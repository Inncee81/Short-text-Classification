why do we own multiple copies of the same book hi i'm a student in my early twenties i was organising my stock of books and realised that i have multiple copies of the same books so i'm wondering what this means is it because our memories deteriorate as we grow older that we tend to grab books that we have already read in other words is forgetfulness the cause of our wanting to re read a book alternatively is it because it is a fundamental characteristic of human beings that they relive previous experiences over and over to various degrees by recognising that one is re living a previous experience would a person be able to discover in that experience a key to her central values simmering under the surface of consciousness or could there be some other reason and if there is an individual who likes reading a particular book repetitively would it be possible for him to live with just one book for the rest of his life i'd love to hear your thoughts hmm i know what you are getting at i haven't ever bought a book twice but i do read the same books over and over again i usually will read one book then a few months later after reading many other books will go back to the book i read months earlier and read it simply because i really liked it or i think i may have missed details that i end up enjoing later on or things i didn't really appreciate when i first read it i also think that re reading books can bring back memories of the time you were reading that book usually happy memories i like to listen to songs from a while ago because they bring back memories but what do i know i'm only twelve and barely have experienced life yet Shaggy dog story Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Human Anthroposophy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Scenes from a Memory Simone Weil Time Out of Mind Goodness and value theory Soul The Amber Spyglass Sant Mat Religious Society of Friends Book of Mormon Abduction Phenomenon Milton H.
