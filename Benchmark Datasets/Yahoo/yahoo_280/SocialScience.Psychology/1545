does this ever happen to anyone first off i know that u are gonna think that i am crazy everytime that i look at the clock it is always at the same digit number example etc please believe me i dont sit and wait for it either just when i wonder what time it is its always on those times everyone tells me i am thinking to much into it but i believe in signs if this is what u would call it u see the reason why i do is because about years ago i had the same thing kind of happen everywhere i would go i would see an ambulance i know they are everywhere buti would see them like times a day while i would sleep i could hear the siren all night it was like this for about weeks straight and happend so much that it was noticeable to me well i started asking my family what it meant and of course i was crazy well the next day i had to call an ambulance for my year old she was having a seizure in the back seat of my car so am i crazy haha lol i just looked at the clock and it's i've noticed that quite a bit with myself as well usually it's either the same digits or it's sequential etc it might just be a subliminal thing kind of like some people that don't need alarm clocks they just wake up at the same time everyday because their body's know what time it is i wouldn't worry or stress too much over it thinking that something bad is going to happen at that time you'll drive yourself nuts thinking about it and no you're not crazy lol Shaggy dog story Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Time Out of Mind Blonde on Blonde Paul Is Dead The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Daylight saving time I Want to Hold Your Hand Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Queen (band) Jon Secada Insomnia Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Ambulance Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Ocean's Twelve The Inside Central processing unit Sleeping Murder Russian joke The Time Machine I Am the Walrus Avenue Q Knots Landing Slow Train Coming Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Phoebe Buffay's songs Hey Jude Aliens of London Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pok__mon Live!
