i am a very lonely girl hello i'm a year old girl and i don't have any friends at all i've been to high schools so far and every time i move i think i can do a better impression of myself but my troubles just apear from start people see me as a weird quiet boring girl i don't want to be viewd that way by others i just want to make at least one good friend that i can share and laugh with i can't help being quiet in class i just don't feel comfortable in a large group of people does anybody have any tips on how i can make a friend hi are you sure people see you as weird quiet and boring what made you say so whether it is true or not stop believing it anyway and start making a good impression of yourself many people are naturally quiet they are called introverts those are people who like spending time alone and prefers to be with a few close friends rather than large groups sad to say their characteristics tend to create misunderstanding by others others believe that their preference to spend time alone mean that they don't need friends at all the next time you go to school check your appearance be aware of how you present yourself including your nonverbal language i believe that there may be people who are interested to make friends with you but because you appear to be aloof they don't approach you at all maybe you're not catching their eye contact or you keep your arms or legs crossed all the time because of that people become afraid of approaching you because you might reject them you know many people are afraid of rejection so don't give people an impression that you're going to reject them however you could also start initiating some friendly moves too try smiling at appropriate times it makes a difference it will be easier for others to approach you talk to people who sits beside you in class or at the bus or wherever you see people around start from simple topics such as the weather or just simple hello and how are you most importantly be kind to yourself believe that you deserve good friends do things you enjoy engage in meaningful activities by establishing your own sets of interests you can easily connect with people having the same interests it's a good conversation topic if you get uncomfortable with large groups don't push yourself too much approach one or couple of people first once you become more comfortable go next to approaching more people hope this helps good luck Social rule Milton H.
