what can you do to vary the tone of make your voice more musical without sounding silly and artificial i dont have a flat monotone voice by any means but sometimes i have been told i sounded emotionally flat when i thought i was talking normally i suppose sometimes you might slip imperceptibly into an emotional rut and not know your there and this cant help but come across in your voice and i suppose if you do exercises with your voice that makes you sound more up and vibrant then that will feed into how you feel mood wise and how people actually perceive you i suggest that you use body language to make your speech more animated and thus appear less monotonic a smile and a quick direct look at someone will always liven up the conversation and hand movements can also provide emphasis to a point without needing to change your tone i think that if you consciously add these aspects to your conversational delivery you will naturally become more animated and more enjoyable to listen to Social rule Tonality Empathy Cognitive science Tone (linguistics) Chinese language Consciousness Singlish English grammar Stuttering Human Speech synthesis Music genre Philosophy of language Phoneme Non-native pronunciations of English Music Psychology Clarinet Happiness Musical mode Mantra Olivier Messiaen Standard Mandarin Asperger syndrome Storytelling Standard Cantonese Dualism (philosophy of mind) Hearing impairment Scientology beliefs and practices Human voice Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Sign language Thai language Greek language Second language acquisition Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gender-neutral language Body language Darth Vader Meaning Aikido Milton H.
