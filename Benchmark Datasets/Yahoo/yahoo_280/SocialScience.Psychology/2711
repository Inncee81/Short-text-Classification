i have very lottle patients and three kids any ideas on how i can control my temper it seems as though my kids know i am having a bad day but continue to fight and nag each other i ask them to stop and behave but they don't and i resort to yelling and spanking because i have talked and talked you have to find some down time for all of you in the midst of chaos i know even professionals like teachers doctors etc will ask someone to watch the kids for a couple of hours so you can get away alone or with a friend for awhile maybe even exchanging babysitting with another mom can help you both otherwise i used to just tell the kids to calm down and watch tv read a book or take a nap for at least an hour without bothering you or each other helps everyone's mood when my kids were especially cranky during an already hectic day we all sat down and told funny stories for a bit or i read them a book and tried to have a good laugh and then pray school will start soon and for god to give you the strength to endure childhood good luck The Catcher in the Rye Social rule Shaggy dog story Vegeta Treehouse of Horror V The Fairly OddParents Doug The Adventures of Pete & Pete Bart chalkboard gags Recess (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga The Ashlee Simpson Show Ron and Fez Ed, Edd n Eddy Sinfest The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Transactional analysis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Springfield Elementary School Nicomachean Ethics Sleeping Murder Le Malade imaginaire Avenue Q The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Kodocha The Amber Spyglass Beavis and Butt-head The dozens Dog training Opie and Anthony Sydney Riot of 1879 Full Metal Panic?
