this is so freaky mostly almost everything i daydream comes true and it sometimes doesn't happen to me it will happen to my family member or someone i know but okay i'll give you an example my sister went babysitting one morning like at and she came back at well while i was at home by myself i don't know why i daydreamed this but anyways i daydreamed that she wasn't doing anything with the kids like she was just sitting there doing nothing and then i gave her advice to play video games with them and that was it not the daydream story so she came back at and i was like so how was babysitting and she was like i felt like i was really bored with them we didn't do anything and then i gave her my advice from my daydreaming and said you should play video games with them and she was like they were playing it and i was like woah weird to myself you know and there was this other story where i would daydream what i say to people and daydream what they would say back and it would always come out true should i keep doing what i'm doing is this a coincidence do any of your daydreams come true and if they do what are they maybe they are exactly like mine and maybe i'm not going crazy lol start day dreaming about krazykasse winning the lotery please Shaggy dog story The Cure Sonic Youth One Tree Hill (TV series) God Emperor of Dune The Magic School Bus The Catcher in the Rye Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avril Lavigne Blonde on Blonde Daydream (album) The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars FoxTrot Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Grandview, U.S.A.
