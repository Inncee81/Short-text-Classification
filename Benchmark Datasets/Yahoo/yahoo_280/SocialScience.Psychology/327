the psychology behind multi tasking can it really be done successfully do the tasks if done frequently enough together be treated as one how much so could you explain precognitive planning personal accounts are also welcome nice question but it seems that some people didn't get it taking driving as an example it is obvious that as a beginner you need a huge amount of attention but as an experienced driver you can have a deep conversation while driving without even remembering the past ten minutes of driving while having that conversation this shows that you can start doing tasks simultaneously as soon as they don't require your attention anymore according to neuroscience things are conscious when you point your attention to them and consciousness actually has a very limited processing power i e you can only focus on one or two things at a time because your brain is busy controlling every single move you make beginners are likely to make mistakes being ready to react upon unforeseen changes and correct the specific movement to re achieve the desired goal staying on the road your unconscious instead can process much more information at a time so if you internalize certain tasks and learn them well enough your consciousness will have enough capacity left to concentrate on other things for example reacting upon problems that occur while your unconscious mind is doing five other things unfortunately i have no idea what precognitive planning is Artificial consciousness Psychology Second language acquisition Cognitive science Psychoanalysis Hypnosis Milton H.
