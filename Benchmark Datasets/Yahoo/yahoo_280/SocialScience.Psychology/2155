desire to hurt your pet lets say you have a dog or a pet animal and you like it at times and other times you dont at times you feel like you want to just torture it you cant stand to look at it because its so weak compared to you you were abused yourself and feel a sense of relief when you see the animal scared of you you dont hurt it but you do mean things to it whats wrong with me i was abused and felt helpless and then i see it sitting there and i get the feeling to taunt it or be mean to it what i get off on is poking it and annoying it the more angry it gets the more i like it i'd also like to add i feel guilty after i do it overwhelming guilt takes place i get like this during depressive episodes i've never seriously hurt any of my pets thank god but it still scares the crap out of me that i've wanted to it comes down to helplessness whether because of depression or abuse you just need to feel like there's at least one thing in your life you can control need to know that there's something more helpless than you there's so much anger too but you know that you can't direct the anger where it should go either because it's too dangerous or simply not possible pets unfortunately receive a lot of that anger again because they're helpless they can't call the police on you can't pull a gun out of their bag and chase you off the perfect scapegoat but it doesn't mean you're evil or psychotic you have problems certainly and they need to be addressed these urges are perfectly natural in response to abuse but that doesn't mean they're healthy you should consider therapy or anger management good luck to you EastEnders Pitaten Anger management Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Clinical depression Alcoholics Anonymous Cult Theory of conduct Columbine High School massacre Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Narcissism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Characters in the Smurfs Hulk (comics) Jam (TV series) Domestic violence Alignment (role-playing games) Spanking Daredevil Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Blood (computer game) The Inside Goodness and value theory Dead Like Me Serial killer YuYu Hakusho Late Night with Conan O'Brien The Fairly OddParents Ranma __ characters Shaggy dog story Borderline personality disorder Friends Sin Evil Tenshinhan Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Piccolo Junior Saga Dog training Bipolar disorder Punk ideology Richard Rahl Crime film Revolutionary Girl Utena Social rule Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Kim Possible Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Great Depression One Piece minor characters Slayers Drug abuse Cat Shit Avenue Q Maison Ikkoku Nicomachean Ethics Rape Characters of Naruto Skin of Evil (TNG episode) Milton H.
