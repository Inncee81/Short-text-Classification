why do we so easily remember things we'd rather forget but forget things we'd often hope to remember have you ever noticed that it's been the bane of both my father's and my existence almost since birth a related phenomenon is the simple observation that for many of us we can more vividly recall certain memories from our childhood than we can recall memories from even just the previous day now what's up with that the things we want to forget are usually traumatic or unpleasant but those vivid events seem to stick in our minds the good memories we tend to file away in our subconscious they're there ready to recall when we wish them but they haven't made as big an imprint on our minds because we don't associate them with trauma you would think it would be the other way around but strangely that's how it works regarding your other question i think it has to do with normal aging patterns we remember our childhood because our minds are so uncluttered at that time that memories have a lot of room to store as we get older there is less room for remembering even simple things when we're young the whole world is interesting and exciting as we age the once colorful things become more ho hum i've often thought of the brain like a computer the more memory you put into it the more often it crashes think about it great question Hypnosis False memory Unconscious mind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Amnesia Lucid dreaming Dream Infantilism Cognitive science Mnemonic Philosophical skepticism Milton H.
