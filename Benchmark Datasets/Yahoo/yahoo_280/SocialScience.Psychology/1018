asking for what you want makes you less nice i just read an article discussing how people women moreso are viewed as less nice when they ask for what the want in this particular article it was dealing with salary i thought that it was interesting that in knowing what you want and asking for it you are considered less nice i have been called mean before and i don't understand why i don't intend any harm on people and most of the times i am called mean i'm just protecting my own rights i guess my questions is it a bad thing to ask for what you want i would make sure that you are asking whatever you are wanting nicely and politely i don't see why people would think of you as mean unless you were taking advantage of them by asking them for things that you want all of the time there are limits that you should take when asking for things because people will see you as being selfish and greedy if you ask them for things that you want to much it also depends on what you're asking for such as if you're asking for something really expensive then they will take it that you are selfish the same goes with always asking for money your best bet is to just try to do things for yourself and be independent and not depend on other people to do stuff for you Theory of conduct Prisoner's dilemma Gross domestic product CPU cache Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Bernard Williams Sharon Tate Abortion debate Scientology beliefs and practices John Howard Yoder Objectivist philosophy Goodness and value theory The nature of God in Western theology Simone Weil Evil Coercion Ethics Numerology Betting (poker) Civil rights Craps Consensual crime Socrates Extreme Programming Insurance Social rule Confucius Epistemology Consensus decision-making Alignment (role-playing games) Nicomachean Ethics School of Salamanca State Seinfeld Current teachings of Prem Rawat Altruism Cultural Revolution Rich Mullins Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) W.
