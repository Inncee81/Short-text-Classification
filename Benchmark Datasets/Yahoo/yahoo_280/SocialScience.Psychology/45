hamlet sane or insane this was my english exam many years ago this question is as difficult to get your head around as it is essential to understanding much of the play so forgive the long answer but it is the only way to give a full answer perhaps the most important question to ask anyone who forwards the theory that hamlet was not truly mad is why would he pretend to be mad there does not seem to be a satisfactory answer to this question indeed the acts that he commits while mad only worsen his situation and make it easier for claudius to try and dispose of him for example deporting him england after hamlet s murder of polonius frequently those who believe in the sham madness idea will sight lines such as i am mad but north north west this has its meaning in an edwardian belief that the mad were influenced by the wind at best this is an admittance of inconsistency not that he was being false the other line that is supposed to support this theory is there is method in my madness again this is does not prove that his madness is false only that there is a kind of method and logic in it distinguishing it from ophelia s perhaps moreover most of hamlet s objections are to do with insincerity for example claudius s posturing as an honourable king or his mother s lack of feeling for hamlet s dead father most notably that one may smile and smile and be a villain given that hamlet is so opposed to insincerity why on earth would he become insincere and pretend to be insane really any idea of his faking is own madness finds itself lacking when on examines the text itself if one can agree that hamlet s flaw was that he thought too heavily on matters as is indicated by his speech in which he christians man a quintessence of dust or his frequent and regular return to musing over the nature of existence and death then understanding his madness is made a little easier he can only act on what he thinks but what he thinks becomes increasingly abstract and is heavily influenced by how he is feeling this leads to a very dynamic thought process and attitude to killing making all but procrastination impossible in short he could not agree with himself on any one course of action long enough to do anything it is more understandable how someone isolated as he was and trapped in his own abstract thoughts as he was grieving heavily over the death of his father might slip gradually into a kind of madness than it is that he would make the whole thing up try http www shakespearehomework com page for further help Hamlet Socrates Deconstruction Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Philosophy of language Epistemology Theodicy Logic Philosophy The nature of God in Western theology Michel Foucault Falsifiability Science Bertrand Russell Laertes (character) Franz Boas Scientology beliefs and practices Creation-evolution controversy Young Earth creationism Supernatural Philosophy of mathematics Meaning of life The Origin of Species Drama Causality Intelligent design Neuro-linguistic programming Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Ten Commandments Justification (theology) Pseudoscience Autism Ethics Atheism Confucianism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Ghost Soul Determinism Second language acquisition Kuzari Evil Historical materialism Leviathan (book) Reincarnation Western philosophy Summa Theologiae Buddhism Species The Brothers Karamazov John Wycliffe Claude L__vi-Strauss Meme Origin belief Merit A Course In Miracles Resurrection of Jesus Homeopathy Creationism Transcendental argument for the existence of God Social psychology Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Mathematics Psychoanalysis Serial killer Existence Ontological argument Cultural relativism The Lion King God Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead Conspiracy theory Human Law of value Donald Davidson (philosopher) Abortion debate Flood geology Victor Cousin Michel Henry John Titor Book of Revelation Coercion Schizophrenia Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi Philosophical skepticism Internet troll Intelligent design movement Narcissism
