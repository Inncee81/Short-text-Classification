is this agression if a person is always making comments about others yet they know you're in the same situation and calling the other person they are describing derogatory names and laughing to your face and staring at you comments you cant defend yourself on because they arent directly coming out and saying your name but the situation they are describing is just like yours so youre defenseless to any attack and they can continue do they not know what they are doing how could they possibly not know is this some kind of subtle underlying agression a way to get away with making fun of you to your face yes it is mildly if you feel offended by the comments and don't want to openly defend yourself too then get the aggressor alone and ask them to tone it down on the flip side derogatory comments only come from shallow people that are generally rude to begin with unprovoked rudeness is a horrible thing you never mentioned whether the aggressor was a friend or not i'll assume no if they're looking directly at you while insinuating the derogatory remarks they're hoping that someone will connect the dots and take it one step or several steps further this is another form of cowardice be strong try not to get hurt and be the best you that you can be Social rule Slander and libel Professional wrestling throws Glossary of partner dance terms Aikido G-Man (Half-Life) Poker jargon Slashdot subculture Ice hockey Homophobia Evil Political correctness Continuation War Undergrads Ron and Fez Friends Craps The Adventures of Pete & Pete Eye contact Irony Nicomachean Ethics Theodicy Sinfest Aerial (dance move) Gay God Emperor of Dune Professional wrestling holds Lauren Bacall Skateboarding trick Tai shogi Joke Infantilism Late Night with Conan O'Brien Theory of conduct Human sexual behavior Australian words Ranma __ characters Sexual orientation Milton H.
