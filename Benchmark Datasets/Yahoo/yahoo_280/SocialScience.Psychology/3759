why are men so agressive immature and more difficult than women here's a good example i went to a salon got a great hair job sleak blonde and i just looked really good so i went out there and noticed a few things different than the days when i didn't look good men reacted more than women women generally smiled were polite or just kind of looked like yeah he's cute when they passed by me one girl stopped me and went can i touch your hair lol i thought it was funny not being stuck up i just happened to actually really impressive that day women were more helpful at stores and were just pleasant now to the men where things get ugly i got a few eye rolls and sneers from them the ones working at retail stores like banana would look frustrated and pissed when they had to help me got called a f g two three times out of a window of a car two looked downright violent like they wanted to kill me also on the positives one guy came up to me started to talk to me asked me about my car name and hit on me from my analysis women girls tend to be very friendly and open towards another person who may be attractive towards them men seem to feel threatened and need to go on power struggles if they're gay or attracted to you that's a different story but they seem to agressively pursue you rather than shy away like girls why are men like this nature or they're just screwed up lol i'm just very annoyed and starting to really hate other guys i prefer guys as friends but they're starting to irritate me lol it just depends on the person the guys reacted like that because they were jealous not all guys though if you would have been a woman the same thing would have happened but the women would have been saying slu or something like that it just depends on the person Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Pitaten W.I.T.C.H.
