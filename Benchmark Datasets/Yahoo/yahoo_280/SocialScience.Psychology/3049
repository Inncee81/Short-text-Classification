should i tell the father of the baby so i found out im pregnant and im i havent told anyone yet i was wondering if i should tell the father of the baby i know i should but i already know what is going to happen nothing he is moving out of state for college and im going back to nyc for school i know he wont be involved he is a jerk we havent even seen eachother in about two weeks so were not even talking i plan on prob doing adoption abortion is not an option and i dont know how i could keep the baby and he would never find out i will be in nyc for a year so what do u think should i tell him also he is def the father i have only been with him no one else ever so yes def the father no doubt sorry i put this in this section i just want many opinions thankyou you really should not because you want to be one happy family but because you want to put up the child for adoption you will need him to sign away his rights as a parent as well otherwise it could cause problems for the adoptive family if he found out and decided years from now he wants the child back don't say he will never find out because this type of secret is the kind that will come out eventually also as the dad he has the right to know how would you feel if years from now some kid came up to you and said that you were his biological parent what if you decide to keep the child then he needs to pay child support no matter if he wants to see the child or not you might want to consult a lawyer to figure out exactly what you want to do Friends Abortion debate Knots Landing EastEnders Adoption Fathers' rights Abortion in the United States Divorce Fathers' rights movement in the UK Everwood About a Boy Kodocha Futurama (TV series - season 5) Neighbours Prenatal diagnosis Laura Schlessinger Pitaten Kyle Broflovski Father Abortion History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Cyprus dispute Sex-selective abortion and infanticide Pro-choice Sant Thakar Singh The Jeffersons (South Park) The Emancipation of Mimi Child support Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Past characters (Neighbours) Prostate cancer Family Charmbracelet Atomic Kitten Karl Rove Infantilism Grandview, U.S.A.
