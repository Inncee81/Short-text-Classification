is there really a life after death thoughts well there seems to be a lot of evidence to support the idea that there is for one thing many have come back from near death experiences with startling claims of visiting the 'other side' i had a close friend quite lucid come back from clinical death on the operating table and his story was a textbook case just like we've seen on documentaries i asked him this question 'did your experience have any element of time like what happened first and a type of progression to it ' he looked at me rather startled and replied 'no it wasn't like that at all its as if it happened all at once you're the first person to ask that question but no there was no time element involved ' this man was over eighty years old when it happend and was quite sincere he lived about another five years after that and like others professed no fear of death or dying after whatever he went through he ascertained that it was the most profound experience of his whole life definatley made a believer out of me i figure if the experience had no time element it must have happened in a type of 'eternal realm' of some sort hope this helps Out-of-body experience Scenes from a Memory Reincarnation The nature of God in Western theology Meaning of life Ex-gay Phaedo A Course In Miracles Theory of conduct Hypnosis Sigmund Freud Religion Socrates Free will Soul Immortality Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Supernatural Milton H.
