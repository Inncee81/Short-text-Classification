how do you override regret i'm years old turning in months i've started learning my th and th languages german and japanese a month ago after a wave of obsession in developing my knowledge and skills ran through me and although am doing great i keep having this awful feeling of regret for not starting even earlier for example i sometimes think why didn't i sign up for private piano lessons a year ago my old instructor moved away and it was no longer possible for me to resume and why didn't i start my language learning even earlier it's making me feel like crap and although am still at a good age for this those feelings keep haunting me as i always wanted to differ and not settle for a normal life honestly you should not let those regrets bother you you are learning way more than most people your age and many even older you are just now at an age where you are capable of making up your mind what you want to learn about and where you are going with your life any earlier and you likely would not have had any interest and would therefore have wasted your time and not learned nearly as much as what you are getting out of your lessons now not to mention trying to learn too much all at one time may well have sabotaged you if you had tried taking everything on earlier than what you have good luck and keep going you are on the right track Sergei Prokofiev Phoebe Halliwell Asperger syndrome Kender PLATO Gliding Milton H.
