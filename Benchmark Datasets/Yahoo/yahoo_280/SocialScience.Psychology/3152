if you could have a virtual experience identical to the real deal in every tangible way would it suffice elaboration this question follows along with the what is real line of questioning suppose you had a lifelong desire to touch the sphinx for instance if you could visit a virtual sphinx and the experience were as exactly as vivid as it would be if you were actually there would that be enough or would you still want to touch the real deal insert any experience you may actually desire into your answer if you could have identical experiences either in the real world or in a virtual copy of the real world would your knowledge that it's not real make you continue to seek it out in the real world if it depends on what the subject matter is are there things you'd settle for experiencing entirely in vr and only in vr versus things that you would only feel fulfilled in experiencing for real please be as detailed and elaborative as you wish i'm very interested in your answers to this question just to clarify yes i know we don't have anything approaching matrix like vr but for the purpose of this question i'm asking you to pretend that we do that the vr experience is the same as far as your senses are concerned and that would be all senses or more if you're aware of any and the only difference would be in what you know about the experienced reality the experience itself would be exactly the same impossible to answer since i never had a virtual experience like the one you describe however i think for me the idea of wanting to do the real deal would still be in my mind simply because i'd want to check if the virtual thing was indeed as good as the real thing Philosophy of language Supernatural The nature of God in Western theology A Course In Miracles Scientology beliefs and practices Science Cyberspace Philosophical skepticism Out-of-body experience Friedrich Schleiermacher CPU cache Theory of conduct Religion Property (ownership right) Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Reality Determinism Philosophy of mathematics Idealism Identity and change Rudolf Hermann Lotze Free will Critique of Pure Reason Goodness and value theory Victor Cousin Scientific method Internet troll Deconstruction Ethics Abduction Phenomenon __tienne Bonnot de Condillac Jiddu Krishnamurti Objectivist philosophy Current teachings of Prem Rawat Atomism Quantum mechanics John Wycliffe Donald Davidson (philosopher) Expert system Manifold Human Metaphysics Artificial consciousness Mathematics Philosophy of space and time Ontological argument Maimonides Biblical inerrancy Simulated reality Numerology Qualia Immanuel Kant Socrates Arthur Cayley Problem of universals Cultural relativism Many-worlds interpretation Theodicy Karen Horney Rudolf Steiner Transactional analysis Slavoj __i__ek Anthroposophy Consciousness Western philosophy Logic Coercion David Hume Alexander Technique Sant Mat Johann Friedrich Herbart Psychology Franz Boas Intelligent design Situationist Social psychology Causality Marshall McLuhan Copyleft Fundamentalism Max Stirner Lebesgue integration Human sexual behavior Species Psychology of religion Buddhist philosophy Traumatic incident reduction Past teachings of Prem Rawat Atheism God
