am i being too hard on myself i love to write and i do a lot of it others often tell me that i write very very well and most of the time i would humbly agree with them lately however i find i myself making more and more mistakes such as i make a lot of typos and punctuation errors or skip entire words it is starting to chip away at my own confidence in my skills and talents no one else says anything about my mistakes but i notice them myself and it really pains me to see these errors happening i am not sure what the cause for the increase in errors is it could be many things which there are too many of to speculate on lately my best hasn't been good enough for me i feel like the person making all these mistakes is not who i really am nor who i used to be i know i used to perform so much better significantly better than i am now am i being too critical of myself should i just try to accept my mistakes and do the best i can should i try to find fix the cause of all the errors it does seem that you're being a little too critical remember that being a good writer is having the ideas and the right words making a punctuation or spelling error probably has more to do with your desire to get everything out your ideas are coming so fast that your writing can't keep up with it plus once you made a mistake or two and it bothered you you probably started thinking more about the mistakes and less about what you want to say there will always be spell check and proofreaders so focus on what you do best which is being creative and sharing your ideas Debugging A Course In Miracles Evil Computer virus Extreme Programming Socrates House of Leaves Punctuation (chess) Newbie Time Out of Mind Objectivist philosophy Milton H.
