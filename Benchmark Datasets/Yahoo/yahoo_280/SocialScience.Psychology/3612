why is there so much illogical thinking on y a people make these broad generalizations about the population as a whole that we're all bisexual but can't back it up with supportive hard facts even if they refer to outdated sexual orientation studies i wonder if they realize that those experiments only studied a segment of society and a sample of the population can't possibly explain the behavioral nature of the rest of the world impossible while the stats may not be wrong the interpretation is especially when saying all people are a certain way just because some people are it's absolutely ridiculous what is everyone's thoughts although i've done no true research on the topic i have heard of studies that concluded that some people regardless of their sex tend to be more masculine or more feminine in other words some males may naturally tend to have female traits and some females may have masculine traits i remember reading that situations like these occur even among those who are considered to be well adjusted the fact of the matter is that the majority of the population consists of those people who have almost equal numbers of masculine and feminine traits in other words even though a person may be female she may have as many male traits as female traits i agree with you entirely some people look at this information and inaccurately interpret what is being said the information out there does not show that the majority of the population is bisexual however the information out there does show that the majority of the population includes people who have both male and female traits and does not mention of sexual preference these are my thoughts about why some people may be confused on the topic miche Sexual orientation Biology and sexual orientation Gender role Bisexuality Gender Homosexuality and Christianity Infantilism Homophobia Cross-dressing Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Sexual differentiation Transgender Demographics of sexual orientation Reparative therapy Feminism Homosexuality Bulgarian language Heteronormativity Theodicy Pedophilia Gender-neutral language Human sexual behavior Asperger syndrome Homosexuality and transgender Intersexuality Religion and sexual orientation Zoophilia God and gender Sex education Sexual selection Ethics Goodness and value theory Man Heterosexuality Asexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Species Luminiferous aether Gay Theory of conduct Philosophy of language God A Course In Miracles Natural selection Esperanto as an international language Non-human animal sexuality Stuttering Alfred Kinsey Rudolf Hermann Lotze Dyslexia Carl Jung Lesbian Myers-Briggs Type Indicator English grammar David Hume Atheism History of intersex surgery Quebec French Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Supernatural Logic Philosophy of science Sexual attraction Hermaphrodite Socrates Abortion debate Meme Homosexuality in China Religion Scientific method Controversies in autism LGBT Orgasm The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Economic inequality Hentai Catalan grammar Mathematics Science Randomness Modern geocentrism Democracy Cognitive science German grammar Social psychology Sociobiology God the Father
