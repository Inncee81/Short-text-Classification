kill joys and nay sayers what's up with these people i get bothered when i try to improve myself but other people will say i can't see you doing that or oh that will be too hard why do some people need to kill a dream you have why do some people need to criticize your ambitions hopes it really bugs me that some people don't believe in me how should one handle such nay sayers and kill joys in a manuscript on destructive behavioral syndromes i am working on i call it the waldo syndrome after a character in a classic mystery novel whose name is waldo waldo attempts to kill a girl that he loves because she announces her intention to marry someone else it is a murder mystery because he messes up and killls the wrong woman by mistake the waldo syndrome is the compulsion to destroy that which one wants but feels he she can't have the author feeds us the main clue when describing an incident where waldo is in an antique store and sees a vase he wants when the storekeeper tells him it is already sold and therefore not available it somehow gets accidentally knocked off the table and broken however it is my observation that abstract values are far more frequent targets of this nasty syndrome than physical material objects values like freedom success and the ability to enjoy life are the most common casualties of this ugly psycho emotional perversion those who are personally repressed in their own minds attack the freedoms of others many of the followers and proponents of severely harsh and restrictive religious doctrines like the taliban of afghanistan for instance are motivated by this particular manifestation of sub conscious psycho emotional jealousy success is the one that your detractors are directly attacking the waldo syndrome the if i can't have it i'll destroy it so no one else can either mentality is one of the most dangerous and intrinsically evil of all the perversions lurking within the shadows and dark corners of the human mind the best defense against it is awareness be mindful of its existence and recognize it for what it is when you come up against it Sigmund Freud Human Evil Alignment (role-playing games) Obsessive-compulsive disorder Carl Jung Mind control Autism Karen Horney Serial killer Polyamory Narcissism Hypoglycemia Unconscious mind Happiness Theory of conduct Objectivist philosophy Free will Scientology beliefs and practices T'Pol A Course In Miracles The Amber Spyglass Goodness and value theory Consciousness God Emperor of Dune Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Simone Weil Trimurti Social rule Empathy Heretics of Dune Theodicy Force powers Traumatic incident reduction Friedrich Nietzsche Psychology Zoophilia Psychoanalysis Soul Ethics Artificial consciousness Fundamentalism Sin City Reparative therapy Psycho Opus Dei S__ren Kierkegaard Alexander Technique Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants 2003 Invasion of Iraq Ralph Waldo Emerson Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Friends Force (Star Wars) Opposition to cults and new religious movements Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dorothy L.
