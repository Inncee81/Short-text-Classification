what was your darkest day and what who helped you through it mine was the day years ago that i realized my parents couldn't make everything better for me i had to make my own decisions it was a dark day but also a bright one i discoved on that day a strength i never knew i had thanks for answering the question my darkest day was that when i discovered that people had a great maw of a capacity for being or succumbing to mean spiritedness at one time in the not so long past i lived under the fantasy illusion that all people would lack the cowardliness to allow them to become so petty now that i know it without a doubt i defend those who have not yet realized it and ignore with a certain pity going to them that they will attract none of my attention all in all it has turned out an invaluable lesson it has honed and helped me maintain my own self valued integrity great great question miss i hope it has struck home with edification any others who'll allow themselves as it has struck me and yes congratulations for upon your darkest day having survived it through understanding realization and then going on with your life withe your strength increased bravo grecia Kain (Legacy of Kain) Incarnations of Immortality Protoss Solar Element Saga Force (Star Wars) Irony Franz Boas Jon Secada Rent (musical) God Emperor of Dune Darth Revan Battle of Britain Nicomachean Ethics Races in the Warcraft universe Alignment (role-playing games) Quest for Glory A Course In Miracles Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Martial art Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back Battle of the Somme (1916) Great Jedi Purge Galveston Hurricane of 1900 Jumpstart 3rd Grade Babe Ruth One Tree Hill (TV series) Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Force powers Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Richard Feynman Kasparov versus The World Shadow the Hedgehog Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Toad Patrol Autism Bionicle Live 8 Notable lines in the Star Wars series Francis Crick Ramakrishna Justification (theology) Sin City Free will K' Han Solo Cultural relativism Nightmare (Soul Calibur) Infantilism Charmed New York Giants Philip J.
