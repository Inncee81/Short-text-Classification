what is wrong with me i don't understand when i turned i just had this huge urge to read and learn now that i'm i can't even make my self pick up a book i'm hoping someone in psychology can explain what my mind is doing being a retired mental health professional with years experience i can say that in diagnosing your situation i'd first of all want to rule out any drug or alcohol problem then i'd want to know your general medical situation assuming that those two areas are okay i'd want to determine exactly what kind of reading and learning you're doing is it a structured process such as school or your own random reading for pleasure or whatever i'd also do a personal and family background review and a current status on your household situation such as are you married have any kids and what psychosocial stressors you may have such as low income or deaths in the family or close friends and i'd want to look at your educational achievements in your history and if i found no problems in all of those i'd be wondering if you aren't just pushing yourself too hard and your mind and body are demanding that you slow down or it threatens to collapse from stress but that's just the beginning of my assessment tools for the scant information you have given so i'd recommend you go see a professional who can spend some more time with you so they can do a more thorough evaluation of your situation god bless you Clinical depression Social psychology Psychology Schizophrenia Addiction Post-traumatic stress disorder Medicine Prostate cancer Stress (medicine) Psychosis Autism Scientology beliefs and practices Bipolar disorder Psychiatry Expert system Psychotherapy Transsexuality Neurofeedback Urinary incontinence Cancer Strategic management Ethics Meditation A Course In Miracles Abortion Alcoholics Anonymous Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Procrastination Education Theory of conduct Sleep Sigmund Freud Neuro-linguistic programming Randomness Tai Chi Chuan Drug abuse Dissociative identity disorder Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Infantilism Reparative therapy Hypertension Adult attention-deficit disorder Homeopathy Alexander Technique Goodness and value theory Ex-gay Dyslexia Transactional analysis Unemployment Nurse Milton H.
