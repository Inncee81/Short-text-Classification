i hate being afraid of rollercoasters ive been on a few roller coasters in my life and other rides too like the tornado the swings all kinds of thing mostly when i was little everytime i went on any ride i hated it so i havent really been on anything since then and now im ive still been terrified and i couldnt remember why i was so just recently my friends convinced me to go on the fribeee this was my first time on it i went on it and i remembered the feelings i get and why ihate it it really upsets me because if i could have one wish right now it would be to love rollercoasters people look like they have so much fun and i want to be apart of that fun when i go on them i get those butterflys but i love butterfly feelings dont get me wrong but i get them so much that i cant take it and then my legs start to shake uncontrollably and i feel stiff and mostly i just feel like i completely lost control of myself usually when im on i wish i could stop the ride ive even tried screaming but nothing help all my friends tell me also that the things i get fear from on the rollercoasters like all those weird feelings is what everyone else enjoys the most i dont understand it how come i cant enjoy it trust me ive tried facing my fears and i always come off crying and feel of vomit and shaking i have a love hate relationship with rollercoasters i love them for obvious reasons but i hate them because they're made by people who are not perfect which means i could go sailing off into the sunset due to a small human mistake but they still make me scream and laugh Roller coaster Thorpe Park RollerCoaster Tycoon Shaggy dog story Alton Towers Milton H.
