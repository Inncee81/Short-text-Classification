why do ppl bully others especially those 'weaker' or more introverted kids like spreading rumours about the kids leaving the quiet kids out of everything isolating them ignoring them it's not fair to them but yet many ppl like me who are introverted get made to feel inferior tho we are in no ways inferior to the 'bullies' ps i dont mean physical bullying ie beating the crap outta them besides being the quietest kid in class im also the one with the lowest self esteem lol it's like when they suddenly look at me or talk to me i lose my cool and go stuttering all over the place ppl hv said i sound 'scared' how to remedy i believe bullying is a way to assert control when a person lacks control in other areas they use their power over other people to show that they can control this situation and therefore have some control in their life where control is lacking in other aspects in respect to your issues with introversion well take your time and go slow pick someone you can relate to and learn to communicate as you become more comfortable you can learn to become more social and in time this may pass you can work on it Asperger syndrome Carl Jung Stuttering Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Narcissism Nerd Social rule Hikikomori Poker jargon Self-esteem Homeschooling Craps Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Autism Newbie Second language acquisition Anger management Shyness Transactional analysis Hollyoaks Modernism Appeal Crime prevention through environmental design Dyslexia Aikido Boston Public Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Spanking Silent Night, Deadly Night Scum (film) In Cold Blood Personality psychology Punk ideology Singlish The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Franz Boas Aggression Surplus product Malcolm in the Middle Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Cyber bullying Spanish dialects and varieties Pitaten Dog training Autism rights movement Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social justice Grief Hearing impairment Anti-intellectualism Social psychology The Fairly OddParents Doug The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Alexander Technique Democratic Kampuchea Gambling The Marshall Mathers LP Big Brother (USA TV series) About a Boy Kodocha T-V distinction Butters Stotch Rush Limbaugh Vegeta Vietnam War Saved by the Bell Lightsaber combat Grade (education) Education in the United States Hip hop culture Fair use The Adventures of Pete & Pete Tank Analytical psychology Court system of Canada Aerial (dance move) Drama Final Fantasy magic Black (people) Child abuse Static (superhero) Kali Yuga The Smoking Room BDSM Education Religion Urinary incontinence N.W.A Chess opening Homophobia Music Meme Scientology beliefs and practices Guild Force (Star Wars) Korean language Azumanga Daioh
