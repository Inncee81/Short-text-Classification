is this gay or just a fad i have this friend who is years old that paints his toenails hot pink and is considering painting his fingernails the same color he lives with his girlfriend of months he told me he had experimental sex with or guys about years ago but didn t know he was straight until he had sex with this girl he says he loves the male physique but not sexually so he claims he is straight and that he is comfortable enough in his sexuality that he does not care what people think about his pink toenails and soon to be hot pink fingernails i am a gay man and i have never heard of a straight guy doing this i have also asked many women and men who are very well informed in fashion gay or straight and they told me that straight guys don t do this i never judge anyone or stereotype people in anyway to each there own is my motto however my question is this do straight guys paint their toenails and fingernails bright pink for the whole world to see is he in the closet or is this just a new fad for straight guys well i've seen metal guys paint their fingernails black even seen black metal toenails or one painted fingernail my italian hairdresser used to do this although he was rather strange but definitely not gay as a straight guy the only time i paint my fingernails is when i'm getting done up for fancy dress which is like allowed straight guys like to dress up as ridiculous women with beards etc it's just something we do however your friend sounds more sophisticated than this and i think it's attention seeking behaviour from a guy who refuses to be stuck in a box and is pushing his own boundaries in years to come he'll no doubt turn into a straight drag queen at which point you can wonder what all the nail fuss was really about Gender role Gay slang Transsexuality Ex-gay Human sexual behavior Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Sexual orientation Kyle Broflovski Manicure Little Britain Anal sex Bisexuality Homophobia Recurring South Park characters Effeminacy Joke The Inside Avenue Q Gay Blood on the Tracks Sex and the City Friends Coming out Cross-dressing Sexual attraction The Time Machine Quentin Crisp Social rule Humphrey Bogart Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Married... with Children Same-sex marriage Transgender The Smoking Room Vernon Schillinger BDSM Lesbian One Tree Hill (TV series) Homosexuality in Japan Biology and sexual orientation Homosexuality Anne Boleyn Drag queen Condom Queer Eye for the Straight Guy Something Positive Domestic violence Herbert Garrison Heterosexuality Phoebe Buffay's songs Cruising (film) Queer American Psycho Homer Simpson Transvestism Milton H.
