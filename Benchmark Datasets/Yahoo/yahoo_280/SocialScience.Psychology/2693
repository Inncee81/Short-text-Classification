but he wont stop begging for love how should i stop him i had met him before then it was a long distance serious relationship looked like it would end with a marriage then i dumped him because some of his habbits were absolutly unacceptable to me i told him about my concern from the beggining and he said he would change but he lieyed and stayed the same anyway so now it is six months later and still i get at least one e mail from him everyday he says he is sorry and sends loves and all that but i know he will stay the person that he is that is not a problem for me because i loved him and i still do and i rather not see my love with bad habbits thus i rather not marry him oh and i have not replied a single e mail of him in the past six months but he wont stop begging how should i stop him i would love your openion on this you will never stop him until you stop sending him signals that you are still interested you state in your question that you still love him yet you want to get rid of him until you make up your mind you will have no peace of mind this whole thing is totally unfair to him and to some degree you i have a feeling you enjoy the attention even though you may not want the relationship either end it completely or accept that he is going to continue trying to win you back T'Pol Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Halliwell Jiddu Krishnamurti Friends EastEnders Sharon Tate Sexual orientation A Course In Miracles Infantilism The writing of Principia Mathematica Past teachings of Prem Rawat Avenue Q Mary Jane Watson Miss Saigon Rent (musical) Jennifer Lopez Milton H.
