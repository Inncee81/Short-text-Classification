do people who try to make you feel sorry for them annoy you why or why not we can only assume that they're doing it on purpose but what is it exactly that make us annoyed about them is it their feeble attempt or are we just impatient because we rather have a clear straight forward answer other than charades possibly we associate the action with being manipulated they certainly could if i let them but that's the only way even though it's a tough choice for me to not be too bothered it is still my choice i know what manipulation is used to be very good at it did i realize i was manipulating well maybe at first a little but usually someone who acts this way will continue the behavior long enough that it becomes part of their lifestyle guess i've been there on the bad side one thing i always say to myself is this no matter what he she is doing or saying that i might see as annoying or wrong or if i am unable to find sense in his her actions there is always always so much more behind the actions of that person which cause them to behave in such a way to condone or participate in or be manipulated by these things these people is not what i am meaning by this but rather to understand that there's a high possibility that they are dealing with things that i am not aware of just as all of us are it doesn't make it right but it doesn't mean i have to fix it either all situations are different of course family v friends v strangers with me usually these would all be approached differently the important thing is that anything external circumstances other people these things can definitely be annoying or even more at times but i don't particularly like feeling that way so i try my best to keep it simple and above all to remember that i make the choice not them does this make sense Theory of conduct Nicomachean Ethics Goodness and value theory Theodicy Social rule Poker jargon Coercion Ethics Contract Microeconomics Sexual orientation Incarnations of Immortality Scientology beliefs and practices Consensus decision-making Supply and demand Evil God Emperor of Dune Utilitarianism Free will Cyberspace Karen Horney Coming of Age (TNG episode) The nature of God in Western theology Milton H.
