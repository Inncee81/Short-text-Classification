adoptive friend abused w out a home advice appreciated i went to a week summer camp and became amazing friends w this yr old latino i'm he really opened up to me about how he is adopted at age living with his biological sister and other adoptive siblings i got home yesterday he called me and told me he was kicked out of the house again nd time and he is staying w his grandmother he is a wonderful person gpa of involved in student government sports you name it and he has already gotten scholarships from colleges he got kicked out because his mother is crazy literally she has kept him just to make money since he is a ward of the state so now that he is almost she doesn't need him anymore and is gradually treating him more and more like dirt calling him racial slang terms slapping him grabbing him in inappropriate places because i guess slapping him didn't do it he is not sexually abused just physically at times he doesn't want to keep living with his grandmother or go back continued to his house he asked his friends to live there but their parents can't take him my father talked to him telling him to call the cops or social services but they will make him go back to his house and he wants nothing to do w his parents now he actually suggested and really wants to move to my town which is hrs away in another state but he has so much set up for him educationally that it wouldn't make sense if he moved here and it would cause more problems for both of us i am going to call social services anonymously to ask for advice about him but i don't know what else to do he says he can live in a homeless shelter but he isn't homeless since he's still a minor i am lost for more ideas about what to do please help with any advice it would be greatly appreciated well in the first place you have to realize you aren't in any position to be the one to help him and if he is everything you believe he is he still is going to need to get some help where he is he wants to move by you because he feels your sympathy and caring but that isn't the answer he does need to go to social services because there are homes they can put him in to help him get self reliant while he gets into a job etc he needs to think what to do so he can move on maybe just temporarily with his grandmother at least it does give him a place to live but if he has to move out the social services can help him some foster homes even will help while he gets ready to be on his own you have to keep a level head and realize you've only heard one side of the story it may all be true but you still can suggest things to do a priest a pastor etc would also help him Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Theory of conduct Friends Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Pitaten Fancy Crane 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Catcher in the Rye Piccolo Junior Saga Ex-gay Boston Public Little Britain God Emperor of Dune The O.C.
