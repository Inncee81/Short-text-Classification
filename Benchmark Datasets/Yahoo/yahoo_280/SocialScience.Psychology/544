strangest problem i've ever had i was wondering if anyone had any input occasionally when i'm hanging out with my boyfriend i forget he's in the room he'll make a sudden movement and i'll jump because it's like he appeared out of nowhere i have this problem with no one else and i find it very embarrassing i would like to think i'm not so self centered as to actually forget that other people exist what do you think i've been taking psychology classes for over two years now and i have never heard of this i would greatly appreciate any suggestions for the record we've been dating for over a year i want to point out that although he is quiet he can occasionally be literally lying on me and i still forget he's there perhaps your just not all that into him perhaps your just not emapthically connected to him nothing to feel bad about i mean no one is able to be connected to everyone i have had people i could not connect to on deep levels it could also be your just so confortable with him there that you forget he is there i don't know what to tell you lol maybe he's a ghost Social rule The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Milton H.
