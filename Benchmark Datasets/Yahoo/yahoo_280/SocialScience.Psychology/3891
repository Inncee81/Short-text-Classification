how can i change this about myself i have always been looked upon as the leader of our class when i am sad and down so is everyone else or at least the guys so after the last time i saw them sad i made a vow to never show them when i am in pain but to lead and be strong i've kept in so many things whenever something is wrong or i am so covered with troubles that i can hardly breath i still hold back the pain and make sure that they are taken care of and help them with their problems no matter how hard i try i can never show that i am hurting and i dunno yes this is a selfish question but id just like to sometimes let out my emotions to my friends and be sad when i feel sad instead of putting on a mask how do i do this could a therapist help me but see i already feel bad that i will let them down who are they in years to come will you still be living your life because you don't want to let them down these people will go out of your life you will still have you all hiding behind this mask of whatever it is it certainly is not happiness why do you take so much upon yourself do you want to be a hero you can't make yourself into something for other people you will still be doing this when you are old and grey live your life truly be true to yourself we are not on the planet to please others we are not even on the planet to help others we are on the planet to be real to show feelings to live our life to the fullest to show up truly in each and every moment to be real to love to receive love to give love what you are doing will hurt your life in the future in being real with your feelings of sorrow fear happiness joy love you are leading you are being strong lead by example that means being who you truly are a human being not something you think you should be Theory of conduct Pitaten Jon Secada Happiness Darth Vader Meaning of life Current teachings of Prem Rawat Force (Star Wars) Humphrey Bogart Goodness and value theory Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sydney Riot of 1879 Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) One Tree Hill (TV series) Religion The Fairly OddParents The Ashlee Simpson Show Avenue Q Rich Mullins Bernard Williams Emotion Social rule Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Glen Jacobs Doctor (Doctor Who) Urantia Anxiety Fantastic Four Abortion debate Simone Weil Sin City Mortification of the flesh Kodocha Saudade Time Out of Mind Pok__mon Live!
