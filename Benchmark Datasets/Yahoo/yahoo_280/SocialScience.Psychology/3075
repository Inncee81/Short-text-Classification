should your dark side be accepted as a part of your total self refusal to accept the dark side of yourself can lead to unhappiness i think this is a great question without knowing what your dark side is i would have to agree that people should accept their dark sides however i also think that the word accept is just the beginning one should accept his or her dark side and work to understand all aspects of it how did it develop any childhood factors that contributed to it what is the story behind the dark side how does it work what does it look like in real life in addition what are the consequences of one's dark side i believe that for many people a dark side means that a person is meeting their needs in a socially unacceptable way so what are these needs what are the consequences of meeting these needs in this particular way i would ask does it hurt me does it hurt others or perhaps it also helps me and helps others most importantly is there any other way of meeting these needs in a way that is healthier however that is defined or better for myself and how can i work towards this while this response may be more analytical than expected i do believe that adults have an ethical responsibility to consider the consequences of their actions on their loved ones and on society for instance if my dark side is smoking a little weed every now and then what does this really mean who is this hurting etc no right or wrong answers just my opinion Theory of conduct Ethics Utilitarianism Epistemology Goodness and value theory Value system Infantilism Evil Objectivist philosophy Alcoholics Anonymous Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Dissociative identity disorder Human Philosophy of language Stoicism Simone Weil Democracy Religion Scientology beliefs and practices Science Extreme Programming Economics Abortion debate Feudalism Bernard Williams Immanuel Kant Plame affair Transactional analysis Religious Society of Friends Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma A Course In Miracles Meaning of life Education Divorce Socrates Nicomachean Ethics Philosophy of mathematics Liberalism Social justice Karl Marx Social psychology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Causality Economic inequality Consensus decision-making Polyamory Morality Coercion Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Ten Commandments Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Hate speech Altruism Motivation Contract Autism rights movement Determinism Narcissism Lie Psychology Growth hormone treatment Originalism Postmodernity Artificial consciousness Deconstruction Universal pragmatics Force (Star Wars) Gender role Drug abuse Cultural relativism Homophobia Internet troll Transsexuality Autism Patriotism Philosophy Paradox Alignment (role-playing games) Reality Creationism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Mary Wollstonecraft Human sexual behavior Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sociobiology Meme Puberty Ownership Asperger syndrome Homosexuality and Christianity Bertrand Russell Manifold Guns, Germs, and Steel Satanism Software engineering Organic farming Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti
