this dream i ve remembered fors years whats it mean okay me and my brother are watching tv in our basement except the window is right above the tv when it should be on the other wall i see this green monster with yellow eye's in it's head look at us then he crouched down so he couldn't be seen i was telling everyone so we were all scared and trying to leave but my dad was sleeping on the couch and wouldn't wake this is either where i woke up or forgot what happened next so what does this mean you may have conjured up this scenario when you were very young you could have been ruminating about your personal vulnerability while your dad was sleeping in front of the television when you attempted to wake him you found that he wouldn't or couldn't wake up immediately this may have introduced some apprehension into your psyche because you realized how vulnerable you were during the time that your dad was in this deep sleep over the years this specific fear has generalized itself and continues to echo the intense feeling of vulnerability that you still may feel Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story W.I.T.C.H.
