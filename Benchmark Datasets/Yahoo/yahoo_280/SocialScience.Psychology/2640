what do you think would lead a person to begin a ya account two mos ago and only post hate filled and insulting questions on the same subject each with a slight change in the wording noticing the same name on several vile questions but choosing not to respond to hate i was curious all the same and looked at the questioners q a what would make someone so miserable that they sit down at the computer and decide to spread some of that misery around day after day what is your take on this beans i haven't seen the cult guys you refer to but you do get my point beans i haven't seen the cult guys you refer to but you do get my point oh you mean like smitty skinhead charlie and all the others in the skinhead cult idk maybe they're insecure and need attention and the only way they know how to get it is by being obnoxious and spewing out hatred just to get a response so they feel like someones paying attention to them its the same thing with the people that use x rated pictures as their avatars they just want to be acknowleded because their self esteem is low and they dont know any other way to do it some people would rather be hated then ignored yeah i dont respond usually i tried once or twice but my rebuttals and telling them to knock it off only seemed to encourage the behaviour if its really offensive i report it but thats only if those are the only things i report pornography and racisim most times i just ignore them as if they're not even there eventually they get the message nobody wants to hear or see that crap thinks but it really makes for an unpleasant enviornment doesnt it Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Little Britain Milton H.
