what is the best way to stop missing someone just curious aiden wish i could help you out i am interested in reading the answers though and must say that the first one sure did make me laugh on a serious note i know our brians release a chemical when we are happy content satisfied aroused etc i think part of the missing of someone is how they could effect us and enable our brians to release these feel good chems i suppose if you met someone else that could do the same for you it would help but chemistry is something i think is either there or it is not and everyone reacts and triggers differently good luck do something for yourself on a daily basis that makes you smile Social rule Happiness Traumatic incident reduction Friedrich Schleiermacher Utilitarianism Bernard Williams Microeconomics A Course In Miracles Water (molecule) Milton H.
