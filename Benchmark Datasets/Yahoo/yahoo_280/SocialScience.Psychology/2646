anxiety problems i've had a little anxiety for a long time both my parents are pretty anxious people too i've been kind of stressed and i'm home alone for weeks which makes me very very anxious i've been so on edge that i always feel sick to my stomach and i'm tense and shaky i was just wondering what kind of things i could do to get over these attacks i really really hate them anything besides medication or therapy just things i can do at home if gender has anything to do with it i'm a guy this just isn't my account one more thing being with too many people makes me really edgy i have had severe problems with anxiety in my life from major panic attacks to milder like i have now i would say do what you want to do if you have nowhere to go for weeks go rent some movies you think you'd like or have already seen read a favorite book go outside and take a walk or ride a bike anything that will get you out of your own self is a good thing do you have some positive acting friends or neighbors you could call or visit the best thing for anxiety is to try to interest yourself in something distract yourself try writing out your feelings drawing you are wound up and need to release your feelings in some way i feel for you Anxiety Charles Darwin's illness Transsexuality Clinical depression Milton H.
