random depression im and live a good life with a great loving girlfriend who ive been with for months we've shared a lot of great memories together and just click i always thought we had a fairy tale relationship and any problem i had i addressed with her and we fix it and vice versa though now i just hit a wall these past few days maybe last couple of weeks when im around her i just randomly get depressed and breakdown she always tries to cheer me up and its awesome that she reassures me that she'll always love me we havent found a solution to it yet but she suggested therapy the only possible factors i can think of are my poor sleeping habbits usually sleep at am and wake up at noon this summer just a constant wanting to be with her every moment its magical or a subconscious insecurity about something i may go through with the therapy because ill do anything to get the relationship back on track im just scared that the therapist might randomly suggest a seperation if you believe you need therapy then i would suggest it as you will be open to the experience however i believe that you may be able to work this out by curbing your sleeping to more normal hours and to find some happiness in other aspects of your life than just your girlfriend when you put too much weight on the relationship person to keep you happy you can actually cause the depression try to work on it yourself first then seek therapy as therapy is not the fix all Bipolar disorder Hypnosis Psychoanalysis Dead Like Me EastEnders Sexual orientation Days of our Lives Traumatic incident reduction Psychosis Electroconvulsive therapy Reparative therapy Milton H.
