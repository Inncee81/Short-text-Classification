i have an accoplishment to share or is it an accoplishment i've saved thousand dollars what should i do with it should put it in a cd spend it buy a house what should i do should i be proud i'm years old no kids hardly any debt i make about a year i own a home it's kind of crappy though i have a lexus rx old but paid for should i be proud of myself if so why am i always worried and not satisfied i'm never content that is definately an accomplishment you should definately be proud today many people are in massive debt you should definately be proud that you have hardly any debt and that you have money saved some people cannot save money which can hurt them and potentially their credit because should unforseen circumstances arise they will not have sufficient money saved to deal with those expenses it is good to have some money saved and accessable in case unforseen circumstances arise money in a cd or possession ie house is not readily accessable if you need it you said your house is crappy so it seems like it would be a good idea to look into buying a new house the problem with doing that right now is that the housing market is not doing well you could still talk to a real estate agent or do some research into the housing market especially in your area if you decide now is not the right time to buy a house which it might not be put some of the money into a cd or consider investing it ie in the stock market because if you really wanted something then i do not think you would not be asking us what to do with the money so the best thing is to save it and use it to make more money so when you find your dream house boat car etc then you will have the money to get it according to financial expert suze orman if you are in emotional distress then wait before you do anything with the money suze orman has great financial advice that may be of help to you life is unpredictable including jobs and the economy so it makes sense you are worried you are unsatisfied because you are not doing what you want to be doing another reason you are not content is that you do not have what you truly desire think about the following questions do you like your job if not do you believe you should be doing a job that you enjoy if so then you will not be happy until you are doing what you truly love do you like the city where you or living do you like the house you have if you do not have a place to call home that feels homey then you are not going to be content until you do do you like how you spend your leisure time if not this can be cause for discontent do you have unfulfilled spiritual goals if so then you will not be at peace and content until you spend some time trying to reach them do you want more time with friends and family then make more time for them whatever is wrong with your life take steps to fix it realize you are a unique individual and what makes others happy might not be right for you no one can tell you what to do with the money because you know what your desires and priorities are we can only give you pros cons and information to consider congradulations and best wishes Microeconomics Keynesian economics Insurance Deflation (economics) Capitalism Hyperinflation Inflation Mutual fund Personal finance Capital accumulation Great Depression Bond Economy of Russia Avenue Q Security (finance) FairTax Annuity Monetary policy Infantilism Say's law Mergers and acquisitions Outsourcing Money Coercion Nicomachean Ethics Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bretton Woods system Gold standard Freeters Arbitrage Warren Buffett EastEnders Estoppel Debt Money supply Social Security debate (United States) Supply-side economics Asian financial crisis Confidence trick Supply and demand Alcoholics Anonymous One Tree Hill (TV series) Economy of the United States Theory of conduct Financial markets Stock Consensus decision-making Labour economics Shaggy dog story Internet fraud Anthroposophy Anarchism and capitalism Trust (Law) USA MMORPG Technocratic movement Finance Law of value Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Emperor of Dune Happiness Globalization Deficit spending Strategic management W.I.T.C.H.
