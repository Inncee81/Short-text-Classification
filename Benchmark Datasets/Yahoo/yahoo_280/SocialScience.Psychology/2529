dying in your sleep from hypnagognic sensations i didnt know how to word my question accurately but my point will become clear it would always begin immediately upon entering sleep i would experience an overwhelming sense of fear its more intense than that but no words come to mind to describe more accurately i would be in a state of lucid dreaming to where i am aware that im sleeping be aware of the fear but not aware of why and be in control of my mundane mental functions in every event i would force myself to wake up experience sleep paralysis for about minutes and would have to stay up for about minutes before attempting sleep again if i would go to sleep immediately after waking it would happen again i have always have the immpression that if i did not wake myself up i would die i will have to include additional details because i do not have enough characters to work with in my question box in one event about years ago i purposely did not wake myself when it began the fear and physical pain grew more intense and eventually i did wake myself i experiences pain in my arms chest and shoulders for about days and never attempted it again in the beginning when i was i would imagine it as a demonic experience i am not strictly religious so i just dont know how accurately applies but it literally feels as if my soul is trying to leave or is being torn from my physical body i have been studying lucid dreaming hypnagognic sensations and sleep paralysis i wanted to discuss this event that has periodically plaguing me for about years my first experience with this was at age i am now it is not a very common occurence maybe once every couple of months but when it happens it concerns me a great deal i want to know about anyone's thought of the matter experiences or theological opinions i go through it as well though it has decreased somewhat during the last couple of years and it seems to be directly related to an emotionally traumatic experience i had the decrease mine have been mostly what would appear as demonic and i studied what was called numinous in fantasy and religion whenever a spirit was present the person encountering it was in a trance and to all appearances to others they seemed dead secular belief says it's purely neurological because there are episodes where the person deals with non religious fears i think it's probably neurological but it's like a state of mind where spirits if they exist can enter and attack in some way the word nightmare is literally night mare it was considered to be a spirit that came to torment the sleeping person before that it was called lilith Out-of-body experience Lucid dreaming Dream Soul Hypnosis Consciousness Traumatic brain injury A Course In Miracles Religion Sleep paralysis Supernatural Narcolepsy Meditation Human Animism Scientology beliefs and practices Hell Cult Psychology of religion Mind Clinical depression Carl Jung Sigmund Freud Reincarnation Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Psychosis Emanuel Swedenborg Dualism (philosophy of mind) Person Friedrich Schleiermacher Miss Saigon Neuro-linguistic programming Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Simone Weil Autism Aikido Milton H.
