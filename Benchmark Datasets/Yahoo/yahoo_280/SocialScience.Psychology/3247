is it bad to not let people walk all over you you know what i mean well let's just say i am very stubborn and strong willed is that a bad quality to have i'm a little unsure about it sometimes it can be easy for some 'strong willed' people to misrepresent such a question but in general what's bad is letting people walk all over you you have every damned right that is just as much as anyone else to do whatever it is you want short of law breaking or other bad things but there are times when compromise can be the better solution just have to temper the strength with some empathy make sure you're not overlooking anyones feelings or situations that could be affected i think one of the best traits to pair with strength is compassion afterall what good is being strong willed if you will only for your own benefit don't be unsure just be mindful Theory of conduct Empathy Alignment (role-playing games) Social rule Goodness and value theory Knife Numerology Procrastination Poker jargon Milton H.
