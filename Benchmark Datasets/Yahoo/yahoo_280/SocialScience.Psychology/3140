did i open pandora's box i have always worn pantyhose with my skirt suits for work each day at the office needless to say with me dressing that way my hubby developed a pretty intense curiousity about it as i was getting ready for work one day i asked him what the fascination was and he told me that he found it alluring and sensual when i wear pantyhose and that he was curious to experience that feeling so i hiked up my skirt eased out of my sheers handed them to him and told him to slip them on i let him keep them on for a few minutes and he went absolutely crazy over the way they felt which i thought was kind of neat now hes asked a few more times recently for me to let him wear them again i don't want to deny it to him because of how fascinated he is and how much he liked it that one time i'm thinking if i can limit it to a few minutes around the time we go to bed we could have fun with it how should i handle this i can't believe that how funny i know men probably do have a hidden curiosity i don't think there was anything wrong with allowing him to try them out i can not help to wonder though why he wants to continue most men would try it and then never try it again most would fear that you would tell someone and then it would be all over i don't wear hose because they feel good i wear them because they accent the appearance of my legs scratching my head i personally would not be comfortable with this here's a suggestion though if it starts to bother you tell him that the fun is over and if you catch him wearing your hose you are going to tell his friends lol that should stop him in his tracks lol Pantyhose Milton H.
