how does the atheist account for the laws of logic i asked this in a previous question and just got argumentative responses b c i involved my beliefs so please just answer the question to your best ability and understand that my beliefs have nothing to do with this question i am simply trying to understand your if you are an atheist account this was not suppose to be in psychology sorry if your question is about logic the answer is simple everyone uses logic regardless of religious beliefs an example of logic is all men are mortal socrates is a man therefore socrates will die this is logic everyone can agree on this because it has been proven true through a logical process this is known as a syllogism religion has no bearing on true logic the only time religion has a bearing on logic is when those posing the syllogism do so with a religious pretense such as the bible states that x is a damnable offense to god you commit the act of x therefore you are going to hell for this syllogism to be true then one must assume that the bible is the true word of god nobody can prove with certainty the bible is the true word of god it now comes to one's faith on whether it is true or untrue the above stated is logic your question i feel has been sufficiently answered if your question was indeed about logic however i believe that what you meant to ask was how does the the atheist account for 'morality' morality is a broad term for right and wrong behavior morality is determined by not only religion but society as well hence a nation's state's province's own legal system this legal system can be viewed as a set of moral guidelines set down to govern its citizens' behavior respectively to the society at large many of these laws everyone can agree with such as it is illegal to steal from another citizen and the legal system provides an avenue of recourse to the victim as well as a punishment levied against the perpetrator of the crime as an atheist morality in a general sense is determined by what society has laid down as right and wrong behavior to go further as an atheist myself morality is also determined through introspection and personal integrity i do not want to steal because a i can no longer be trusted by my peers and b i do not have the right to simply take something because i want it to elaborate on example b allow me to give the following example say i want a plasma tv and my neighbor has one i have not worked for the money to go out and buy the tv i have not through self discipline saved up my money to go out and get one either therefore i have not earned the right to own a plasma tv which means i do not through my own actions deserve to steal my neighbors plasma tv that he bought by his own means i do not feel that i am owed anything in this life that i have not earned through my personal actions this is not just in a material sense such as the examples would imply but in a personal sense as well i e honor trust respect etc logic is at the heart of atheism we use verifiable social truths daily to logically determine what is morally right or wrong according to the society in which we live and not simply just because god said so most people of religious backgrounds think that atheists promote anarchy this is absolutely not the case yes there are atheists who do behave in such a manner but these are far fewer than their religious extremist counterparts most atheists are very level headed and socially aware people if you refer to those who commit godless acts these are not necessarily because they are atheists their actions do not reflect the lack of god they reflect a lack of integrity let me know if this was a good answer to your question thanks for trying to understand the other side of the coin Goodness and value theory
