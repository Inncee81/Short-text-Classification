how are people's social lives being undermined by spending more time bonding with a computer instead of actual people i'm referring to social networking sites such as myspace for example it seems like an addiction for some folks why don't people just walk outside and meet people in front of their own nose that is a far better option these potential friends live next door they're at work church social engagements night classes etc what is everyone's thoughts about this mat the elder the fact that it is becoming the norm is flat out pathetic don't people have lives outside the computer i am not a member of myspace or any other site similar to it i prefer to meet real people face to face in the real world meeting people the old fashioned way sure beats online social connecting which i think is for the lazy and chair potatoes for lack of a better word i feel sorry for today's generation that they have to rely on a computer to meet friends sad i prefer to be my own person rather than follow the bandwagon just because it appears that everyone else is on it doesn't mean one has to join just imagining people sitting at their computers adding digital friends especially for those in their s and s seems so immature don't they have a life nckmcgwn good point i'm with you there thank goodness i was born during a time before all of this silly nonsense if this is all people have time for adding friends at the click of a button all while sitting on their duffs well that is unbelievably ridiculous moreso for the older folks and somethings and up mat the elder that is true people will always be social animals but if they are so social why are they hiding behind a computer screen pumping up their profiles and adding people left and right and then announcing them like they do in elementary school not very mature i'm referring to those past the ages of and for the younger crowd it's a whole different ballgame my question is focused on the older supposedly more mature crowd no way jose can a single human being have a meaningful relationship with or friends and to call them friends is silly in a case where someone's friend list is that high well i think they are mostly acquaintances and not honest to goodness true friends real social animals are extroverts and let me tell you one thing extroverts do not waste time collecting online buddies they go outside to social engagements church functions and other events etc along with meeting them at work and in classes if one wants to use a social networking site to keep in touch with friends they already know and met in the external world that is fine and to add people you don't know is fine too if you know who you're dealing with and not letting it control your life but why hundreds of friends why add that many if you can't keep up with them all i mean who can or has time especially when there's hours in a day time is limited life is short wouldn't it make better sense to keep social networks small so you can dedicate more energy to those relationships as for me i prefer quality over quantity any day when you keep your circle of influence smaller the bonds are tighter the larger it gets the connections weaken i mean who wants or would want that there are people who spend loads of time trying to connect with digital friends but they don't even pay attention to the friends or acquaintances they've met in real life offline relationships are far better than online go out that's one of the reasons why i hate myspace it makes making friends as easy as clicking a button when it really isn't building a good friendship means meeting in person your best friends are the ones that you've known for a long time you know before myspace you met them in person and connected with them in person that's why the bond is much stronger kids now can just click on whoever looks hot to them and talk to them on the computer i think it's pathetic i used to have myspace but i realized i didn't need it i'd rather meet people in person you're right it is far better Theory of conduct Friendship LiveJournal The nature of God in Western theology Religious Society of Friends Mouse (computing) One Tree Hill (TV series) MMORPG Social network Cyberspace Poker jargon Indian English Philosophy of language Social rule Carl Jung Zoophilia Windows XP Law of value Physical attractiveness Japanese tea ceremony Time Out of Mind IBM PC compatible Narcissism Floppy disk Knots Landing Undergrads Password About a Boy Nicomachean Ethics Surveillance Social software Aerial (dance move) IPod Pitaten Scientology beliefs and practices Jumpstart 3rd Grade Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Oscilloscope Infantilism Mojave people Sexual orientation The Catcher in the Rye Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Plame affair Goodness and value theory Polyamory Human sexual behavior Friends Church of Christ Daredevil Internet fraud Objectivist philosophy Yu-Gi-Oh!
