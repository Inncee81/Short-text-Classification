what were some experiences you had as a child that shaped you into the person you have become i dealt with a lot of death at a very young age the loss of siblings from when i was years old definatly shaped me i'm not sure i'll ever fully understand the impact it had on my way of thinking considering those are the shaping years but i know one thing i have a tendency to play out death scenarios in my head every time someone i love is late coming home calling me meeting me if they said they would be somewhere at a certain time and they are not within minutes i've listed all the ways they could have died what it will feel like to hear the news wondering how long it will before before i get the call who i will have to call what i'll wear to the funeral and so forth then they show up and it all goes away morbid i know but i can't help it i had a therapist tell me once it is a defense mechanism to prepare lol as if thats possible so that i won't have to go through the shock of it expect the unexpected and all that lol sorry i don't have something more positive to respond with but that's my story nonetheless Grief Time Out of Mind Psychoanalysis Drama Milton H.
