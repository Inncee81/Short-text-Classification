when do you know it's time to cut ties with a friend my friend talks to me regularly but i don't feel much warmth in our conversations even when we talk about emotionally charged topics she takes a removed intellectual approach towards them this is something i've always appreciated but lately i'm sick of it i've tried telling her i wish she was more personal but all that's done has gotten her to talk more about herself without regard for what i say she rarely asks me questions about myself or what i'm up to i just don't feel encouraged other friends tell me i should be the bigger person and treat her the way i want to be treated but i can only take so much this person is supposed to be a good friend and we do talk a lot but our friendship is emotionally lacking when is it time to settle and when is it time to hit the road i'm usually the one initiating new topics of conversation and even inviting her to spend time together i don't feel like i'm getting a fair deal this is supposed to be a friendship sometimes in life it's wise to cut people out who aren't helpful or bring you down if she brings you down instead of raise you up she's not a true friend how is she your friend anyway i'd offer distance before i'd write her off perhaps space will offer you some time to think and miss her or realize you're better off parted i guess being honest with her would help some people are so dense and in their own world you are right a fair and balance is about give and take but i often found i had friends who i turned to when sad or needed help yet my best friend in the world growing up laughed when 'bad' things happened tripping in front of people or my bad grades perhaps i made her feel better when luck wasn't for me anyway cut back and see if she notices if she does be honest and good luck Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Ashlee Simpson Show Nicomachean Ethics Mojave people Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story God Emperor of Dune Humphrey Bogart Sydney Riot of 1879 Dead Like Me Glen Jacobs Another Side of Bob Dylan Emotions (album) EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Highway 61 Revisited Sharon Tate Infantilism Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jon Secada Alcoholics Anonymous Ty Cobb Kender Vernon Schillinger Cliff Richard Goodness and value theory Sigmund Freud Earth Girl Arjuna The Death Gate Cycle Bad Wolf Friends Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief About a Boy Undergrads The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Plame affair The Emancipation of Mimi Cheating in poker Current teachings of Prem Rawat Scientology beliefs and practices Kodocha Blonde on Blonde Transactional analysis Ethics U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Socrates Extreme Programming Athrun Zala The Catcher in the Rye One Piece minor characters Poker jargon Richard Feynman Big Brother (USA TV series) Aesthetic Realism Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Milton H.
