statistical psychology question it is required to know whether the mean gas mileage for some population of cars is lower than the legally required minimum of miles per gallon the measured mileages for a sample of cars are a state the null and alternative hypotheses b formulate decision rule to reject the null at level of significance c calculate the value of the t statistic state whether or not the null is retained or rejected and interpret your conclusion a light bulb manufacturer wants to see whether or not the use of a given alloy alloynew in the filament of a light bulb makes any difference to the lifetime of the bulb compared to alloyold the alloy used in bulbs being currently manufactured accordingly he manufactures bulbs using alloynew and bulbs using alloyold and measures the lifetimes of the bulbs in hours use alloynew as x and alloyold as x the lifetime of the bulbs containing alloynew are the lifetime of the bulbs containing alloyold are a state the null and alternative hypotheses b formulate a decision rule able to reject the null at a level of significance c calculate the t statistic state whether or not the null is retained or rejected and interpret your results a researcher wants to study the effect of lemon juice injections on the speeds of sabertooth airport melons however pilot studies indicate that lemon juice injections have different effects on sabertooth airport melons depending upon their level of education when sabertooth airport melons are injected with lemon juice the speeds of melons with higher levels of education seem to increase more than do the speeds of melons with lower education levels accordingly the researcher decides to perform a t test to investigate the hypothesis that when melons are matched for education level lemon juice injections increase sabertooth airport melon speeds the researcher gathers two groups group and group each containing sabertooth airport melons the researcher also makes sure that the ith melon in group has the same education level of the ith melon in group he then injects each melon in group with water which has no effect on sabertooth airport melon speed and injects each melon in group with lemon juice he then measures the speeds of all the melons in both groups these speeds are as follows melon group group a what are the null and alternative hypotheses b formulate a decision rule to reject the null at the level of significance c compute the t ratio for two dependent samples and state whether the null is retained or rejected and interpret your results in english i need calculations please help i really really hate this a that through this report you will show that the mean gas mileage for some population of cars is lower than the legally required minimum that the alternate hypothesis is that the mean gas mileage for some population of cars is higher or the same as the legally required minimum b that if there is a deviation of more than mean gas mileage that the null hypothesis does not hold true and by admittion the alternate hypothesis is proven c as the mean value for the numbers given is and only out of the cars are above this it is of the cars that are above the mean legally required average um not sure what else to do here hope this helped even a little Null hypothesis Quantitative marketing research E85 Statistical hypothesis testing Scientific method Incandescent light bulb Race and intelligence Speed of light Normal distribution Luminiferous aether Statistics Doomsday argument Intelligence quotient Economics Gravity Battery (electricity) Bayesian inference Psychology Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Headlight Welding Light-emitting diode Experiment Explosive material Balassa-Samuelson effect Solar variation Factor analysis Reliability engineering Biology and sexual orientation Qualitative psychological research Alcohol fuel Model (economics) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mann-Whitney U Temperature Antenna (radio) Microeconomics Electrophysiology Hybrid vehicle ELO rating system Student's t-distribution Student's t-test Supercharger P-value Tire Z-test Turbocharger Economic inequality Lighting Supply and demand Likelihood-ratio test Hardy-Weinberg principle Diesel engine Carbon dioxide Many-worlds interpretation Supreme Court of the United States Growth hormone treatment Casting Parapsychology Biodiesel Pearson's chi-square test Randomness Insurance Vitamin C Gasoline Speed limit Determinism General relativity Standard deviation Divorce Freeway Philosophy of mathematics Special relativity Bell's theorem Species Automobile Jet engine Hypoglycemia Probability Randomized controlled trial Sea level rise Motor oil Nutrition Efficiency wages Modern geocentrism Likelihood principle Tobacco smoking Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Graduate school Ultraviolet Stopping power Bicycle lighting
