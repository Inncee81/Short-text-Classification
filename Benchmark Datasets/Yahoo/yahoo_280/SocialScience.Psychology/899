i'm confused by personality tests every time i do a personality test i come up as reserved rational obedient quiet introspective etc but when i meet people i come across as outgoing sociable interested in them etc everyone i know says i should be a life coach or teacher or something where i interact with others but all these tests show i should be a pa or librarian or something what do people think about these tests how true realistic are they and how seriously should i take them when i'm looking to change my whole career you have answered your own question if you should be a life coach then you wouldn't need to sit asking these questions a librarian would however sit and ponder over this yes you should follow the personality test or ask to see a life coach SAT Meaning of life Personality psychology Social psychology Jiddu Krishnamurti Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Social rule Librarian Philosophical skepticism Simone Weil Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Roman Catholic Church English grammar Socrates Ben Johnson (athlete) Human sexual behavior Milgram experiment Library reference desk Guru Jumpstart 3rd Grade Identity and change Objectivist philosophy David Hume One Tree Hill (TV series) Expert system Theory of conduct Rei Ayanami Juggalo All Quiet on the Western Front Babylon 5 Theodicy Altruism Charles Grandison Finney New York Knicks Past teachings of Prem Rawat Zhu Xi Consciousness John Howard Yoder Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Avenue Q National Certificate of Educational Achievement God Emperor of Dune Law of the People's Republic of China Edward Bouverie Pusey Moral objectivism Zen Empiricism Transsexuality Tai Chi Chuan Rorschach inkblot test Abraham Karl Popper Satanism Fallacy Alignment (role-playing games) Game show Mojave people Library catalog Test cricket Catechism Logic The Princeton Review Koan A Course In Miracles Goodness and value theory Philosophy of science Test (student assessment) Philosophy of language Donald Davidson (philosopher) Bayesian inference The Austere Academy Standardized testing Debugging Religion Model (abstract) Schutzhund Derek Parfit Family Feud George Harrison John Wycliffe Metacognition Scientology beliefs and practices Guru-shishya tradition Leviathan (book) Contract Justification (theology) Summa Theologiae Big five personality traits Subud Tony Hancock Coercion Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Phaedo Prime number Copyright Ecco the Dolphin Mary, the mother of Jesus Tripartite System Calvin and Hobbes
