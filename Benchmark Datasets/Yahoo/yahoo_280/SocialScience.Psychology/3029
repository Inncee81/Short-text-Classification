why are westerners so attracted to atheism i discussed the issue with some friends and other than the usual cliched answers they gave some explanations namely because of a gambler's principle which says that the richer you are the more likely you are to gamble therefore people in western countries are more willing to gamble away their eternity another gambler's principle which says that a person would much rather win a million dollars in a casino than to work for it therefore westerners like to think that the universe and life started just by chance because they live in highly organized and regulated societies and it results in a psychological phenomenon that could be referred to as beast envy therefore they eagerly embrace theories like evolution which imply that humans are merely animals i think these theories have some truth in them but i'd like to hear other explanations but please not vain ones like because they are more educated that obviously has nothing to do with it thanks realists they are answer given by by jeremy k that is another vain answer that doesn't answer anything anyone can claim that their view is the realist one and i think atheists are the ones who are not being realists daniel alando garcia keep telling yourself that same crap oneal some people look at the bad things we do as the devil being inside of us well i look at it as the result of either abuse or having a weak brain not being able to take violence found on tv or in video games well both explanations are just attempts to excuse humans from responsibility for their own actions actually most christians don't say the devil being inside of us i think what they say is that people often sway to temptations and immoral deeds that are influenced by the devil which is quite different power and control is a westerners way making that money having that car to let go and say there is a higher power is a humbling experience for someone who lives to get that control often most are let down by the god they were brought up with so they give up on having faith in anything but the money that can get them what they think they need for some the attitude is that they have to see things in order to believe them society in general has its problems and well some of these people are going to have to believe in something in order to get through and yes i am one of them trying to figure out who my higher power is Religion Atheism Gambling Meaning of life Intelligent design Philosophy of mathematics Creationism Goodness and value theory Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Existence of God God Free will The nature of God in Western theology Social psychology Alcoholics Anonymous Afterlife Soul Intelligent design movement David Hume Evil Immortality Theory of conduct Supernatural Atomism Philosophy Microeconomics Karl Popper Altruism Sola fide Simone Weil Psychology Creation-evolution controversy Evolutionary creationism Utilitarianism Ethics Devil Abortion debate Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief History of creationism Friedrich Schleiermacher Agnosticism Motivation Moral objectivism Aristotle Animism Reincarnation Religious Society of Friends Evolutionism EastEnders Craps Teleological argument Cult Blackjack Franz Boas Deconstruction Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Guns, Germs, and Steel Young Earth creationism Slot machine Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Karma Leadership Philipp Melanchthon Jiddu Krishnamurti Bernard Williams Magic (paranormal) Ten Commandments Democracy Philosophy of language Creation science Scientology beliefs and practices Gravity Psychology of religion Friedrich Nietzsche Summa Theologiae Fermi paradox Jewish philosophy Resurrection of Jesus Poker jargon Occam's Razor Teach the Controversy Anarchism Urantia Sexual orientation Gestalt therapy Satan Homophobia Sin Existentialism
