gay and pedophile help i am in the middle of an heated discussion with this guy about pedophiles who like little boys only he say's even though they only choose little boys and not little girls that makes them pedophiles only and not homosexuals too he says if they're homosexual then they would only like grown men i don't believe this does being attracted to kids automatically mean they can't be gay or at least exibiting homosexuality by purposely targeting boys only when he says this i immediately think about the catholic church i can understand if he sought out children no matter their sex but he targets young boys only therefore i believe he's a homosexual pedophile thank you everyone for the help if there is anything else to add i would be grateful i'm sorry for the misunderstanding the person i was conversing with is not a pedophile we were talking about some one else who has been apprehended of course if someone was raping kids or anyone else i would report them right away not ask questions on y a thanx to everyone who responded years ago back in the s the fundamentalist christians carried on a vicious campaign against gays saying they were all pedophiles they said that since gays can't reproduce they recruit trying to get their hands on little boys and turn them gay this was never true in fact many leaders of this movement like singer anita bryant later apologized but some people are just so spiteful and malicious that they cling to any 'facts' true or not sadly a large number of these spiteful malicious people are to be found in religious groups who supposedly espouse love and tolerance for everyone but not all christians are like that a lot of male pedophiles who exploit little boys are not even really gay i mean they don't find themselves attracted to men just to little boys many of the catholic priests who went after little boys it was because they were forced by the church to be celebate but little boys were available to them Pedophilia Religion and sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity North American Man/Boy Love Association Sexual orientation Same-sex marriage Childlove movement Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Human sexual behavior Bisexuality Rick Santorum Gay Ephebophilia Reparative therapy Opus Dei Anti-gay slogan Marriage Ex-gay Gay rights Anglican views of homosexuality Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Same-sex marriage in Canada Religion Religion and sexuality Recurring South Park characters Biology and sexual orientation Child sexual abuse Gender role Homosexuality and transgender Holy Orders Homosexuality in Japan Child sexuality Christianity Church of Christ Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Age of consent Criticisms of Christianity Fundamentalism Infantilism Anal sex Homophobia Don't ask, don't tell Transsexuality Christian right Eastern Orthodox Church Effeminacy Cybersex John Wycliffe Prostitution Christopher Marlowe Lesbian Mormonism and Christianity Laura Schlessinger Cult Trinity Zoophilia Religious conversion Section 28 Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Evangelicalism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Abortion debate Domestic violence Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Theodicy Anita Bryant Cliff Richard South Park Seventh-day Adventist Church French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Protestantism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Sin City Religious pluralism Gay slang Avenue Q Ludwig Wittgenstein Persecution of Christians Jerry Falwell James Dobson Transgender History of sex Kyle Broflovski Lawrence v.
