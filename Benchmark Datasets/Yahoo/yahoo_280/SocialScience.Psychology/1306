goosebumps and tingly what is the cause i live near buffalo and last year everyone was obsessed with the sabres for hockey they were close to winning and everyone was going crazy over it i never watched a game and i dont care about the team i mean it would be nice if they won but it would also be funny to laugh at the people who got their hopes up in my global class every day my teacher would play a youtube video someone made about the team that had an inspirational song and clips of nice moments in town and then the sabres and i would get goosebumps and feel tingly everytime he played it and recently my friends bought a nsync live concert dvd to reminisce and when i was a kid i hardly liked them at all i heard their songs maybe on the radio but i wsant a huge music fan and i never owned a cd by them and when they started with the first song i got the same feeling i ws just wondering if this is caused by the energy and excitement going on or maybe something else thank you i think that you get caught up in the enthusiasm and joy that you perceive in others when your group of friends and acquaintances are happy you become happy The Ashlee Simpson Show Queen (band) Britney Spears The Catcher in the Rye Buffalo Sabres Live Aid Current teachings of Prem Rawat Cliff Richard Shaggy dog story Neil Young Roxette I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Ron and Fez Seinfeld Ayumi Hamasaki Care Bears Nine Inch Nails Goosebumps The Emancipation of Mimi Spice Girls Depeche Mode The Jam English cricket team Radiohead The Ashes Ice hockey King Crimson Los Angeles Clippers Crazy in Love Incubus (band) Ramones The Star Wars Holiday Special Hip hop music Weezer Green Day Mario Lemieux Alanis Morissette Garth Brooks Led Zeppelin Donovan Pok__mon Live!
