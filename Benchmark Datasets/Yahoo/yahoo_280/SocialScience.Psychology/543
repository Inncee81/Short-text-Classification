playing the cancer card my father had prostate cancer back in the mid 's he had surgery and was pronouced cancer free he is a very hateful and verbally abusive person and whenever he abuses one of us and has to be accountable for it he will say he went to the doctor and his psa numbers are up and the cancer is back my mother is a co dependant enabler and agrees with him however in the years since he hasn't had any treatment or anything to prove that this is anything more than a form of manipulation so how should i handle this in the future what should i say to him the next time i confront him on his actions and he says something like how can you do this to a dying man i understand your dilemma here the minute you call his bluff you may be dealing with the little boy that cried wolf and feel just awful if he needs to start treatment or becomes deathly ill i say bring up this topic with his doctor or at least the doctor's assistant i am certain your father is not the only one that uses a previous ailment in such a manipulative manner as well you do not want to let this sink in to his mind that he is sick and never getting better some times the mere thought can make us sick in short talk to his doctor's office they may not be able to tell you anything personal but may be able to better inform you about what steps you need to take as well they may want to speak to him about how he views the information they give to him may you and yours be blessed while still on this bumpy path Prostate cancer Cancer Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Causality Fight Club Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Curse of Fenric Church of Christ, Scientist Immortality Stomach cancer Consensus decision-making Poker jargon The nature of God in Western theology Sigmund Freud Alternative medicine Kodocha A Course In Miracles Death Comes to Time Hearsay Divorce Le Malade imaginaire Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Mother Teresa Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Summa Theologiae The Doctor Dances Infantilism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sant Thakar Singh Reiki Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief The Invisibles Clinical depression Sin City Domestic violence Colony in Space Earth Girl Arjuna Mental Health Act 1983 Post-traumatic stress disorder Psychology Bad Wolf Medicine Witchcraft The Subtle Knife Parsifal Scientific method Emperor Yuan of Han Orgasm Traditional Chinese medicine YuYu Hakusho Leonard McCoy Metastasis Predestination paradox The Twin Dilemma John Howard Yoder Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Mesothelioma Circumcision Incarnations of Immortality Radiation poisoning Annuity Hydrogen peroxide Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Sola fide Plame affair History of medicine Something Awful Contract Benign prostatic hyperplasia Knots Landing EastEnders Neuro-linguistic programming Prisoner's dilemma Altruism Child sexual abuse Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity One Tree Hill (TV series) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Opposition to cults and new religious movements Friedrich Schleiermacher Time Out of Mind Iago Denis Law Medical analysis of circumcision The Brothers Karamazov Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Internet troll Ludwig Wittgenstein Contract bridge Decompression sickness Ten Commandments Publicly funded medicine Priesthood (Mormonism) William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham Hollyoaks Disease Yoga Sutras of Patanjali
