trichotillomania for people that suffer from it how did your family take it when you told them that you had it how did you explain to them what it was hey vengence i do have a life i have a beautiful little girl and a wonderful husband your lack in grammar and arrogance is sad company my family treated me exactly the wrong way they kept telling me to stop picking at my face etc they would constantly harrass me about it and showed very little understanding of what was going on of course i myself didn't know what was happening except that i had the uncontrollable urge to pull out facial and other hair to this day about years later i still have very few eyebrows though i have managed to stop pulling hair from almost all other areas except for beard hair but that's no big deal cause i can shave i do wonder if a more positive reaction and approach back then could have saved me some trouble down the road the only way i could explain to them was that i wasn't doing it on purpose that it had a name and that there were lots of other people who suffered from the same thing eventually over the years they became more understanding though i think it still annoys my father they at least learned to quit harrassing me about it once i explained that it just makes it worse and more frequent don't know if that helps but that's my personal experience and for what it's worth trichotillomania is classified as an impulse control disorder in the same spectrum as tourette's syndrome not an ocd best wishes nathan Trichotillomania Obsessive-compulsive disorder Baldness Tourette syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Asperger syndrome Pitaten Shaggy dog story God Emperor of Dune Milton H.
