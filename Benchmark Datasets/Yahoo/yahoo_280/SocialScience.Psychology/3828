why are people lazy i don't mean all people some people just seem to be born lazy and i wonder why i think it relates to having no interests in life and having no desire to learn i've known fat thin clever and dumb lazy people and the same trypes as active motivated people so i don't think laziness is necessarily to do with being fat or lacking intelligence but i found it's common among the lazy for them to have no personal interests of hobbies and to have no desire to learn about anything i don't understand that at all so what is your opinion please about why some people are intrinsically lazy perhaps you also know a 'cure' for it also do you think it's something in their brain that's biologically 'wrong' and if so could science reverse that please exclude depression lack of motivation in depression isn't laziness i mean those lazy people who love being lazy and are happy being that way also i'm not sure about the upbringing theory as it's common to have siblings who are bone idle while others in the family are very active motivated i'm pretty sure of what it is it's because other people permit them to be lazy look at lazy people why are they lazy it's because they have a support system of people around them who claim to 'love' them so do everything for them sometimes this pattern begins in childhood with a mother who 'spoils' her child sometimes it begins later in life when a man marries a woman who then attends to his every whim so he needs never get up off his as there's no way you can be lazy if you live alone or if others seriously depend on you if you live alone and are lazy you'd starve lazy people always have others tending to them it's a partnership other people permit them to be lazy by doing everything for them when you think about it you know it's true lazy people find they're on to a good thing being waited on by a mug s so they keep on being lazy until it's their nature and they can't change Asperger syndrome Goodness and value theory Friends Autism Human sexual behavior Theory of conduct Human Biology and sexual orientation Motivation Narcissism Meaning of life Utilitarianism Nicomachean Ethics Sigmund Freud Neuro-linguistic programming Bertrand Russell Polyamory Objectivist philosophy Intelligence quotient The Smoking Room Transsexuality Social psychology Sexual orientation Controversies in autism Autism rights movement Capitalism Ethics Prostate cancer Intelligent design Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Alignment (role-playing games) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Psychosis Alois Hitler Narcolepsy Animal rights Numerology Divorce Family Androgen insensitivity syndrome Happiness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Current teachings of Prem Rawat Deconstruction Creation-evolution controversy Homer Simpson Physical attractiveness Person Stephen Jay Gould Fathers' rights Michel Henry Nature versus nurture Married... with Children Theodicy On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Evil Merit Soul Adoption David Hume Brain Religion Philosophy of language Pitaten Altruism Left-handed Abortion debate Zoophilia Logic Psychology of religion Magical thinking Hearing impairment Mnemonic Free will Kim Possible Child sexuality Mental retardation EastEnders Atheism Love Religion and sexuality Shaggy dog story Causality Eugenics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Stem cell Race and intelligence Neighbours Poverty Summa Theologiae Phoebe Buffay's songs
