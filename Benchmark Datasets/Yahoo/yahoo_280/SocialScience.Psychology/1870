why am i so fixated on certain childhood memories when i was a kid i was not forced but coerced by my brother to do oral on him he was and curious i guess i was and naive now as an adult every once in awhile i get to where i'm really wanting to do oral on a guy i guess the reason is i want to feel dirty and slutty i thought maybe it was my way of taking full control of what my inner child wasn't or is that all phycobabble because as an adult if i don't want to do it i have no trouble saying no i also like getting humiliated and punished one thing i fantasize about is bare bottom spankings also i like my girlfriend to take all my money and give me just enough to get by i told her to spend it frivolously but i can't really get her to do it because she says she would really feel too guilty sometimes i feel so abnormal and depressed about things omg tercentenary i feel so bad for your past but at least it's in the past and you have every right to be angry with her bad things are traumatic trauma sucks if good things were traumatic in a positive way we wouldn't remember the bad things Avenue Q Spanking Narcissism Pitaten Serial killer Infantilism EastEnders Hypnosis Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Catcher in the Rye Friends Grief Knots Landing Traumatic brain injury One Tree Hill (TV series) Time Out of Mind False memory Child sexual abuse Incest Kyle Broflovski Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Theory of conduct Ranma __ characters Beavis and Butt-head Post-traumatic stress disorder Taxi Driver Traumatic incident reduction About a Boy Satchel Paige Kender Child sexuality Hazing Clint Eastwood Shaggy dog story Transactional analysis Trailer Park Boys Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse L.O.C.K.D.O.W.N.
