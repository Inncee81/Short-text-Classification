why people always assume that i am always arguing i got such a feedback from my senior colleagues in my previous company and my present company i was told that i had make a mistakes at work i will argue back to make it as if the mistakes weren't done by me but i was only trying to explain to them that i did not do it deliberately due to such a conditions i make mistakes sometimes i do know that to certain people i might sounded very defensive and arguementative but sometimes i thought to myself that it would be better to explain not that i am not willing to admit my mistakes what shall i do to improve that i really don't want to portray myself to others that i am a very negative person i do value my work i just join my current company for only months i just got these feedbacks from my leader and i am feeling a little downhill of course every colleagues of mine have their individual style at work good bad and the ugly but i only worry about myself really if i am serious or when i joke they commented about me as some felt offended over a harmless comment and if i kept quiet they commented that i am too serious and asked me why i am so quiet another problem of me is that i am kind of straight forward and also outspoken hi user i'm better than i deserve i am glad i am not the only one feeling like this i do admit that i do this with my family members too but after that i will slowly think back was it really neccessary to be called for to further explain about my reasons nevertheless thank you for sharing your thoughts with me i am really unable to choose the best answer as all of you guys answers are so beneficial to me d i would like to say a big thank you once again for taking your precious time to read and answer my question i will keep all the advises from you guys by hard hope some of the friends out there who have the same problem as me will be benefited from these answers as well we are not alone and we will work hard to become a better person which will be a good will to people around us d have a good day ahead you know when you go to a new job interview they ask that stupid question the what are your strengths and weaknesses well do share this experience your strength is that you are a perfectionist you become disappointed with yourself when you make mistakes strength and it bothers you to hear someone else point it out weakness then tell the future employer that it's something you are aware of and fixing so you don't come across as argumentative let them know you want your work to contribute to the overall success take it from me i'm beyond a perfectionist probably borderline ocd Social rule Plame affair God Emperor of Dune Shaggy dog story Transactional analysis Avenue Q Theodicy Obsessive-compulsive disorder A Course In Miracles The Ashlee Simpson Show Poker jargon Whose Line Is It Anyway?
