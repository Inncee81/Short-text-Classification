why i don't have the best friend when i become older and older i believe that every body can remember their child friend and that time our life is simple free and happy but after becoming older and older and the life must be changed and also must recognize kindly of different things though eyeshot was opened up but also lost some pleasure especially for the best friend hello nelly x i am not sure you have even met your best friend yet but you must not give up hope a best friend can be someone born in the next bed to you on the day you were born or be in the next bed to you on your last day on earth when you are about years old best not to panic just yet but look at all the people you do know and think what kind of a friend you have been to them then think of the people you don't know and how you could strike up a friendship with one of them they could be even like me a pen friend that you could arrange to meet after you have had a written relationship with them and found out what they are aboutm and just how valuable as a friend they could become so many angles to this question of yours nelly you really are going to maybe sort this out from a research angle first i have a pen friend called mary i have only met her on this web site but i feel like i have known her and maybe even loved her all my life and the relationship we have on this web site and in our e mails together are positively amazing if i was free to meet her i would in a minute we have a lot in common but it is mostly literal as we have other interests when it comes down to personal love and we know that taking this kind of relationship is virtually pointless but i will dorrespond with her every day and all day as it's fun we have not sex that is how it suits us but if this was you and you were free to take it further you could meet your new best friend and keep him for the rest of your life and wonder for all time why you didn't do it sooner and all thanks to yahoo don't forget yahoo is international and will serve you in more ways than you can imagine try yahoo personals it's great when you want to meet someone and you can do it through e mailing for years if you want to before you arrange to meet with your new best friend i bid you good luck nelly and hope this answers your question tony m Theory of conduct Social rule Rich Mullins Nicomachean Ethics Pen pal Milton H.
