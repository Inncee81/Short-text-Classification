how to deal with a parent with possible personality disorders ok my mother has been declared mentally unstable by a court therapists earlier this year and i would like some options on how to deal with her her behavior is almost a mirrored image of her mother's and it was assumed my grandmother had several personality disorders i would say she was diagnosed but she never went to a counselor herself this was information assumptions my counselors explained to me over the years grandmother was assumed to have narcissistic personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder among others after reading the explanations for these two in the dsm iv i see several parallels and though i know it's not an official diagnosis i really would like some tips on how to deal with something like this i would like to avoid breaking any all contact but if there is no other option then there's no other option i just want to explore my options as thoroughly as possible i wanted to say that i'm not sure what the court therapists diagnosed her with she won't disclose anything specific to me setting your own personal boundaries will be important dr henry cloud has an excellent book on boundaries that might be helpful for you i struggle with a father who has strong narcisstic traits he's never offically been to a doctor to be diagnosed either i've had to accept that he is very likely incapable of really understanding my or anyone else's point of view the way i want him to as i see it there are lots of reasons 'why he is the way he is' both from his childhood and probably also from his biological makeup and i truly believe he does the best he can but i've also learned that i can decide to what to degree i want to be involved in his life or how i let his behavior affect my own life and actually as i've begun setting my own limits gently and respectfully our relationship has slowly improved best of luck to you i hope you also have supportive persons in your life you can talk with about this it can be very helpful Autism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychoanalysis Antisocial personality disorder Controversies in autism Borderline personality disorder Clinical depression Narcissism Dissociative identity disorder Transsexuality Asperger syndrome Personality disorder Post-traumatic stress disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Psychotherapy Narcissistic personality disorder Adult attention-deficit disorder Mental illness Dyslexia Sigmund Freud Medicine Bipolar disorder Motivation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sexual orientation Addiction Prostate cancer Psychiatry Schizophrenia Anorexia nervosa Traumatic incident reduction Reparative therapy Expert system Pervasive developmental disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Anti-psychiatry Obsessive-compulsive disorder Psychosis Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Charles Darwin's illness Autism epidemic Multiple sclerosis Philosophical counseling Intelligence quotient Supply and demand Terri Schiavo Friends Human sexual behavior Species Stuttering Gender identity disorder Mental retardation Physical therapy Mental health Drug abuse Second language acquisition Transactional analysis Scientology beliefs and practices Franz Boas Fathers' rights History of intersex surgery Sexual addiction Down syndrome Childlove movement Social psychology Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Autism rights movement Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Albert Ellis Cerebral palsy Probation officer Abortion debate Narcolepsy Gender role Divorce Psychology Plame affair Child sexual abuse A Course In Miracles Intelligent design Information Technology Infrastructure Library Traumatic brain injury Carl Jung Anxiety Infantilism Involuntary commitment Cephalic disorder
