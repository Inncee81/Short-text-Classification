what do u understand about psychology being a scientific discipline psychology is most certainly a scientific discipline here is why as patois stated psychology uses the scientific method for gathering empirical data and evidence to support theories and hypotheses the same scientific method that has been applied to such disciplines as math physics or chemistry has been and is applied to psychology psychology like other sciences uses statistics to quantify uncertainty i think patois did a nice job of providing you with some resources but let me stress that if you would like to know more about psychology get your hands on a used intro to psych textbook you can pick one up pretty cheap online and it will be a great resource sorry but i hate wikipedia i mean lets face it would you rather read a book by someone with a phd or online articles by whoever decides to post there sadly enough however it sounds like richard s is an idiot and he obviously knows very little about psychology or the sciences of which he states that he has knowledge human behavior is uncertain that is for sure but so is most everything else in science most every science has some degree of uncertainty example pi the digits extend to infinity with so sign of a pattern or quantum mechanics einsteins theories about particles break down at the most minute of levels in other words every science has uncertainty and psychology has just as much uncertainty as other sciences what we know about psychology tells us that human behavior is in fact to a large extent predictable and explainable rather than elusive and random anyone with knowledge of psychology knows that i e not richard s the goal of psychology is to some degree to predict manipulate and control human behavior much in the same way that physics can be used to predict manipulate and control moving objects human behavior is much more predictable than you think if you dont believe me look up some of those refernces patois listed or an intro to psych book finally if psychology is not a science than nothing is it adheres to every requirement needed to be considered a science only the ignorant would argue otherwise Scientific method Physics Parapsychology Sociology Statistics Economics Probability Quantum mechanics Philosophy of science Uncertainty principle History of science Neuro-linguistic programming Intelligent design Social sciences Mathematics Social psychology Theory Falsifiability Randomness Quantum mind Chemistry Particle physics Logic Faster-than-light Religion Occam's Razor Psychoanalysis Computer science Artificial intelligence Sociocultural evolution Creationism Gravity Speed of light Time Franz Boas Free will String theory Intelligence quotient Race Developmental psychology Human Meaning of life Computer Where Mathematics Comes From Alfred Korzybski Chiropractic Entropy Many-worlds interpretation Time travel Soul Causality Software engineering Luminiferous aether Behaviorism A New Kind of Science Autism Research Second language acquisition Origin belief History of physics Political science Creation science Dissociative identity disorder Richard Feynman Spin (physics) Doomsday argument Species Brainwashing History of psychology Consciousness Emergence Bell's theorem Physical science Bayesian probability Multiverse Flood geology Supernatural Information Propositional knowledge Conspiracy theory Microeconomics Homeopathy The Skeptical Environmentalist Sociobiology Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Normal distribution Black hole
