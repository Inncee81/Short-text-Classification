is heaven an actual place or is it a state of mind i would say it is both in a way it's not a 'place' as we can perceive in our d world as we are now it has no coordinates but there are multi dimensions beyond what our sensory peceptions can see in our limited human bodies and this 'solid' world these dimensions are operating at a much higher vibrational frequency than our own that is why they appear invisible a bit like us being tuned in to only one radio station and not realizing every other radio station exists when we 'die' we change our form to a much higher vibrational level and we then experience the higher state of consciousness known as 'heaven' it has nothing to do with any 'religion' or the 'bible' everyone will ultimately experience the same state of bliss infinite love and oneness when they revert back to their original state of being after 'death' a bit like being re born we are all facets of the same one energy and one consciousness so yes heaven is a place and a state of mind God Sri Aurobindo Mantra Hinduism Soul Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Consciousness Immortality Loudspeaker Heaven Out-of-body experience Yoga Friedrich Schleiermacher Advaita Vedanta Origin belief Bhagavad Gita Idolatry Church of Christ, Scientist Maurice Merleau-Ponty Heat capacity Sense Acoustics Urantia Christian eschatology DC Universe Sant Thakar Singh Debye model S__ren Kierkegaard Aum Microphone Samadhi Philosophy of perception Light Phonon Hindu philosophy Psychology of religion Quantum mind Kundalini Solar cell Subtle body Tae eul ju Infinity Multiverse Digital audio broadcasting Mortification of the flesh Meaning of life Dualism (philosophy of mind) New Age Nirvana Eastern Orthodox Church Ascended master Buddhism Human Religion Reality Supernatural Mind Tesla coil Etheric plane Afterlife Radio Lucid dreaming Theodicy Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Information General relativity Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Brahman Summa Theologiae Harmonic series (music) Turiya Baptism Ramakrishna Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Tests of general relativity Cyberspace Fuel injection Regular polytope Satya Spiritual evolution Death Cosmology Infantilism Michel Henry Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Existence of God Guitar Naruto jutsu Oneness (concept) Electric guitar Telepathy (Star Trek) Transformer Pitch (music) Dither
