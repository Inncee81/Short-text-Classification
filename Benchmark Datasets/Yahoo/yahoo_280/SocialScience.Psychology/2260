plastic surgery i have always had low self esteem growing up my relatives would always call me ugly and it really hurt me i am thinking about getting plastic surgery because it really would make me feel so much better about myself but i can't convince myself that it is necessary enough that i should go through with it i mean by getting plastic surgery it would make me feel so much more confident but then again my parents are really against it and they think it's unnecessary and it does cost a lot of money so i guess i just want to hear some unbiased opinions about this i think this depends on how old you are if you are still young like younger than i would wait sometimes people grow into their looks or find other ways to help them feel better such as diet exercise new hairdo makeup techniques etc i didn't start feeling confident about myself until i reached it's really a point where women start to feel more confident in themselves as most are established and successful if you're older than and feel there's nothing else you can do and that you've exhausted every other means by which you could feel better if you're sure and you have the money understand that it could be botched and that it's painful and serious surgery and are willing to deal with it for the end result then go for it it's your life your money Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Carpal tunnel syndrome Colorectal cancer Stomach cancer Theory of conduct Kodocha Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Narcissism Cancer Religious Society of Friends Simone Weil Scenes from a Memory History of intersex surgery Obesity Breastfeeding Social rule Weight training Plastic surgery Transsexuality Self-esteem Sex assignment Pitaten David Reimer Fecal incontinence The Apprentice 2 The Ashlee Simpson Show Current teachings of Prem Rawat Nip/Tuck Menstrual cup Breast implant Inflation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Days of our Lives Babe Ruth Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Microeconomics Joker (comics) Adjustable gastric band CPU design Stroke Dice Supply and demand Chronic fatigue syndrome Knots Landing Hikikomori Fancy Crane Bondage (BDSM) Journey (band) Medicine Aikido Autism rights movement Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate Controversies in autism Anorexia nervosa Milton H.
