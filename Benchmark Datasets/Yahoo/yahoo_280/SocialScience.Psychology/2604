what would u do if you got in trouble because you move to college to live on campus imagine that you got accepted to on campus housing you tell it your mother and she gets upset you get for that private loan cosigned by your father and of course loan is ultimately for you to pay off but then she goes crazy saying that you'll get in debt and never get out that you can't leave her that you go there just to party and she won't listen to any of your concerns instead she says because you did that decision by yourself she will no longer cook help with any expenses if you ever will need help or help you with anything i carefully plan school and expenses with financial aid and i need to live on campus to get more involved and have better chance for better grades i did commute first year but it wasn't easy what would you do yes we are polish is your mom an old fashioned polish lady cause that definitely sounds like my mother if my mom told me that i would probably listen to her stay at the house but then again i have no choice due to my lack of money lack of make rational decisions but i might later then think about it go out on my own let her know that i would try to be a responsible person independent if she doesn't want me to be responsible independent then i'd ask her how she raised me did she raise me to sit in a hole with my parents my entire life be a complete loser did she raise me to be dependent on her my entire life if she says no to those questions then i'd leave good luck Student loan Education in the People's Republic of China Pitaten Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in the United States Education in Germany Divorce Small business Microeconomics Credit card Mortgage Theodicy Social rule Money Brown University Personal finance Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Monetary policy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) United Kingdom corporation tax Adoption EastEnders Annuity Capitalism Students' union The Apprentice 2 Animal Crossing Health insurance SAT Donald Trump Luck Grandview, U.S.A.
