how can i get rid of my jitters regarding my big lsat exam i will be taking my lsat law school admission test on sept th and it is taking over my life it seems like i have been having these excruciating headaches stomaches and a backache not to mention extreme dizziness at times i forget whether i locked the front door or not amongst other things i am way too anxious about the test to be practicing like i had before it was nearing i am just helpless do you have any advice or suggestions on what i can do any sort of help would be greatly appreciated thank you holy cow it is really early for you to be having these kinds of symptoms i don't want to exacerbate your worries more but if you are having pressure symptoms this bad now you should seriously ask yourself whether law school is a good choice for you right now the lsat is difficult but it is a magnitude easier than any one first year law school exams and you will have about of those the bar examination to qualify you to practice law is brutal as well i don't want to freak you out but anyone who suggests to you that this is the big test is feeding you bs this is the beginning of a tough road and i am worried about your coping mechanism ok some things you can do if you are committed to going forward first pay the money and take a review class if you are not already doing so it will improve your grade more importantly it will give you structure when you are self studying it's easier to get distracted than when a live instructor is talking to you second get enough sleep i'm assuming you are going to see your doc about your physical symptoms also ask if something like ambien makes sense to help you sleep third make lists i found that when i was getting distracted by things like locking the front door or remembering what else i needed to get done it helped me to write down a list of everything i could think of that was bugging me knowing that it was on paper helped me turn back to the task at hand i wish you the best of luck please take care of yourself Law School Admissions Test Pitaten Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Law school Graduate school SAT Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Education in the United States Extreme Programming Education in the People's Republic of China RuneScape quests Education in Germany Education in Romania Procrastination Chronic fatigue syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dyslexia Hypoglycemia Cannabis (drug) Test (student assessment) Great Teacher Onizuka GED Medicine Martial art Debugging A-level Philosophical skepticism Stroke Scientific method Social rule Multiple sclerosis Love Hina main characters Traumatic brain injury Clinical depression Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Bipolar disorder Pneumonia Theory of conduct Science Mach kernel College admissions Education in Portugal Richard Feynman Shaggy dog story Second language acquisition Lawyer The Shining (film) Charles Darwin's illness Cancer Alexander Technique Piccolo Junior Saga Homeopathy B-47 Stratojet Education Hogwarts Advanced Placement Program Perl Multiple chemical sensitivity One Tree Hill (TV series) Aerial (dance move) Explosive material About a Boy Socrates The Princeton Review IB Diploma Programme Linked list Terminal ballistics A Course In Miracles Hikikomori Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Time travel Mobile phone radiation and health Migraine Traumatic incident reduction Poker jargon Internal ballistics Physician Milton H.
