will i ever find love again will i ever find love again why is it so hard to just find someone who understands me i feel like i've been dating little boys i'm getting tired of it i'm almost i may be young but i'm def mature for my age and this my friend is the truth honey when you least expect it love will find you the only task in front of you is to stop chasing after it i have found that sometimes life works in this way you recieve gifts when you least expect them and as for dating men around your age group i know how difficult it is because i am the same age as you and sometimes it feels like all they want is sex and well i'm sure you already know that girls mature earlier than boys i suggest you start looking in new places to find a lover different from the places you were looking in before instead of finding a bf at a party how about you try a more mature setting etc just find different places to meet guys this affects the types of guys you meet very much good luck and i am sure you'll find somebody to love when it is time you're young enjoy your life and your independence you have more than enough time for relationships About a Boy Infantilism Love Friends Sex and the City Pitaten Avenue Q Maison Ikkoku Polyamory Kodocha Jon Secada Incarnations of Immortality Sexual orientation Honey and Clover One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.
