why am i feeling like this i have a sick feeling about just people before school starts like i dont mind them i just dont know its weird some of them are really stupid and immaure and some i hate and like but how can i get rid of this it always happens before school but when i start it it goes away btw it starts in weeks haha i totally know how you feel and i agree that it is hard to describe but there is a way to get rid of it it is a form of anxiety and i always had it when i knew i was going to go to school the way i got rid of it was probably the only way there is to get rid of it anxiety is a form of fear the only way to conquer fear is to face it i had to chose that i would be somebody that others would look up to i had a hard time with that at first because i was so shy i had to change my thoughts about myself and once i did that it was automatic i was cool popular in charge instead of shy timid and afraid of other kids tell yourself you're amazing with people and that you are a person others want to be around Anxiety Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Karen Horney Out-of-body experience The Adventures of Pete & Pete One Tree Hill (TV series) Chu-Han contention Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Shyness Obsessive-compulsive disorder Panic attack Homophobia Alexander Technique Stoicism Relative clause Hikikomori Defence mechanism A Course In Miracles The Demon Headmaster Shit Agoraphobia Procrastination Borderline personality disorder Social rule Vegeta Night (book) Boston Public Kodocha Year of the Spider The Ashlee Simpson Show The Contender (television series) Singlish Babe Ruth Jan Smuts Mary Jane Watson Phobia Doug D.N.
