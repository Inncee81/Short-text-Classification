when i went to school i was a serious loner and i thought i was very unpopular but some people that i knew were in an incrowd said i was very cool is this just a cruel joke and if not how could this be i am in school sorry i meant my last school because i am transferring no i don't think it was a cruel joke i think their observation about you was quite correct in fact they might have been trying to reach out to you because you seem like one of them so think again is it possible that you were engaging in some kind of self fulfilling prophecy that wasn't based on reality to start with do a bit of introspection try examining yourself see your good points you might get surprised with the results how you see yourself may not be consistent with reality yup that happens to some people they put themselves down but there isn't really any basis for that since we're at it why not challenge yourself to be a better person by having a bit more confidence in yourself maybe you were too critical about yourself Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Social rule Philosophical skepticism The nature of God in Western theology Epistemology Theodicy Time travel Objectivist philosophy Shaggy dog story Intelligent design Milton H.
