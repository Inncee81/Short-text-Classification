why do so many people insist their opinion is fact regarding the mccann case looking at the news and events category i agree with many who say that they believe there is something very odd about this whole case ie the disappearance of poor little madeleiene mccann and my opinion is that there is more to it than meets the eye i know however that this is my opinion i know we get worked up about this case but i find it very disturbing to see so many people shouting about the truth and claiming that their opinion is undisputable fact does nobody else accept that no matter how suspicious we may be about events of that day the fact of the matter is that we weren't there we therefore do not know for certain what happened why are people getting abuse for pointing out this rather important fact well said star for you False memory Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Sydney Riot of 1879 Plame affair Dissociative identity disorder Holocaust denial New Testament Project Blue Book Roswell UFO incident Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Peter Sutcliffe Mumia Abu-Jamal Resurrection of Jesus Theory of conduct Parapsychology Free will The resolution of the Dreyfus Affair Jean Charles de Menezes Church of Christ Terri Schiavo Contract Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Opinion Consensus decision-making Azaria Chamberlain disappearance Democracy Journalism ethics and standards Slander and libel Judicial functions of the House of Lords Arjuna International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Controlled Substances Act Appeal Nick Berg conspiracy theories Child sexual abuse ROC presidential election, 2004 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Media bias in the United States Succession to Muhammad Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda Romulus and Remus Biblical inerrancy Downing Street memo Movement to impeach George W.
