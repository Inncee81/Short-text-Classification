i had a weird dream is a sad one i was like dreaming of me and my two cousins walking and i was like not the one talking my older cousin started to kinda tease us of being to immature and we were like walking and surrounding us were cherry blossom trees and then a girl that was in front of me talked to me and said ''ajay and then i looked at that girl and i could tell she's from japan i looked at my hands and they were light brown skinned as always my cousins and that girl started to run i said hey wait i looked front and it was an amusement park the ground was turning into quick sand i was trapped and they kept running the japanese girl smiled at me and said bye bye then i felt like crying and i cried and now woke up so what does it means does it means that i didn't met a girl that i have to meet just because i'm weak from the quick sand bit it sounds like something else is going on in your real life that you have felt is for a long time uncontrollable and you feel like your sinking think about that and see if you can change that part in your real life by dealing with it and turning it around dreams tends to reflect emotions from your life situations that are bothering you Shaggy dog story Jon Secada K' God Emperor of Dune The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pitaten Kodocha Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Miss Saigon Blood on the Tracks Piccolo Junior Saga The Amber Spyglass About a Boy The Shining (film) Paranoia Agent Social rule One Piece minor characters Yami no Matsuei Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Doris Day American Idiot Inception of Darwin's theory Father's Day (Doctor Who) Hall & Oates Milton H.
