can coffe make you feel depressed i was once a coffe addict i had some coffe early hours of the day and as the time past at night or going up up to night i felt really sad and dull but just recently i gave up coffe and i feel so happy i cant belive it is this just my human asumption or is it coffe that can make you feel sad im just throught that help a little bit peace i'm a professional barista in seattle plus i have a psychology degree so i will try to answer this coffee is a stimulant which has different effects on different people coffee makes you hyper wakes you up and it also suppresses hunger and constricts your blood vessels but it is definitely addictive and the crash you feel as it wears off is the caffeine withdrawal which is why you probably felt better as you drank it more and more often because you'd get tired depressed get headaches etc as it wore off if you were seriously addicted to it it probably also affected your sleep patterns which i know can make people depressed so no coffee doesn't make you sad it's being addicted to coffee and not having any that probably made you feel like you were depressed you're only if i were you i'd steer clear of it especially if you feel better not drinking it plus you're young and probably not done growing and caffeine can stunt your growth i used to drink tons of coffee but now i usually just have a cup in the morning and lay off it the rest of the day if you need to wake up try green tea or some fruit they're just as effective and there are less ups and downs Caffeine Sleep Coffee Starbucks Clinical depression Drug addiction Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Yerba mate Breakfast Tea Pitaten Methamphetamine Word of Wisdom Opioid Hypoglycemia Cocaine Cannabis (drug) Addiction Narcolepsy Alcoholism Chronic fatigue syndrome Bipolar disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kurt Cobain Narcotic Coffeehouse Tobacco smoking Common cold Menstrual cycle Avenue Q Anxiety Migraine Social rule Coffea arabica Carbon dioxide Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Characters in the Smurfs Friends Motivation Antidepressant Hyperthermia Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Diazepam Narcissism Withdrawal Economy of Colombia Japanese tea ceremony The Drew Carey Show Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Herbal tea Minor Discworld concepts Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Futurama (TV series - season 5) Coffea Childbirth Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Decaffeination Sleep deprivation Happiness Charles Darwin's illness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coca-Cola Seasonal affective disorder Goodness and value theory First aid Hangover Atkins Nutritional Approach Recreational drug use Cardiac arrhythmia Rooibos Sleep apnea Reflexology Drug abuse Coffee and Cigarettes Psychosis Amphetamine Anger management Raisins (South Park episode) Borderline personality disorder T'Pol Medical cannabis Sexual orientation Lorazepam Red Bull Dieting Khat One Tree Hill (TV series) Knots Landing Sleep debt The Death Gate Cycle Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Cuisine of Singapore Stanley Cup
