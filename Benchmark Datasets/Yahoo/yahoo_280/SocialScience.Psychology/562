color hmmm curious what is everyones fav color mine is green has been since i was a baby anyone know how we start why we pick a fav color when we toddlers i've never heard anything about how we choose our favorite colors my favorite color is green too but it didn't start out as my favorite pink was my first favorite primarily because my mother loves pink and she used to dress me in it all the time then it changed to purple for a short while then it became red and stayed red for a long time just recently though i've begun to feel more in tune with green it's calming and soothing and it's the color of nature we'll see how long this one lasts Light-emitting diode Color theory Color The Supremes Rainbow Brite Dragon Booster Days of our Lives Jon Secada Teletubbies Shaggy dog story Koopa Kid Diamond Tour de France Adoption Red Hot Chili Peppers Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
