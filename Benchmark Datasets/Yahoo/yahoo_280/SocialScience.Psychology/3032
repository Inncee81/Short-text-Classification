all my life i have been closed to people whenever i would fall in love with someone it would be painful to open up to them and i would feel like i would have to protect myself from them so obviously those relationships never lasted with my friends i let them do all the talking and every now and again i will share what is going on with me im so closed what can i do to open up so its not so painful to me i have a therapist but sometimes i close up to her too its funny i can tell when im even closed off from myself i get pissed off and feel sad whenever im feeling sad i avoid everyone at all costs and try to keep the conversation directed at them im trapped in my own cage i need to get out any tips sometimes due to bad past experiences subconsciously you won't speak your mind because your afraid to be hurt or something like that it is very hard to even open to the ones you fall in love with because you are uncertain here's an idea since you have trouble being upfront trying communicating indirectly sometimes writing them a note for a while can help until you can gain the courage to be direct hope this helps Transactional analysis Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Social rule Pitaten Transsexuality Reparative therapy Diving Alcoholics Anonymous Infantilism True Crime: Streets of LA Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Polyamory Unconscious mind Clinical depression Scenes from a Memory Borderline personality disorder Pok__mon Live!
