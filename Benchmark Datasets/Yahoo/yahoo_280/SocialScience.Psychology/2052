are bad bosses making us sick seriously i just read an article that indicates that office bullies tend to be the type of people who get promoted to the top ranks if this is the case that is pretty alarming if you stop and think of how stressed one can be thanks to work how it affects our emotional and physical health you would think that everyone would strive to have a positive intelligent and people motivating person to be the head cheese and not the tyrant with the whip what are we living in a third world country thoughts this is the article for the reader who was asking http ca news yahoo com s reuters odds odd work bosses dc well i must say as someone who has supervised people i was always a softy and if anything they walked over me mind you i never got promoted beyond this either but i didn't want to be with the corruption and bullies either and was happy in that great little world while it lasted and you know what my girls never let me down not once we all gave and took and i never docked them for being late or anything because they were good people i later was transferred when the place downsized to the office from hell there was no productivity and everyone hated each other and after that i quit never went back and work for myself who needs that would rather live a simple life that sacrifice myself to that i have met many people who were made ill by their bosses it is a common problem but it has been for years it is allowed to go on because a company is only interested in making money and people don't count however productive they are i can't see how the problem can be solved specially since the study in the story showed that the bad bosses climb the corporate ladder i guess it's a warning not to take a career as too important it's better to have peace of mind Theory of conduct Dilbert Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus It's Walky!
