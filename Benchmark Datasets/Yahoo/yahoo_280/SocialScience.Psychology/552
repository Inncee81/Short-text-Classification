have problems expressing myself clearly i have problems speaking clearly and articulate and it's interfering with all areas of my life i consider myself intelligent and articulate but i just don't express myself this way i happen to be a great writer and have no problem with writing clearly even using more articulate language than the average person but when it comes to speaking i have problems expressing those same thoughts and ideas clearly i do have a shy personality and constantly get nervous when speaking to others especially on serious issues could my nervousness be the reason it's really annoying and interfering with how i communicate with others and relationships with friends i come across as unconfident or clueless the other part of the problem is that sometimes what i say doesn't make sense and i end up sounding stupid when in reality the thoughts and ideas made sense in my head and are profound but when i speak it's like i'm rambling this usually happens during discussions in meetings or class i think that your self conscious you say that u ramble and say stupid things but have anytone ever told u that u ramble nervousness usually stems from the belief that by speaking out may lead to ridicule but use yourself as an example if someone said something stupid would u mock them and laugh at them particularly in school no one will mock u in the middle of class and by the end they will have forgotten also such incidents dont last long can u remember anything that anyone else has said in class try to remember that no one is scrtuinising u that and that most people are self conscious and believe in what u say there are no right or wrong answers so have confidence in what u want to say and to hell with what others think theyre just narrow minded good luck Social rule Hypnosis Philosophy of language Scientology beliefs and practices Socrates Theory of conduct Immortality The nature of God in Western theology Problem of universals Franz Boas Transactional analysis Free will Victor Cousin Ludwig Wittgenstein The Ashlee Simpson Show Autism Recurring South Park characters Friedrich Schleiermacher A Course In Miracles Atheism Predestination David Hume Political correctness Maurice Merleau-Ponty Meaning God Aristotle Sigmund Freud Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Religion Aphasia Blood on the Tracks Pitaten Milton H.
