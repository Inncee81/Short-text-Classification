my cousin was denied for disability when he turned what can he do to get it back read for more info he has a learning disability and he isn't handicapped he is still in school and attends regular classes but with many accomodations he is very forgetful and has to be told things many times before he does it he daydreams alot and wanders off in his thoughts he doesn't focus very well and rarely does things on his own without being told they said he is able to work but i don't think so you have to constantly stay onto him for him to do work and for him to stay focused otherwise he just zones out and forgets and no one is going personally stay on him like his family does he is fighting to get his disability back what kinds of things should he say we have to write this letter to explain why we think their decision was wrong what should we say why does someone like him who has a legit problem get denied and the people who are fake get theres their entire life thats not fair i don't want to cheat the system i just want them to see he has a real learning problem again what should he put in the letter what ways can we grab their attention so that he can get his disability back what you need to do is call binder and binder disability advocates binder they will probably get all info on file right then you will then fill out the paperwork again and they will tell you what to do was your cousin actually denied or did they pull his disability when he turned and he needs to be evaluated again that happens too these people can and will help give them a call good luck Dyslexia Social rule Pitaten Humphrey Bogart The Star Wars Holiday Special Kender Procrastination Milton H.
