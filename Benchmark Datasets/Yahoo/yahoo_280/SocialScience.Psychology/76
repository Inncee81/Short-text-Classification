what does this dream mean my brother had a dream the other day about my dad who passed away almost a year to the dream anyway in the dream it was at our childhood house my ex partner was there along with my mom brother and myself my dad always only ever sat in one chair but in the dream he was sat in one on the opposite side of the room he was holding a piece of paper which was a life insurance polocy for one million pounds and he said to all of us upon my death you all get thousand pounds each whatever can this mean the of us have been trying to work it out i think that maybe your dad was not in his usual chair because he was trying to say he wants u move on and the insurance policy actually has nothing do with money but wealth as in he still love's u all even though he has gone xx Life insurance Full House Shaggy dog story Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Grandview, U.S.A.
