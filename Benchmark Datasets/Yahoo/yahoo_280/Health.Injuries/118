boyfriend broke my rib my boyfriend and i were arguing and he pushed me back and it's hard to describe kneeled knelt on my body so his knees were a bit lower than my collarbone i heard a crack which is understandable as his whole body weight was on me and the next day a lump came up which was sooo painful i couldn't lift my arm or anything and it went through to my back weeks later its a bit better but still very sore and the lump is still there does this sound like a broken rib i can't leave him i love him the women with abusive men all love them and most leave them and go back over and over i suppose it was all your fault for not loving him enough to do just what he wanted wasn't it hint he has just what he wants a victim i hope you wake up before you don't wake up some morning go to the hospital and tell them exactly what happened and i'll bet anyone checking this post that she won't do it why because dying is easier than admitting she made a mistake my daughter survived somehow not all do Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Professional wrestling throws Jon Secada EastEnders Social rule The Shining (film) Knots Landing Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ozzy Osbourne Autopsy Piledriver (professional wrestling) Boxing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Roswell UFO incident Blood on the Tracks Aerial (dance move) StarCraft: Uprising Shaggy dog story Evel Knievel Humphrey Bogart Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Casualty lifting Ron and Fez Skateboarding trick Paul Is Dead The Lovely Bones Weight training Babe Ruth Neighbours Kodocha Breastfeeding First aid Reaction to the assassination of John F.
