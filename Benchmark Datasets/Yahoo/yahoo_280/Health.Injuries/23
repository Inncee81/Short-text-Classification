is it possible to be struck by lightning without any injuries my daughter was outside earlier today and there was a lightning strike close to our house and i am trying to determine how likely or unlikely it is that she was struck she says that she fell down when she heard the thunder when i asked her if she had any pain she said her hip buttock area hurt i think i have heard of some people being struck and having either no injuries or minor ones i know people have been struck and survived although they often have lingering problems so are there any experts out there who can tell me the likelihood that my daughter was struck yet has no serious injuries the chances are highly unlikely she probably just hurt herself when she fell it's not entirely impossible but very unlikely Lightning Hip fracture Spanking Equine conformation Warren Commission Stopping power Corporal punishment Professional wrestling attacks Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Terri Schiavo War of the Worlds (2005 film) Lightning rod Myocardial infarction Babe Ruth Buttocks Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix BAC TSR-2 Tara Lipinski Bruise Ice hockey Piccolo Junior Saga Female genital cutting Breech birth Pain Boxing Chair Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Diving Triage Luke Skywalker Martial art Casualty lifting Aerial (dance move) Paracetamol Toronto Blue Jays Darth Vader Traumatic brain injury John F.
