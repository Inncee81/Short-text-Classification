i want to wear heels but i'm afriad that i could break or fracture my ankle can that happen with like a inch heel did that ever happen to you i doubt that would happen unless you were trying to run and then fell it's more likely that you'd twist or perhaps sprain your ankle in such tall heels if you aren't careful but i don't really think the likelihood of injury is that high practice walking around the house before you go out this also helps to break them in and protect against blisters and be careful on slick surfaces good luck Equine conformation High-heeled shoe Kurt Angle Shoe Hip fracture Hiking Diving Aerial (dance move) Running Foot Gary Sheffield Professional wrestling slang Traumatic brain injury Jessica Lynch Sailing Luck Professional wrestling holds Michael Vick Mois__s Alou Horseshoe Social rule Biped Tallit Triage Stone Cold Steve Austin Paragliding Pitaten Traditional Chinese medicine Japanese tea ceremony Skateboarding trick Magical thinking Motorcycle helmet Terrell Owens Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Paul Levesque Cowboy boot Snowboarding Leon White Bone fracture Pain Shawn Michaels Surveillance Greg Valentine Decompression sickness Climbing equipment Theory of conduct Marching band Dragon Booster Irish dance Diving suit Strike (attack) Table saw Martin Brundle Spring Heeled Jack Basketball Teen Girl Squad Motorcycle safety clothing Philosophical skepticism Professional wrestling attacks Crash test dummy Bass drum Violin Glen Jacobs Suplex Achilles' tendon Weight training USS Tunny (SS-282) Hulk Hogan Ski Chicago White Sox Seismic retrofit Paintball Horse Tooth enamel Montreal Screwjob Avalanche Drill bit Detroit Tigers Knife Tonya Harding Brian Pillman Survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks Donovan McNabb Page Falkenberg Boot Land mine Snowboard First aid Adam Copeland Tooth Mo Vaughn Asana Computer security Tire Domestic rabbit Amy Dumas Seattle Mariners 24 (television)
