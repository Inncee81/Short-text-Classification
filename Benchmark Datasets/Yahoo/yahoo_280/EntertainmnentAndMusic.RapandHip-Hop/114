is it really the man's fault i've been hearing this alot lately that its the mans fault for where some of us are as a people and im sorry but i have to disagree i mean whose fault is it that we have year olds who can recite every line to a rap song yet they have a th grade reading level now i dont like blaming rappers for certain things but cant you place some of the blame on rappers like young jeezy who glorify a life that gets you nowhere except in prison or an early grave the kids who see that image and think its cool cant you blame our black leaders ex al sharpton who care more about what rappers say in their music then he does how many blacks die of aids every year or how many africans were killed as a result of the ongoing genocide in darfur or the fact that some areas of black education are in shambles alot of finger pointing going to the man but when are we gonna take responsibilities for our actions teach the kids right from wrong create a safer environment hnic you are absolutely correct and in that other post about jena everyone was pretty much saying the same thing it is just a matter of making the distinction between true racism and the few people who make a point to play the race card every chance they get i do think the man is partially responsible for some of or perhaps a lot of the things that left the black community in it's current state and while i'm all for taking responsibility i don't want to downplay racism and act as though it doesn't exist not to imply that you do i'd like to think that we're not gullible enough to rely on him to fix our problems but at the same time we are sort of at his mercy because he owns all of america's corporations educational institutions the entertainment industry and makes the decisions that affect us and with that being said i'd like to see more funding in our black schools and yes it would be helpful for sharpton to put focus on more pressing issues and btw one thing that has gotten me really ticked off lately is the naacp wasting time defending michael vick's dog fighting that's ridiculous so again you are right we could also shift some of that blame on our black leaders bottom line it's a shared responsibiltiy the parents our black leaders the rappers and each individual i think hilary clinton put it best when she always says it takes a village to raise a child but you're right it has to start in the home and we all must take personal responsibilities for our actions Theory of conduct Bill O'Reilly (commentator) American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Economic inequality Ethics Ten Commandments Anti-Defamation League Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Affirmative action The Marshall Mathers LP Darfur conflict Abortion debate Hillary Rodham Clinton Plame affair Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Hip hop collaborations Sponsorship scandal Education in England Original sin Video game controversy Supply and demand Gangsta rap EastEnders Intelligent design movement Microeconomics NAACP U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Hip hop culture Social rule International Criminal Court Sampling (music) Objectivist philosophy Racism Islam as a political movement African American Music genre Free will Criticism of libertarianism Rosa Parks Philosophy of language Anarchism and society Divorce John Howard Yoder Education in the United States Janet Jackson Nation of Islam Philosophical skepticism Libertarianism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism 2004 Republican National Convention Time Out of Mind Communitarianism Asperger syndrome Theodicy Scientology beliefs and practices Determinism Aquemini U.S. presidential election, 2008 Autism rights movement The Ashlee Simpson Show Polyamory Rush Limbaugh The Apprentice 2 Alan Keyes 50 Cent Consensus decision-making Extreme Programming Amnesty International Autism Reparations for slavery Democratic Party (United States) Pitaten National Kidney Foundation Singapore Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Pledge of Allegiance Cultural Revolution Evil Arguments for and against drug prohibition Nigger Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans No Child Left Behind Act Tripartite System Equal Protection Clause Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Simone Weil Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Teach the Controversy Mumia Abu-Jamal Jennifer Lopez Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Whose Line Is It Anyway?
