can you help a camcorder novice i am looking to by a camcorder i don't want to use the little tapes it has to be able to hook up to my computer for editing on my computer prefer something that will word with windows movie maker i already know how to use this program any ideas any camcorder with the hard drive would be fine it's much faster to transfer video to the computer than one that uses minidvds don't get the camcorders that record video to minidvds that would take hours just to rip the friggen minidvd to your computer just to have it there to edit that's why i'd suggest one with a hard drive you can edit videos directly from the hard drive and then burn dvds and or vcds right off the hard drive hope this helps have fun with your camcorder with whatever one you choose Camcorder VHS 8 mm video format DV Warez Video CD Karaoke DVD-RAM Digital video Computer and video games Digital photography Videotape IBM PC compatible Digital cinema High-definition television Personal computer Digital8 Nintendo GameCube S-VHS IPod Film Screenshot AmigaOS Windows XP Computer Hard disk Desktop computer Independent film Floppy disk Mouse (computing) Computer hardware ITunes Computer virus Apple Computer Digital cinematography Digital camera Back to the Future Commodore 64 MP3 Digital video recorder Real Love (song) Atari ST Xbox TRS-80 Blu-ray Disc TiVo Hard disk recorder JVC Game programming Redundant array of independent disks Amstrad CPC Super Video CD Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Knoppix Compact disc Laserdisc CD-ROM Apple II family FireWire The Cure Atari 8-bit family Booting Professional video camera Secure Digital card Remaster Windows Vista File system Apple Macintosh IBM PC Video game music Linux Scooby-Doo Mac OS X Sound recording ZX Spectrum The Emancipation of Mimi Copy protection Ghostwriter (television series) Computer role-playing game Early IBM disk storage Covert listening device Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Nintendo Revolution History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Advanced Technology Attachment Magnetic tape MS-DOS PowerBook DOS Database Road traffic accident S__CAM NeXT Microsoft SCSI CD recorder Microsoft Windows The Star Wars Holiday Special Streaming media
