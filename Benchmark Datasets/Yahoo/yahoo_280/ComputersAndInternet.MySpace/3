what happens if you block someone on myspace theres some dude sending messages to my younger sister she's he's he was only talkin to her for like minutes then asked her to call him she don't wanna so she just ignored the message but he's been sending messages like 'how come you ain't talkin' and when she posted a bulletin at he replied to it saying 'liar' he's posted comments sayin 'talk to me what are u doing' and she can't use her myspace because if he sees she's talking to someone else he knows she can't pretend she's offline judging by his profile he is the same with other girls accusing them of lying he seems like a psycho so my question is will he be able to see her profile if he is blocked is there ever a way to remove her from his profile she doesn't want a private profile because then only friends can look she can delete him off of myspace block him he wont comment or send messages he would think it send to her but actually she'll never get the messages she can always hide her offline now icon by going to account settings if you dont want to know that you're online but actually you are MySpace Ann Coulter Internet troll AOL Instant Messenger Everything2 Internet forum Stopping e-mail abuse E-mail spam Taxi Driver Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Jim Rome Show Friends Steam (content delivery) Instant messaging Xbox Live Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Theory of conduct Shawn Michaels Internet phenomenon Another Side of Bob Dylan IP Multimedia Subsystem Social software Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Amber Spyglass The Catcher in the Rye Spam (electronic) Cross site scripting 2channel American Psycho E-mail Cindy Sheehan Netiquette Surveillance Harry Nilsson Slashdot subculture Internet fraud Plame affair Anonymous remailer LiveJournal Little Britain Avenue Q Gmail Computer virus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scientology versus The Internet James Randi Usenet System/34 God Emperor of Dune The Best Page in the Universe Piccolo Junior Saga B3ta 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Facebook (website) Blonde on Blonde Fark.com StarCraft Episode VI Fox News The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Independent Media Center Daz Dillinger The Human Stain Internet Relay Chat Ex-gay The Jazz Singer Skype Advance fee fraud Have I Got News For You Psycho The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Alan Keyes Social rule Project FUBELT Sharon Tate Xanga The Shining (film) The Inside FAQ Prank flash The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Something Awful Forums Self Portrait Rick Santorum Jennifer Lopez Tool (band) Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them MSN Messenger Patrick Bateman Apollo 440 Datalore (TNG episode) The Ashlee Simpson Show Windows XP Katelyn Faber Internet Group Management Protocol Newsgroup SuicideGirls Bulletin board system Kodocha Lie
