what is the correct grammar for using the possessive with me one other i e the pen belonging to tom and me but obviously the apostrophised version but obviously the apostrophised version perhaps i didn't make it clear the question isn't about i me it is about the possessive but i think it's been answered now so thanks what the second person said the key is that each of the 'owners' should be able to stand on their own and still make the right sentence i e my pen tom's pen thus my and tom's pen or tom's and my pen this is why the first answer on here is wrong 'the pen belonging to tom and i' sounds right because we sort of learn that 'i' is posher and more correct than 'me' however you would never say 'the pen belonging to i' and so the correct version is in fact 'the pen belonging to tom and me' alternatively by the same logic it would always be 'tom and i own the pen' hope that helps hx Riddle Cryptic crossword Charades Crossword Paul Is Dead Acrostic I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Scrabble (game show) Academic Games Anagram Magical objects in Harry Potter Gry Kryptos Phoneme Rotor machine Vowel Password (game) Orders of magnitude (numbers) The Hunting of the Snark Riddler The Hobbit Alphabet Jumpstart 3rd Grade Wheel of Fortune Pinyin Tag Welsh language You Don't Know Jack The Da Vinci Code WQHT (FM) Greek alphabet The Nameless Novel Letterboxing United States Postal Service Masquerade (book) Storytelling Transliteration The Penultimate Peril Silent letter Cranium (board game) One Ring Mnemonic Consonant Final Fantasy IX Italian language German language Diacritic Mail fraud Countdown (game show) Scrabble Patent Mussar movement Somali language Transposition cipher Now You See It .info Tetragrammaton I Am the Walrus Sherlock: The Riddle of the Crown Jewels Numerology MIT Mystery Hunt Kensington Runestone Make money fast Latin poetry Maze The Vile Village Acute accent The Amazing Race Arabic alphabet Aramaic language Ma'alot massacre Leon Trotsky Caesar cipher Tuvan language Anton Chekhov Double Dare (1976) E Springfield (The Simpsons) ROT13 Georgian language Betrayal at Krondor Oplan Bojinka Ligature (typography) Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Chain Reaction (game show) Nik Kershaw Negima Z Penutian languages Gottfried Leibniz Dutch language US and Canadian license plates __ Hereditary peer Voynich manuscript Circumflex Varieties of Arabic Substitution cipher Longest word in English S
