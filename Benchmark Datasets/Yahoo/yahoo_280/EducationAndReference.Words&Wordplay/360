plural or singular some americans use singular when they have to use plural for example i like tattoos on girls sometimes they say like i like a tattoo on girls or i like girls in a skirt is it ok in conversation ordinarily the numbers have to match for this sort of general statement girls skirts a girl a skirt in the first example you give someone who says a tattoo on girls may be trying to make it clear that they are not talking about girls who have multiple tattoos but the best way out of this is to make both terms singular i like a girl with a tattoo and of course i like a girl with tattoos is fine as for girls in a skirt it is incorrect but i would not make such a big deal of it for casual conversation note that in this case there should be no concern about using the singular skirt to avoid confusion since it is extremely doubtful we're contemplating a girl wearing several skirts at the same time English plural English grammar Skirt and dress Trousers Morphology (linguistics) American and British English differences Tattoo Finnish grammar Spanish pronouns German grammar Disputed English grammar Latin declension Namie Amuro Gender-neutral language Drag (clothing) Literature Kimono Spanish grammar Singularity theory Empty set Spanish verbs Religious pluralism Spice Girls Gender role Anonymity Vanilla Ninja Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Hijab Pantyhose Suit (clothes) Serbo-Croatian language Grammatical gender Data Singular they Euro Plural Great Teacher Onizuka The Virgin Suicides T-V distinction Physical paradox Grammatical person Woman Polygamy Arabic grammar Orthogonal matrix Social rule Angelina Jolie School uniform Buttocks Hebrew grammar Spanish dialects and varieties Call girl Polymorphism (computer science) Venetian language Dice Grammatical number Bulgarian language Extreme Programming You Hypercorrection Casual Epistemology Slovak language Amharic language Americas Names of God in Judaism Czech language Gothic Lolita Italian grammar Bob Jones University Culture of Fiji Subjunctive mood Vocative case English verbs Mojave people Idolatry Plame affair Gwen Stefani Varieties of Arabic Big O notation Quotation mark Invertible matrix Sento Pronoun Moral relativism Dual (grammatical number) Social aspects of clothing Twin Plutonium Irezumi Infantilism Ido Vulgar Latin Belly dance Sesotho language Tibetan people Black hole Earring Umlaut
