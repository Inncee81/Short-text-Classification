where did the name new zealand come from i am a new zealander and it is a shame that i dont even know this but ive moved to america and alot of people have been asking me where the name new zealand comes from and what it means ive tried researching and cant find anything of any relevance so maybe you guys could help thanks it comes from the southern most dutch province of zeeland zealand which borders the north sea opposite britain the province is made up of several islands which is most likely why it was chosen as the name for the islands found in the south pacific it is thought to mean 'sea land' though another opinion thinks it might be a shortened form of suevan land named for the german tribe called suevii if sea land it is quite an appropriate name because that is exactly what new zealand is even the maori names for the north and south island have sea themes with the fish of maui and the great canoe the links show maps of the netherlands and zeeland btw holland is a region within the netherlands but because it includes most of the coast facing britain the british call it holland there was also a kingdom of holland at one point but the netherlands is larger than that was City of Heroes Morecambe and Wise Superman Magic (paranormal) Invisible Hand Supernatural Jumpstart 3rd Grade Free will Zerg Pok__mon Abilities Altruism Golden Sun Parachuting Expert system Radar Gandalf Gradius Microeconomics Events in the Wheel of Time series Toa Aztec One Ring Merit Libertarian socialism Independence Party (Iceland) Incarnations of Immortality Science Link (Legend of Zelda) Invisible Woman Fantastic Four Fluorescent lamp Ganon Darth Vader GURPS Age of Mythology Politics of Canada Goldstein's book Property (ownership right) Khazar Correspondence School of Salamanca Xiaolin Showdown Young Wizards Justification (theology) Coercion Invisibility Occam's Razor Castlevania Legends Mister Fantastic Shen Gong Wu Rule of St Benedict Magus Antenna (radio) Pok__mon (video games) Password Phaedo Druid (World of Warcraft) Force powers Cryptanalysis Wheel of Fortune Baptism Marvel Universe Ra (board game) United States House of Representatives Chaos Emerald Waverider (comics) House of M Theodicy Quicksort Ecco the Dolphin Michelson-Morley experiment Congress of the United States Where No One Has Gone Before (TNG episode) Filipino American Special relativity Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Advertising Spells of Dungeons & Dragons Sarah Kerrigan Peter Singer United States Senate Items in the Metroid series British House of Commons Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Northern Lights (novel) The Fellowship of the Ring Australian Senate Priesthood (Mormonism) Immortality Chuck Palahniuk Leviathan (book) Neo (The Matrix) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Forum moderator Morse Code Peter Pan The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Presidential system The Queen of the Damned Super Mario Bros. 3
