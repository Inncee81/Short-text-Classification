what does the saying 'keep your friends close but keep your enemies' closer mean it just crossed my mind the other day you have to keep your friends close that means you have to look after them but not always they're not your children i mean you have to keep them close like you got their back at all times you have to keep your enemies closer because you never know when they'd stab your back or do something to humiliate you or make you feel bad this answer is what most people think i used to think the same way but i think this is more correct see you have to keep your enemies closer so that you will learn to live with them so you would learn to restore peace with them and if both sides are willing to make peace you can be friends with your enemies just like love your enemy as your neighbor if you know the story of the good samaritan that'll be helpful too Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Good Samaritan John Howard Yoder Samaritans (charity) Friends Kodocha Chu-Han contention A Course In Miracles Days of our Lives Social rule Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sicilian Expedition Sydney Riot of 1879 Patrice Lumumba Pitaten Current teachings of Prem Rawat Mystique (comics) George Harrison Goldstein's book The Ashlee Simpson Show The Pilgrim's Progress God of War Transactional analysis Friendship About a Boy Scientology beliefs and practices Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Kender Peace Baroque chess Incarnations of Immortality Ten Commandments Chess strategy and tactics Sub-Zero Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles Charmed Frontier in Space Socrates Goodness and value theory Shen Gong Wu Wolfrider Chess terminology Justification (theology) Evil Scenes from a Memory Hollyoaks Avenue Q The Brothers Karamazov Final Fantasy magic Priest (World of Warcraft) Good Times Professor X Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Bon Jovi The Invisibles Jacen Solo Love Kyle Katarn Parsifal Phoebe Halliwell Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Dog training Religious Society of Friends Zhao Yun Christian views of Jesus The Amber Spyglass The nature of God in Western theology Theory of conduct Timeline of alternative rock Richard Bentley Mojave people John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Kain (Legacy of Kain) Alexander I of Russia Sleeper agent Cliff Richard Athrun Zala Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Nasreddin Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Vernon Schillinger Saruman The Book of Five Rings Darth Revan Scarlet Witch Hannibal Encantadia Louis XV of France Chess (musical) Jacques-Louis David Julius Caesar Miss Saigon Married... with Children The Adventures of Pete & Pete Shannara creatures Lightsaber combat Jean Grey Lex Luthor
