what happened to spell check or at the very least grammer lessons does no one ever use the check spelling feature before they submit their questions i'm no genius but i'm sure that they have gone through some sort of schooling and should have practiced spelling no one seems to spell correctly anymore what with all the internet spelling or mis spelling that's taking place what do you think and then there's the scary way some posters seem to be combining text message style spelling with appalling syntax i make spelling errors sometimes but the way some people spell and write i can now understand how some english teachers end up as totally obsessed language freaks it's post traumatic folks colloquial english doesnt have to be totally lacking in style or grace sure write in colloquial englsih if you want to but its still gotta be understandable this is why we have a spelling standard that's a compromise between phonetics and history so we can have a consensus that people from varying backgrounds can learn to understand and read and write in regardless of whatever form or dialect of english you learnt as a child Havelock Vetinari Electronic Arts Tony Banks (musician) Thud!
