setanta sports and the reception ive had this for a month now so i can get epl and spl coverage picture quality excellent on a good day but total crap when it rains anyone else have the same problem its not my sky dish coz every other channel works just fine only setanta with the dreaded 'no satellite signal' if it does it during an 'old firm ' game i'l do my nut lol was looking forward to liverpools game but couldnt even see that i think that this is the make or break season for setanta if they want to be taken seriously as an alternative to sky but i was talking with my mate earlier and seem to remember sky going through this also totally agree though if it happens during and old firm match then the rage will descend Sky News Home Box Office Setanta Cup Sky Sports British Sky Broadcasting Cable television Satellite television High-definition television Freeview Communications satellite FA Premier League Scottish Premier League Celtic F.C.
