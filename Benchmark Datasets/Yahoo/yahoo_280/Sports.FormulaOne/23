hamilton vs alonso all of f fans saw what happened between this two top class drivers the question is which one is the best it's alonso really scared of this young talented rookie what made him act the way he did ok i see that nobody want to answer this so i'll tell you my point of view alonso signed with mclaren until but he didn't know what's going to happen he was supposed to be the no in the team the champion titles recommending him but hamilton was the real surprise he accomplished what no man did before consecutive podiums in his rookie season but than came nurburgring a race that you can't see too often but still hamilton fought till the and what i think is that hamilton should be the 'king' of f this season clearly he is more talented that alonso is he is for the moment much better than alonso as for the second question he has every reason to be scared he isn't anymore the no at mclaren the results say so not to say that he might not even be at mclaren next year why he acted that way i really don't know all i know is that jealousy can determine a man to act very silly and that's what alonso did a silly thing it's shame that two good pilots can't get along at a team like mclaren and i can wait the and of this season although i'm not a fan of hamilton or alonso and my team isn't mclaren i hope that hamilton will finish this season the way he started Fernando Alonso Team McLaren Ayrton Senna Michael Schumacher Kimi R__ikk__nen 2005 Formula One season History of Formula One Giancarlo Fisichella 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Scuderia Ferrari Juan Pablo Montoya Mercedes-Benz Renault F1 Jacques Villeneuve 24 Hours of Le Mans 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix Jenson Button Nick Heidfeld Emerson Fittipaldi Prost (racing team) Jordan Grand Prix Martin Brundle 2000 Australian Grand Prix Mika H__kkinen Penske Racing Jarno Trulli Bruce McLaren Mark Blundell Tiago Monteiro Jacky Ickx 2005 French Grand Prix Chris Amon Formula One 2005 United States Grand Prix Ivan Capelli Pittsburgh Steelers 2005 Australian Grand Prix Riccardo Patrese 2003 United States Grand Prix Nigel Mansell Boston Bruins Surtees New York Knicks Minardi New York Giants WilliamsF1 2004 San Marino Grand Prix Detroit Tigers Heinz-Harald Frentzen 2004 Formula One season International League Cleveland Browns Jackie Stewart Tony Stewart Chip Ganassi Racing 2002 Formula One season 2005 British Grand Prix Adrian Newey September 2005 in sports Los Angeles Dodgers 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix Seattle Mariners Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix Stefan Johansson Cincinnati Bengals Carolina Panthers 2005 Canadian Grand Prix Mario Lemieux 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix S__bastien Bourdais Mark Webber Jody Scheckter Buffalo Bills Red Bull Racing British American Racing Super Bowl XXVII Wayne Gretzky Oakland Athletics Shaggy dog story Florida Marlins I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Masten Gregory Toronto Blue Jays Playoff New England Patriots Keke Rosberg
