paintball gun i would like to have a longrange accurate gun without haveing to upgrade in s of dollars im thinking on a tippman or kingman spyder sonix i just want something that can shoot far accurate and not fire slowley any ideas this above answer is sketchy at most all markers do need to shoot under fps but the difference in somes stock barrel accuracy distance is pretty drastic anyone that can walk outside with a tippmann model with the stock barrel can shoot a few rounds then switch to say a evil driver and will instantly notice a difference but the buck doesn't stop there accuracy relies on the b's of paintball bolt ball barrel so an upgraded bolt with your barrel won't just help your markers efficiency but you'll gain some much needed accuracy good paint no cheap dimpled crap will fly much straighter and will have a far less chance of busting in the marker to answer your question both markers are good markers but the tippmann model is by far the better choice when it comes to its extreme reliability low cost and vast amounts of upgrades available tippmann is the only company that produces the flatline barrel system and after the fallout they had with wgp around k k with the flatline cocker they will never make another flatline system for any marker that doesn't have tippmann stamped on the side of it for distance these barrels use a back spin technology that greatly increases the paintballs distance and will flat out reach out and touch someone on the other side of the field but due to the model flatline kit they are too bulky for some peoples taste for accuracy and comfort i'd suggest sticking with a evil driver j j ceramic armson stealth smart parts progressive ect pbreview com has reviews over both of those markers along with the barrels and many other forms of gear that will help your decision take care Paintball Internal ballistics Airsoft Firearm Shotgun Natural Selection (computer game) Machine gun Rifle Floppy disk Sniper rifle M60 machine gun Krag-J__rgensen Carbine Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Mouse (computing) Tag Sniper Handloading Universal Century Technology SA80 Equine conformation Air gun Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Terminal ballistics B-47 Stratojet Toyota Prius Springfield 1903 rifle Heckler & Koch G3 Space Shuttle program Fast bowling SKS Lee-Enfield Bubble Bobble M82 (rifle) Revolver Nintendo Hubbert peak theory Motorcycle Cheating in Counter-Strike Blackjack Hard disk Transformer Economics Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Mossberg 500 Submachine gun .22 Long Rifle Shell (projectile) Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Craps Central processing unit Trench warfare Messerschmitt Bf 109 M1 Carbine Chevrolet Corvair engine High explosive anti-tank Artillery Anti-aircraft warfare Supply and demand Cartridge (firearms) Shotgun shell Ammunition Kammerlader Volleyball Wild ARMs 2 AK-47 Perfect Dark M2 machine gun Nuclear weapon design Colt Commando Starsiege: Tribes Bicycle lighting Sturmgewehr 44 T-72 Accuracy International AWM Archery M4 Carbine Zerg GLOCK Motion capture Golf club (equipment) Eyepiece Loudspeaker Suppressor Energy development Halo: Combat Evolved
