how to safely empty a paintball co tank i have a java oz co tank i think the guy who filled my tank screwed up and jammed or bent the pin someone told me i could fix it if i emptied the tank and played with it is there a way to do that safely at home i dont want the valve to explode or something it wont give the gun any air i said something right away the paintball field the guy let me borrow a rental tank for the rest of the day and they claimed it wasnt their fault that my brand java has faulty valves and they do that all the time java doesn't have as good of valves as say pure energy but still that pin shouldn't have done this without letting all the air out first just put a drop of oil on the valve where the pin is if it's leaking then move the pin with a small pick until it's straightened out if it will not air up the marker then something is very wrong with the tank and should be dealt with by a professional these tanks can't get very dangerous and i've had a valve shoot through a wall of out shop before so be extra cautious when handling the damaged tank for the cost of a new one though you might end up being better off just buying a new one take care and i'd seriously talk to the fields owner about the probelm Paintball Aerial (dance move) Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Hydraulic machinery Space disaster Diving cylinder Hand grenade Carburetor Apollo 13 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Carbon dioxide Seismic retrofit Flush toilet Gasoline Ammunition Tire Airsoft Attack on Pearl Harbor Nuclear power Thermal power station Professional wrestling throws Oxyacetylene Rebreather Rail terminology Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 M60 machine gun Circuit breaker Combine (Half-Life 2) Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 B-47 Stratojet Yohoho!
