good beginning skateboards i just started skating yesterday when i bought a piece of crap board from a fair for it took me about minutes to figure out that i needed a new board so what's a good beginning board for me the cheaper the better but i'm willing to pay what it's worth if it makes any difference i snowboard am and skate goofy and i've never touched a skateboard before now but so fair i've learned to kick turn do as much carving as this board will allow stop and do a manuel on my back wheels if that matters also there's a bc surf and sport that i'm considering buying from has anyone else done this what's their price range are their boards worth it and i don't care if you laugh at me for being female and i want to learn how to skateboard so i'm gonna do it ok well for a skateboard i say u just get a mini logo it a cheaper deck and some simple phantoms trucks there good and like flip or ricta wheels with maybe bones or flip hkd bearings that should be a good board for beginner the price should be about to dollars and im not laughing at u im and a gurl and skateboard no one shou ld really laugh at u anways Skateboarding Skateboarding trick Skateboard Roller skating Kitesurfing Rodney Mullen Monopoly (game) Z-Boys Wheel of Fortune Snowboard Wakeboarding Powell Peralta Rocket Power Steve Caballero Figure skating Artistic roller skating Inspector Gadget Violin Craps Inline skates Rugby union Backgammon United States dollar Dice Microeconomics Poker jargon Bicycle brake systems Aerial (dance move) American football Sport Go (board game) Skate punk Alan Gelfand Parkour Unicycle RuneScape skills X Games Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dominoes Jackass: The Movie Aggressive skating World Industries Ski Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Boot Wonder Woman (television series) Teen Girl Squad Surfing Windsurfing Chess strategy and tactics Reversi Quiksilver Tony Hawk Traumatic brain injury Mario Bros.
