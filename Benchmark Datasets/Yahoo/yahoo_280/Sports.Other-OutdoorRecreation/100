i want to incorperate high adventure sports into a career im thinking about writing for a magazine like national geographic any other ideas does anyone know what the salary for that would be most writers reporting on high adventure sports are free lance journalists who are paid by assignment this is even true for major magazines like the geographic only very few would be salaried staff writers as in any type of published writing the payment depends on the stature and circulation of the magazine and the skill and reputation of the writer so you could be looking at anywhere from zero payment to 's of dollars per article in a way it is like being and actor or a musician only the very best writers can support themselves well by only writing about sports most also have another type of related work as backup such as photography or guiding i have known two wilderness sports free lance writers who worked as manufacturer's sales reps for outdoor gear if you look in most magazines like national geographic and outside they will have little blurbs in the front of the magazine with information about the writers of articles in the issue reading those could help give you some ideas as to how they got to the level where such publications would hire them to write pieces it's important to not only be an excellent writer but to have an in depth knowledge about the sports you plan to cover to be willing to travel a lot at a moment's notice under often rough conditions and to be able to meet deadlines under pressure if this is something you really feel you could be good at it you should plan to take college courses in writing and journalism to hone your skills to build a portfolio of published work i would also recommend joining one or more local clubs for the sports that interest you surfing skiing climbing etc and then submitting articles about their events to their newsletters you won't get paid to start off with but they are usually happy to have free articles and it will give you a chance to get practice and to appear in print this will help you get jobs eventually also going to events like the mountain film festivals in telluride colorado every memorial day weekend and in banff alberta early november will give you a chance to meet some of the top people who write about extreme adventure sports it would be a challenging career if you've got the talent and drive for it good luck The Standard Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Minor league baseball Newspaper Adventure racing Plame affair Skiing Sports Illustrated National Football League Magazine Nintendo Power Screenplay Extreme Programming Microeconomics Yearbook Experiential education UK Singles Chart Copyright Education in the United States Education in Japan 2004-05 NHL lockout Education in the People's Republic of China Ming Pao Weekly newspaper GED Hunter College High School Peer review Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Public domain Charles Dickens Salary cap Electronic Arts Colorado Tax Columbine High School massacre Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution ELO rating system Trademark Boy Scouts of America Professional sports Oxford English Dictionary Publishing Mutual fund Equine conformation Air traffic controller HK Magazine Edmonton, Alberta Management Kyoto Protocol Car handling Am730 Game programmer Paragliding Boston College New York Giants Norway national football team Gliding Legal research Mountaineering Student loan RuneScape Inflation Transport Workers Union of America Science fiction magazine Michael D.
