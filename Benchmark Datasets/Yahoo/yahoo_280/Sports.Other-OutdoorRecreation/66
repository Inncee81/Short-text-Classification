when u are doing an ollie how do u get the back wheels off the ground skateboarding i have no problem getting the front wheels off but i can never get the back wheels off i have read instructions and watched people do it so many times but i still cant get it i have been practicing for a while now too the ollie is the root of most skateboard tricks it is the jump of skateboarding by popping your board and jumping you will get your board a little bit off the ground then by dragging your front foot up the board to the nose you will suck the board higher and even it out to be even with the ground this is usually the first trick you learn in skateboarding most people give up when they can't do it after a week but if you practice a lot you will be able to do it note notice how drag and dragging are bold this is because it is the most important thing in an ollie at least when you're learning place your feet as follows back foot on the tail with your little tow even with the edge of the board and the front in the middle of your board with the back foot quickly pop your foot down and snap it back up at the same time you are popping you should be dragging your front foot up the board as soon as your front foot reaches the front truck you need to put your back foot on the back trucks and push down the ground is coming so bend your knees the key word is drag you have to drag your foot up a lot of people just slam their foot as soon as they pop but you need to drag usually what happens is you learn to slam your foot down as soon as you pop i can't say enough about this because almost everyone slams you need to drag another common problem is when you pop sometimes your board doesn't get in the air because you didn't snap your foot back up you need to snap your foot back up as quick as possible this problem is easily fixable though from hear i can't tell you much more you have to practice practice practice if you're still slamming your foot and not dragging then you probably know that i feel like i'm talking to a brick wall or lamp post you need to drag if you want to get a higher ollie you have to pop quicker and drag higher on your board start small ollie hockey sticks around sticks is usually a deck high from there on you need to stack decks because it is easier to put a deck up then to put hockey sticks stacked up a good thing to start doing is ollie stairs like sets and 's and stuff like that try to ollie of high drop offs and don't be afraid try it if you have a chance that you could possibly land it remember the worst thing is not to try Skateboarding Skateboard Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Poker jargon Equine conformation Shaggy dog story Volleyball Professional wrestling holds Kitesurfing Drag racing Drill bit Diving Mouse (computing) Autogyro Wind turbine Suplex Grandview, U.S.A.
