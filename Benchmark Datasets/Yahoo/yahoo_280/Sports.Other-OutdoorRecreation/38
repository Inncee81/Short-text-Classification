my ak wont feed i think i jammed it with and g bbs but i unclogged the barrel now i have the regular rd mag and the winding mag but neither will feed into the system i uses g bb as the manual say and so i wont go back through the unjamming process if i hold the gun upside down it feeds perfect but the bbs wont go far but is it that the battery is low or i need to get the gun looked at to anyone in houston or around the area i have multiple airsoft wars anyone is welcomed with your choice of airsoft weapon my contact info is on my profile but my number is name is lc it's your magazine whenever an airsoft gun will only run upside down that's because there is not enough spring tension on the bb's in the magazine the reason it shoots upside down is it is gravity feeding check that your magazine is wound enough and if it's not tensioning there may be an obstruction inside that must be removed that means disassembling the magazine unfortunately when attempting this keep in mind that the bb retainer at the feed hole is gonna come out it consists of a small retaining catch and a spring don't lose this Airsoft M60 machine gun Paintball Internal ballistics Machine gun Paintball marker Air gun Firearm Anti-aircraft warfare Gas metal arc welding Carburetor GLOCK Shotgun Repeating rifle Movie projector Terminal ballistics Heckler & Koch G3 M249 M16 (rifle) Saiga-12 Krag-J__rgensen Iowa class battleship M4 Carbine Poker jargon Cartridge (firearms) M240 Gatling gun StarCraft: Uprising Fire-control system Ammunition Combine (Half-Life 2) Pump-action Revolver USS Vestal (AR-4) Energy development SA80 Indian Army Items in the Metroid series MG42 FN P90 Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Handloading Sten FidoNet M61 Vulcan Lewis Gun Glossary of climbing terms Second Battle of the Atlantic MG34 Columbine High School massacre M242 FN MAG Aerial (dance move) Bulletin board system Bofors 40 mm gun Overhead lines Field Artillery in the American Civil War Universal Serial Bus Gravity Irrigation Battle of Hampton Roads Worms weapons and tools Sawn-off shotgun Rifle XM8 rifle Textile manufacturing Browning Model 1919 machine gun AK-74 Patricia Ford Tank Nuclear weapon design Live action role-playing game Minigun Springfield 1903 rifle Heckler & Koch USP Blood Simple Sniper Diving regulator USS Wasp (CV-7) GunZ The Duel Credit card Heavy machine gun Bullet Artillery Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Marathon (computer game) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Opportunity rover B-47 Stratojet SKS RuneScape quests Wire wrap Dairy Blood (computer game) Bren Timpani GoldenEye 007 Cannon Armored Core
