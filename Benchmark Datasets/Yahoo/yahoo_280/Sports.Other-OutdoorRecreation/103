good brand of hiking boots i recently bought a pair of men's vasques size the women's didn't fit me well they are really comfortable shoes but when i hike it feels like my heel is pounding the trail i've tried heel inserts but they don't seem to make a difference is there a better brand of hiking boots or does it just depend on the person and the foot also is there a rule about how often you should buy hiking boots is it after your current pair wears out a friend of mine has had the same shoes for years and has patched them up many different times they seem to work but he's curious i do a lot of mountain hiking so this means steep paths and climbing over and up rocks i bought a pair of keen's and they blew out on my first trip both sides they were really comfortable but i wouldn't recommend them so i'm in the same boat of looking for a good brand i was told vasque was very good you might try a different style within the brand rei and also lowa you also might want to try a different style of women's because i'm sure there's a difference things like that can also depend on the weight of your pack and the way you pack it but it's true it always depends on the foot and the person i know you tried inserts but i was told that superfeet are really good by salesperson and friend they also come in different volumes so they can be different for each wearer it can completely change the feel of the boot as for how long a boot lasts i say if they're still comfortable and sturdy then they are still working and years it means they're pretty good quality Shoe High-heeled shoe Boot Glossary of climbing terms Strap-on dildo Trail Hiking Diving suit Mattress Equine conformation Cowboy Snowboard Menstrual cup Long Path Snowboarding RuneScape quests Mountaineering Brassiere Appalachian Trail Rei Ayanami Flip-flop Clothing Sock Ski Eddie Guerrero Iditarod Theory of conduct Slide Mountain (New York) Climbing equipment Skinhead Humphrey Bogart Mojave people Dr. Martens Jumpstart 3rd Grade Punt (boat) Shaggy dog story Yosemite National Park Bicycle Car handling Figure skating Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Shoe size Shoe fetishism Undergarment Gender role Stereoscopy Upholstery Marilyn Monroe Cowboy boot Make money fast Guadalupe Mountains National Park Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Professional wrestling attacks Platform shoe Sport rowing RuneScape economy Curling Francis Bacon (painter) Hot air balloon Dog agility Corset Backpacking (wilderness) Joke Hiking (sailing) Blonde on Blonde Denis Law Collecting fossils Milton H.
