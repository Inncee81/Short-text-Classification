what is a good hiking compass to buy i need to purchase a compass for hiking and i want it to be affordable but not a piece of crap any suggestions look for a large liquid filled capsule for the needle it will settle quickly get the kind with a plastic backing plate a bright color is always smart to avoid leaving it behind put a lanyard on it when in constant use you'll put it in your shirt pocket and make it long enough to go around your neck for the late night walk out to the bushes which is when many people get lost rounded corners are nice especially for women this way you can tuck it into your shirt when no pocket is available and it won't swing around banging an adjustable declination compensation is handy but if you do math in your head it is not needed and if you don't do precise work it is a bit extra consider this an advanced feature buck will get you a nice unit and for beginners a unit from silva works great avoid the lensatic engineer's and little ones Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Carburetor Craps Compass Poker jargon Textile manufacturing Knife Mattress Hiking The Inside Strap-on dildo Drill bit Clarinet 1957 World Series Internal ballistics 2000 Australian Grand Prix Upholstery New England Patriots Gramophone record Chess strategy and tactics Scuba set Humphrey Bogart Softball Shirt Sundial Violin Punch card Ayrton Senna Oscilloscope Glossary of nautical terms Animal Crossing The Amber Spyglass Weight training Fischer Random Chess Dice Plastic Professional wrestling throws Yohoho!
