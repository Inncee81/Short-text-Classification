should i get the vs paintball gun by kingman or the ' superstock select fire by wgp i looking to get a new paintball gun which one do u think i should get they're both good markers but totally different design wise the superstock cocker is a closed bolt pnuematic while the vs is a stacked tube blowback open bolt the cocker will be a great marker along with being fast thanks to the karni front block and ergo frame but when a break down occurs you'll have a lot more trouble fixing it than you would a spyder due to the cockers pnuematics design way ram and reg can go out of time easily and usually requires a tech or a skilled owner to get it back inline but when everythings tuned right the cocker is a serious force to go up against pbreview com has reviews over both of these markers my vote goes for the superstock but a backup marker just in case wouldn't be a bad accessory take care Paintball Paintball marker Airsoft Tag M1911 Ammunition Firearm action Machine gun Blowback (arms) Recoil operation Betting (poker) Final Fantasy magic Compiler optimization Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Heckler & Koch G3 Motorcycle M60 machine gun Cartridge (firearms) Repeating rifle Shen Gong Wu Chevrolet Camaro M16 (rifle) M2 machine gun Floppy disk Poker jargon Embedded system Israeli Gaza Strip barrier HTML element Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Seismic retrofit Shotgun Bolt action Gatling gun Bicycle Joe Cocker SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Dragon Booster American football strategy Lewis Gun Draw poker Mouse (computing) Sturmgewehr 44 M4 Carbine M4 Sherman Computer virus Natural Selection (computer game) Revolver Punisher Anti-aircraft warfare Wrigley Field Guitar Addressing mode MG42 Tribes 2 Mauser Handloading Lathe Suppressor Jarmann M1884 Rotary engine Transmission Control Protocol Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Air gun Unreal Table saw IPod Windows XP Beltway sniper attacks Mercury Cougar Extreme Programming Jet engine Oscilloscope Uzi submachine gun Speedloader USS Tunny (SS-282) Dog training Dog agility Sinclair ZX81 M1 Carbine Tank Team Fortress Classic Car body style Motorola 68000 Mitsubishi Eclipse Carbon dioxide Wrench Computer and video game genres Sniper Carburetor Wax bullets P-47 Thunderbolt Pulp (band) Gun safety Krag-J__rgensen Heinkel He 112 PlayStation 3 Nuclear power Circuit design Floyd Rose
