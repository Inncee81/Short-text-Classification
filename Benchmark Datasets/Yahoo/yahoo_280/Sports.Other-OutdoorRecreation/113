in lacrosse my mesh is hard how do i make it softer i want my mesh to be softer but not to soft if it is was then it would harm my throwing hey you can make your mesh softer in two different ways continually play practice with it or put it in water practicing with it is the natural way but it may take longer putting your mesh in water and then playing with it is much faster and easier to do so i would recommend this generally speaking mesh doesn't ever get too soft is does break in more but never that much in my experience the mesh almost always breaks rips before it is ever too soft i hope this helps Textile manufacturing Snowboard Knife Riemann integral Drill bit Violin Aikido Parachute Collecting fossils Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Manual transmission Alcoholics Anonymous Domestic rabbit Wood Sharpening stone Lacrosse Textile manufacturing terminology Recumbent bicycle WMGK Strap-on dildo Plaster Piano Adult contemporary music Trapping Electrophysiology Cross-country skiing Kitesurfing Skateboard Theory of conduct Microwave oven Religious Society of Friends Concrete Chinchilla Cheating in poker Dietary fiber Fishing Cheese Naruto jutsu Carburetor Etching Led Zeppelin Aerial (dance move) Diving suit Soft drink Volleyball Poker jargon Public domain Golf Snowboarding Katana Computer representation of surfaces Faster-than-light Clarinet Soft science fiction Floppy disk Musical terminology Table saw Polyurethane Mortification of the flesh Chewing gum Experiment Theodicy Die making Lead Hard water Blackjack Breastfeeding Car handling Alkane Tofu Upholstery Chinese martial arts Diving Marine aquarium Illegal drug trade Strike (attack) WTMX Sonic boom Flute Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Craps Cube (film) Hard drug Softball Bong Luck Najaf Esperanto as an international language Polymethyl methacrylate Seismic retrofit March (music) Hard science Cannabis cultivation WCBS-FM Internal ballistics Tenshinhan Solder Everwood Chair
