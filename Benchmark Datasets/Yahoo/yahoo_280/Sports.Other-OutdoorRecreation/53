if i was to take a boat and go find an island to camp on would it be illegal it depends very much on where you are and what's going on there in most parts of the country small islands are covered by riparian rights and are considered public property and accessible to anyone unfortunately that does not protect you from some ignorant person who does not understand the law and believes the island belongs to him and has a shotgun so it can be a little bit risky also in many places if an island is ten acres or larger it can be held as private property except for the banks or beaches which are covered by riparian rights laws the safe thing is to ask around at local marinas or even better call the county sheriff or the river patrol they are usually very friendly and helpful and will know other things like where the fewest snakes are and where the fish are biting for more information do an internet search on riparian rights and always use the internet before you choose a vacation destination search for local marinas campsites and government information before you go Public domain Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution Shark Property (ownership right) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Liberty Island Long Island Search and rescue CPU cache United States Bill of Rights Civil rights Police Grand Teton National Park Sheriff Freedom of information legislation Water police USS Tunny (SS-282) Theory of conduct Whitewater Politics of the United States Mount Sinai, New York Copyright Zion National Park Corporation Political divisions of the United States Democracy Trade union Elis Prefecture Copyright law of the United Kingdom Privacy UTF-8 Unlawful combatant P__voa de Varzim Discovery Bay Cairns, Queensland American Black Bear Separation of church and state Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Annuity American individualist anarchism Government of Ohio Gun politics Status of religious freedom in Iran Freedom of speech European Convention on Human Rights Territory of Hawaii Indian nationality law Easement Political subdivisions of New York State Refugee Trademark Counties of the United States Classified information Legal research Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Second Amendment to the United States Constitution USA PATRIOT Act Law Abortion debate Password Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 4 Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong War on Terrorism Arguments for and against drug prohibition Santa Catalina Island, California Separation of church and state in the United States Right Two Treatises of Government Marriage Copyright infringement of software Boy Scouts of America Freedom of the press Capital accumulation Shotgun Abortion in Canada River Virginia Beach, Virginia Lee County, Florida USS Atule (SS-403) Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Bras d'Or Lake International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Breastfeeding Mineral County, West Virginia Libertarianism Anarcho-capitalism Yosemite National Park Slander and libel Eminent domain Patent Property law Isle Royale National Park Tourism United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea Hiking Trust (Law) USA Barbados Pretty Good Privacy The Dukes of Hazzard Holes (book)
