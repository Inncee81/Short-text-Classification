you know how there is a united negro college what if what if the white people were to build a college just for whites would there be outrage from the black community calling us racist what would happen here i get what you are asking it's kind of weird that if you are proud to be black you are celebrating your heritage but if you are proud to be white you are a racist the race thing is just all messed up and it's tied into economic and social issues as well example black kids who do well on the national merit exam get access to a scholarship pool just for them which of these kids do well the rich suburban african american kids who went to good high schools not so much the poor ones who never had much of anything and could use a boost race issues are hopelessly complex i figure that the historically black colleges are there as an attempt to balance things out i have no idea whether it is working with regard to colleges i attended a college that was all white except for a handful of black kids who were all there on scholarship heck anyone who was in any way different from the crowd was there on scholarship i am a white girl who likes to paint and that was different enough to get me a scholarship the place was that whitebread so i'm thinking there are plenty of all white colleges out there they just don't advertise it as a feature Affirmative action Racism Black nationalism American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) African American Black (people) Scholarship Martin Luther King, Jr. Education in the United States Minstrel show Garth Brooks Race of Jesus Nation of Islam Humphrey Bogart Interracial couple Ohio Wesleyan University Negro White supremacy Aesthetic Realism Anti-intellectualism Paul Robeson Commonwealth of Nations Beavis and Butt-head Nelson Mandela Hank Aaron Boston Public Blacks and Mormonism Education in the People's Republic of China White nationalism National Merit Scholarship Racialism White flight Gross domestic product Ku Klux Klan Race and intelligence Harlem Renaissance African American history Racial segregation Class in the contemporary United States History of South Africa in the apartheid era White (people) EastEnders Race (U.S. Census) SAT Rhodes Scholarship Nigger Westminster School Fiddler on the Roof Southern United States African American contemporary issues Education in Romania Predestination Calvin and Hobbes New Trier High School Jorge Luis Borges Power Rangers The Simpsons School choice Community college Al Sharpton Moral Politics College admissions Nadir of American race relations Goodness and value theory African Blood Brotherhood Rich Mullins Vernon Schillinger The Human Stain American Civil Rights Movement (1896-1954) Miscegenation Ted Radcliffe Stuyvesant High School 2000 Australian Grand Prix Paul Newman Little Britain Black Panther Party Marcus Garvey Black Power Conservatism David Hume Robert Byrd Education in Germany Copyleft Richard Allen (reverend) Left-wing politics National Certificate of Educational Achievement Franklin D.
