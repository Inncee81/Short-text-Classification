does a hispanic male and a mix female look right i really like this mixed girl she's half black half white and she likes me to but she says she's had some bad history with interracial relationships she felt real uncomfortable with people staring and the mean thing they've said so do you think if we were out in public we'd be looked at alot i know most of you wouldn't but most people in general if your wondering she's caramel skin colored while i'm light skinned brown who cares if you guys care for each other and want to be together go for it and don't worry about what other people have to say there's always going to be someone saying something negative but you can't base your life on trying to meet other people's expectations and make them happy because if you do that then you'll be miserable my husband is mexican and i'm white and trust me people have stared at us but i don't care our love for each other goes beyond skin color hope this helps Interracial couple Jon Secada Social rule Marilyn Monroe Theory of conduct Avenue Q Care Bears Friends Humphrey Bogart Black (people) Pitaten Haven (TNG episode) Human skin color White (people) Time Out of Mind Multiracial The Emancipation of Mimi Knots Landing Polyamory Black The Fairly OddParents Kodocha The Ashlee Simpson Show Honey and Clover Fiddler on the Roof Rum Professional wrestling slang W.I.T.C.H.
