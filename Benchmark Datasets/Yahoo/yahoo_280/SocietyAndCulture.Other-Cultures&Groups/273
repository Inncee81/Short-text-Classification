are geisha considered to be prostitutes i am fascinated with asian culture and i have always admired the dedication of geisha's and the skills that they had they have had to learn things about politics current events music dance and other specific arts but a large portion of people have said that they were simply prostitutes does anyone know if this is true or not and where can i find that information also did the meaning of the term geisha just change over years and that's why they were considered prostitues no they are not in japanese society they are actually respected geishas differ from prostitues in the sense that they are more civilised and sophisticated escorts as opposed to sex workers eg they are trained in music singing art work etc not every geisha offers sex and not every customer wishes to hire a geisha for the sole purpose of sex Geisha Memoirs of a Geisha Prostitution Gender-neutral language Human sexual behavior History of sex Homosexuality in Japan Male prostitute Martial art Kylie Minogue Amateur radio Human Street prostitution Civilization Prostitution of children Hip hop culture Child sexual abuse Hentai Scientology beliefs and practices Western world Jazz Counterculture Sex worker Karaoke Japanese name Left-wing politics Sexual slavery Same-sex marriage Transgender Mail-order bride Gender Man Orientalism Asian fetish Call girl Consensual crime The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Strategic management Folk music Culture Constitution The Book of Five Rings Confucianism Yoshitoshi Serial killer Aesthetic Realism Sexual orientation Music Mojave people Child pornography Civil rights Software engineering Nudity Japanese war crimes Motion picture rating system Working class Workplace democracy History of theater Cutey Honey Popular music Social movement Kabuki Devadasi Objectivist philosophy Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Economic inequality Sociocultural evolution Secretar__a de Inteligencia Wealth Asian American Kanazawa, Ishikawa Antonio Gramsci Comfort women Death rock Prostitution in Germany Advertising Contract Glossary of partner dance terms Sento Sexual abstinence Prostitution in Japan Pornography in Japan Asperger syndrome Insurance Indus Valley Civilization Brave New World Phone sex Constitution of Japan Sauna Situationist Profession Homophobia Ukiyo-e Oral sex Irezumi Freeters Sex Kimono
