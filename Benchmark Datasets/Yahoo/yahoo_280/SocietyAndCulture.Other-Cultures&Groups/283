i have heard this comment a lot the true americans are the native americans not the europeans that came later could this statement be considered accurate for those who may find the question confusing it s not a semantic question it s not about who was here first or what native means as a personal comment it s not a statement out of fashion if you have had the chance to know innmigrant communities living in america who do not understand for example why everyone that is not white is labeled as xxxx american including natives who were irrefutably the first to inhabit this land giving the impression that these groups are an annex of the real american society hi yes that is very true the native american indians were the first people that lived here in the united states of course it wasn't known as the united states then but you know my meaning they were the first settlers to make our country their home or i should say 'their country' since they were here first and the europeans took it away from them realistically speaking of course go to your local library or the internet and look up the history of the native american indians quite interesting they were very proud people have a great day White (people) Indigenous peoples of the Americas South America Black (people) Hispanic Telephone numbering plan Slander and libel Languages in the United States Past teachings of Prem Rawat Social psychology Philosophy of science Philosophy of language Cherokee Colony Manifest Destiny Indian Wars Indigenous peoples Hearsay Reality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus North American Numbering Plan Native Americans in the United States Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) History of Ohio Race (U.S. Census) Plame affair Cultural relativism American Revolution Social rule French colonial empires Africa Logic Asian Latin America Bosniaks Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Falsifiability Lie Ownership Indian reservation Americas History of Texas Ontology (computer science) U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 History of the United States Multilingual State Existence Portuguese Creole Hindu Transcontinental nation New Caledonia English grammar New France British Isles Irish Rebellion of 1641 Quantification Reparations for slavery Donald Davidson (philosopher) Roswell UFO incident Multiracial Lenape England Seminole (tribe) Pensacola, Florida Atheism Indigenous Australians Ward Churchill History of Florida Ubykh language History of the United States (1789-1849) Fashion Ohio Country Population history of American indigenous peoples Inuit Republic of Texas Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Contract Modal logic Colonial America Pontiac's Rebellion Asian American History of the Americas Northwest Indian War German language Southeast Asia Demographics of Brazil Cree Fort Ashby, West Virginia John Titor Goodness and value theory War of 1812 Philosophy African American Western United States Native American name controversy American exceptionalism Indigenous peoples in Brazil Frontier
