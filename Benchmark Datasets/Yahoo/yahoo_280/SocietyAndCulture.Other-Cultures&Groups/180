are all thugs in gangs its funny how when you say the word thug people assume its a negative thing associated with gangs violence and ignorance but some people dotn even know half of what its really like being with a thug or knowing a thug they just assume what do you think imo not all thugs are gangsters and not all gangsters are thugs i have only known one gangster in my life and he was no thug again imo a thug and a gangster are similiar but not the same i know quite a few thugs but there are different levels of thugs just like there are of gangsters a bonafide gangster tends to be more discreet as does a true thug laying low some people who associate with them outside of their environment may not be aware that they are to some extent thay are the same they just operate on different levels a thug is you front line soldier while your gangster tends to be higher up the food chain i also think people confuse gangsters and gang bangers which are not the same those are just my thoughts Gangsta rap Gangster Gang Infantilism All Eyez on Me Thuggee Grand Theft Auto III Mafia Hip hop collaborations Gangster No. 1 Power (sociology) The Untouchables Cultural Revolution Max Payne EastEnders Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Aquemini A Piece of the Action Al Capone Beavis and Butt-head True Crime: Streets of LA Intelligence quotient The Usual Suspects Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Full Metal Panic?
