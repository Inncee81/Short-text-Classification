why do white people invade people's land why do europeans move out of europe and to someone else's nation and then subjugate and torment the native people and cause their starvation and misery europeans went to australia the phillipines almost every country in africa south america north america india and alot of places in between they even did it to themselves roman empire but white folks seem to hate being around other ethnic groups unless the group decides to join them and their society then they can tolerate them a bit what is so wrong with europe is it really that bad it looks fine to me except not as many natural resources yes people from other countries move to other countries i know all about immigration but the difference is that they leave countries with few opportunities and they don't try to completely destroy native people's homes and usually the countries were colonized or invaded beforehand by europeans what is deal just trade if u need resources why is it ok to steal bohmoron i hear alot of this theory that africans sold other africans but i don't think this was always the case because certain tribes would put hugeplates in the lips of their women so that they would look scary grotesque and would not be nabbed by portueguese invaders also some theories suggest that african kings thought they were sending people to be educated in europe and that they were tricked robert k africans did develop ships they sailed to the americas and traded with the natives of central and south america i read this in a book called they came before coloumbus by cheik anta diop also remember that the natives of polynesia macronesia and micronesia appear to be of african descent so that means thay they probably sailed there from africa there are also theories that african's often sailed to china and traded with the people there at least years ago mike is calling me stupid but has not backed up his claims at all i read and i analyze which i am quite sure mike does not just becasue you don't like what i have to say does not make me stupid oh and brillilant vocabulary mike idiot and stupid are such clever insults psf europeans have dominated of late but at one times africans were dominant one perosn here pointed out that the north african moors invaded iberia and ruled for years i believe that spain wa the one country that did not go into the dark ages because these africans brought education and universities and fresh ideas which means that yes this kind of invasion can be a good thig as well however what should a people do with that domination should they kill and destroy other culutres and people should they bomb other nations hiroshima nagasaki should they exploit people and take their natural resources and let the native people starve even with all this technology and advancement there appears to be a price the internet has been shown to be a danger to children factories cars trucks and airplanes pour out harmful chemicals into the environment convenience foods have led to obesity and heart disease entire animal populations are extinct ok i'm off topic now definatelymaybe yeah i know its in the past no you dont have to invade anyone but some of the governments will do it for you and you will reap the benefits see its not about you the indivdual you simply get to reap the benefits while others suffer you dont have to lift a finger and maybe i am reaping the benefits as well which i dont think is ok since i'm black and you know i should care about other black people in peril al r i dont believe that stuff about africans selling other africans because it too perfectly lets american off the hook for slavery and since publishers celverly omit certain things from school books concerning slvery such as the rape torture bdsm you know that bondage sex stuf sodomy pedophilia raping of lil boys the hanging of pregnant women the whipping of pregnant moms until their unborn babies fell out this was done for sport the fact they forbid slaves to read and write the fact that after church white folks would go watch people being lynched the fact that black people rebelled often and killed whites often the hatian revolution where african slaves rose up and defeated their masters and took over haiti led by denmark vesey and i could go on but for this reason i am skeptical about what i read in history books and on the history channel because so much stuff is left out and they act like slavery was fun and games i believe this has perplexed so many people you find yourself thinking until you can think no more that's all i have to say as we speak we are all trying to be assimilated into a method of self destruction and a sterile hostile planet that can no longer hold human life and still not much is being said mimi below me that was quite a selfish answer and i hope you know it Black (people) Slavery Atlantic slave trade Economy of Africa Guns, Germs, and Steel Reparations for slavery South Africa
