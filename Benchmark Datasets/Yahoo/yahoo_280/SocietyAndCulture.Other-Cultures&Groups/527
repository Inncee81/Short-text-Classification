will there be a possibility for people from around the world to love each other for their differences i think there is too much of hate and anger i came across this site http connectonone blogspot com do share your stories of love and connect with the rest it allows people to from different countries and background to come together and share their love for human beings from other countries i am finding it very important these days to feel love for every other human being across the world cultures are very different from our own from necessity i was reading how it was possible for muslims to have multiple wives with out the jealousy it is more like a father with his daughters than a husband and wife brought about by necessity because of so few men and so many women that made me understand it a lot better i do believe that answers is good if they would stop the hate and explain it so we can understand the culture instead of attacking our religion and society by saying your religion is bad we know different but by explaining their reasons for their culture i believe we could have a better understanding they were raised that way and it works for them wouldn't that be better than we hate you your religion and your country then immigrate here isn't that fostering hate for those people before they even arrive help us to understand don't just tell us you hate us Polygamy Religion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Human Marriage Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religion and sexuality Sexual orientation Patriotism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity God Simone Weil Supernatural Emotion David Hume Theodicy Iago Evil Salvation Animism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sacrifice Knots Landing Confucius Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friedrich Schleiermacher Philosophy Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Origin belief Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Predestination Family Mojave people Fundamentalism Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Deluge (mythology) Criticisms of Christianity Bosniaks Current teachings of Prem Rawat Aristotle Psychology of religion Kodocha Reincarnation S__ren Kierkegaard God Emperor of Dune Discordianism Bernard Williams Human sexual behavior Horus The Amber Spyglass Culture of Lithuania John Howard Yoder Confucianism Plame affair Rudolf Hermann Lotze Charmed Michel Henry Sola fide Polyamory Criticism of Islam Jean-Jacques Rousseau Sant Thakar Singh Eastern Orthodox Church Sigmund Freud Meaning of life Sexuality in Christian demonology Guiding Light Soul Rei Ayanami Social rule Goodness and value theory Immanuel Kant Merit Michael J.
