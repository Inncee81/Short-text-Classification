this is a little controversial but i'm going to ask anyway racisim do people find that in the media if a white person says something racist they are repremanded and shuned which is rightly so i'm completly against any form of discrimanation but if a non white person of any other race say's somthing racist against a white person they are no repremanded to the same extent i would love to hear opinions from everyone thanks i agree people are warped now into being hyper sensitive about a whtie person's racial outlook but they turn their heads when it comes to a minority's racial outlook not fair not right and something should be done about it and it should be televised on a reputable show like minutes oprah etc as for comics since dave chappelle and carlos mencia are equal opportunity offenders and it's soooo funny then the green light should be given to all comics to make fun of different groups of people regardless of the comic's own race however there is a condition both carlos mencia and dave chappelle make fun of everyone but it's well understood that they themselves are not being racist they are pretty much making fun of racism and stereotypes altogether any comic who wants to do that should be clear that they're not being personal when it comes to racial humor but that it's to make fun of racism and stereotypes altogether i personally don't believe for one moment that mencia or chappelle are racists because they married outside of their race and have children with their wives mencia's wife is caucasian chappelle's wife is asian they even say that all this racism is ridiculous hell they even make fun of their own race and it's hilarious bottom line i agree with what you're saying Chappelle's Show Racism White trash Nigger Dave Chappelle Minstrel show Our Gang Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn Asian fetish White (people) Joke Married... with Children Black (people) Race Media and ethnicity Scientific racism Blackface Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Racial segregation Ethnic issues in Japan Validity of human races Skinhead Race and intelligence Arab-Israeli conflict Sarah Silverman British National Party The Fairly OddParents Humour White supremacy Indian American Anti-racism Comedy Central Bertrand Russell I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Deadpan Racialism Nadir of American race relations White Australia policy Multiracial Sketch comedy Caucasian race Peter Pan Little Britain Affirmative action Late Night with Conan O'Brien Fictional character Porgy and Bess The Simpsons SpongeBob SquarePants New anti-Semitism Model minority Eddie Murphy Anti-Defamation League Blacks and Mormonism Bob and George Mem__n Pingu__n Racism in the United States Whose Line Is It Anyway?
