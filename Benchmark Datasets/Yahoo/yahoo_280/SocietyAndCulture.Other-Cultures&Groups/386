i was accused of being racist and it hurt a lot i work in a hotel and we were full tonight an older black couple came in at am and asked if we had any rooms we didn't and i knew that without having to look it up on the computer because i do all of the paperwork for the hotel anyways i apologized and explained that we are the only hotel this far west in omaha and without missing a beat they said they were going to call a lawyer and he would be calling us in the morning because we discriminate and then they walked out i for one enjoy making money so i wouldn't turn away any paying customer unless it looked like they were wasted and they were going to trash the place so why would they just jump to the conclusion that i was discriminating is there a mentality that midwest men are racist or something our part of town is not predominately white in fact there are blacks and latinos that work here at the hotel too and i have never come experienced this kind of situation before what do you think they only assumed that because you didn't bother to check to see if there were any rooms available they didn't know you already knew that there weren't any rooms left simple misunderstanding edit by reading some of these comments it's clear how most of you people are racist every black person doesn't scream racism whenever something doesn't go right Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Racism The Shining (film) Ann Coulter American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Have I Got News For You Shaggy dog story Little Britain Escape from New York Ethnic issues in Japan Vernon Schillinger Ocean's Twelve Satchel Paige Anti-Defamation League Make money fast Avenue Q Eddie Guerrero The Catcher in the Rye The Star Wars Holiday Special Late Night with Conan O'Brien Karl Rove Hal Trosky Piccolo Junior Saga Friends Black (people) The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Futurama (TV series - season 5) EastEnders Boston Public Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Plame affair Domestic violence Beetle in an Anthill Fancy Crane Martin Luther King, Jr. The Inside Humphrey Bogart Kasparov versus The World On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Alan Keyes Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Ron Weasley Pitaten Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Sin City Taxi Driver Leo Frank Reparations for slavery African American James Hanratty Rosa Parks Schapelle Corby Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Garfield Superman III The Emancipation of Mimi Daredevil Major League Baseball television contracts Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Howard Stern Montreal Screwjob Angel One (TNG episode) Blonde on Blonde Blacks and Mormonism Jean Charles de Menezes The Human Stain Equal Protection Clause Rent (musical) God Emperor of Dune Marilyn Monroe Russian joke Miss Saigon Eugenics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Nation of Islam Nadir of American race relations Jackass: The Movie Nigger Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Full Metal Panic?
