do the scottish really hate the english hi i was hoping to get some points of view on this especially from people who live d in scotland or who moved there from another country or scottish people who live there now the reason i ask this is because i am most probably going to be moving there sometime soon with my family and i am really worried about how i will be treated there as i am english actually my grandmother is scottish but they wouldnt be able to tell that coz i have english accent is it any different in city compared to small villages or is it the same all over i understand that it is a deep rooted thing dating back centuries but is it still a really big thing for the scottish or is it just overhyped in the media no one i know hates the scottish but the stories you hear about them hating us makes me worried i dont want to be treated differently just because i am english i hold no grudges in fact i love your country don't worry we aren't all like that to be honest i think its the english that over hype it i've seen posts on here from english people who have no idea where i live there are quite a few english people even my neighbours are english they had english flags up and they only got destroyed by weather people walk around with english footie strips on and nothing that incident in aberdeen was just a one off thing by some pr ck we don't all hate the english and as the corries sang its in the past now and in the past it shall remain i know a lot of english people that have come up here and now state they are scottish shame that they don't want to be indentified as english but its nice at the same time i've gone on a bit but just want to assure you that you can be english and live a normal life in scotland and won't be burned at the stake p scots lass's answer is also very good Scotland Scottish Gaelic language Theory of conduct Scottish English England Unreformed House of Commons English English Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Social rule Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Music of Scotland Mary I of Scotland Scottish National Party Avenue Q The Star Wars Holiday Special Regional accents of English speakers English language Shaggy dog story Phaedo Singlish Time Out of Mind Culture of Lithuania RuneScape quests Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an History of the British constitution Dualism (philosophy of mind) American and British English differences Little Britain Scottish country dance David Hume New Zealand English Elections in the United Kingdom Sydney Riot of 1879 Jennifer Lopez History of Scotland German grammar Rachel Corrie Aberdeen Infantilism Scottish Parliament Culture of Scotland Scrooge McDuck British Home Championship Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity United Kingdom Sexual orientation History of England Polyamory Wars of Scottish Independence American English Representative peer John Knox Stewie Griffin Scottish Civil War Battle of the Boyne Politics of Scotland Garfield Four Quartets African American Vernacular English Rangers F.C.
