why do the majority of black folks insist on being called african americans when we all know darn good and well aint a fraction of them ever even been to africa we never hear of a white person getting offended for being called white white people do not expect to be called german ireland americans or french canadian americans we know we are white and have no problem being called so i am no more prejudice or bigoted then i am a man fyi i am female and i too overlabel myself i refer to myself as german native american indian american in sarcasm of course because we as a politically anal people do overlabel my wife makes handmade cloth dolls faces are painted and each doll's hair is handmade and outfits are custom made she belongs to several on line doll making groups meaning no one knows where the other group members live race religion etc a few years ago a very skilled lady posted pictures of her newest doll which she called my beautiful black child lots of folks started flaming her calling her racist said they were insulted that she would so rude and crude to call the doll black instead african american they also flamed her for making the doll too stereotypical complaining the doll's broad nose fat lips the dark skin is too dark etc saying she was just mean since she making fun of african americans some even accused her of wanting to enslave all african americans because she named the doll my beautiful black doll this woman didn't respond to anything for a few days to let the furor die down then she responded i am black in my lifetime i have gone from being called a negro or the n word to being called colored to being called black which is still how i think of myself to being called african american she then added why didn't i or any of my friends or family get a choice on the african american name everyone i know thinks of themselves as black and i hate being called an african american i was born and raised in ohio calling me an ohio american would make a lot more sense and being accused of being racist the reason why that doll looks like a real black child with real dark skin fat lips broad nose is because i used my precious grandchild as my inspiration in creating this doll i think my granddaughter is the most beautiful black child i have seen so i made a doll to preserve how delightful she is at her young age then she ended her posting with this matter is closed i hope some of you have learned something by all of your nasty comments this is my insight i am not saying all african americans want to be called black in my job i work with people of all races and during the intake interview the government requires us to ask people which race or ethnic background the clients they belong to if we don't ask and document their responses the government will cut our funds this gives every client to tell me how they view themselves i don't ask them african american or black but just tell me how they refer to themselves in many groups there is a wide variety of how they liked to be referred to some examples african american or black mexican american or hispanic or latino or mexican native american or indian or their individual tribe a lot my clients tell me they prefer to be called an american i ask each individual so that i don't unintentionally offend them and this leads to a better working relationship with my clients Black
