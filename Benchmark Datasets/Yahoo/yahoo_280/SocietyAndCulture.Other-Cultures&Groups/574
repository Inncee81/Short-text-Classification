should i be discouraged or offended my ancestry is mixed african american and native american the term griffe describes a person with mixed negro and indian ancestry if someone calls me that should i be offended also i consider myself a black indian because of my dual ancestry and i acknowledge both parts should i be discouraged by african americans who think that i should just focus on black heritage alone and think it traitorous to focus on another should i be offended by the opinions of american indians who are narrow minded and think that there is no such thing as black indians and think that i am a wannabe please no silly or disrespecful answers i'm in the middle of a culture shock if you study much history you find that many times when a group of people become a minority that many people in the majority dislike or view as lesser that members of that minority are very strict in their estimation of who deserves to belong to that group for example i know some gay and lesbian folks who deride and call bi sexual folks bad names because they don't like it when someone can keep keep a foot in either camp so to speak and there are indians who are the same way somehow i'm mixed blood too it's apparently our fault for being born and not wanting to scorn half our heritage for the other half or for being happy that we are who we are not one thing or another just the descendants of people who weren't willing to let race change their decisions on who to love or have sex with you know it's said in some tribes that have a large number of folks with a percentage of non indian blood but the tribe still has a strong identity that when the first mixed race babies were born many in the tribe were for killing the infants of course it never happened because no one wanted to do the deed and those infants became treasured members of the tribe celebrate who you are and be grateful for all those ancestors who were smart enough to look past race when they looked at their beloveds and remember that most people don't think you're a traitor for being respectful to everyone who made you what you are just a vocal self righteous minority because mixed blood folks of every racial description really are the future Black (people) African American Sexual orientation White (people) Hispanic Multiracial Palestinian Afro-Latin American Creole Mestizo Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Race and intelligence Chinese Filipino Africa Abortion debate Voodoo One-drop theory Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Blood purity (Harry Potter) Zambo Gay Ethnic groups of the Philippines Music genre Marriage Indigenous peoples of the Americas Demographics of the Philippines Cherokee Pashtun Genealogical DNA test Affirmative action Indigenous peoples Native Americans in the United States African American literature Franz Boas Bisexuality Human sexual behavior Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Southern United States Caucasian race Demographics of Brazil Gay slang Arab Afro-Mexican Blacks and Mormonism Coloured Music history of the United States Gender role Shaggy dog story Child sexual abuse Race Ethnic group Theory of conduct Little Britain Western United States Equal Protection Clause Circumcision Louisiana Past teachings of Prem Rawat Curse and mark of Cain Anglican views of homosexuality Homophobia Massachusetts Afrikaner Tamriel Ex-gay Autism rights movement South America Ward Churchill Alan Campbell (pastor) Indian Wars Magyars Religion and sexual orientation Lamanite Wang Mang Gay rights Race (U.S. Census) Portuguese Creole Mu'allaqat Hip hop music Black nationalism Reparative therapy Bosniaks Homosexuality Creationism Internet troll Transgender A Course In Miracles Multiculturalism Asian American Childlove movement Delaware Infantilism Greeks Friends White nationalism Pedophilia
