ae abercrombie hollister not preppy come on they are so totally not preppy is ralph lauren lacoste banana republic and j crew preppy is a lifestyle of popped collars nantucket beach houses and classic clothing abercrombie hollister and ae couldn't be preppy if they were slapped with it true preps would never shop there if abercrombie was preppy you wouldn't see kids whose parents only make a yr wearing it who agrees with me im fifteen btw like you yourself mentioned being preppy is a lifestyle fashion and style don t need a name or a high price tag unless you know nothing of it looking for a brand name and setting that as a standard is telling someone who does understand fashion that you are someone who is going safe style does not have to cost a lot preppy is a lifestyle of popped collars nantucket beach houses and classic clothing you are making a great point about style being a lifestyle and the preppy look is a lifestyle but then you say you have to wear these companies to be preppy you are basically arguing with yourself i love the companies that you mentioned ralph lauren lacoste banana republic but you don t need to buy from those or abercrombie and hollister because if what your saying is true means that any unfashionable person can be stylish money does not buy fashion and if money buys the clothing the person who is wearing the clothing has to work the clothing buying and putting on the clothes is not enough i see people sometimes trying to look a certain way by dressing up in the style that corresponds with that and they look stupid because that person and the clothing don t fit the same puzzle anybody can just buy a brand to look preppy it does not matter what brand they still have to make it work for them self ps by the way i'm not preppy and i never even shopped from any of those companies you don't need a logo to look fashionable Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
