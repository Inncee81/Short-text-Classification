how come i only see japanese to japanese friends or korean to korean i mean i always see them in flocks and they seem to keep their circle to be in their own country like yellow asians only sorry if that is a rude term but i don't know how else to tell them apart from other asian countries does it have to do with their language do they feel more comfortable hanging out with a group that they can talk in their native tongue i would love to have some japanese korean chinese friends but they all look so rude and so it's hard to even start a conversation with them i am of japanese heritage and my sister in law is korean her family had some misgivings but it is a successful union until recent years koreans even outlawed all pop culture from japan to understand japanese people one has to understand the culture we did do alot of bad to alot of people i am not proud of it if i was japanese and not american i would be ostracized for saying that i am not proud of our japanese soldiers one man of political importance was even assassinated for saying we should apologize i don't suppose people who are not japanese would understand the way japanese people stick together as a point of honor but the chinese have also done their share of raping and killing of those who are weaker and as a rule many japanese bear no ill will for the raids and eventual a bombing of our country by americans apologies are meaningless in this respect empty words will not build bridges nor will it bring back the dead in short it's really just misgivings passed down to children for deeds long since done Korean language Anti-Japanese sentiment Japanese language History of Korea (1900___1950) Hangul Korea Martial art Japanese war crimes North Korea Asian American Chinese language BoA Korean War Love Non-native pronunciations of English Responses of Germany and Japan to World War II crimes Comfort women Knots Landing Japanese name Confucius History of Vietnam Manchuria Ethnic issues in Japan Theory of conduct Black (people) Culture of Japan Asian Korean name Korean people Chopsticks Zhao Yun Emperor of Japan Southeast Asia Native Americans in the United States Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Japanese history textbook controversies Contemporary culture of South Korea Khmer Rouge Korean adoptee Burma Campaign The Amber Spyglass Kim Jong-il USS Yorktown (CV-10) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Asian fetish Japan Hanja Spring and Autumn Period Standard Cantonese Culture of Korea Simplified Chinese character Go (board game) Family name Hongkonger Koan Sino-Japanese relations Han Chinese clothing Liu Bocheng Medal of Honor Excerpts from government-approved Japanese history textbooks Euphemism Chinese character Taiwan independence Demographics of Japan Multilingual History of Korea Hawaii Second Sino-Japanese War Buddhism USS Thompson (DD-627) Turkic peoples Donovan Kodocha Tianjin Dictionary Chinese calendar Customs and etiquette of Japan Japanese honorifics Brainwashing Mojave people Asymmetric warfare Phoneme Good Morning, Vietnam Indigenous peoples of the Americas Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Military history of the United States Vernon Schillinger Arjuna China Languages of Hong Kong Music genre Sub-Zero Given name Shinto Sin City
