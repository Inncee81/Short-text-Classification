do filipinos have a national identity while looking through the chapters of my history i see no trace of culture thats distinctly filipino do we filipinos have an identity that could identify us a race well there's the indigenous culture and the colonial culture they're all mixed up they say the true filipino is based on the indigenous heritage there are at least a hundred indigenous tribes in the philippines maranao maguindanao igorot tagalog visayan etc some say the true filipino race is malay but the first filipinos aborigines were aetas pygmies however when the spanish and americans colonized the philippines they changed the cultural and political institutions so that they introduced the american public school system and spanish catholicism many filipinos have an identity crisis in that they cannot appreciate their indigenous heritage because the colonists spain and america taught them that their original culture was inferior to western culture but if you examine original filipino culture and tradition their art and music and food and religion and values of respect for nature and god and people and objects and overall what they value as good and moral you find that their filipino culture is very rich and beautiful Philippines Demographics of the Philippines Ethnic groups of the Philippines Filipino people Black (people) Filipino American Mestizo Chinese Filipino Languages of the Philippines Music of the Philippines Hinduism in the Philippines Filipino language Colonial mentality Indigenous peoples Southeast Asia Philippine-American War Spanish in the Philippines Religion in the Philippines Hispanic Culture of the Philippines Creole Bukidnon History of the Philippines Manila Tagalog language Indigenous peoples of the Americas Hispanic culture in the Philippines Spain Bisaya Eskrima Filipino Muslim Culture Latin America Literature of the Philippines South America Ateneo de Manila University Philippine peso Benguet Pinoy rock European colonization of the Americas Military history of the Philippines Mexico Portuguese Creole Spanish colonization of the Americas Family name Spanish Creole Nationalism Cebu Philippine Revolution Agusan del Sur Iglesia ni Cristo Hindu Hawaii Colony Malaysia Multiracial Black Legend Latin American music Sociocultural evolution Conservatism Native Americans in the United States Philippine mythology Mindanao Ilokano language Africa Negrito History of Mexico Languages of Hong Kong Genocides in history Canadian nationalism Visayan languages Population history of American indigenous peoples History of the Spanish language White (people) Cuisine of the Philippines Multilingual Colonisation Taiwanese aborigines Mission (Christian) Indigenous peoples in Brazil Culture of the United States Native American name controversy Laguna province M__ori Bosniaks Philippine Independent Church Christianity in Korea Anthropology History of the United States (1865-1918) Coloured Mount Pinatubo Colonial America Patriotism North Africa Slavic peoples
