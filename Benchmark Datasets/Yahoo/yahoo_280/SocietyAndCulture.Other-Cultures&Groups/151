what do other people from other countries really think about americans just wondering if everybody really hates us because of what our president is doing and do they realize we hate our president too hi i work in new york city in my line of work i meet a lot of people from foreign countries especially countries in europe over the past years in this line of work exposed to different people i have found that just like americans people from other countries can be nice interested in the country they are visiting and it's people or again just like americans they can be hostile closed off and disrespectful of the country they are visiting and it's citizens the question you are asking begs for a generalized blanketed one dimensional answer there are people who hate americans and other nationalities i'm sure and they've hated us long before president bush was on the scene he's just the icing on the cake for america bashers also there are plenty of people who understand that just because he's the president doesn't mean that we all like him i'd have to say that anyone who's going to hate you because you're american is not worth meeting anyway concern yourself with friendly open minded life loving people who you can share your culture with and hopefully share theirs as well W.I.T.C.H.
