why do some people want to be something they are not i know a white lady who pretend to be a little bit black she'll say maybe black but she doesn't know for sure her brother says that they have american native american but not black why would she want to be black i know for some reason she hates white men and prefers bad boy blacks not the ones with good jobs she gets abused by these men she chooses i know white men also i have told her that she can admit to being a white woman who perfers black men but she insistes on trying to pass for black i meant to say that white men also abuse i swear that i am not a bigot i am not against anyone of a different raise i just don't understand why a person feels the need tto try to be someone they are not she might have some personal issues associated with being white i know a white girl who pretends to be hispanic she fakes an accent and everything she was verbally physically abused by her parents and most of her friends were hispanic so i think she feels some envy for their life dk maybe this girl likes black men and feels that she has to excuse it by saying she is part black or maybe she has bad history with whites for whatever reason the grass is always greener on the other side EastEnders Transsexuality Knots Landing Friends Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Butters Stotch Mojave people Kodocha Social rule Humphrey Bogart Nation of Islam The Catcher in the Rye Little Britain Good Morning, Vietnam Theory of conduct Ranma __ characters Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Fairly OddParents Kender Trainspotting (novel) Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Domestic violence South Park Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Infantilism W.I.T.C.H.
