is there some reason why uk people keep getting in the american section it's okay most of the time but occasionally there are cultural topics or things that they just don't understand did they just get accidentally re located i've been re directed to the uk section unknowingly after following certain questions or are they doing it on purpose i'd just like to point out that i'm not trying to be mean or racist to english people hell i'm part british myself i was just trying to figure out what was going on i have some norwegian ancestry just showing some pride in my background i do not live there though some questions automatically post to both areas i've seen people from the uk asking why americans invade their section of yahoo answers the same way we did iraq that one really made me angry and i'm not so easily flustered there's an option to filter out questions from people in other countries by just choosing to see usa questions rather than all english questions i'm pretty sure people in the uk have the same option but honestly why should they we have to being from a certain country or culture isn't necessary for participation here the only requirement is speaking the same basic language which we do besides this is a perfect way to learn understanding and to help someone else understand we can all benefit from these crossovers if we so choose Theory of conduct Singlish African American Vernacular English German language English grammar U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 The nature of God in Western theology English language Whose Line Is It Anyway?
