this is a question for wiccans or pagans please i am so very intrested in your belifs i have always felt a lack of a better work witch at heart i have experienced a power of some sort i would like a guiding hand where should i start i would like to do this the right way i don't know much but can you tell me a little about your path and how you got where you are today thank you so very much witchcraft is a belief system based on the practice of magic and it is also a spiritual enlightenment some practice only one most do both you can also be born a witch usually with psychic powers or witchcraft family traditions but those are rarer witchcraft the craft is designed to work with the universe to achieve goals like healing or punishment or love witchcraft the old religion is to achieve personal enlightenment i have always worked for both ppl who are witches usually have some contact with the other worlds since they are children like seeing ghosts or pre cog or other psychic abilities however witchcraft is a skill like praying or gardening it is not associated with any religion per se you can get burnt as a witch regardless of your faith i know some jewitches some islamic witches and esp xian witches that said witches are usually perveyors of the old religion that is the folk traditions of native ppls of the area in question like native celtic or norse nowadays they are often called 'pagan' or earth based religions reclaimists and many neo pagans actively work to recover the lost knowledge and practices of their elders and therefore do a great deal of research on folklore although most of it was lost with the often forceable conversion to xianity and islam much of the folk traditions we see today all over the world are handed down from ancient times http paganwiccan about com od wiccaandpaganismbasics a wwpdiffs htm witch the practice of witchcraft is not associated with any religion therefore you can be a witch and yet also be a member of any number of religions or none using the natural energies within yourself along with the energies of herbs stones or other elements to make changes around you is considered witchcraft though the skills and gifts that are part of witchcraft can be inherited from parents or grandparents you aren't automatically a witch just because your grandmother may have been one the use of magick takes practice experience and learning on a side note a male witch is called a witch not a warlock wiccans are usually witches but witches do not have to be wiccan thank goodness one of the biggest sore points among wiccans is the improper usage of the terms wiccan and witch too many people use the terms interchangably presuming that they both mean the same thing they do not wiccan wicca is a religion and someone who follows that religion is called a wiccan sometimes it can be difficult to accurately define wicca and not all wiccans will define themselves the same way observing the wiccan sabbats honoring the gods and or goddesses creating sacred space for rituals to name a few typical wiccans also practice magick and therefore are also witches witches are low magic practioners usually specializing in herbal and natural healing both physical and mental solving family and tribal issues like finding lost articles weather prediction and the like they are usually women and also known as priestesses of the old religion which they often were wizards are high magic magicians they specialize in ceremonial magic such as the kabbalah or key of solomon they are the cape hat wand sword and dagger crowd they are usually male most witches don't need to start practicing witchcraft they always have done so however like any skill we learn by doing experiementation speaking to others and reading there are many ways to increase efficacy of spellcraft including focus research mediation symbolism of both words and tools i am a witch from a witch family who lost the belief system and ritual structure if they ever had it and have certain abilities like prophetic dreaming which is passed on in a legacy format when someone dies i have been a practicing witch all my life and was dedicated when i was years old i have chaired a seance with correct answers coming forth unbidden i have felt presences and asked them to remove themselves when i became frightened including my own grandfather stupid that i have led guided meditations since i was a child had a few veriable pre cog incidences practiced divination and had weather affinity and magic before training i have heard the distinct thoughts of others on many occations including those far away but those are rarer there are many websites to help you increase your skills and aid in your spirituality http www witchvox com http www witchway net
