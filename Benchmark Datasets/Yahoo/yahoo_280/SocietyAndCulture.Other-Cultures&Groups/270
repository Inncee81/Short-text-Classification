we must assimilate to be an american i noticed that some people whether on this site or in the real world feel that we must all be the same in order to be considered an american now don't get me wrong i don't object to getting an education having a succesful career and being a just law abiding citizen but on the same side we should not discriminate against others who feel that this is not the way of life they wish to choose providing of course that the way of life they choose is not harmful to themselves or anyone else i see alot of you are getting quite hostile in answering this question everyone knows that there must be a certain degree of assimilation to servive in america as well as other countries what i'm asking is how far should that assimilation go should we just drop our beliefs and cultures all together in order to go along and get along i re read my question and can see how some of you thought i was taking a stance on immigration and are attacking me for this supposed stance well fine i can not change your minds and opinions especailly since i can see none of you in person to express what i am truly trying to say in a way that you could better understand it but hey at least i'm getting the answer to another question i was going to post to some degree one has to deal with the common ethos work study family tolerance et cetera in order to fit in but that does not in the least mean that one should abjure one's original culture the art music clothing and other cultural features of many lands enhance the american cultural landscape to the benefit of us all Sexual orientation Abortion debate Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Liberalism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Epistemology Fundamentalism Same-sex marriage in Canada Art Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Evil French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Coercion Same-sex marriage Franz Boas Melting pot Psychoanalysis Bernard Williams Cultural relativism Goodness and value theory Internet troll Postmodernism Jew Patriotism U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Belief Ludwig Wittgenstein Ethics Alignment (role-playing games) Republic Contract Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Deconstruction Soul Homophobia Atheism Reparations for slavery Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Objectivist philosophy Democracy Religion Philosophy of mathematics GED Transsexuality Arab-Israeli conflict Tai Chi Chuan Ten Commandments Aesthetic Realism Judaism Anti-Americanism Transactional analysis Economic inequality Polyamory Socrates Peter Singer History of British nationality law African American Vernacular English Zionism and racism Childlove movement The nature of God in Western theology Bosniaks Meaning of life David Hume Civil rights Psychology Metaphysics SAT Scientology beliefs and practices Creation-evolution controversy Reality Human sexual behavior Legal aspects of transsexualism Talmud Animism Simon Commission Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Freedom of speech Discordianism Merit Human Appeal Modernism Law of Return Bertrand Russell Religious conversion Opposition to cults and new religious movements Racism Social psychology Parapsychology Simone Weil Jewish denominations Infantilism Commonwealth of Nations Jewish principles of faith Canadian identity Culture of the United States
