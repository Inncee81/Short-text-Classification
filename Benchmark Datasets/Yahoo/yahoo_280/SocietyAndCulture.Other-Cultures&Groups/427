why do taller people get treated with more respect taller people intimidate the shorter ones i am pretty tall myself but when i am talking to someone taller than me although i don' t want to there is subconscious awareness of their height and presence in an intimidating sort of way i had several difficult bosses over the past years and whenever they would come with idiotic requests i would get up from my chair knowing that i was taller and they would immediately change their attitude it's unfair but it works and if it works for a tall female imagine how much better it works for a tall male Heightism Milton H.
