how do the muslims and the christians get along in albania i realize it was a communist country for a long time so i am just wondering if they are affected by their religious differences much or not ethnically i am part albanian my family was orthodox but i have converted to islam so i find albania quite interesting but have a hard time coming across good info on it most albanians i run into claim to be italian lol i'm not going to give you a thumbs down say what you will i find it disturbing to see smile down their with the smile avatar and the kitten avatar the other day such filth comes from his mouth and yet he calls him herself smile shudder so here is the low down from someone who was just there well kosovo anyways the muslim community in albania and the balkans in general is very modern and non fanatical although you do see some very strict muslims it is nothing like the middle east the slavic races in the area the ones who are orthodox christians tend to get along with them just for that reason at least that is the impression i got after being in kosovo for a year that being said kosovo was more of an economical war and not a religous war however it would deffiantly appear so long story short christians and muslims do get along there are fanatics on both sides which would like to see the other suffer but hey thats life funny you should say something about albanians pretending to be itallian ive noticed that too to the religon hater up there you mispelled ignorance Albania Kosovo Balkans Albanians Demographic history of Kosovo Bosniaks Republic of Macedonia Pri__tina Kosovo War National awakening and the birth of Albania History of Albania (1919-1939) Greater Albania Epirus Timeline of Albanian history to 1993 Serbia History of the Balkans Ottoman Empire Caucasian Albania Montenegro Macedonians (ethnic group) History of Ottoman Albania Unrest in Kosovo History of Albania Military history of Albania during World War II Greater Serbia Persecution of Christians Population transfer Fundamentalism Greece Islam in Albania Bektashi Serbs Macedonia (region) Foreign relations of Greece Islamic world Yugoslavia Turkic peoples Sand__ak Music of Albania Assyrian people Religion Kosovo Liberation Army Prizren Germany Kor____ History of Islam Bulgarians Skopje Europe Greeks Albanian language Durr__s History of Bosnia and Herzegovina Mother Teresa Ethnic cleansing Eastern Orthodox Church Bulgaria Judaism Middle Ages Enlargement of the European Union Jews in the Middle Ages Christianity Ismaili Religion in Israel Nagorno-Karabakh Zog of Albania Samaritan Education in Albania Tetovo Gorani (Kosovo) Byzantine Empire Sharia White (people) Battle of Kosovo Origin of Albanians Sectarianism __am__ Eastern Europe Africa Religious pluralism Abrahamic religion Persecution of Muslims Islam Bosnia and Herzegovina Origin of Romanians Skanderbeg Ethiopia Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina History of Italy as a monarchy and in the World Wars Islam as a political movement Khazars Gospel of Barnabas
