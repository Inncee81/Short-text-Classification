are their cliques in college this h s bs is gettin to me better not be like this in college it depends on what type of college you go to a place like nyu doesn't have cliques the greek scene is very small and has no bearing on the college whatsoever other colleges are almost all greek life a place like clemson u is almost all greek they have their own villages of housing for them even and then there are some like binghamton university that have both greek life but it in no way runs the school in that kids are in cliques kids have their particular group of friends but it's a much more mobile scene between kids part of researching colleges is to research the social scene within and outside of the college you want to find a place that suits your social needs as well as your educational needs there's a saying that college education is classroom and social as a college grad i can say this is absolutely true your ability to thrive in the academic setting in a place of higher education will depend on your ability to feel comfortable and happy in the social setting because chances are that you will not be living at home and learning how to manage your life on your own good luck with high school i promise it gets better what i found to be so interesting about going to college is that many of the popular kids in high school are not so much in college becuase everyone is in the same boat and because most college house tens of thousands of students it's damn near impossible depending on the size of the school for that specific in crowd to exist you'll find your niche in college both personal and socially speaking it's amazing i still go to my alumni weekends every year because college was just that amazing for me i made my own little family up there that's how awesome my college friends are and how much they mean to me Graduate school Education in the United States College Pennsylvania State University New York University Carnegie Mellon University Clemson University University of Houston University Education in Japan Georgia Institute of Technology Education in Germany Grade (education) University of Central Florida Saved by the Bell Florida Institute of Technology Juris Doctor SAT Damn Yankees American University Johns Hopkins University Fraternities and sororities Merrimack College Wabash College University of Virginia GED Students' union Secondary education in the United States College and university rankings Education in the People's Republic of China Columbia University High school subcultures University of Massachusetts Amherst Education in Romania University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Duke University Friedrich Schleiermacher Binghamton University Alpha Phi Auburn University Ohio Wesleyan University Quizbowl Multilingual Homeschooling University of Alabama The College of New Jersey University of California, Santa Cruz University of Texas at San Antonio Rice University Virginia Commonwealth University Education in Australia University of Bristol Trinity College, Dublin Washington State University Culture of the United States University of California, Los Angeles Florida State University University of Canterbury Indian Institutes of Management Higher education High school School Experiential education University of Szeged University of Connecticut University of San Francisco Theory of conduct Drama Ivy League Academia North Carolina State University Stern School of Business University of Southern California Scientology beliefs and practices Education in Singapore Gifted Baylor University Affirmative action University of Maryland, College Park University of Michigan Education in Taiwan Chinese University of Hong Kong University of Chester Clique University of California, Berkeley Tripartite System University of Tennessee Otterbein College Syracuse University University of Bath Ateneo de Manila University Rudolf Steiner Franklin W.
