i was wondering if anyone else find this depressing people usually young people i am thinking posting questions stating that they didn't read this or didn't complete that math question and could some one give them the answers in a hurry because it is due the next day is it just me or have the kids today gotten lazier in my opinion not only don't they want to do their homework and have some one else do it for them but they want want want everything else to be handed to them too it is like the world owes them just for existing i realize that every generation has these types of people but is it just the advent of the internet that makes us realize how many of them are out there or are there more today than ever before i think tomorrow when it becomes feasible i will choose the young lady for the best answer as she epitomizes the need for learning i think that is horrible and technically considered cheating homework will mean a whole lot more to you when you are a mature adult but by that time you will be regretting that you didn't want to learn i'm and i love doing my homework i'm not a nerd or anything but especially when you get something challenging it's so worth it when your hard work pays off x carrie Theory of conduct Asperger syndrome Shaggy dog story Education in Romania Humphrey Bogart Calvin and Hobbes Saved by the Bell Singlish Procrastination Darth Vader Nerd GED Test (student assessment) Past teachings of Prem Rawat FoxTrot Mathematics Sampling (music) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Controversies in autism God Emperor of Dune Karl Rove The Adventures of Pete & Pete Socrates Current teachings of Prem Rawat K' Cliff Richard Mutual fund Piccolo Junior Saga Simone Weil W.I.T.C.H.
