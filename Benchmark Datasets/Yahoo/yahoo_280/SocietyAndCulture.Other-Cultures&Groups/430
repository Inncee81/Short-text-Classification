whats your opinion of iraq and have you been there i always read all this stuff about outside people giving strong opinions and they have never been there to really experience what they are talking about st of all i have been to iraq i spent months their earlier this year i was with a reserve unit in northern iraq which is considered kurdish territory the american people are not getting the true feedback about what is happening over there we have made a lot of progress and pulling our forces out of there would be a complete disaster every day i read the news i hear how many soldiers died they keep track of the number since the start of the war we have more people killed in holiday traffic accidents for the magnitude of the war we have had the least amount of troops killed than in any other was in history the people in iraq are poor and only have about a percent litercy rate this is the result of the type of dictatorship they were under for so many years i had a chance to visit a lot of the villages the people are poor very few material items most houses don't have running water open sewer pits are common about every block electricity is a luxery and those that may have it only have it a couple of hours a day children play in the street and around dangerous areas most roads are not paved sheep herding is common when you travel around its like visiting back in biblical times hygene is almost non existant compared to western standards if we pulled our efforts out in six months it would take billions and billions of dollars and ten to years just to fix the social and economic problems that exist i seen some politicians that visited while i was there these bastards cause more hate inconvenience and uprest than you can imagine they show up unexpected causing soldiers that need the flight to go home or get medical help to delay the army has to pull their troops back and form special protected convoys with all the best armored equipment just to protect these politicians and it causes overall discontent and lowers morale among the troops dod has to bring these politicians over just to try and convince them that what we are doing is critically needed the entire thing is a joke and causing the american taxpayers millions to add insult to injury these politicians bring their own group with them including their spouses at times so they can go on a shopping spur on the way there and back its very sickening and field commanders have to really bite their tongues and put up with it while there folks are there visiting they don't go where the action is and don't visit the children and villages they stay behind the wire inside compounds and take up everyones time and resources catering to their rediculous needs if you want the real scoop on what is happening and what needs done ask the field commanders and troops the spell check on yahoo takes to long so i'm sending as is take care savvy Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New
