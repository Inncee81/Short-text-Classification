will there ever be a time when we can walk down our streets and feel secure hahaha no i am not a ghetto child lol i live in a good area but i don't feel comfortable even walking down my own street there was a time and it wasn't long ago that few in the us felt the need to lock their doors and kids were able to run all over without fear of somebody snatching them what changed is too much law and the loss of some key elements of core us society the war on drugs was a war against the us people and it turned cops into the bad guys not that they really needed much help in that area since the late s law enforcement in the us had become increasingly brutal and repressive against the poor until the s it was also often repressive against various ethnic religious and other societal groups today they just pick on the poor this produces a backlash that is exibited in many ways class tension increased violence and crime and most of all a loss of respect for the law the mph speed limit completely elimanated any respect the us public had for the law corruption from top to bottom has been the norm in us politics and it's become more and more open clinton literally sold us technology to china in what amounted too an open bribe bush's crowd is getting quite rich off the war in iraq nothing to do with oil the gov contracts and the way they are parceled has been a bonanza for bush's cronies gore got caught red handed taking bribes from the chinese and scooter libby should have been tried for influence buying not lieing under oath nixon reagon carter all cabinets full of corruption scandal nixon was unseated by the watergate scandal reagon and bush sr nearly undone by contra gate and a few other scandals hilary got busted with fbi files on personal enemies of the clintons what bigger abuse of power could there be nobody has faith in our institutions any more and for good reason the cops are frequently busted in theft rings or worse the politicians are openly corrupt and might as well paint a dollar sign on their face the courts could care less about guilt and innocence and dispense gross injustice more often than they get the right guy people go to prison for life for having bags of pot but a guy molests children and gets probation with a system like that how can you respect it once there's no respect then why abide by the laws if your going to get blamed for something or another why not at least do some crime somebody once said the only true law is one that leads to freedom and they were absolutely correct there are too many laws too many cops too many crimes and too much gov in everybodies biz when left alone most people are decent folk given a chance to make something of thier lives and a good environment they will ethnic centric ghettos breed crime and distrust of other ethnic groups many groups in the us have come to reject the american values that is they do not subscribe to the strong work ethic and value of education that is core to the american values they don't subscribe to the traditional american live and let live system they want to ban everything force people to live like they live there is little tolerance today if you are different at all you are attacked for those differences that's not the american way the melting pot has been our ideal sure america's never been perfect about it and has it's shameful periods when one group or another was mistreated overall though america has led the world in tolerance and spread it across the globe to all who'd listen another huge problem is we look at each other and we don't see americans we see skin color religion political party affiliation and a host of other dividing factors we are smokers or non smokers we drink or don't drink even the type of music we listen too can create divides when those happen we don't look out for our fellow american because they are not one of us any more they are x group outsiders if they are not one of ours then we don't feel responisble so people don't help when something bad happens they drive on by they close the curtains and look the other way sometimes they might even join in the riots in watts were a great example not only was anybody not black targeted despite people from all ethnic and social groups down at the police station protesting each of the affected groups rarely tried to help each other hispanics looked after fellow hispanics asians looked after asians by doing so it left these groups divided and outnumbered in the area of the riots few blacks came forward to help people of other ethnic groups somehow we ceased being americans and have splintered into a thousand different groups another factor is the huge number of ex cons produced by the war on america the us has imprisoned people like no other nation in history and the prison culture has invaded the mainstream you hear it in rapp lyrics country songs even in other music genres people live out in the world like they were still in prison there the rules are very different and much more violent the lack of rehabilitation and the large concentration of ex cons in poverty stricken areas just assures an endless cycle the last factor is so few people are armed and or willing to use force today recently two unarmed criminals forced their way into a doctor's home think about that a moment they were so assured that the victims would be unarmed that they brazenly entered these people's homes without a weapon themselves all it'd taken was a single gun crossbow or other ranged lethal weapon on the vt campus and the first time the shooter reloaded he'd never lived to kill more students this dependancy upon others to protect us puts us at risk and invites the predatory elements in our society it's like leaving your keys in your car people walk by and are tempted by the vulnerability people that wouldn't normally think about stealing a car the lack of self sufficiency in america has invited violence upon ourselves there is no fear those who wish to do evil fear only the inefficient cops who might or might not catch up to them look at how many unsolved crimes there are every year and look at how many people have been freed of wrongful convictions by dna evidence i'd say at least a fifth of those in prison are doing time for a crime they didn't commit that means for every one who's innocent in there there is somebody who got away with that crime and probably out doing another one there's no fear career criminals have a career because they can get away with crime times out of there couldn't be many career criminals if they got caught with any frequency so people who do not watch out for each other people who are incapable or unwilling to put themselves in danger to help a stranger and the mess our legal system has become combined with socio economic and cultural struggles has created a society on the brink there won't be any safe neighborhoods soon even in the best neighborhoods people are afraid to let their children run around any more there is no safe place and we may start to resemble latin america where the wealthy live in fortresses and the rest live in crime and poverty to change it we need imediate reform at the top toss both corrupt lieing parties out the door reforms in law enforcement and justice are desperately needed we need to see each other as americans first and forget the other things the sub cultures need to adopt american core values that is value on education pride in being american being american first then whatever else as a very distant second respect for the law at least once the laws are respectable again a strong work ethic anti corruption a common language and other things that tie us together that bridge what religion we might practice race how much money we have or any of the other things that divide us now i'm not holding my breath the worse the economy is the worse crime gets and the economy is on the brink of collapse i see the divides deepening i see few people who are not something american any more many who drop the american completely and think of themselves only as something else we have enough enemies outside our borders yet we are our own worst
