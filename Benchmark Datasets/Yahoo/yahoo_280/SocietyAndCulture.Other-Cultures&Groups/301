if the us is so racist how did the world's richest black richest woman get her wealth solely in the us i know its alot easier to blame someone else but obviously some black people managed to make it and not every white person is rich there will always be racism danielle i bet you say a racist comment every day towards white folks people will always find something they don't like about you or me or whoever unless you can prove to me that it prevents you from life liberty and the pursuit of happiness you sit down and shut up i wish every white person in this country could be transformed to a black person for just day so they can actually see how subtle racism is in this politically correct environment or vice versa this just happened to me i had over million dollars designated to purchase a home i chose an extremely wealthy neighborhood that is the home of movie stars and other types of celebrities for months i was being called and attempted to be steered to a community that is close by has some beautiful homes has more mixed neighborhoods blacks and hispanics and is very upper middle class even though my ideal community had over homes for sale within my desiginated amount i finally negotiated on my own with a homeowner in my designated area and we agreed to a deal now the racist real estate person is suing me for her loss of commission and i in turn have filed a civil rights suit against her i have made it and this is just an example of how racism continues despite the fact that i made it through many obstacles along the way Racism White flight Economic inequality American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Capitalism Ethnic issues in Japan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Urban sprawl Anti-Defamation League Millionaire Insurance Microeconomics Rosa Parks Nadir of American race relations Racism in the United States Nicomachean Ethics Harlem Skinhead Essex County, New Jersey African American Theory of conduct White nationalism Marshall, Texas Flat tax History of South Africa in the apartheid era Equal Protection Clause Avenue Q Guns N' Roses Economy of Africa Left-wing politics Vernon Schillinger Civil rights Contract Minstrel show Daryl Gates Betting (poker) Black nationalism North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Multiculturalism Tax Arab-Israeli conflict FairTax Mortgage Appeal Black (people) Richard Littlejohn Southern United States Social justice Chip Berlet Colonial mentality White supremacy Class in the contemporary United States Supply and demand Beverly Hills, California The Apprentice 2 Nigger Stop the War Coalition ITunes Music Store New Urbanism Kitchen Democratic Party (United States) O.
