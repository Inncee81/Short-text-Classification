going greek i have read a lot of different takes on the greek system in colleges some for and some against do you as a person think that 'going greek' in college makes a difference in a person do you think that they are for the good or for the bad of the campus and community do you think that the type of organization you pledge matters cultural or social of course the organization of your pledge matters also you have to decide whether you are going to go greek with a chartered chapter some get kicked out of campus but remain a house by name only also remember that when you go greek you will be told who you can and cannot affiliate with outside of your house usually you are without doubt not allowed to go to other parties unless they are of the opposite sex house parties meaning you cannot go to other frat parties if you're a guy but can go to any sorority house and vice versa and the big thing is whether or not you want to risk all those years with people you end up not actually liking if you go greek too soon you will be pigeonholed with you can can and cannot befriend and if it doesn't work out that's it your social life is down the tubes you can become friends with a greek house and live under all the perks of the parties and private events without actually pledging my friends called me the sweetheart meaning i didn't date any of the boys but they were all my friends and protectors but they weren't really a big frat on campus more like a social club i went to all the formals and date parties and private house parties i had friends in sororities but they needed people like me to help them meet guys in frats the frats don't really care about sororities and the sorority girls don't really care about each other by the end of years you'll notice that many sorority girls spend little to no time with each other or their house cultural or social greek does not matter still the same feel unless you join something like phi delta phi the co ed law frat they don't do hazing or anything like that just hang and pay dues frats and sororities frats esp have bad reps amongst communities sometimes with good reason University of Alabama Hazing Alpha Phi Night of the Creeps Carnegie Mellon University Alpha Phi Omega Trinity College (Connecticut) St. Elmo's Fire (film) Case Western Reserve University Franklin and Marshall College Paddle (spanking) Social rule Friends Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Towson University Theory of conduct National Lampoon's Animal House Hamilton College Brown University Rice University Pan Sophic Pitaten Marriage Phi Delta Theta Swarthmore College Southwestern University Avenue Q Freed-Hardeman University Kettering University The George Washington University Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc.
