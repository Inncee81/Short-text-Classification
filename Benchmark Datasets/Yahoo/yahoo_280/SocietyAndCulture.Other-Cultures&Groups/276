can a psychopath claim to be able to love when she he lacks feelings like empathy i mean it's another thing to decide that you are going to put on an act and cry when you win money cry at your wedding cry if somebody proposes to you but feeling these feelings genuinely is another thing can a psychopath feel emotions of love and the like when they can't feel for exampe empathy super psych the dependence you are talking about is a key word we know in which ways we are all dependent on each other in the world though we may not admit it readily in some cases but to depend on some one and then hate them doesn't make sense every body is dependent on some one in some way whetehr we would like to admit it or not these things are all amazing and as maya angelou put it it's time we are living in a time for the thinkers to think dink you say psychopaths are most likely the ones filling up prisons for crimes commited against individuals or society but do you and i agree that even those who put them there do not fare well in this analysis because hte prisoners are all individuals each has a different story to tell that has probably put them in that situation what do you call the lack of understanding for that fact if we had empathy and tried to understand what has brought a human being to commitnig hideous crimes crime is not to be justified at all but if we had empathy far lesser people would be in prisons at least not for longer periods of time abateddust i love the earnesty of your answer really people like a 'psycopaths' tend to have either a severe chemical imbalance in their brain or have cut off ties to reality due to specific usually extreme experiences they are usualy able to feel regular emotions but due to their instability and whatever may have caused it these emotions may not register be ignored due to much more powerful influences other emotions thoughts or the emotion may even be a reminder of somthing that caused the instability and in that case will usually be avoided at all costs Empathy Evil Antisocial personality disorder Autism Social psychology Theory of conduct Transactional analysis Religion Goodness and value theory Human The nature of God in Western theology Soul Epistemology Narcissism Consciousness Capital punishment Addiction Serial killer Theodicy Philosophy of language Novel Post-traumatic stress disorder Altruism Abortion debate Scientology beliefs and practices A Course In Miracles Gestalt therapy The Amber Spyglass Torture Alignment (role-playing games) Numerology Mojave people Borderline personality disorder Psychology Patriotism Emotional intelligence Out-of-body experience Social rule Mental illness Human sexual behavior Law of value Ethics Asperger syndrome Scientific method Capitalism Mental Health Act 1983 Sexual orientation Objectivist philosophy Traumatic brain injury Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Rape Determinism Neuro-linguistic programming Enneagram Homophobia Atheism John Howard Yoder Universal pragmatics Marshall McLuhan Franz Boas Stuttering Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Charles Manson Daredevil God Phoebe Halliwell Zoophilia Karla Homolka Motivation Obsessive-compulsive disorder W.
