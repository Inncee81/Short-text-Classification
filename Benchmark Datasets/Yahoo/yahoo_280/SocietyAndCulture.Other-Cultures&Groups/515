is bdsm a valid form of sexuality i've done my research clear back to victorian scientists and i still can't decide if it's a sexuality like homo or heretrosexuality or if it's just kink or if it is an iteration of the natural order of things ie dominant male and submissive female as it is in the majority of bdsm relationships or if it is just a way for chauvenists to get their jollies in a mariginally accepted way what do you think and no jack ss answers please giggles thanks for all the answers everyone i'm no closer to deciding what bdsm actually is in terms of catagorization but you've given me food for thought in my experience in the bdsm world i have found that men are more often dominant in the pro bdsm world however there is a vast majority of women who are dominant and yes these are the professionals of whom someone spoke thanks again everyone i believe that it is just as valid a choice for me my slavery was a calling as any other sexuality or lifestyle i define myself as a slave and i live as one inside or outside of the bedroom whether i have a partner or not to me it is not a kink or even a choice i just am this does not mean that i am unable to make my own decisions i am highly independent broadly educated and very intelligent nor that i am unable to stand up for myself i am the strongest person i know i am also very able and willing to say no or pick faults in a situation slaving if i submit to a partner is undertaken with my full consent and full understanding in broader society i expect to be treated with the same courtesy and respect as any other person who lives according to their different truth homosexuality for example and do not fail to command it i also do not slant others for their beliefs if something that i personally disagree with makes someone happy as long as they don't try to push their ideas onto me then so be it each to their own cheers Domination & submission (BDSM) BDSM Polyamory Sexual orientation Infantilism Bondage (BDSM) Human sexual behavior Human Homophobia Zoophilia Sadism and masochism Theory of conduct Bisexuality Goodness and value theory Human sexuality Homosexuality and Christianity Same-sex marriage Age of consent Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Simone Weil Homosexuality Objectivist philosophy Female dominance Contract Religious Society of Friends Divorce Homosexuality and transgender Kink Child sexual abuse Scientific method Asperger syndrome Deconstruction Sexual abstinence Sexual intercourse Lawrence v.
