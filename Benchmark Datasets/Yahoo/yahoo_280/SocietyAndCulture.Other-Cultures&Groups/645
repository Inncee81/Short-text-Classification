why are chinese people better than everyone else at math there is a recent study by milner which examined this question children whose first language is chinese have an advantage in math because of the way their numerical language is structured example the number eleven english speaking childing would have to learn a new number coinciding with a whole new term in essence a whole new language the same goes for twelve and thirteen and so on but in chinese their language term for the number would be translated into english as ten plus one so chinese people do not have to learn a whole new term such as eleven instead they can operationalize upon old terms they have already learned one added advantage is that they also learn to add earlier as well this advantage carries on through the years the empirical evidence and conclusion the children of both races had the same acquisition rate for the numbers but after that the chinese children had the profound advantage Numerology Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Language acquisition Japanese language Esperanto as an international language Mathematics Multilingual Simplified Chinese character Chinese language Chinese spoken language Bible Dyslexia Pinyin Korean language Mandarin (linguistics) Left-handed Kanji Languages of Hong Kong Central processing unit Behaviorism SAT Linguistics History of the English Bible French language History of China Speech synthesis Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner Biology and sexual orientation Phoneme Education in Hong Kong Hangul Autism Duodecimal Education in the People's Republic of China Chinese numerals Economic inequality Celt Chinese calendar African American Vernacular English Greek language Demographics of the Philippines Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Maurice Merleau-Ponty Encyclopedia China Wolof language Education in Romania BASIC programming language M__ra-Pirah__ language College Auslan Computer numbering formats Psychology German language Gender-neutral language Tocharians Literacy Dictionary Foreign language Writing system Philosophy of language Macau Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination Novus Ordo Missae Homeschooling Vietnamese language Anthropology Developmental psychology Vladimir Nabokov American Sign Language Hearing impairment Manglish Singlish Standard Mandarin Cantonese (linguistics) Advanced Placement Program Strategic management Central Asia Cognitive science Tone (linguistics) East Asian language Education in the United States Sesotho language Aristotle Education Child prodigy Neolithic Europe Education in Singapore Hispanic Origin of language Names of large numbers Translation Nafaanra language Standard Cantonese Mainlander Han Chinese Tao Te Ching Common Era Logic
