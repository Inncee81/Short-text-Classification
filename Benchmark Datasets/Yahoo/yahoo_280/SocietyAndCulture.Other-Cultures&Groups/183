why are women becoming so blatantly hypocrites i just watched a movie called phat girls comedian monique and what i noticed is that the main point of the movie was to say that women that are overweight still have sex appeal value but what i found to be so hypocritical was that there weren't any overweight men displayed in the film as sexy or having any value before the immaturity starts no i'm not overweight but it got me to thinking that women have been in the past few years trying to get men to appreciate overweight women but yet most women don't have the same appreciation for overweight men why blue i'm sorry but i think you're mistaken if you think that men don't worry about their appearance and my opinion wasn't just based on the movie the movie just got me started thinking judy i never said anything wrong about big women i'm just talking about how women treat men dam good question i have never noticed that but you are completely right Little Britain Humphrey Bogart Peter Griffin Sexual attraction The Smoking Room Cary Grant Friends Pornographic movie The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Social rule Kodocha Gay slang Tony Hancock Sin City Spidey Super Stories Wedding Crashers Judy Garland Cliff Richard AFI 100 Years series Physical attractiveness Sinfest Good Morning, Vietnam The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Joke Yoko Ono Episodes of Lost (Season 1) American Psycho Infidels Binge eating disorder Sex symbol Madonna (entertainer) About a Boy Chinglish Mae West Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Nine to Five Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In True Grit Reservoir Dogs Feminism Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures A Series of Unfortunate Events The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Canon (fiction) Anime Miss Saigon Lauren Bacall Stewie Griffin Comedy film One Tree Hill (TV series) Married... with Children Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Theodicy Sexual orientation Extras (sitcom) Doug Big five personality traits U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Same-sex marriage in the United States Springfield Elementary School Human penis size The Pilgrim's Progress Piccolo Junior Saga Laura Schlessinger Sex and the City Epistemology Catwoman Peter Sellers The Country Wife Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Paradox Mississippi John Hurt South Park Paramount Pictures EastEnders Stuart Smalley Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Roger Ebert's most hated films Mystique (comics) Futurama (TV series - season 3) Super Size Me Mulholland Drive (film) Milton H.
