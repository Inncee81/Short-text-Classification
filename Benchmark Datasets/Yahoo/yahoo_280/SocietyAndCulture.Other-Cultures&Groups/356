why are some small communities outside small towns so rude and ignorant they rather insult degrade and put people down rather than simply give them notice to move out of the area are they afraid of being sued for prejudicism and yet not afraid of being sued for harassment i've had the same treatment when in hurkett matheson cobalt gilles waterside most these places were in ontario but waterside is just north of enderby it's the worst of the places there triple nastier than those other small communities i mentioned is all of bc worse than ontario yet some say bc is the place to be why i haven't been happy in bc yet don't have enough money to go back to ontario i don't know if it be wise to do so maybe ontario has gotten worse too i don't know i'm and can't keep moving from place to place i wasted so much of my life moving i hope where ever i go to will be for the rest of my life any ideas or answers to question well strictly speaking i guess that i shouldn't stick my beak into this one as i am from the uk however i am from a small village community and some of what you say rings true even over here in blighty over here i think that the nastiness is a lot more subtle though for example you move into a small community and almost everyone seems really nice and friendly then after living there for a while you get to know who the local gossips are and you see them out walking theirs dogs also know as meeting up to spread any juicy tit bits of gossip they think they know and you soon get to realise that as the newbie you are top of their gossip list personally i would rather have them talking about me than someone less confident or assertive who would be afraid to speak up for themselves if faced with false accusations or the like sometimes i have even been known to give them something to talk about like taking my suitcases out to the car my mum wanted to borrow them really screaming oh don't worry i won't come back towards the house and screeching off in my car all done for the gaggle of gossips gathered at the end of my road ha ha ha whilst they are gossiping about me they are leaving someone else alone i reckon you should pack your cases and come over here to live next door to me and my crazy mob there's never a dull moment and you will always be made to feel welcome Shaggy dog story Social rule Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Newbie The Smoking Room The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Russian joke Apology (Plato) The Shining (film) Rent (musical) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Apprentice 2 Marie Antoinette True Crime: Streets of LA The Catcher in the Rye Humphrey Bogart The Marshall Mathers LP Plame affair Philosophical skepticism Avenue Q Futurama (TV series - season 5) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Kill Bill StarCraft Episode VI The Subtle Knife Cliff Richard The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Sydney Riot of 1879 Mojave people House of M The Invisibles Internet troll Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Plame affair timeline Muslim ibn Aqeel Reservoir Dogs Jon Secada The Death Gate Cycle Piccolo Junior Saga Singlish Blackadder Charles Darwin's views on religion Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Jennifer Lopez G-Man (Half-Life) Sharon Tate Spanish verbs Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ocean's Twelve Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Prisoner's dilemma Scientology controversy Rais massacre Paranoia Agent Escape from New York German grammar The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Calvin and Hobbes Professional wrestling slang Goodness and value theory Current teachings of Prem Rawat Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief The Ashlee Simpson Show Boom Town (Doctor Who) W.
