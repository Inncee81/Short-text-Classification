why do biracial children with ethnic mothers look less ethnic than biracial children with white mothers i have noticed that when i see a white woman with biracial children the children have more ethnic features and color but when i see an ethnic woman black hispanic asian with biracial children white father more often the children look less ethnic i know hispanic women with white children and the children look white but when i see white women with hispanic children the children look hispanic i also have two black girlfriends with white husbands and the children could pass if they wanted to if anything they look italian or greek do children tend to take on the genes of the father more often this must be a matter of perception the biracial children of a mixed white ethnic couple are usually going to be darker than the white parent and lighter than the ethnic parent but since you're more likely to see kids out with just their mother instead of their father you're probably just noticing how biracial kids look different from their mothers if you often saw them with just their fathers instead you'd be wondering why the kids don't look more like their dads children do not and cannot take on the genes of their father more than their mother a man's genes are not stronger or more dominant than a woman's the only way a man's genes are different from a woman's is on the y chromosome which actually contains fewer genes than the x chromosome when it comes to appearance a child is equally likely to take after its mother or its father Multiracial Black (people) African American White (people) X chromosome Dominance relationship Human Eye color Incest Mendelian inheritance Father Haemophilia Liger Androgen insensitivity syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Affirmative action Blood type Fathers' rights Daredevil Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Intelligence quotient Melanin Colonial mentality Cat coat genetics Color Family name Physical attractiveness Mestizo Color blindness Mitosis Vivid Entertainment Woman Recessive gene Race Left-handed Miscegenation Divorce Cell growth Chromosome Child custody Human skin color Mulatto Thalassemia Horse Domestic violence The Jeffersons (South Park) Color theory Species Huntington's disease Biology and sexual orientation Gene Race (U.S. Census) Interracial couple Blood purity (Harry Potter) White flight Hair color Joke Gender role The Human Stain Feminism Abortion debate Family Santa Claus Hispanic Iberian naming customs Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz Roan (color) Beauty contest Japanese American Gray (horse) Spy Kids Ethnic stereotypes in pornography Genetic disorder Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Married... with Children Baldness About a Boy Asian fetish Will & Grace Fathers' rights movement in the UK Boston Public Maiden name Bill Cosby Racial segregation Genealogical DNA test Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Passing DNA Laura Schlessinger Urinary incontinence Demographics of Brazil Down syndrome Reggie Jackson Barbara McClintock Tibetan people Tortoiseshell cat Kyle Broflovski Gene Simmons Reproduction Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)
