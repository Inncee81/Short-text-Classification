why is it that different races are built differently take black and middle eastern indian women they usually are very shapely and even the skinny ones have a big butt i'm not trying to offend anyone but asian girls are usually very tiny and they kind of remind me of children not that there is anything wrong with that different people white girls are usually shaped weird i do not count latinos as a race since well latino isn't a race it's an ethnicity and anyone can be hispanic i've also noticed the same for men asian men are small white and african american men are usually tall actually i think that white middle eastern indian black men are built the same well i have noticed something about races some would consider my answer racist but really it's just an observation the darker skin races tend to have more physical advantages than the lighter skin races but the lighter skined races tend to have more mental advantages for example most pro sports players tend to be of darker skin yet they make up far less of the population look at the lighter skined people they tend to always hold higher offices and tend to hold more manijorial positions of course there are exceptions to every rule and this by no means that white people and asians can't be sports players or construction laborers darker skinned people just seem to have an advantage also the same goes for darker skinned people such as blacks and mexicans they can hold high offices and be intelligent yet they tend to have less qualities on average again this is not racist just observation i am just curious if others have noticed this Race (U.S. Census) Black (people) Race Race and intelligence African American Affirmative action Racism Colonial mentality Dragon Booster Human skin color Asian American Interracial couple Race of Jesus Strap-on dildo Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Physical attractiveness Miscegenation Volleyball White nationalism Wood Lamanite Blacks and Mormonism White supremacy Double bass Baseball American football Joke Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Mestizo Afrocentrism National Football League Skinhead Basketball Kender Caucasian race Aryan race Media and ethnicity Ultimate (sport) Validity of human races Violin Asian fetish New York-New Jersey English Mahjong Human Batting average White flight Species Indian English Equine conformation African American contemporary issues Intelligence quotient Ethnic stereotypes in pornography Water polo Ethnic issues in Japan Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Betting (poker) Non-native pronunciations of English Multiracial Rolling-element bearing Left-handed Political correctness Model minority Boxing South Africa Nation of Islam Billiards Dravidian people Race in biomedicine Mario Kart 64 Southern United States Black supremacy Race X Oz (TV series) Sento Passing Social rule Education in the United States The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Rules of Go Coloured Racism in the United States Androgen insensitivity syndrome Chess terminology Salary cap Sport rowing Clarinet Nadir of American race relations Lacrosse Welding Punt (boat) Chess opening Economic inequality Vernon Schillinger Hair color Zambo
