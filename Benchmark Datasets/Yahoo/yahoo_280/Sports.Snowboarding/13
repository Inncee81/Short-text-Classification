are snowboard bindings usually sold in pairs or individually i have been to a few sites and they say their they're selling a binding singular not plural i need to know if this is just a wording issue or if bindings are usually sold individually no they sell binding as pairs it's just worded as binding sometimes what good would two bindings of a different kind or buying a separate left and right binding as well do if they're gonna sell you a binding it only makes sense to sell the matching binding to go on the other side of the snowboard that'd be funny as hell though riding a burton custom brew on the left and a rome binding on the right or something like that thank you you just gave me my laugh of the day not to insult you or anything it's kind of a no brainer for me but then again there are things that are no brainers for other people that i would never think of hope somebody puts as big a smile on your face as that just put on mine and have a sick time snowboarding with matching bindings Snowboarding Snowboard Morphology (linguistics) Poker jargon English plural Social rule Mojave people Roman Catholic Church AFI 100 Years series Professional wrestling slang The Marshall Mathers LP Contract Shit German grammar Time Out of Mind Shawn Michaels Abrahamic religion Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Skiing Jennifer Lopez Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dice 613 mitzvot Property (ownership right) Have I Got News For You Altruism Comics Existence Frankie Laine Joke Infinity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Milton H.
