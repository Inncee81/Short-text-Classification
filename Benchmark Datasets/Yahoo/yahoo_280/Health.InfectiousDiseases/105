duodenal ulcer and its complications i've been recently diagnosed with a duodenal ulcer caused by a bactria called h plyori and possibly from partying too much long story short i went to the hospital because my stomach was bleeding from the inside it's been months since i've had anything alcoholic drink b c the doc said i should stay away from it for a while i was just wondering if anyone else had this before or do you think i can drink now helicobacter pylori is a common infection of the stomach that in addition to predisposing people to development of stomach and duodenal ulcers can infrequently cause stomach tumors both adenocarcinoma and malt when found in conjunction with a duodenal ulcer then h pylori is usually the culprit it is generally treated with a combination of medications usually at least two antibiotics amoxicillin clarithromycin metronidazole and a proton pump inhibitor e g omeprazole lansoprazole the most common prescription is prevpac which is a combination package of lanzoprazole amoxicillin and clarithromycin pills for which the patients would receive a single prescription and have one co pay depending on their insurance reasons your doctor recommended alcohol abstinence may be unrelated to your duodenal ulcer or due to possible interaction with the treatment her prescribed for your h pylori infection therefore the best way to proceed from here is to discuss this question with your doctor since you had a complication bleeding ulcer requiring hospitalization with your h pylri infection your doctor should also later check that the treatment was indeed successful and that you do not have a persistent or recrudescent h pylori infection in your stomach the easiest way to accomplish this nowadays to have your stool checked for h pylori antigen rather than checking for antibodies in your serum that can remain positive for a couple of years at least even after successful antibiotic treatment good luck Pneumonia Esomeprazole Gastroesophageal reflux disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Prostate cancer Colorectal cancer Coeliac disease Ulcerative colitis Esophageal cancer HIV test Crohn's disease Diarrhea Gonorrhoea Ranitidine Chronic fatigue syndrome Acute pancreatitis Lupus erythematosus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cirrhosis Breast cancer COX-2 inhibitor Malaria Diclofenac Traumatic brain injury Proton pump inhibitor Psoriasis Group A streptococcal infection Immunosuppressive drug Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Hepatitis Multiple sclerosis First aid Homeopathy Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Lung cancer Health insurance Asthma Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Medicine Antidepressant Folic acid Breastfeeding Cystic fibrosis Malignant melanoma Paracetamol Penicillin Hypoglycemia Urea breath test Common cold Diabetes mellitus Pharmaceutical company Adjustable gastric band Hepatitis B Medical cannabis Barry Marshall Allergy Infectious mononucleosis Intravenous therapy Alcoholism AIDS Cytomegalovirus Turner syndrome Conjunctivitis Pharmacology Mouth ulcer Tuberculosis Syphilis Shock Bone marrow transplant Escherichia coli O157:H7 Medical analysis of circumcision Streptococcus pneumoniae Fecal incontinence Smallpox H2-receptor antagonist Antibiotic Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Paget's disease of bone Bipolar disorder Dexamethasone Campylobacteriosis Drug addiction Radiosurgery Growth hormone treatment Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Chlorpromazine Obstetrics Blood type Rabies Abortion Antiviral drug
