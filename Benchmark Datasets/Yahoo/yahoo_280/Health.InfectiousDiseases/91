is it possible to create a vaccine that mutates so we can be protected against all viruses like if we created a harmless germ that constantly mutated in our bloodstream but spread fast enough to where it wouldn't be killed off so that we would produce antibodies for every kind i already know how a vaccine works i'm talking about a germ that mutates its protein often but the germ itself is harmless to us so that our antibodies will still kill it and we will become immune to that protein format i dont think so but whoever does would be rich i dont know but i highly doubt it Antibody HIV vaccine Vaccine Virus Cancer Influenza pandemic Influenza Malaria Semen Antiviral drug HIV structure and genome DNA repair Smallpox Gene therapy Spanish flu HIV test H5N1 Ebola HIV Avian influenza Hepatitis B Bioterrorism Mutation Infectious disease Vaccination Human papillomavirus Louis Pasteur West Nile virus T helper cell Multiple myeloma AIDS Hepatitis Immune system Foot-and-mouth disease AIDS reappraisal Monoclonal antibody HIV Disease Progression Rates Immunology Polio vaccine Streptococcus pneumoniae Anthrax Antiretroviral drug Cytomegalovirus Allergy Common cold Flu vaccine Blood Coagulation Milk Measles Virulence T-Virus Antigen Apoptosis Marburg virus Poliomyelitis Schistosomiasis Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy Autoimmune diseases Retrovirus Jonas Salk Genetic disorder Protein Tuberculosis Antibiotic resistance Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome The Invisibles Mosquito Humoral immunity Myxomatosis Herpes simplex virus Molecular biology OPV AIDS hypothesis Biological warfare Germ theory of disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ultraviolet Life Major histocompatibility complex Angiogenesis Cell (biology) SV40 Autistic enterocolitis Colorectal cancer Sleeping sickness Transposon Epstein-Barr virus Echovirus Ricin Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome Human skin color Alzheimer's disease Immortality Pneumonia Hay fever Prion
