whats a simple way to put my hair up i always wear my hair up no matter what but it takes a while to get it looking like i want it to which is like hair hanging straight down from the bun and sticking up evrywherin the back it usually takes me like times to even get it close to this is there an easier way that i canput it up and it looks like i want it the first or second time this is what i do it takes maybe five minutes if my hair's being really stupid i flip my hair over my head and gather it into a ponytail i make a messy bun by starting one wrap of the holder but not finshing it so that my hair is in a loop don't let go of the holder i repeat that twice more or as many times as the holder will allow i tuck in any hanging strands by wrapping them around the bun in random places and pushing them underneath the holder careful here it might losen the bun then i either secure back my bangs by gathering them make sure they i can pull them forward so they are flat then flip the ends of the bangs at least once so there is a slight bump when secured hold onto the flipped part and bring it back to the top of your head push it forward until you achieve your desired height for the bump i criss cross bendy hair clips to secure my bangs but you can also use about bobby pins use a skinny head wrap looks like this http www boscovs com wcsstore boscovs images store product thumbnails ex pt jpg pv a cb a d d to hold back every single bang it if is sliding off i put a bendy hairclip of the head wrap on both sides of my head and underneath bobby pins would work here too but it would be more risky i figure not to put any on the top of my head it would look kinda funny i prefer the second way of putting my hair up because when i put my hair up i don't want anything tickling my face ps don't always wear your hair one way it can make you look insecure like you're afraid to try new things for fear of what people will think Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling holds Haircut Suplex Swingout Violin Professional wrestling attacks Textile manufacturing Lindy Basic Professional wrestling match types Breaststroke Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling aerial techniques Diving Equine conformation Comanche Ponytail Strap-on dildo Fast bowling Amateur telescope making Side pass (dance move) Volleyball Sport rowing Revolver Casualty lifting Drill bit Squidward Tentacles Salute Mattress Daredevil Boxing Internal ballistics Sari Snooker Professional wrestling slang Shaggy dog story Pinball Bobby Charlton Japanese tea ceremony DDT (professional wrestling) Steyr Mannlicher M1901 Gesture Knitting Hair Car handling Contredanse Glossary of climbing terms Indianapolis 500 Table tennis Dreadlocks Magnet The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy View camera Piledriver (professional wrestling) Beavis and Butt-head Horizontal bar M-209 Customs and etiquette of Japan Movie projector Teen Girl Squad The Amber Spyglass Backstroke M16 (rifle) Ra (board game) Charleston (dance move) Marching band Happy Tree Friends Heckler & Koch G3 1957 World Series Baldness Hip hop collaborations Drag racing Floppy disk Muslim ibn Aqeel Vegeta Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Bob and George Sugar push New York Giants Cliff Richard Canoe Repeating rifle Figure skating Operational amplifier Dragon Booster Roxette Lock picking Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Homer Simpson
