chi staightener doesn't work i finally got mine today and was expecting my hair to be pin straight sleek and shiny no my old staightener was a total piece of crap my chi is a little bit better and is a little bit faster but that's it my hair still poofs out any reasons why tips hi i understand what you mean first though some tips to using a straightener and the one you have is one of the best be sure to use smaller sections at a time especially if your hair is super thick and curly also it helps to use a straightening balm or leave in conditioner for frizzies after washing before using the straightener this will help and for all of us here in my house saves time even though it costs to get a good one be sure to use a shampoo and conditioner that is geared for straightening hair and not volumizing hair as that can add to the problem you are trying to fix and the hardest one be patient and make sure your iron is hot when you start it i clip off my hair in sections before i start and while it is heating up and then i start at the bottom underneath and work my way up to the top part hope this helps good luck Drill bit Shampoo Wind turbine Diving Equine conformation Violin Haircut Knife Internal ballistics Hair Dragon Booster Cello Baldness Aerial (dance move) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Iron Dreadlocks Sento Three Stooges Textile manufacturing 2000 Australian Grand Prix Drag racing Afro textured hair Welding Tai Chi Chuan Rail tracks Floppy disk Digital circuit Leaf Electrophysiology Craps Sport rowing Wok Diving suit Paragliding Brewery Fast bowling Pubic hair Coffee Seismic retrofit Thermal power station Piccolo Junior Saga Jet engine Extreme Programming Poker jargon Gas metal arc welding Billiards Pitaten Kitchen Erie Canal Shit Opportunity rover Katana Hair conditioner Kodocha Sandy Koufax Ironing Horseshoe Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Soldering Casting Novelty (locomotive) Book of Kells Prostate cancer Shaving CPU design Hangul Double bass Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Guinea pig Bread Lighting Certified Nursing Assistant Dynamical system Quicksort Psoriasis Nuclear fusion Bladderwort Pachypodium baronii Stairway Manifold AMD Narrow gauge Hot air balloon Fitts' law Soap bubble Japanese tea ceremony Hermione Granger Growth hormone treatment Drug test Oscilloscope Snooker Heinkel He 112 Gliding Dandruff MOSFET Handloading Dynamic random access memory Turbocharger Helicopter
