if you get extensions at a salon ru supposed to bring your own extensions or do they typically provide them also which would be cheaper or does it vary i wanted hair extensions with my bridal veil to wear my hair down i like the jessica simpson ones but i'm not sure if synthetic looks better than real hair i like that it comes wavy the real hair only comes straight i would have to curl it myself it's actually cheaper for you to buy your own but it is convenient to let them purchase and that way they know exactly what type to buy if you go to an upscale salon some would have the hair already there i like letting them pick out the hair because they are professionals they know exactly what to look for Wig (hair) Haircut Dreadlocks Mutual fund Violin Hair Kimono Headgear Hilary Duff Price discrimination The Apprentice 1 Fur Saxophone Afro The Ashlee Simpson Show Computer Volleyball Beavis and Butt-head Moustache Hijab Strap-on dildo Hearing aid Gender role Professional wrestling match types Irish dance Textile manufacturing terminology Barbie The Apprentice 2 candidates Digital photography Greco-Buddhist art Paul Is Dead Veil Oakland Athletics Synthetic diamond Katana Hair coloring Real estate broker Afro textured hair Three Stooges Shampoo Insurance Sport utility vehicle Supply and demand Winter Olympic Games Knife Taxicab Diamond Customs and etiquette of Japan Bow (music) Totally Spies!
