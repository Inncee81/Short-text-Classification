hair dying question i dyed my hair tonight myself with a box of hair dye but i don't like the way it came out there's pretty much no difference between it and the color i had before i'd like to dye it again tonight but the directions say not to dye it again for days is it okay if i dye it again tonight why does it say you should wait weeks before you dye it again it say so because your scalp is likely to be slightly damaged by the chemicals your hair is also damaged by the chemicals let it recover then dye it again the most gentle part of your hair is the part closest to the scalp it absorbs the chemical a lot more than the rest of the hair if you dye it again your hair might come out different color at the root or it might breal off at the root weeks is enough time for the hair to grow out Hair The Ashlee Simpson Show Pubic hair Henna Blond Hair coloring Baldness treatments Dandruff Dye Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Textile manufacturing CD-R Depilation Technicolor Hair color Haircut The Rasmus Shampoo Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Mohawk hairstyle Kimono Staining (biology) Burdock Psoriasis Turquoise Photography Uranium Guinea pig Horse Indigo dye Anthocyanin Chemical reaction Microscopy Head Stem cell Green Day Wolfrider Joker (comics) Head louse William Perkin Ink Leather Drug test Dry cleaning Solar power Prostate cancer Comanche Jennifer Lopez Radiation therapy Alizarin Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Hair conditioner Stomach cancer My Little Pony Chromatography Baldness Christina Aguilera Tzitzit Light-emitting diode Acne Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Tie-dye Treehouse of Horror IX Tanning Son Gohan P-Phenylenediamine Pigment Tarantula Quantum dot Anodising Social rule Batik Clothing Acetic acid Battles of Lexington and Concord Norway national football team Rei Ayanami Androgen insensitivity syndrome Root Han Chinese clothing Hydrogen Barbie Skinhead Madder Primus (band) Tallit Hiberno-English Lithium Dragon Booster Heavy metal fashion Photographic film Alopecia areata Wood Chromium Internet fraud Laser hair removal Intravenous therapy L'Or__al Genesis (band) Diseases of the honeybee
