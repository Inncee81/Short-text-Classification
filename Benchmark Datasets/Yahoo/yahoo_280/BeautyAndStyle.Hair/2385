how should i cut my curly hair ok so i have wavy curly hair it reaches my mid back when i leave it out and i want to get it cut but i'm not sure what kind of hair cut would look good i have and oval face and i was thinking that if i layered it my shortest layer being about one inch below my chin it wouldn't look too bad does anyone have any other suggestions or advice pls help i'm going to keep it my same length except with short layers would that look good my mum has curly hair in the style you described and it looks great she also has layers cut through underneath as well as on the top becsause she has really thick hair her hairdresser does this thing where she takes a chunk of hair and twirls it around her finger so that it all twists together and then takes the scissors along the egde of the twist of hair this looks great in curly hair but my hair is kinda wavy and it works for me too to avoid any disasters make sure you get it cut at least a week before you go back to school and make sure your hairdresser knows what he she is doing talk through what you want with them first they may also have some ideas for what would look good in your hair perhaps ask them when you go to book the appointment this will give you time to think about it have fun with your new haircut Haircut Hair Three Stooges Textile manufacturing Kodocha Leaf Violin Professional wrestling throws Depilation Shaving Barber The Emancipation of Mimi Portuguese Water Dog Knife Dreadlocks The Ashlee Simpson Show Pubic hair Beard Poodle Fur Saw Emo fashion About a Boy Table tennis Textile manufacturing terminology Guinea pig Beavis and Butt-head Greco-Buddhist art Equine conformation Opportunity rover Scissors Pachypodium bicolor Great Teacher Onizuka Rock, Paper, Scissors Drill bit Glacier Little Britain Dennis the Menace (UK) Katana Mullet (haircut) Razor Floppy disk Greco-Buddhism Social rule Lord of the Flies Stairway Ranma __ characters Tire Taxi Driver Baldness Noonan syndrome 2000 Australian Grand Prix Garfield Mattress The Invisibles Puberty Happy Tree Friends Rod Stewart Mercury Atlas 6 Skateboarding trick Europa (moon) Solar cell Red Dwarf characters Pitaten Griffon Bruxellois The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Book of Five Rings Moustache Potato Dragon Booster Physical attractiveness Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Galileo spacecraft Diamond cut Pseudofolliculitis barbae Cheating in poker Breath of Fire III 1957 World Series John McDouall Stuart Dilbert Hot dog The Shadows Tibetan people Breaststroke Trichome Table saw Blood on the Tracks Upholstery Extreme Programming Osamu Tezuka's Star System Avenue Q Casting Pet Sounds Aerial (dance move) Pachypodium key to species Professional wrestling attacks Dead Sea Tarantula Veruca Salt
