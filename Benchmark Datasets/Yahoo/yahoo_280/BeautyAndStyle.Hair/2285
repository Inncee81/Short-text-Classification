blonde hair slowly growing black ok i have fair blonde hair like my mum and sister but my sister's hair is darker and has quite a few browney blonde hairs mine is lighter but i've began to notice and getting more dark roots i have never died it i'm guessing this is just natural but why but i wanted to know if pulling them out will make them grow back thicker more less i don't pull out big chunks just single hairs sometimes when they look quite dark you never mentioned your fathers colour or how old you are genetics play a huge part and you may find that your hair has changed its colour from when you were little to your age now pulling them out wont make them grow thicker it will probably be more annoying to you as they grow back cause they will stick out my sister used to pull out strays too and she eventually gave up and bought some hair dye Hair color The Ashlee Simpson Show Red hair Cheetah Hair Black (people) Kender Kodocha Pubic hair Blonde on Blonde Ashlee Simpson Reservoir Dogs Textile manufacturing Human skin color The Inside Samson Pitaten Double Dragon EastEnders Cello Queen of Wands Wood Madonna (entertainer) Mink Hermione Granger Melanin Rave Master Marilyn Monroe White (people) YuYu Hakusho Puberty Horse Characters in the Smurfs Eye Species Link (Legend of Zelda) Bob and George Dragon Booster Kimono Color theory StarCraft Episode VI W.I.T.C.H.
