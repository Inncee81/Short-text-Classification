so i was going to get prenatial vitimans to make my hair grow healthier etc but can anyone answer this these prenatal vitimans are said to have more then just taking vitiman but would talking it everyday be too much your only supposed to get so much of a vitiman a day and above that can cause problems or make you sick so i guess my question is do prenatal vitimans have the right doseage of vitimans not too many but just enough what vitimans do they have and how much of that vitiman if im gonna take them for my hair i just dont want to overdo it it can be too much of a good thing look up taking vitimans with high levels if you dont believe me im sure you'll find something i found this off the website http findarticles com p articles mi m is ai the dangers of overdosing however as with any nutrient you don't want to go overboard too much of a good thing can be harmful indeed some minerals such as selenium zinc and iron can be dangerous in high levels the jury's still out on others because ethical conditions limit research on humans sorry its so long so what do you think are prenatal vitimans safe to take or is their too much of a certain vitiman also how come it prevents them from testing on people when other companies test stuff on animals x x i think they should be protected too e e prenatal vitamins are very safe to take for hair growth i am a guy and i take prenatal vitamins every day Tocopherol Nutrition Vitamin D Veganism Folic acid Prostate cancer Anorexia nervosa Zinc Milk Obstetrics Omega-3 fatty acid Theory of conduct Cystic fibrosis Dieting Organic food Prenatal diagnosis Arguments for and against drug prohibition Prenatal care Breastfeeding Cancer Human height Golden rice Garlic Egg (food) Stomach cancer Vegetarianism Genetically modified food Growth hormone treatment Stroke Vegetarian nutrition Retinol Shampoo Carnivorous plant Transsexuality Eutrophication Vitamin Guinea pig Hamster Baldness Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sudden infant death syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome Coeliac disease Scientology beliefs and practices Autistic community Growth hormone deficiency Hair Aspartame Dog Dandruff Coronary heart disease Baldness treatments Human skin color Androgen insensitivity syndrome Alzheimer's disease Cyanocobalamin Nutrient Engineering Chronic fatigue syndrome Factory farming Soybean Biology and sexual orientation Password Dairy Acne Animal rights Intelligence quotient Drug test Malnutrition Left-handed Sigmund Freud Common cold Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ethics Insulin Animal testing Stem cell Dietary fiber Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Atherosclerosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Contract Sunscreen Pregnancy Explosive material Schizophrenia Thallium Melanin Theodicy Consciousness Utilitarianism Controversies in autism Abortion debate GED Eugenics Ulcerative colitis Handedness Epistemology
