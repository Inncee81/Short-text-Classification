oh no blonde hair gone bad i am trying to get my hair from my natural color dark brown down to a dirty blonde i bought some powder bleach and a level developer put it on waited and my hair ended up a very bronze color i decided to go ahead and put in the hair dye i bought darker blonde and it still has a touch of bronze any suggestions my life story buy a shampoo called 'ultra light shade' i think that's what it's called anyway the bottle is blue and you can buy it at shoppers drug mart assuming you live in canada or at probably any drug store you can also buy the conditioner but the shampoo works better and then you can just use a normal conditioner it adds toner to your hair to eliminate the bronze and lighten the blonde it's magic i swear use it until you get the color you like and then only use it every other time you shower assuming you shower daily or every other good luck Hair coloring Hair color Blond Color theory Human skin color Melanin Hair Link (Legend of Zelda) Color W.I.T.C.H.
