why is my hair getting greasier i have thick wavy hair that i am growing out after being cut short when it was short i washed it every other day and it was fine then it started to get greasy as it got longer so i started washing conditioning every day i've been doing that for months and it looks great but recently in the last week or so it's started to get greasy right after i wash it it's a bit shorter than shoulder length what do i do ps i've been told washing it less will help but i was washing it less to begin with and when it got greasy the problem was fixed by washing it more pps the problem is not my diet i eat well thanks for your help all i've heard that thick hair gets greasier more easily ask for it to be thinned next time you get it cut that should hopefully make it less prone to becoming greasy as well as that you could try not conditioning it every day and instead try every other day as condtioner acts as a sort of moisturisor for hair you can also buy shampoo and conditioners for greasy hair try using one that is aimed at you hair type Psoriasis Dandruff Shampoo Haircut Drill bit Hair conditioner Equine conformation Skin Knife Textile manufacturing Carding Acne Welding Leaf Wool Fecal incontinence Soap bubble Brush Tarantula Baldness Casting Breastfeeding Katana Kodocha Menstrual cup Laundry detergent Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Certified Nursing Assistant Breakfast The Ashlee Simpson Show Prostate cancer Meat Loaf Guinea pig Bread Drug test Havanese Beard Cat Tasmanian Devil Leather Puberty Month Stomach cancer Ramen Anorexia nervosa M60 machine gun Keeshond Year Cross-country skiing Hearing aid Grammatical aspect Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Carbon nanotube Polar Bear Rapunzel Hamster Great Depression CDC 6600 Nuclear fallout Tocopherol String (computer science) Scapula Textile manufacturing terminology Shark Gas metal arc welding Violin Internal ballistics Washing machine Shotgun Hair color Marathon (sport) Domestic rabbit Extreme Programming Siegfried Line Ranma __ characters Tank Urinary incontinence Pachypodium key to species Coeliac disease Carnivorous plant Manx (cat) Non-native pronunciations of English Obesity Chinchilla Hebrew calendar Jute Deluge (mythology) Japanese tea ceremony Sugar beet Otter Cheese Archery Cubic zirconia Sword Social rule Passenger car M16 (rifle) Pubic hair
