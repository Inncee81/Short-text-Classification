would it be ok if i stopped brushing my hair i keep reading and hearing that brushing your hair is bad for it and gives it split ends so could i just stop brushing and and use a comb when i need to and how often what if my hair gets tangled in the wind so would it be ok to just use a comb or will a comb pull out alot of hair it's so fab that u wanna improve your hair i think it's a great idea and use a comb when ur hair looks out of place combs actually don't pull out hair unless u tug at a knot for a while so go for it peace out girl scout paige Charmed Sean Combs Dreadlocks Five Ks Brush Yami to B__shi to Hon no Tabibito Comb Haircut Weaving Hair (musical) Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Crab louse Pubic hair Cashmere wool Beard Textile manufacturing The Isley Brothers Act Without Words II Rastafari movement The Care Bears (television series) Satchel Paige Shen Gong Wu Kitesurfing Milton H.
