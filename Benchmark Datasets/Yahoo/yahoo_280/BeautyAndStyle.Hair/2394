straight bangs for curly haired people hi my hair's wavy curly and very poofy im about to get bangs the short ones and they only look right if they're straight is there a way to get them straight that doesn't involve me using a straightener on my bangs every day unfortunately no the only way is to blow dry it straight or use a flat iron unless u want to chemically straighten it which i don't think u do just a word of advice from experience if you have curls like if your hair is more prone to curls than waves don't get short bangs get longer ones kind of side bangs unless u're willing to make them straight everytime u wash ur hair otherwise don't even bother it just doesn't look right when it's curly that's only my opinion Haircut Hair Three Stooges Shampoo Equine conformation Fur Afro Afro textured hair Guinea pig Gesture Leaf Sesshomaru Diving Dreadlocks Hair conditioner Baldness Brush Big Bang Textile manufacturing Skinhead Shaving Hippie Quotation mark Poodle Drug test Prostate cancer Vegeta Aerial (dance move) Gaozu of Han Dilbert Hey Arnold!
