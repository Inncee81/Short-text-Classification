what colours can i dye my black ish hair without having to bleach it or am i destined to a life of boring hair because i'm scared that bleach will ruin it thanks for your time with dark hair it will force you to look at colouring your hair differently if you want very bright vibrant colours or lighter shades then you'll probably be forced to bleach and then dye over it however you can get some very nice colours albeit muted hues by dying over your natural colour bright colours will show in your hair but in a more subtle fashion than in people with lighter hair another option is to go darker there are so interesting colours red blacks blue blacks purple blacks that appear very dark but when the sun hits them they're a fairly vibrant shade which might be an option Color theory Hair color Color Hair coloring Human skin color Kimono Death rock fashion Blond Dye Turquoise Joker (comics) Sunglasses Arsenal F.C.
