how long do synthetic hair extensions last if they are glued in nd you take care of them and your hair doesn't grow freakishly fast probably around months if you did them yourself with glue good luck at getting them out that glue is a beyotch i had to use the oil stuff to loosen the hair and then my boyfriend went and took a fine tooth comb and picked out the hlue because it stays on your scalp and i felt like he was picking lice out of my hair yuck if you are a diyer like me i suggest clip in extensions not the wft pieces like they sell at sally's because you run the risk of not having enough hair that happened to me because i have thick hair and the extensions were much thinner i like the jessica simpson extensions and you can get them on ebay or if you have a beauty world near you or go to the website hairuwear com and it will find the nearest retailer if however you aren't made of money there is another kind it's also on the hairuwear website called pop or put on pieces and they sell it at my target for like and its the same thing the lengths are just a lil bit shorter you could search that and find where it sells closest to you good luck have fun with your hair Textile manufacturing Violin Hair The Ashlee Simpson Show Cello Haircut Baldness Equine conformation Knife Ashlee Simpson Brush Leather Pubic hair Hilary Duff The Critic Social rule Kender Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Floppy disk Hamster Upholstery Guitar Pitaten Drill bit Gramophone record Internet fraud Kodocha Christina Aguilera Teen Girl Squad Sonic the Hedgehog Baldness treatments Jessica Simpson Table tennis Kimi Finster Neopets Double bass Nail (anatomy) Stem cell Late Night with Conan O'Brien Psoriasis Crab louse EastEnders Horseshoe Dreadlocks Avenue Q Guinea pig Hair conditioner Sex and the City Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Nine Inch Nails Comb Puberty 2000 Australian Grand Prix Little Britain $ale of the Century Squidward Tentacles Internal ballistics Prostate cancer Sperm Whale Black Books The Price Is Right Roswell UFO incident Dandruff Leaf Strap-on dildo Sampling (music) Marilyn Monroe Characters of The Sandman Three Stooges Fruits Basket Baroque chess Afro Head louse Beavis and Butt-head Physical attractiveness Autograph Beard Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Piccolo Junior Saga Minor Harry Potter Beasts Anorexia nervosa Lil' Kim The Star Wars Holiday Special Comanche Textile manufacturing terminology Max Martin Totally Spies!
