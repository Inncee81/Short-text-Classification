i have a question for all you beauticians ok so i have really thick but soft shiny hair im not into doing it everyday like straightening it or curling a ponytail will do just fine but im geting older and its kinda embarassing to not really know how to do my hair but not only that i try sometimes and it looks terrible and my older sister always has to redo it so my question is is there any hairdo out there i can get professionally done or someting that could take like three mins so i dont have to do much i can it done at a local hair salon or i might be able to do it myself oh and if i get it done at a hair salon i want it to be permanent so that all i really need to do is brush through it every morning oh and i cant get a perm because my hair is so thick i will go fro style but any other type i could get done professionally or do in three mins remeber im a lost when it come to hair super thick hair i am soooo jealous but sounds like it's too much for you to handle why not try some long layers this will help with movement and also take some of the bulk out of your hair is it stick straight if so then there is no need to straighten ask your stylist to add long layers and tapper around the front of your face or add some side swept bangs do you have a little wave you can do the same thing but skip the side swept bangs keep the hair out of your eyes by taking the middle section of your hair and clip it back not far back on your head like back in the 's but jsut a little poof near the top near your hairline if it's stick straight and you want a little body ask your stylist for a body wave it won't give you the afro poof of a perm then add a good leave in conditioner i fell in love with aussi mosit leave in conditioner its a bit thick but leaves my hair very managable when in doubt a pony tail isn't always a bad thing but i understand the getting older thing and you want to look your age a great way to do that is to get a drastic cut short hair can be a challenge to get use to but when your stylist gives you a good cut you shouldn't have do to much to it as you don't have all the options that girls with longer hair have best of luck Equine conformation Knife Dreadlocks Aerial (dance move) Floppy disk Kodocha Curling Baldness Leaf Professional wrestling throws Ponytail Shaggy dog story Pitaten 2000 Australian Grand Prix Drill bit Volleyball Swingout Textile manufacturing Three Stooges Fast bowling The Fairly OddParents Casting Mattress Barbie Mountaineering Dog Violin Gramophone record Singlish San Francisco Giants Characters in the Smurfs SMTV Live Afro Pubic hair Totally Spies!
