how can i fix my eyebrows i'm a guy and i tweeze me eyebrows beacuse if i didn't i'd have a unibrow my parents told me just to leave it like that it's ok if you have a unibrow but i find it really disgusting so i pluck them i have thick eyebrows so i wanted to get them fixed so i went to unisex place and i asked if i could have my eyebrows fixed and they laughed at me because i'm a guy so i never plan on going to those places how can i do it myself and make my eyebrows thinner looking i'm never going to a spa place or anything like that ever after being publicly embarassed so don't suggest that just trim your brows go for a clean line and dont copy a womans brow if you need help on triming your eyebrows go to eyebrowz com and they have a great section on grooming brows just for men and please dont wax go for the natural look Unibrow Social role of hair Depilation Cross-country skiing Baldness Kodocha Physical characteristics of the Buddha Cosmetics Mummy U.S. presidential election, 2008 Social rule Casting Vulcan (Star Trek) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Beard EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Three Stooges Stewie Griffin Knots Landing Jennifer Lopez Salute The Ersatz Elevator One Tree Hill (TV series) Mozilla Firefox The Star Wars Holiday Special Singlish Friends Physical attractiveness Anne Boleyn The Shining (film) Manos: The Hands of Fate Windows XP Little Britain Madonna (entertainer) Reaction to Darwin's theory Missouri Compromise Good Morning, Vietnam Sharon Tate Downing Street memo Faustyna Kowalska Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Coldplay Survivor (novel) Effeminacy Hair 2005 trial of Michael Jackson C__line Dion Debugging Fancy Crane Men in Black Sami Brady Count Olaf Luanne Platter The Smoking Room Frida Kahlo Jam (TV series) Ocean's Twelve Wang Mang The Two Doctors Jean Chr__tien Killian documents Marilyn Monroe Publication of Darwin's theory Ganesha Atomic Kitten Grandview, U.S.A.
