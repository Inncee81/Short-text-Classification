a combination of choices circumstances or events cause and effect choices have consequences i know that but at times it seems that we are unable to determine the outcome of our choices only to regret later i blame it on unforseen circumstances which makes the results turn out bad so perhaps it it is fate that we make certain choices i mean that for eg you will not know if taking which two routes would prove to have a more repercussion than the other liike choosing to sit on which plane which one of them fated to crash if we know which is going to turn out bad we won't choose it in the first place but sometimes things juz can't be helped isn't it there is a major fault in your logic that seems to be blinding you to the truth of this argument first in order to understand your agreement on must admit that there is a thing commonly referred to as fate it has also been deemed reciprocity or karma this idea states that things occur despite choices the butterfly effect represents the opposite of this premise if one chooses to believe in destiny fate or what have you then our lives become autonomous and therefore cannot be free to choose because what ever you choose was a result of the idea of fate i reject this notion in its entirety i believe there was an intelligent creator that being infinitely wise and loving gave man the one gift that only he possess free will he gave us the ability to choose to love or despise him to decide for oneself whether we get on either plan and in a sense whether we will be the cause of the plane crash if you follow this train of thought you see that every action has a consequence whether prosperous or poisonous whether deadly or giving life i had a choice to answer this message i chose to expound upon that which i believe now you have a choice repent and be saved or reject the greatest gift ever given a loving creator awaits your decision your choice is all that stands in your way Theodicy Predestination Free will Determinism Goodness and value theory Meaning of life Theory of conduct Incarnations of Immortality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Utilitarianism Duties of the Heart Karma Causality Scientology beliefs and practices Rudolf Hermann Lotze Logic G__del's incompleteness theorem Paradox Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Objectivist philosophy Economics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Simone Weil God Coercion Abortion debate Sin Scientific method Summa Theologiae Original sin Philosophy of language Intelligent design Merit Liberalism Social justice God Emperor of Dune Human nature The Apprentice 2 Alcoholics Anonymous Calvinism Bernard Williams Internet troll The nature of God in Western theology Ethics Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Atheism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Karma in Hinduism Problem of Hell Soul Hell Origin belief Eastern Orthodox Church Jiddu Krishnamurti Phaedo Numerology Probability Microeconomics Single Transferable Vote Decision making Evil Polyamory Philosophy of mathematics Axiom of choice Victor Cousin Moral objectivism Agnosticism U.S. Electoral College Immanuel Kant Ontological argument Atomism Trinity Church of Christ Appeal Creationism Libertarian socialism Vulcan (Star Trek) Urantia Critique of Pure Reason Religion Non-aggression principle Dharma Luck Neo (The Matrix) Baptism Philosophy of science Socrates Philosophy Poker jargon Darth Revan
