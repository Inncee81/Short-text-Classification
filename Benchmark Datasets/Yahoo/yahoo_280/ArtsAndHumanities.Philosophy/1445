do you think that we really have a choice in how our life turns out or is it already pre destined for example a yr old man steals a car is sent to jail in jail he either gets bitter angry associates with other criminals becomes a better criminal or he thinks this isn't the life he wants begins pursuing an education in law then helps underpriviledged kids do you think that in either case whichever path he chooses is meant to be or the choice that was already written before he was born or do you think that a person has a choice in life and that nothing is set in stone everything is pre destined because what u regard as free will or choice in life actually isnt free will at all think about the decisions u have made in the past do u think u could have decided differently dont u think the decisions u have made so far are as good as possible knowing what u knew at the time of the decision and not afterwards dont u think ppl always try to do the best they can for themselves u could learn night and day become super smart and maybe become the ceo of a great company but most ppl dont do that they learn but they also party a lot try to enjoy life as good as poosible and simply have a good life in their younger years their parents might say this aint smart at all they should learn as hard as possible and get rich and whatever so whats the right decision some ppl are too scared to do the right thing others dont take things seriously ppl normaly only learn from mistakes they make they feel stupid afterwards for making the wrong decision they wish they would have decided differently but they just didnt know whats right and wrong before normally ppl recognize that they could not have acted any different in their lifes only after several years that means they can forgive themselves some call that the grace of god i think its just another lesson in life Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity One Tree Hill (TV series) Free will Predestination Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Phoebe Halliwell Moral objectivism Ethics Alcoholics Anonymous Summa Theologiae Pitaten Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Divine grace Abortion in Canada Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Atomic Kitten About a Boy Michael Garibaldi Theodicy EastEnders John Howard Yoder Abortion debate Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Social rule Conscience Static Shock School choice Paradox Alexander Technique Meaning of life American individualist anarchism Days of our Lives Friends Procrastination Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Nicomachean Ethics Original sin Sin Ten Commandments Salvation Time Out of Mind Age of consent Spidey Super Stories Scots law Unlawful combatant Swami Vivekananda Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Relative clause Kodocha Great Teacher Onizuka Current teachings of Prem Rawat Transactional analysis Avenue Q Sola fide The Contender (television series) Divorce Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dead Like Me Plame affair Baptism Human nature The Fall of Man Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Appeal Socrates Scenes from a Memory Aesthetic Realism European Convention on Human Rights Value system The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Pashtunwali Repentance 2004 Republican National Convention Sly Cooper Year of the Spider Godspell Decision making Patrick Star Utilitarianism Infantilism Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Athenian democracy Quicksort Opus Dei Lex Luthor Obi-Wan Kenobi Survivor (novel) Characters in the Smurfs Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Intellectual property Green Goblin Vehicular cycling
