what is your definition of the good life the good life being able to see rainbows after a great thunderstorm being able to smell the sweet scent of a blooming rose in the garden feeling the sun kiss my cheeks with her warmth gazing in awe at the intricate beauty of a snowflake and know there is no other like it witnessing a fawn being born and stand to its feet for the first time feel the mist of a rainfall dance on my skin hear the beautiful songs of the crickets and bullfrogs in the summer see the red rosy cheeks on a small child after tobogganing parking at the back of the parking lot and being able to walk on my capable legs to the entrance of the store having a healthy child and watching him grow knowing what love is how to give it as well as receive it smiles from friends tears from friends freedom tasting a juicy peach as it drips down your chin popcorn and licorice especially when you use your licorice as a straw the smell of fresh cut grass the feel of soft green grass under your bare feet watching a humming bird feed dropping a quarter in the beggars jar or guitar case handing out blankets to the homeless on sub zero nights watching children play in the sand a warm embracing hug the kind that holds you just tight enough seeing two old people still holds hands after being married for so many years i could go on and on and on but i think you get the just of what the good life is to me Hamster Peach Mango Shaggy dog story Care Bears Rose Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Trademark Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Frankie Laine Happy Tree Friends Harry Warren Christmas tree Mission UK Tofu Coffee Japanese tea ceremony Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Yoko Ono Flower Equine conformation Comanche Poker jargon The Amber Spyglass Carrie Jacobs-Bond Aerial (dance move) Cliff Richard One Piece minor characters Mattress Blonde on Blonde Professional wrestling holds The Time Machine Donna Summer Futurama (TV series - season 5) Friendship My Little Pony Cuisine of the Philippines Characters of Naruto Proprioception Dog Social rule AFI 100 Years series The Beach Boys Academy Award for Original Music Score Shawn Michaels American Black Bear Jon Secada Apple Liquorice The Ashlee Simpson Show Hansel und Gretel Yosemite National Park Rain The Lovely Bones Scarlet's Walk Trish Stratus Red Hot Chili Peppers Tom Jones (singer) Pysanka John the Baptist Breastfeeding Kodocha The McGuire Sisters Atlanta metropolitan area InuYasha media and release information U2 (band) RuneScape quests Charles Peace Remix The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bong Grunge music Alberta Characters in the Smurfs Sheryl Crow Odyssey Animal communication Mid-levels EastEnders Hersheypark Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Drifters Aida (musical) Marilyn Monroe Socrate Tori Amos Milton H.
