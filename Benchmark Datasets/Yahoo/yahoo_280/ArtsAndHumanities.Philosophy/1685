if we were all blind and had the inability to feel sense then would we all be equal if we could not see the color of ones skin and only hear their ideas and personality i thought of such things back when i was a teen however coming more into age i gained insight that it isn't so much our sensory perspective that defines our judgments of others but rather there is something more while all man born equal possessing the right by reason of nature to conduct themselves as they please this right isn't spread to everyone equally by reason of the condition of their birth ethically speaking yes we are all born equal but in reality the person that you are in this world does not choose the life they will inhabit in fact what you are born into is the laws of your birth some are born into life to have little freedoms others to dictate their freedom while others whom have the choose stand back and do nothing to release those from their enslavement and thus we have in this world the conditions of learning each conditioning fitting the need of the refinement or balance that the soul seeks after why don't people ask the questions the tough questions why one is born into the lives that they live why some are so racist that it overcomes any source of sense perception the truth is we are all equal but equal doesn't equate to being the same there is a uniqueness to each racial condition each condition period on this world some live lives like a pendulum moving back and forth between the two degrees until they have come to terms within such a person it's in many cases beyond just sense perception there is a vibrational cosmic and karma reason one can say that racist are conditioned to being so via their upbringing but this just means that they were born to be racist doesn't it this is as school not everyone is supposed to be harmonious with others Objectivist philosophy Human Epistemology Alexander Technique Theodicy Rudolf Steiner Philosophical skepticism Theory of conduct Soul Meaning of life Michel Henry Causality Simone Weil Jewish principles of faith Arthur Schopenhauer Determinism Moral objectivism Scientology beliefs and practices God Abortion debate Philosophy of language Ethics Anthroposophy Goodness and value theory Critique of Pure Reason Phaedo Deconstruction David Hume Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Summa Theologiae Reality Social justice Alignment (role-playing games) Atheism Rudolf Hermann Lotze Numerology Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Postmodernism Existence of God Moral relativism Coercion Autism Racism Thomism Black (people) Social psychology Dharma The nature of God in Western theology Polyamory Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Age of Enlightenment Cultural relativism Aristotle A Course In Miracles Karma Color Philo Religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Merit Immanuel Kant Human nature New Age Jiddu Krishnamurti Victor Cousin Buddhism Reinhold Niebuhr Atomism Science Entropy Nihilism Scientific method Logic Sexual orientation Philosophy Free will Doomsday argument Contract Nicolas Oresme S__ren Kierkegaard Libertarianism Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Sri Aurobindo Capitalism Urantia Fundamentalism Anarchism and capitalism Gravity Conscience Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Consciousness
