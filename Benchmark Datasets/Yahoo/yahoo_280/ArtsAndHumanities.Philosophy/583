am i a liberal or a conservative i don't believe in tax and spend politics and i don't think the federal government should make most or many of our own personal decisions however i do believe the federal government should step in when people try to abuse and take advantage of the common worker or hurt someone else for their own gain i know we still live in a racist culture i lived in the south long enough to learn that but i don't think people should be given advantages based on their race i'm against abortion but i think a woman has a right to choose what she does with her own body are you confused good the whole distinction between liberal and conservative is sometimes not a very useful model i've found that thoughtful people tend to have opinions like yours that don't fall neatly into one of those two categories some self proclaimed liberals conservatives are like the clueless society girl who only wears gucci or prada it's like a brand to them keep thinking out of the box not sure if the links below will help but i find them really interesting the first one is a quiz where you give your opinions about a range of issues and it claims to tell you which presidential candidate most closely matches your views the second is a list of us political parties there are some really wacky ones out there but the point is that there are more than two the last one is a quiz that plots your political views on both liberal conservative and libertarian authoritarian axes Political spectrum Conservative Party (UK) Liberal Democrats (UK) Democracy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Democratic Party (United States) American Conservatism Canadian federal election, 1993 Politics of Canada Republican Party (United States) Nolan chart Liberalism Gucci Anarchism Left-Right politics Abortion debate Pat Buchanan Moral Politics Civil rights Criticism of libertarianism Liberal Party of Canada Libertarian socialism Right-wing politics Communitarianism U.S. presidential election, 2008 Bob Rae Bill Maher U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Worldwide green parties Australian legislative election, 2004 Rick Santorum Libertarian Party (United States) Politics of the United States Third party (United States) U.S. Electoral College State Southern strategy Christian right Islam as a political movement Conservative Party of Canada People's Republic of China Progressive Conservative Party of Canada George Lakoff Michael Badnarik Ethics Plurality electoral system Feminism George W.
