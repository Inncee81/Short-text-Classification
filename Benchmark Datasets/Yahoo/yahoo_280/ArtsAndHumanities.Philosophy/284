what is love hi there i'm going to try and work through this in order love is very difficult to describe because as said many many times 'love is different for everyone' each bond relationship and friendship is unique and only understood by those who are experiencing such first of all there are different types of love that of a mother and child husband and wife brother and sister two friends boyfriend and girlfriend and other what i call instinctive love is natural you are born with this applies to every option except deeper relationships between boyfriend and girlfriend husband and wife taking brothers and sisters for example they can fight every single day and feel anger towards each other but there will always be love whereas if this happened with a couple then its likely they would break up for me the 'love ' when there's what we like to call 'chemistry' or 'a spark' between people whether that's a man and a woman a man and a man etc its the most unique type of love in my experience of this the best words i can give you are a feeling of 'rightness' and 'perfection' however before you can love you have to accept accepting is probably the hardest part because once you are truly open and conscious to most of the other person s faults you have to say 'ok i accept this is what you do' or 'ok i accept that you chose not to do this' unless you have accepted your relationship cannot grow any further or to is full potential that's my view of love any type of love is a beautiful feeling something that everybody should be able to experience love does make the world go around i believe because we tend to depend on others love to keep us going as motivation and a reason to live even the worst criminals tend to have a partner thank you great question i wish you had more answers Love Infantilism Marriage Polyamory Domestic violence Interpersonal relationship Friendship One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Sexual orientation Human Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Divorce Homosexuality A Course In Miracles Current teachings of Prem Rawat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Human sexual behavior Full House Family Incest Abortion debate Polygamy Ethics Adoption Homosexuality and Christianity Same-sex marriage Kevin and Kell Knots Landing Boston Public Rape Eastern Orthodox Church Origin belief Carl Jung Transactional analysis Social rule Days of our Lives Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Bisexuality Another World (TV series) Strap-on dildo Objectivist philosophy Religion Simone Weil Justification (theology) Mother Teresa Nicomachean Ethics For Better or For Worse Dead Like Me Expert system George Costanza Charmed Socrates Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Mary, the mother of Jesus Maison Ikkoku BDSM Internet troll The Ashlee Simpson Show Lesbian Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sharon Tate Sadism and masochism History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Fathers' rights Heterosexuality Kodocha Western philosophy Economic inequality Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Narcissism Grief Alignment (role-playing games) T'Pol Physical attractiveness Kimi Finster Scientific method David and Jonathan The Lovely Bones Zoophilia Merit Theodicy Will & Grace Urantia Women in Islam Once and Again Order of succession
