what's the point of burying or cremating the dead why not put the bodies out for scavengers the town where i live has more land devoted to cemetaries than parks i've read numerous articles talking about corpse bacteria showing up in drinking water because scavengers will take care of the body a lot faster than decomposition it seems like that wouldn't be as much of a problem if the body's left out for animals so what is the point of devoting so much the land required for cemetaries materials required for a casket urn and the fuel required for cremation to decaying matter if you wish to claim respect as a reason i demand an answer to the following two questions how is it disrespectful to do things the way nature intended how is it more respectful to have bacteria do it the end result is the same however your way results in much more pollution and consumption of resources such as land wood metal fuel etc clean sure if pumping people full of a carcinogen putting them in a box covered in toxic substances and sticking them in the ground through which the rain water goes is what you consider clean and don't forget the drinking water tainted with corpse bacteria yummy i actually boil my water before using it now becauseof that if you wish to use clean as a reason how is it more clean to do the above paragraph than to put it out in the country for the coyotes wolves bears etc or in the oceans for the sharks i remember seeing a show on the parsis though i couldn't remember their name interesting group they are in years we'll be at billion souls on this earth at our current rate of growth at what point will it be mandatory that we find a more efficient way of getting rid of our dead Cremation Burial Renewable energy Decomposition Energy development Nuclear power Future energy development Water (molecule) Funeral Hydrogen economy Eutrophication Alcohol fuel Theory of conduct Environmental concerns with electricity generation Embalming Coffin Water purification Flood geology Burial at sea Explosive material Jewish bereavement Organic farming Earth Carbon dioxide Alkane Tooth Water resources Hydrogen Kyoto Protocol Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Water pollution Death Brewery Marine aquarium Coal Foodborne illness Uranium David Hume Economy of the People's Republic of China Methane Gasoline Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Nuclear reactor Hydrogen vehicle Bacteria Vampire Microeconomics Biodiesel Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Environmental Protection Agency Hubbert peak theory Overpopulation Coffee Hydrogen peroxide Pollution Helium Ecco the Dolphin Mummy Abiogenic petroleum origin Air pollution Carburetor Two-stroke cycle Heinkel He 100 Spacecraft propulsion Cancer Menstrual cup Solar power Capitalism Indian caste system Carnivorous plant Social rule Space Shuttle program Fossil fuel power plant Factory farming Ozone Economy of Norway Theodicy Alcoholic beverage Vacuum Hard disk Rum Methanol Immortality Soil Wealth Origin belief Diesel engine The Skeptical Environmentalist Sant Thakar Singh FairTax
