what is mind whats the nature of mind is mind independent of matter body or is their a link what is the state of link this won't be easy to understand sorry but mind is existence itself mind is what it is to be people typically mistake ego for mind the ego is just a fleeting perspective of mind the ego deludes itself it thinks it is mind it thinks it has a past and a future beyond the present moment but in reality the ego has no past or future the self that the ego believes itself to be is an illusion there is actually no such self mind in contrast to ego is eternal and non physical in the sense that it is not in time or in space the best way to get a handle on this is to understand a photon according to einstein's relativity something traveling at the speed of light never ages and never moves through space as viewed from its own perspective photons of course always travel at the speed of light so there is no such thing as time or space from a photon's perspective a photon is physical in the sense that it interacts with the physical world and thus is measurable by physicists but a photon's perspective is not physical in the sense that it does not involve any measurable expanse of time or space within the photon's frame of reference the entire billion year history of the universe is just a single moment and the entire physical expanse of the universe is a single point thus the photon is outside of spacetime in the sense that there is no such things as physical distance or the flow of time for a photon the mind is eternal and non physical in this sense what we experience as space and time arise because the transition from indeterminate being a k a nothingness the pregnant void etc to determinate being where some object x is what it is in contrast to all that is not x necessarily involves limitation a determinate thing cannot be both x and not x thus to be x at all x must necessarily be limited and mind experiences this limitation in terms of momentary perspectives mind itself is intrinsic to all perspectives but each perspective by its very nature is limited and thus from any given perspective the mind experiences being as being a particular limited being since each perspective is limited it cannot embrace all of being within a single moment or at a single place mind is both x and not x but due to the limited natures of all determinate beings mind cannot experience being determinate x and not x at the same time and in the same place thus determinate experience engenders a sense of space and time thus allowing mind to experience for example being two feet tall and being feet tall at different stages of life spacetime is how mind experiences the coexistence of contradictory properties mind can be both x and not x but mind can only experience being x and being not x in its spatio temporal mode which is to say it experience being x at one point in spacetime and being not x at another the neurological activities involved in memory allows mind to experience itself as an individual moving through time and space but the metaphysical roots of the continuity that we experience as being an individual self going through various stages of life is to be found not at the level of ego but rather in the universal nature of mind without memory mind would not recognize itself from one moment to the next because in reality no thing exists from one moment to the next the physical mechanisms of memory give mind the experiential sense of flowing from one moment to the next through a limited stream of spatial locations those that are physically connected to the neural network responsible for memory but the ultimate root of this sense of continuity through this span of time is not the physical entity itself but rather the non spatio temporal nature of mind we can be there at every point in our spatio temporal lives because the one mind is in effect everywhere and everywhen thus by implication if somehow it happens that your memories are recreated in some sort of physical system a million years from now it will be you who is there in just the same sense that it will be you who wakes up in your bed tomorrow morning you exist in every moment of your life because mind is not limited to any specific point is spacetime you are being itself existing in a mode that limits itself and thus does not recognize itself for what it really is so the bottom line is that there is in reality one mind but each of us is a limited determinate being so we don t experience ourselves as one mind but rather we experience ourselves as limited beings ultimately we are one but due to the limitations of being the determinate beings that we are we experiences ourselves as distinct isolated essences individual souls selves egos our sense of existential isolation is thus true in some sense it is truly how we experience ourselves but illusory in another sense it is not truly what we are Free will Human
