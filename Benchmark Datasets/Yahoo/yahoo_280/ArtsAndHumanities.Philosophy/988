sartre and terrorism a philosophical question following the munich massacre in which eleven israeli olympians were killed by the palestinian organization black september in munich sartre said terrorism is a terrible weapon but the oppressed poor have no others sartre also found it perfectly scandalous that the munich attack should be judged by the french press and a section of public opinion as an intolerable scandal keep in mind that palestinians have no rights to enter the olympic games soccer tournaments film art festivals etc since their country is not on the map agree or disagree why as always be fair show some proof have a logical argument and be nice so far everyone makes such good points it's going to be difficult picking a best answer i see the conflict as a political one one side wants the land back while the other is afraid to give it back one side wants to be back on the map as it was before and the rest of the world is deaf to this request i am aware of the monotheistic religions but i think people use them as a pretext it troubles me that in mainstream media no one mentions that some palestinians are christians orthodox like the greeks if we took that into consideration we'd have to admit that certain individuals who claim to blow things up in the name of islam which is a pretext since the koran does not condone suicide for instance do not represent all palestinians of course my goal is to see peace not war in addition anyone who uses religion to reason any bad action to me shows ignorance from a psychological perspective i think the individuals who do these horrible things are ill mentally in order to stop people from blowing themselves up i think one must treat them as children after reading various doctors without borders articles i realized that palestinian children grow up in terrible conditions those dire conditions are what make angry grown ups who seek revenge of course i do not agree with violent actions but i am beginning to understand why they do this the same principle as with any abuser applies when one is abused as a child he has high risk to turn into an abuser if only they had the proper medical care we may have a chance at peace if they could attain that peace both israelis and palestinians could thrive and become quite rich as countries as their number one source of income could be tourism holy sites for all religions i'm thinking of course of the vatican as an example that's just my view on it of course conflict in palestina is a very complicated issue because beliefs religions and race also play important roles in that prolonged conflict and up to now there is no sign that both sides will come to an agreement it is difficult to see who is right and who is wrong however terrorism is never a desired way to achieve our goal how noble our goal is violence creates other violence and it will become a chain reaction all sides usa israel and palestina should show good intention to live in peace for common welfare Arab-Israeli conflict Jean-Paul Sartre Al-Aqsa Intifada Suicide bombing Terrorism Oslo Accords International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Israeli West Bank barrier Goodness and value theory Terrorism against Israel Yusuf al-Qaradawi Palestinian territories Religion War on Terrorism Objectivist philosophy Democracy Theory of conduct Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religious pluralism Palestinian National Authority Cult New anti-Semitism Anti-Zionism Opposition to cults and new religious movements Sabra and Shatila massacre Noam Chomsky Palestinian political violence Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Peace Zionism Liberalism Israel Children and minors in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict State Peace movement Militant Plame affair Lebanese Civil War Operation Days of Penitence Abortion debate Israeli-Palestinian conflict timeline Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs Divorce Battle of Jenin 2002 Simone Weil Israeli settlement Fundamentalism Scientology beliefs and practices Road map for peace Christianity Existence of God History of Israel Meaning of life Mahmoud Abbas Philosophy Atheism Domestic violence Consensus decision-making Deconstruction Ramallah Suicide Military use of children UN Security Council Resolution 242 Utilitarianism Separation of church and state Anti-Defamation League Palestinian Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an International Solidarity Movement 2003 Invasion of Iraq Judaism Amnesty International Post-September 11 anti-war movement Ethics Coercion Philosophy of language Ten Commandments Islam as a political movement Assassination Involuntary commitment Wye River Memorandum Logic Autism rights movement Six-Day War A Course In Miracles Population transfer Moral relativism John Howard Yoder Ariel Sharon Infant baptism
