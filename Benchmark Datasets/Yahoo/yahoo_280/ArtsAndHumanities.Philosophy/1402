a self conscious thing basically i've got this cut on my head that i don't know where it came from this is beside the point the problem is that i have been self consciously pick at it and it's not just that you know those things you pull up and down a curtain with will i'm sitting on the couch i end up playing with it like a cat without realizing it ok thats an over exaggeration but i do little things like that and those things make my mom crazy they don't just drive her crazy they drive me crazy so my question is how do i stop these self conscious things i do you need to look at these from another point of view they are not just self conscious things they are habits example you blink your eyes so often that you do not realize that it is a natural habit to do it you breath in and out and that is a natural habit that you are not thinking about since you just do it we are all creatures of habit we dress the same way every day we get out of bed the same way we come in the door the same way we eat the same way to stop a habit you have to consciously refrain from doing the same thing the same way more than twice in a row if you do it more than twice you are already training your brain to do something in a habit form the key to self control is to keep what you are doing in your conscious mind at all times and not in your subconscious mind then you will stay in control of it that takes practice but if you think about not doing a habit the same way more than a few times you will have no problem retraining your mind to stay focused in the conscious mind Unconscious mind Human Milton H.
