would u prefer to hear lie or truth why in truth i must say neither because whichever one i choose will lead me to sadness because of the knowledge they bring i don't care how open minded a person is when they hear something they don't like they'll be mad we forget that the truth hurts knowing that everything you hear is a lie is the same as knowing the truth it seem that the more a wise man learns the more he realizes that he knows far too little and that makes for a sad wise man the wise often envy the ignorant because ignorance is bliss of course i don't know anyone who would knowingly choose ignorance in order to be happy but neither would the wise choose either truth or lies because to choose that kind of pain is nothing less than masochistic Socrates Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Theory of conduct Stoicism Michel Henry Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory Theodicy Shaggy dog story Sadism and masochism Kosas Bhajan Summa Theologiae Phaedo Merit Social rule Plame affair Richard Rahl Brahman Utilitarianism Pitaten Supporting Characters (Xenogears) LaVeyan Satanism Wise Blood Muslim ibn Aqeel Sri Aurobindo Pok__mon Live!
