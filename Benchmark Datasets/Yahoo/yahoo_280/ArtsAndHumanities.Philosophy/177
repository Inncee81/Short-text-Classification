based on string theory there are eleven dimensions can you dig that for generations mathematicians kept working to solve an equation and finally it was solved it was proven mathematicly that there are eleven dimension and the smallest partical is a string i believe that ther are ufos and now i came to a conclusion that why we are not able to see them is because they are traveling in other dimensions they are aware of us primitive beings and may be hundreds of thousands of years ahead of us learning and accepting the string theory is the way to go if we want to know the truth and how nature works and what is the reality a string being the smallest element is never going to be proved in labrotory we may never have the facilities to test and observe a string therefore can't be called scietific but that is expected and since our facilities are primitive doesn't mean it isn't a fact mathematics are a means of making sense of our nature and all the technology we see and will see in future we owe it to math it doesn't lie i can dig it in fact there is five types of string theory Mathematics String theory G__del's incompleteness theorem Dimension Philosophy of mathematics Complexity classes P and NP Halting problem Science General relativity Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace M-theory Exact solutions in general relativity Matrix (mathematics) Where Mathematics Comes From Adjoint functors Luminiferous aether Spacetime Complex number Reality Physics Theory of everything Ordinary differential equation Many-worlds interpretation Arthur Cayley A New Kind of Science Real number Joseph Louis Lagrange Time travel Extraterrestrial hypothesis Randomness Mathematician Special relativity Naive set theory Mathematics of general relativity Numerology Wallpaper group Epistemology Infinity Hilbert space Prime number Cardinal number D-brane A Beautiful Mind Singularity theory Dark energy Henri Poincar__ Transformation problem Causality Philosophy of space and time Philosophy of science Vacuous truth Pi Axiom Intelligent design Logic Technology Collision detection The nature of God in Western theology Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Srinivasa Ramanujan Probability Computation Postmodernism Interpretation of quantum mechanics Natural deduction Fibonacci number Philosophical skepticism Monstrous moonshine Loop quantum gravity Solar system Boolean algebra Fermi paradox Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sociocultural evolution Category theory Dynamical system IP (complexity) Sheaf (mathematics) Mathematical logic Simone Weil Lattice (group) Manifold Lorentz group Einstein's field equation Artificial consciousness Physical paradox Doomsday argument Trigonometric function String (computer science) Examples of groups NUMB3RS
