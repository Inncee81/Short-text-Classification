knowledge help or hurt friendship so me and my friends are talking about knowledge and friendship and i would like to get some other thoughts from other people so my question is does having great knowledge help a friendship or does it hurt current friendships let me put it to you this way do you think people want to be friends with you because you're smart so being smart helps make friends yes or no when a true genius appears in the world you may know him by this sign that the dunces are all in confederacy against him but if the person with great knowledge can step down off his or her high horse for at least a little bit everyday then some people might be able to stand it of course that's a very bleak look at everything can't say i can lump everyone with knowledge in that category actually people with real knowledge are quite nice to be around it's the jerks who think they have knowledge who are real pains Friendship Franklin Pierce Theory of conduct Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Alcoholics Anonymous A Confederacy of Dunces Socrates Social rule Meaning of life Kim Possible Nicomachean Ethics Friedrich Nietzsche Jewish Messiah Undergrads One Tree Hill (TV series) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Philipp Melanchthon Rich Mullins Pitaten Philosophy of language Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Bon Jovi Gertrude Stein Past teachings of Prem Rawat Neil Gaiman Pashtunwali Scientific skepticism Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Azumanga Daioh Expert system FOXHOUND Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Trish Stratus Epistemology Rudolf Hermann Lotze Cindy Sheehan Reality Scouting Animism .hack//SIGN The nature of God in Western theology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mojave people Power (sociology) Lex Luthor Street Smarts (game show) John Kennedy Toole Peter Griffin Martin Heidegger Care Bears Knowledge management Critique of Pure Reason The Dunciad Characters of Smallville Sinfest Bentley (Sly Cooper) Jon Secada Serial killer Sant Thakar Singh Jeopardy! in culture The Angry Beavers Bhagavad Gita Narrator The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Phaedo 2000 Australian Grand Prix Horse tack Philip J.
