is it right for a mother to shoot her son to prevent him from killing his father this is not a trick question it is a straight moral one seek your views and reasoning hello well if the father has done terrible things in his life towards his child and wife then the boy might have snapped and could not take it anymore thus killing the father then the mother should have not killed her son if the father was an normal person and the son would have just jumped on the neck of his father to kill him then the mother is right killing her son to prevent tragedies lost of son in prison and lost husband in death but maybe there were some unknown things between father and son that the mother did not know so the son killed the father maybe in an act of defence for future possible things that might have happened like killing his mother and taking money or any other scenario then the main point to this story you made killing should not even happen but it is and it is an part of life even if we don t like it and it is not normal but i agree the mother should have killed her son to prevent tragedies but in real life i have to say to you even in the worst stories mothers can t kill they re sons if she has no psychological problems even so in the end it is an act of defence Abortion debate Theory of conduct The Brothers Karamazov Bernard Williams Identity Crisis (comics) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Suicide About a Boy Arjuna The Amber Spyglass Mystique (comics) Wang Mang Infantilism Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Vernon Schillinger 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Children of Dune Memento (film) Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Hamlet Only Fools and Horses Pitaten Capital punishment EastEnders Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Alois Hitler Rape Utilitarianism Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist David Theodicy Free will Scenes from a Memory Sexual orientation Rick Santorum Blood purity (Harry Potter) Drama Prisoner's dilemma Luke Skywalker Harry Potter (character) Miss Saigon Heir Apparent Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Little Shop of Horrors Milton H.
