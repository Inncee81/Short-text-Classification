at face value how much is peace worth sorry ultraviolet dear all the tea in china does work as a wish but i have a problem with all the goods we buy labeled made in china i long for the days when the lable said made in japan nowadays anything with a lable that says made in the usa should be bagged preserved and used as future evidence ephod we are talking pearl of great price lodi great point it is relative how can you know what true peace is unless it eventually happens then how will you know it is real art you know essence not much if wish to translate it to a dollar value only the dead are safe and at peace how much do you want to say you are right about anything the letters of war spell we are right when mankind's spiritually matures then it maybe possible for spirituality to overcome materialism then after a few centuries peace may become the new paradigm of world civilization by spirituality i don't mean weekly attending church mouthing rote prayers dissembling platitudes and wearing sunday go to meeting clothes i mean where you communicate directly with god whatever you concieve god to be constantly from the heart to the heart soul to soul peace is free and always available the hard part is doing it or at least trying personal peace is always available on a social level it starts getting difficult because when a concensus must be reached to do anything then everybody in that unit must believe something even if it is just that the group is right what happens when any group believes they are right about anything they say we are right there are enough of these groups that become fanatical crazies to the point that their we are right must overcome all the others claiming the same thing on a group level this is where fanatics of christianity become kkk or fundamentalist islamists become al queda or anything judgement stops thought that is how the nazis juggernauted throughout europe etc until enough people said wait a sec adolph we disagree many people believe in a holy book such as koran bible or bagavad gita etc and all of them state the same tenets basically to love god your neighbor and yourself those books explain that in the form of commandments one of them is god's favorite and most ignored thou shall not murder kill to accomodate the exigencies of the material world and their particular way of life it got worked over at first they took little liberties such as interpreting it as don't murder your family friends then don't murder those of your faith and so on if fact there is only one true commandment love god if you love god then you could not possibly break any of the other commandments such a depth of spirituality requires a maturity beyond mankind's current state humankind tends to be materialistic and many in a crass and vulgar way the world economy is based on this peace is nor profitable nor fun in a materialistic way humankind requires the anomy of striving for something the challenge of surviving and cannot tolerate peace because this would require control of their ego place in society and a different structure placed on self humankind has always had the resources to ensure hunger and want need not be prevalent throughout the planet what happens when a virus or microbe or animal colony is fed they reproduce more mouths to feed bodies to train brains to teach we are pretty much there a majority of this planet live and eat in relative peace comfort so are you willing to give up your car ipod laptop or tv to feed a village for a year not really necessary people have died will die and will always die humankind is basically one soul that has many material connections what family tribe or civilization you belong to is only your belief your human body is like a coat of many colors your soul is eternal while your soul is eternal your coat is not eternal if you are going from a to b you may tear a patch on your coat do you toss away the entire coat for a tiny tear on your journey through inhospitable weather war poverty will always exist there will be those you can help along in humankind's journey and many you cannot help but keep your center and continue your journey peace will evolve in its inevitable way in due course just don't hold your breath help as many as you can on your journey and don't be ashamed nor grieved to accept help either just move forward on your
