about crumbs if you have a crumb on the table and you cut it in half will you then have crumbs or halves of a crumb that depends if you knew the crumb was cut into two then your view would be that you now have two halves of a historical crumb if you did not have prior knowledge of this crumb you would assume that the two pieces are two crumbs technically you would have zero crumbs as the original crumb structure was significantly modified when it was cut and that when put alongside normal crumbs from the same source these two pieces would not match and would therefore not qualify to be called crumbs any longer the assumption that there is only one crumb to begin with is a hypothetical one why if one had microscopic vision then one would probably have observed a sea of crumb like material on the surface i think the question is absolutely relative and every answer would therefore be correct until proven incorrect Knife Law of value Doomsday argument Natural deduction Speed of light Maxwell's equations Color Faster-than-light Science Many-worlds interpretation Solar system Kosher foods X86 assembly language Diamond cut Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Determinism Species Plame affair Theodicy Theories and sociology of the history of science Flood geology Gravity Scientific method Passover Bayesian inference Philosophy of mathematics George Crumb Normal distribution Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Stereoscopy Sea level rise New Testament Quizbowl Luminiferous aether ELO rating system Black hole Epistemology Equivalence principle General relativity Fermi paradox Bayes' theorem Manifold Scientific revolution Transformation problem Summa Theologiae Abiogenesis Crossword Table tennis Philosophical skepticism Classical mechanics Quantum mechanics Diamond Complexity classes P and NP Eyepiece Physical paradox Pottery Origin belief Intelligent design Logic Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Comet Kensington Runestone Fallacy Time travel Prices of production Postmodernism Esperanto vocabulary Margin of error Temperature Drawing Polarization Goodness and value theory Floppy disk Daylight saving time Second language acquisition Creation science Bell's theorem Killian documents Casting Draw poker Expert system Pressure Property (ownership right) The Joker's Wild Microeconomics Electron microscope IMAX Labor theory of value Non-standard analysis Hebrew calendar Atheism Philosophy of language Heim theory Fried chicken Victor Cousin Parallax Ontological argument Ethics
