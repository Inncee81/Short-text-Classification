anybody can tell me what is the meaning of love foong is so sad about love can anybody tell me what is the meaning of love anybody got story to share thanks for helping me i don't know about everyone else but for me i know that i love when i would put another's best interest and comfort before mine with no questions nor regrets i know that i love when i would forgive another even before they thought of the words i'm sorry i know that i love when i would feel another's pain as mine and would gladly endure the agony if only i may siphon it into my being i know that i love when i would put pride and selfish feelings in the backseat whilst they would share an obstructed view out the windshield with me in this journey we all call life and i know that i love when i would always visit upon them in my prayers so that they would know peace and courage to endure this life without me if i were to suddenly depart this world well it's like that for me at least A Course In Miracles John Howard Yoder Scenes from a Memory Love Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Duties of the Heart Evil Current teachings of Prem Rawat W.I.T.C.H.
