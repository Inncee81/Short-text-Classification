why do most people think and talk badly of the rain and good of sun because to be honest yes sunshine is nice now and again but i see more beauty in the rain and i think the rain falling down onto your shoulders feels nicer than the hot sun on your face so why do most people prefer sun which do you prefer and why abcdefghij stupidity read the question and answer in educated english how can you prefer both firstly i'm aware that sun gives light and rain gives water how can you prefer both anyway yes i agree that both have their uniue ways of spreading beauty i didn't chose which one is good and which is bad actually i'm simply stating my preference and asking for others opinions also i didn't say about never having sunshine or never having rain i said sunshine is nice now and again i had difficulty understanding the last part of your question maybe a dictionary would help sorry to sound rude but before calling something stupid understand what it is your calling take care i like rain even at the most inconvenient times it's nice and when you want to hide you can drench yourself in the pouring water from above to me a sun's like a spotlight you're easily seen and just noticeable generally since the sun is bright and the rain is cloudy and dark in order to happen that would indicate goodness for the sun and darkness for the rain generally but hey without rain or the sun working together you won't have a rainbow Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Singlish Climate of the United Kingdom Discordianism Cliff Richard Shit Sunlight Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Sun Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Futurama (TV series - season 5) Honesty Rainbow Social rule AFI 100 Years series Kanji Goodness and value theory Care Bears Simone Weil Ages of Myst Frankie Laine Mountaineering Roxette Cloud Password Bad Wolf English grammar Jon Secada Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kyle Broflovski Opportunity rover Shaggy dog story Aesthetic Realism Shen Gong Wu Photography Wheel of Fortune Eli Siegel Transactional analysis Gravity Socrates Adoption Titan (moon) Leviathan (book) Avenue Q Jumpstart 3rd Grade Sydney Riot of 1879 Kodocha Sampling (music) Expert system Entropy The Pet Sounds Sessions Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Ra (board game) Microeconomics Missouri Compromise Japanese grammar Hangul Empire Burlesque Textile manufacturing Season Hey Jude Renewable energy DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Autism rights movement Milton H.
