do you consider people who go to college lemmings i hope not since i am currently a college student i am assuming you are describing college students as lemmings because going to college after high school is what most people do whether they want to or not i think it depends on the motivations behind going if you're just going to college because you think it's expected of you you're just going in the hopes of earning as much money as possible or to avoid the real world for another years then yes you'd be a lemming if you're going because you love learning or you really want to work in a field law medicine teaching etc that requires a higher education then no you're probably not a lemming personally i am going to college because i love learning and as a personal goal which is to get a bachelor's degree in history i'm an adult student well past my 's and am definitely not going because i think i'll make big bucks with a history degree you want fries with that so i don't consider myself a lemming either Juris Doctor Education in the United States Community college Graduate school Education in Australia Master's degree Medical school Education Physician Academic degree Law school Education in the People's Republic of China Lawyer Doctorate Education in Finland Education in Portugal Associate's degree Chinese University of Hong Kong Teacher Degrees of Oxford University Education in Germany Dentistry Education in the Republic of Ireland Homeschooling Paralegal Trinity College, Dublin Higher education Columbia University University of San Francisco Education in Hong Kong Software engineering Academia Professor Temple University No Child Left Behind Act High school University Education in Taiwan Medicine Bachelor of Arts Education in Japan University of Houston Motivation Chiropractic The College of New Jersey Nurse College admissions Memorial University of Newfoundland Robert Hutchins Alexander Technique City and Guilds of London Institute University of Bristol University of Szeged General practitioner Multilingual Seneca College Grade (education) Bologna process Distance education SAT GED Athabasca University Experiential education Education in India Cooperative education Education in Sweden University of California, Los Angeles Georgetown University Australian Qualifications Framework University of Santo Tomas Literacy Virginia Commonwealth University Salt Lake Community College Doctor of Philosophy University of Alabama Far Eastern University Current teachings of Prem Rawat Tai Chi Chuan University of Pittsburgh Marylhurst University Education in Malaysia Textbook Affirmative action Nanjing University Student loan Advanced Placement Program Washington University in St. Louis American University Master of Laws Cornell University Culture of the United States Education in Singapore University of Notre Dame Medical University of South Carolina ITESM Coeducation Otterbein College Boston University Johns Hopkins University
