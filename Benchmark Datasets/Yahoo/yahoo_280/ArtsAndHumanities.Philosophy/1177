how far away do you feel your mind has traveled awake or asleep sometimes i'll look at an object and imagine zooming in on it i'll go through it in my mind reaching its chemical makeup all the way down to the atoms of which it's composed i'll then zoom out in my mind and see humans as rather large and in control of things in the world i'll go further out and notice how tiny people are in the scheme of things i'll go further and further until the earth is minuscule and much larger planets catch my eye eventually i can't imagine anymore because i don't know anymore i'll come back down into my mind and i'll look around and try to guess what everyone else might be imagining when driving down the road sitting in on an assembly or anything else The Amber Spyglass Spacecraft propulsion Out-of-body experience Alien races from the Godzilla films The nature of God in Western theology Earth Girl Arjuna Atomism Shaggy dog story Datalore (TNG episode) Solar system Haven (TNG episode) Consciousness Lucid dreaming The Subtle Knife Oh My Goddess!
