do more dreams or more nightmares come true fascinating you asked this this morning digressing as i tend to do last night i committed myself to a happy dream i had a long long dream actually the dream itself probably only lasted a second or two but time stretches in dreams through the entire dream i was laughing to tears when i woke up i was laughing out loud neither dreams nor nightmares come true in a literal sense recurring dreams of deep emotion contain messages in symbols metaphors that in retrospect come true for example i had a recurring dream i record them in journals that i referred to as losing my place in every dream there was an extreme shock of realization that i'd somehow left my place could never return a very emotional sense of being forever lost wandering in search of it but knowing i could never go back i hated these dreams but did i get the message no indeed i literally left my place spent some years disoriented regretful messages in dreams or nightmares come true now i examine any pattern i see developing evaluate its metaphors as to what's happening in my life decisions choices absolutely rely on them to guide me i've not erred so far edit theviking has really gone over the top your avatar is handsome reminds me of the guys in playgirl magazines my sister got for a brief priod of her life audacious opinion that should be kept to himself really Miss Saigon W.I.T.C.H.
