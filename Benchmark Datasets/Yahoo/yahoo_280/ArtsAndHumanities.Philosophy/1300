can win win situation be a reality or is it an illusion due to viewing from different angles and perspectives i believe that the real sum of the cause and its effect ought to be zero whereas the 'win win' assumes doubly positive there might be even triple or more positive effects if i take one seed just one little bean seed and i put it into the earth and i tend it in giving the earth enough moisture and putting a stalk into the ground where the plant can crawl up i might have from one seed several profitable positives i might be able to teach my son the law of sow and reap i might reap at least new bean seeds from one seed sown i can sow them the other year which will give me back and if i put this into the earth the next year i will reap beans i could not only make home made bean soup from that but also give it to my neighbors and in that would win the vibration of joyful thoughts even if one person would carry this joyfulness into their daily life with others and spread the joy i would be part of the cause of this joy and i might win the most high prize the realization that i helped to make the earth a happier place you know often the cause and effect cannot be zeroed out but good caused in some way will always grow like a bean plant bringing more and more good even to unexpected places and with unexpected effects hallelujah Vegetarianism 613 mitzvot Current teachings of Prem Rawat Soul Vicia faba Microeconomics Karma in Hinduism Bean Dead Like Me Barley Bean (character) Flax Seed Vanilla Sprouting Tobacco Francis Light Happiness Norman Borlaug Demeter Peanut Turnip (brassica rapa) Determinism Divine grace Value added Keynesian economics A Course In Miracles Religion Mazer Rackham Reincarnation Coffee Supply and demand Agriculture Sub-Zero Patent Poker jargon Coffea arabica Inflation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Garden Strawberry Stratification (botany) Complex number Xiaolin Showdown Summa Theologiae Global warming and agriculture Common bean Vegeta Plough Professional wrestling holds Past teachings of Prem Rawat Potato God Tofu Incentive Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Celery Biodiversity Book of Isaiah Ten Commandments Biblical inerrancy Guinea pig Advaita Vedanta The Matrix Bible and reincarnation Externality Luck Michel Henry Edgar Cayce Death of a Salesman Tomato Car handling Maize Divorce Inca mythology Holy Spirit Equine conformation Gambling Simone Weil Tillage Bulk vending Heaven Storytelling Coriolis effect Luminiferous aether Illegal drug trade Ethics in religion Achilles de Flandres Strap-on dildo Merit Bamboo Alignment (role-playing games) Rice Baseball Microphone Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Oakland Athletics Johnny Appleseed
