what if our world was watch by intelligences whats the best answer for this question i would have to say that for the most part i would probably feel like a lab rat and wonder why they have not made themselves visible to us and hope that they are watching us to try and find ways of helping us out i for one definitely believe that there are extra terrestrial beings out there i think the reason we have not had any of them making themselves public is probably because first of all so far as i know intelligent life the type of intellect to create machines etc is probably living on one out of a trillion worlds or so worlds perhaps even far less then that and i believe this because again so far as i know you need an unbelievable amount of events to occur properly for a suitable environment planet to support life then needing several environmental changes events etc to eventually bring forth complex creatures in the evolutionary process also all of the signals that we have sent into outer space satellites tv radio waves etc have not reached far at all if you consider the number of galaxies planets etc that are out there personally myself i believe that the universe is infinite if other extra terrestrials are trying to contact us ones that have roughly the same type of intellect as us they would probably have to search for and detect our signals like finding a needle in an unimaginably large haystack same with us when we are trying to find extra terrestrials there are also several senses that we do not have or that are not developed enough except for perhaps a select few people which they may have and visa verse which could make it virtually impossible to detect each others presence in the universe this would likely be because us and them would see experience the universe so differently that we may not even detect each other attempts for communication even if the signals pr what have you were right in front of our faces super civilizations i also believe that those that are far beyond us technologically intellect wise etc could reach us by other means but that they may be an unimaginably long distance away perhaps even so far away that they are well beyond the parts of the universe that us humans have seen through telescopes etc they may want to contact us and help our world to reach a new age on infinite understanding possibilities that we could only dream of perhaps even far beyond that but that they are too far away to make a visit to the earth a reality others may even be in another realm plain of existence and some may have visited us through dreams visions and other eerie phenomena since those may be the only ways that they can communicate with us perhaps there are some roaming the earth right now that are invisible to the visible light spectrum maybe even all other spectrum's tests etc that we know of so they could be right in front of us and we may not even know it they may not even know of us if they live in totally different reality that is all around us but that we can not detect so next time you hear a dog barking a cat hissing etc for no apparent reason perhaps they are sensing those extra terrestrials presence freaky stuff also have you ever had that eerie feeling that you were being watched but when you turned around no one was their perhaps someone or something was their but could not be seen others may just simply find us too under developed looking at us as many people would say worms ants etc after all i do not know of any people who try to introduce themselves talking about the human race and so on to worms or ants far too boring and not worth the effort since worms or ants would not understand our complexities no matter how hard we tried to teach them others may think that we are too boring interest wise looking upon us as we would a plain old gray rock far to boring since many are probably trying to expand upon themselves reaching new understandings and experiencing sights sounds emotions events etc that are soooo unimaginably far beyond our human capabilities high hopes for our future i am more than certain that at some point that we will meet other extra terrestrials and or them meeting us and change ours and perhaps even their lives forever changing who we and they are opening us all up to new views on the universe our selves life its self etc perhaps even opening us up to possibilities that we never even though of who knows perhaps we will be the first to make contact so that to them we would be the extra terrestrials could this be true i believe that einstein s calculations for the effects of travel toward at and beyond the speed of light were correct at least in a visual sense because the calculations were just for the images that were visible imagine riding with beams of light for example if one travels away from the earth faster then the speed of light and if they were to look back at the earth seeing everything perfectly they would see everything moving backwards this is because they would be catching up with older images like when a galaxy from say a million light years away is viewed you are seeing what it looked like a million years ago took a million years for the older images to reach us also if one was looking at that galaxy and headed towards it at well beyond the speed of light then it would appear that that galaxy not you is moving into the future but you are only catching up with the newer images i also believe that if you are traveling close to the speed of light you will not slow time down true you would see everyone thing behind you moving much shower the closer you got to light speed but what i believe is actually happening is that the beams of light images are taking longer to reach catch up to you same analogy with the galaxy a million light years away if you were to go exactly at the speed of light time would not freeze and would not allow you yourself to have time frozen around you but you would just be traveling with the same images beams of light you guessed it same galactic analogy here too talk about some interesting food for thought in such an awesome universe with so many possibilities i think to myself how would it be possible for extra terrestrials not to exist i have lots of info that i think you will find quite helpful and enlightening http yahoo com blorm multaeeneea lavacom for tons of inspirational info http ecowellness multiply com for all the environmental info let us all strive for a greener brighter future by helping to create a solid foundation for future generations to build upon so we can hand them a beautiful world filled with never ending awe and wonders where peoples differences and uniqueness are accepted where we all live as one helping one another so that we can all play our own mysteriously beautiful melodies in the never ending awe inspiring song of life i truly have faith in humanity and believe that someday our lives and
