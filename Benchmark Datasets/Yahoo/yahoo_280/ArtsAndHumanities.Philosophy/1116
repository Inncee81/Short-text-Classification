whats ur opininon on life on the scale of earthly time individual lives are but mere blinks of an eye we're born we live we die and then you're not heard from ever again there might be a tombstone or family tree made with your name on it but eventually the tombstone weathers from age and who knows what media your family tree will be used all the memories and accomplishments will be totally forgotten unless you're a hitler or alexander the great type person in a thousand years your bones will be dust and no other trace of your existence will be seen unless of course you become fossilized for some reason but even then after thousands of years more that will be disintegrated into dust we influence the lives of our children and others but they too will eventually die so what's the point of living in astronomical terms the earth will eventually succumb to the supernova of our sun it's an astonomically certainty the earth will be burned to a crisp so does death render our lives meaningless if we were immortal that would be the ultimate in boredom repetition day after day of doing the same thing for thousands of years hundreds may be ok but nothing beyond that but i digress back to the meaning of our little lives it all boils down to how creative we can be in the short period of time we have on this earth our activities need to be worthwhile for their own sake not because they fulfill some supernatural transcendental purpose live damnit Solar system Supernova Meaning of life H II region Soul Immortality Sri Aurobindo Comet S__ren Kierkegaard Age of the Earth Existence of God Scientology beliefs and practices Reincarnation God Earth Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Stellar evolution Summa Theologiae A Course In Miracles Mantra Day-Age Creationism Supernatural Sun Arjuna Comet Hale-Bopp Intelligent design Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Flood geology Young Earth creationism Religion Atheism Jewish bereavement Goodness and value theory Human extinction Angel Extrasolar planet Parallax Time travel Incarnations of Immortality Evolutionary creationism Adam and Eve Astronomy Traumatic incident reduction Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Renewable energy Christian eschatology Tribulation Fermi paradox Afterlife Phaedo Creationist cosmologies Eastern Orthodox Church Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Open cluster Grimke Sisters Creationism Causality Simone Weil Climate change Al-Ghazali Permian-Triassic extinction event Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction Ice age History of science Timeline of the Universe Sesshomaru Christianity Resurrection of Jesus Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Merit Neutron star Trimurti Life insurance Ishmael (novel) Neutrino Planet Scenes from a Memory Alchemy Human Wolfrider Cosmic dust Kabbalah Plagues of Egypt Existentialism Comet Hyakutake Hubble Space Telescope Jewish eschatology Tai Chi Chuan The Amber Spyglass Biblical inerrancy Rudolf Steiner War of the Worlds (television) The Lovely Bones Agnosticism Memento mori Origin belief Mercury (planet) Planetary orbit Astronomy on Mars
