can you feel more then one way at a time can you focus upon more than one thing are you asking about feeling focusing or both it looks like you're asking two questions so i'd better answer likewise feeling we're talking emotion right seems to me you can feel only one way at a time though that may be very complex first we feel then we make sense of our feeling that's when we parse it into types we're familiar with really where does happiness end and sadness begin where is the boundary i don't see any sharp line feelings blend together like colors in a rainbow i don't recall many times when my emotions were pure what i could call sheer happiness complete and utter bitterness they do happen but i notice them because they're so simple pure red what is that there's quite a bit going on in a single color i'm not about to say there's no such thing but i will say it all strikes me as very complex to begin with emotions are global the sources local mix two colored lights and you get a new hue take a wet piece of paper let two drops of different colored ink fall near each other and watch how they mingle emotions are responses that behave this way as i see it anyhow focus focus and awareness are different things i can be aware of quite a bit more though i'll center my attention on some spot focusing on more than one thing at a time strikes me as a flat contradiction time lets us focus on more than one thing but i don't think this is really possible simultaneously if i multitask it's more like shuttling back and forth between one thing and another not simultaneous true focus but just because i can't do it doesn't make it impossible still i'm very skeptical true multitasking would involve awareness of different things without focus on any to do that you'd have to have control over everything you're aware of listening to the stereo while doing homework is easy when neither thing challenges you chances are you're listening to music you know already so no surprises the homework may well be busywork but put on a cd somebody lent you and i expect you'll be drawn toward it you might well forget about the problems you need to do if one of those problems is harder and you want to solve it the music will probably drop out this is probably my biases made general but my own experience has given me these thoughts and i don't think i'm really any different than anybody else Theory of conduct Social rule Drawing Milton H.
