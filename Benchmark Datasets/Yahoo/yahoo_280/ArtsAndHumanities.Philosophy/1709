do you agree that there is an exact point where one thing becomes another there are no shades of grey this is difficult to word but the point i am attempting to get at is there is an exact point or 'line' at which something becomes another meaning that it is either black or white there are no shades of grey for example what is the deciding factor that something is black and not white when does it become a shade of grey where is the line of difference so if the line or point of difference is so vague how can we judge something or someone and say it is that who decides that it is just that and not something else when people see things as beautiful ugliness is created when people see things as good evil is created being and non being produce each other difficult and easy complement each other long and short define each other high and low oppose each other fore and aft follow each other therefore the master can act without doing anything and teach without saying a word things come her way and she does not stop them things leave and she lets them go she has without possessing and acts without any expectations when her work is done she take no credit that is why it will last forever Theory of conduct Capitalism Billiards Socrates Glossary of partner dance terms Alaga__sia Inflation Falsifiability Color theory Evil Goodness and value theory Dark Phoenix Saga Anarchism and capitalism Volleyball Microeconomics Halting problem Rudolf Hermann Lotze Artificial consciousness Jean Grey The Book of Five Rings Color Utilitarianism Tamriel Horse Typeface Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Shen Gong Wu Legacy of Kain Conscience Snooker Ishmael (novel) Free will ELO rating system Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Bill Stevenson Summa Theologiae Wassily Kandinsky Tai shogi Black Eragon (character) Human skin color Religious Society of Friends A Course In Miracles Gross domestic product RuneScape skills Saturation (color theory) Color blindness Tao Te Ching Fast bowling Software engineering Hulk (comics) Primary color Species Graduate school Public-key cryptography Art Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Flat tax GURPS Alignment (role-playing games) Biblical canon Dog training Golf Abortion in the United States Kasparov versus The World Magic (paranormal) Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Dragon Booster Drawing The Apprentice 2 Entropy Saruman Anarchism and society The nature of God in Western theology Debate Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Determinism Blacks and Mormonism Rave Master Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Whale shogi Taikyoku shogi Bob and George Leviathan (book) Hades Baptism Scientific method Metaphor Ultimate (sport) Boston and Lowell Railroad Chaos Emerald Beauty Tenshinhan Chess strategy and tactics Bayesian probability Spice Girls Water polo Jedi Scopes Trial
