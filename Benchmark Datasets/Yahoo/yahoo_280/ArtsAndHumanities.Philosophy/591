let's be totally honest does anything we do here on this planet really matter in the long run if we're all eventually going to die anyway i just don't buy into the belief that we will be rewarded for all our good deeds in an afterlife that's just wishful thinking aren't we all just really waiting to die and be over with it on the scale of earthly time individual lives are but mere blinks of an eye we're born we live we die and then you're not heard from ever again there might be a tombstone or family tree made with your name on it but eventually the tombstone weathers from age and who knows what media your family tree will be used all the memories and accomplishments will be totally forgotten unless you're a hitler or alexander the great type person in a thousand years your bones will be dust and no other trace of your existence will be seen unless of course you become fossilized for some reason but even then after thousands of years more that will be disintegrated into dust we influence the lives of our children and others but they too will eventually die so what's the point of living in astronomical terms the earth will eventually succumb to the supernova of our sun it's an astonomically certainty the earth will be burned to a crisp so does death render our lives meaningless if we were immortal that would be the ultimate in boredom repetition day after day of doing the same thing for thousands of years hundreds may be ok but nothing beyond that but i digress back to the meaning of our little lives it all boils down to how creative we can be in the short period of time we have on this earth our activities need to be worthwhile for their own sake not because they fulfill some supernatural transcendental purpose live damnit Soul Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Solar system Meaning of life Afterlife Immortality Supernova Religion Maimonides Reincarnation Scientology beliefs and practices Atheism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jewish eschatology Supernatural H II region Phaedo Intelligent design S__ren Kierkegaard Goodness and value theory Angel Comet Merit Evolutionary creationism Sri Aurobindo Arjuna Resurrection of Jesus Sun Summa Theologiae Existence of God God Heaven Al-Ghazali A Course In Miracles Flood geology Day-Age Creationism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Deity Predestination Age of the Earth Theory of conduct Theodicy Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Philosophical skepticism Black hole Kabbalah Creationism Agnosticism Mantra Salvation Planet Hell Fermi paradox Young Earth creationism Astronomy Extrasolar planet Stellar evolution Sesshomaru Nihilism Time travel Shinto Urantia Simone Weil Adam and Eve Neutrino Comet Hale-Bopp Duties of the Heart Timeline of the Universe Contract Death The Lovely Bones Traumatic incident reduction Ishmael (novel) Alchemy Scenes from a Memory Deconstruction Creationist cosmologies Memento mori Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction Trimurti Trust (Law) USA Presuppositional apologetics Mercury (planet) Confucianism Mind Human nature John Howard Yoder Renewable energy Nicomachean Ethics The Amber Spyglass Mars
