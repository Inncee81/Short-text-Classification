why are some doctors jerks i work at a hospital and we have a policy that between the hours of no one is allowed on the floors because it is intensive care in that time i take a lunch well this family because their son was a doctor felt like he and his family were above this rule and complained i tried to get them to go downstairs and they said no they didn't want to comply so i went to the charge nurse and she allowed to stay now this family began to curse at me and call me just about every name in the book after that the doctor got my name down and is trying to get me in trouble now i am working in the main entrance and when the waiting area is full i limit the amount of people up on a floor so everytime i limit his family mr doctor comes down and tells me remember i can get you in so much trouble so watch it what should i do i hate being nice when people are jerks i know his dad is sick but he is just pushing his limit am i over reacting dear veronica you are not over reacting the doctor who is pulling his rank is jerk he has no respect for the rules and when it comes to rules there is no exception in the universe even the god has to abide by his own rules the doctor in question is working with his own ego and arrogance and when the other people see this it makes them angry and dishonored they also love their relatives as much this jerk of a doctor does now there is big problem here for you now doubt you are a person with good sense of duty and justice but you may be working as a crusader for what you believe in remember what happened to the man who was a crusader in the past he was crucified what you are suffering from is sense of injustice and a conflict in doing your duty in a fair way hold your thoughts right there and takes a different step talk to your supervisor and tell him or her that you have a conflict in your duties and tell her the whole story by taking an appointment with her in her office and follow her advice if you have to answer the other people waiting to see their sick relatives then answer them as i think is the best answer for you you are making this exception because the doctor is getting concerned about his relatives just to relieve his tension so that he can continue in his work without worrying about other matters you are making this exception but miss veronica just to let you know that you have very high principles i should remind you that when we are standing at the pearly gates you will be let in first because there we are judged by our duty our heart and self less love for others there are better solutions of our conflicts that do not put us in a jeopardy of compromising our principles and still go through the rout of justice the doctor in question has to learn humility and justice for all i think that your thinking is perfect in this predicament and let this be your reward of thinking correctly there are crooked ways to follow in our lives and then there are straight roads you are on a straight road and the doctor is not i do not want you to be crucified for this because we all need a person like you in our hospitals ramesh Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus A Course In Miracles Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Father's Day (Doctor Who) John Howard Yoder Social rule Appeal The Curse of Fenric Theodicy Miss Saigon Simone Weil Humphrey Bogart Prostate cancer Shaggy dog story Goodness and value theory Summa Theologiae Jiddu Krishnamurti Futurama (TV series - season 5) Rule of St Benedict Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Catcher in the Rye Duties of the Heart God Emperor of Dune Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Calvin and Hobbes The Lovely Bones Social justice The Five Doctors Socrates Health insurance Combat stress reaction Stomach cancer About a Boy CPU cache 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Leviathan (book) Charles Peace The Pilgrim's Progress Transactional analysis RuneScape quests Merit Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Jeopardy!
