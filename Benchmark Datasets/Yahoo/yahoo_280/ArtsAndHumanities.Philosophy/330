why are westerners so attracted to atheism i discussed the issue with some friends and other than the usual cliched answers they gave some explanations namely because of a gambler's principle which says that the richer you are the more likely you are to gamble therefore people in western countries are more willing to gamble away their eternity another gambler's principle which says that a person would much rather win a million dollars in a casino than to work for it therefore westerners like to think that the universe and life started just by chance because they live in highly organized and regulated societies and it results in a psychological phenomenon that could be referred to as beast envy therefore they eagerly embrace theories like evolution which imply that humans are merely animals i think these theories have some truth in them but i'd like to hear other explanations but please not vain ones like because they are more educated that obviously has nothing to do with it thanks answers like cos they are more free in what way are simply restating the question the soviet union wasn't free yet it was mostly atheist there are many other examples that has nothing to do with it iamnothing butlife don't try to pull that one on me those religions you mentioned are not atheist don't try to redefine atheism just to win an argument everyone knows what the typical atheist believes and it is not just 'nothing' it is rather a 'nothingized' something future posthuman arc i am sure you are an intelligent person and i appreciate your answer but you obviously haven't understood those arguments you are responding to you're simply making a knee jerk criticism of them richiel said they are unwilling to put down their good life to a higher being i would add no matter how evil or immoral it is epistemologyfan you are basically saying exactly the same thing i asked you to keep that stuff about science or education i repeat that has nothing to do with my question drevol atheism is not a consequence of thinking skeptism about specific doctrines might be a consequence of thinking but not atheism very true nancy b i think the mythos and logos concepts explain this the best these are two ideally complementary ways of thinking with mythos covering artistic spiritual meaningful thinking and logos covering practical logical intellectual thinking in the west logos has become so dominant over mythos that it has even started to take over religion drop in to the religion spirituality section if you don't believe me you will see they keep arguing about whether or not there is logos style proof of god the western educational system mostly teaches logos so we get very good at this type of thinking in school but not very good at the mythos thinking then people grow up and some believe that logos is all that matters logos has no use for religion so the people who have the most extreme preference for logos over mythos become atheists the effect is not just limited to religion westerners also seem prone to dismiss the value of art literature music and anything else that requires mythos for its appreciation it is hardly possible for anyone to make a living as a poet here hope that helps Intelligent design Supernatural Creation-evolution controversy Meaning of life Jewish principles of faith Creationism History of creationism David Hume Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Agnosticism Evolutionary creationism Theory of conduct Separation of church and state Intelligent design movement Deconstruction Antony Flew Philosophy of mathematics Simone Weil Cultural relativism Psychology A Course In Miracles Soul Human The nature of God in Western theology Teach the Controversy Philosophy Friedrich Schleiermacher Strong atheism Young Earth creationism Altruism Scientology beliefs and practices Summa Theologiae Logic Philosophy of language Reincarnation Goodness and value theory Phaedo Bah__'__ Faith and Science Moral objectivism Bertrand Russell Origin belief Predestination Ethics Charles Darwin's views on religion Anti-intellectualism Microeconomics Atomism Animism Phillip E.
