how can the term nothing exist when in reality there s always some thing there just my curiosity working up again great question nothing is a concept derived from something if there is something and that is removed what remains is nothing however we are so tuned to and limited by space that we can not visualize absolute nothing what we think of as nothing is in fact empty space which is something and not nothing nothing should mean that even space is not there and such a concept is not possible for us to truly visualize anything and everything can be destroyed but nothing can neither be created nor destroyed in that sense it has no definite existence however it is eternal or perennial in the sense that it is the ultimate remnant when everything is removed or destroyed if one does not believe in god one has no option but to assume that everything has come out of nothing and finally can only disappear into nothing in that sense nothingness is the atheist's god it is really mind boggling God Existence of God The nature of God in Western theology Atheism Reality Brahman Summa Theologiae Infinity Atomism Friedrich Schleiermacher A Course In Miracles Phaedo Predestination Buddhism Theodicy Art Ontological argument John Wycliffe Monotheism Deconstruction Philosophy of mathematics Perennial Philosophy Existentialism Objectivist philosophy Color Creationism Eternity Epistemology Philosophy of space and time Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Simone Weil Philosophy Origin belief Theory Religion Strong atheism Nihilism Critique of Pure Reason Physical paradox Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Rudolf Hermann Lotze Human nature Cosmological argument S__ren Kierkegaard Hinduism Nontheism Goodness and value theory Teach the Controversy Idealism Sin Existence Muraqaba Philosophy of religion Truth Mantra G__del's incompleteness theorem Christian eschatology Victor Cousin Soul Creator God Immortality Deity Buddhist philosophy Urantia Afterlife Property (ownership right) Immanuel Kant Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Al-Ghazali Specified complexity Religious pluralism Mind Agnosticism Eastern Orthodox Church Johann Friedrich Herbart Nothing Marvel Universe David Hume Max Stirner Ken Wilber Metaphysics Moral relativism Hindu philosophy Scientific method Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Intelligent design Advaita Vedanta Merit Salvation Arthur Schopenhauer Space Dharma Cyberspace Philosophy of perception Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Love Quantum mechanics Free will
