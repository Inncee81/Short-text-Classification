is there any one in this world who doesn't want to be loved i do and i'll even disagree with seattle slacker though in order for me to make sense first as with many things you'll have to want to see my point of view and want to accept it an answer no matter how good won't matter if you asked a question by which you have made up your mind or are looking through your version without considering that your version may not only be non exclusive but as a result of our modern social up bringing in relation with both history psychology and many other factors for a quick objective down the line no nonsense perspective cracker i recommend reading this http en wikipedia org wiki free love i don't know if this coincides with who i am because i've self developed these feelings which eventually formed my opinion prior to encountering this word in wikipedia now here's the kicker in order to not want to be loved the trick is to love sounds contradictory but this is as far as a description i can go unless we go into specifics this trick is what differentiates not wanting to be loved from what seattle slacker describes as defensive shields or even repression thoughts of want often represent a desire to fill something lacking or to seek something that fills it and the closest modern mainstream representation i can think of that even comes close to loving without wanting to be loved are missionaries there's your flaw right there religion by itself doesn't represent this well because it tries to apply it to a large chunk of people the love of jesus the role model he presented gets toned down and becomes applicable to priests ministers and the like and that still gets toned down further by representing it as a duty than a want to love and another problem would be that it's just one religion and it happens to have a major influence even to those who are not part of that religion so culturally there's many layers already covering and changing the concepts of love one major thing would be attributing love to marriage and for me that's a minor thing to what eventually lead me to not wanting to be loved but to many people marriage is one crucial factor of love even those who don't want to be married have this sense of relationship and even those who get along and don't go into relationships have this guilt of cheating on their love and even those who love you have this definition of love that involve a certain bond that must be kept at most times even to the point of it being your duty or just right to maintain that chain even when the proximity disengage another problem is we have these definition of annulments and divorce that further confuses legality and feelings and mixes them up into a combination of both that's the biggest hurdle to explaining the validity of my point of view each turn of your head each waking hours each show each person you are talking to are constantly feeding you a story of love that keeps being drilled into our head as if it were true or some sort of standard and the other alternative is one of denial or biological disengagement that involves a bunch of hormones and pheromones and puberty etc even these opinions expanding to the defensive shield opinions further these stories by telling you the counter to these love thus again reaffirming and telling you this tale of what is love and wanting to be loved it's a long hard road to get over this definition with all these things brute forcing their way into our mind but contrary to the common description is not one of loneliness no rejection bitterness um celibacy etc are not proof that a person doesn't want to be loved problem is that's what most people will point to and of course once that shell is cracked people use it as proof that everyone wants to be loved i don't know what will crack this illusion but for me it was falling in love and remaining in love and being shut down in an offer of relationship problem with this method is it often causes temporary depression bitterness or just passiveness towards love and most other mainstream effect that we read on mediums that further propagate the mainstream definitions of love each preaching daily that theirs are the right road if i have to put it into anything what happened to me was that the concept of relationship lost it's credibility for me because even today that love never disappeared without me having to maintain anything that's not the story of how a person ends up not wanting to loved but rather a beginning of a road that just happens to have that side effect yes for a person not wanting to be loved answering this question is not only minor but ultimately unnecessary it's like coming back to the classical senses you know how when we want to eat we don't think of eating but what to eat and that becomes a choice or how when we smell we don't think of wanting to be smell but we define our want through what we smell or how when we hear we don't really attribute hearing to a want but rather we attribute liking what we hear through allowing what we hear to reach through our brain and to allow it to interpret the quality of it and react to it and based it on that or how when we taste we don't really have this want to taste but we allow this taste to reach us first and we define our wants through that and even then it's not just one version we could like a taste because it's salty or it's hot or it's crunchy even our want of touch is not necessarily a want of touch but an effect of that touch and is still a choice normally we don't cling or try to touch everything we want to but again as a baby we would touch everything so there's a story there that influences that well to get that side effect of not wanting to be loved the feeling coursing through me becomes so similar to these senses and in fact many of what we consider love today are combinations of these senses this just feels more similar to that like that want isn't there or always there but just as is like the senses there's the feeling that it's there as a choice but not as an object of sensation to be touched seen taste felt smelled but rather it's a sensation that comes to you through little things that through combination of sensations creates a more general term that's easier to be termed love but like what these senses encounter it's not this ideal pleasure inducing mushy stuff but it feels more natural pure yet still in combination not one and in that sense it becomes one like how a hamburger becomes a hamburger to us through a combination of these senses and yet at the same time represent different things when treated as separately for ex when we are asked how a hamburger tastes when we want to determine it's tastes we don't think of how good it tastes but we think of how good it tastes as a hamburger so in that sense we are using all senses but we are prioritizing on just that taste and it is our choice no matter how subtly whether we will even factor in sight smell feel and sound as addendum to our taste this is also what i think to be the clearest hint of why it's love but it's different because by doing so like the hamburger example above it also disconnects sex with love but while not allowing truly separating both concept like say taste can be disconnected from smell but not truly separating what a hamburger is to us this effects allows it to be not applicable to common defensive shielding justifications or to wanting to be loved justifications it can't because it's different therefore it just doesn't apply and that's why it can have a side effect that seems implausible to those who see through version no matter how many variations of that version and those who are against that version no matter how many variations they have against the many variations of that version and that's again what's going to make or break this answer Free will Love Predestination Hypnosis Grunge music Victor Cousin Philosophy
