if too much time is spent outside the box is it possible that one could find it hard to get back inside is this a possible reason that can lead to eccentricity or even maybe to a complete detachment from reality i knew i left the question a bit too vague and i didn't want to leave too many clues because i wanted to see how people would interpret my question in their own different ways of course some of saw the relation to this question to the now popular saying thinking outside the box thinking outside the box is very much related to creativity and innovative thinking and this is seen as very good traits to have especially in this very competitive era the ability to think outside the box is what differentiates a select few from the masses but my question actually tackles the sociological aspects of people who dedicate their entire lives being consistently outside the box in fields such as arts philosophy and all the sciences known in this world my career as an architect requires exactly this that i put myself in various new vantage points from which i could imagine or create new or different kind of forms and spaces something that would mark my designs as unique creative etc inspiration is something that we cannot really control sometimes ideas come to us in the weirdest of times and they also sometimes follow you back home to where you live in a life of family and friends and this is where my question comes in i have found on many occasion that i live in a world of my own where sometimes even my husband struggles to bring me back down to reality sometimes i cringe to admit it would take me a while to hear the call of my own daughter trying to get my attention i have read several life stories of famous artists and thinkers over the history which although having achieved glory in their respective fields their life outside that field sometimes seem tragic and devoid of the many other things that life has to offer love for instance is there a relationship to this all that one would be so self absorbed that they somehow neglect other more normal aspects of their lives can one so detached from the people around him return safely within the comforts of normal human relationship thus my question and thank you so much for those who have moved to answer i've often shared that thought myself that's a common pattern i've seen in past creative types they got too far outside their box so they could pursue their work that they lost it and never could get back in john forbes nash jr mathematician had to go outside the box to find solutions to the biggest problems of his day and he became schizophrenic and delusional for a good portion of his life before remission that same pattern can be seen in other mathematicians and in artists and musicians or if they don't completely lose the box they spend so much time outside of it that they can never find the door to get back in or the door reseals like a cut heals on skin if they ever did want to get back in they'd only be able to stay near the edge of the box yet still on the outside the only solution would be for someone inside the box to come and bring them in but those in the box are reluctant to come out or even look out some don't need to go out some never need to come back you'll get lost anyway whichever side you're on A Course In Miracles Simone Weil Modernism Philosophy Mathematics Philosophy of language W.
