how would we know if satan could take any form and is more intelligent than any human how would any mortal know that satan did not himself write the various books of the bible as a tool to control human behavior and promote violence against the peoples of other religions how would we know if satan was among us right now and professing to be a christian my point is that christians believe that anyone or anything can be influenced by the dark forces of satan i am just saying if that is really the case both christains and christianity itself may also have been under this influence sorry but you can't have it both ways anthony m maybe you are onto something i wonder that in a way but if satan started not just that relgion but others as well to divide people into groups so we could never truly get along becuase in the first place christains didn't right the bible save the new testment and even then they were jews that were telling there stories over again it seems possible but not completly likely because there are some good points not just to bible but to other religions as well all hail peter rabit j k Satan Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Antichrist Bible Satanism Hell Evil Demon God Church of Christ Christian Identity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity End times Resurrection of Jesus Devil Jehovah's Witnesses Michael (archangel) Book of Isaiah Religion Armageddon Chick Publications Angel Zoroastrianism Theology Heaven Sin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Paradise Lost Christianity and anti-Semitism Prophet Fundamentalism Religion and sexuality Pentagram Pok__mon Christian anarchism Dissociative identity disorder Book of Job Religious pluralism Abraham Ebionites Book of Revelation Rastafari movement Predestination Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religion in the United Kingdom Mormonism and Christianity Opposition to cults and new religious movements Anti-Mormonism Fallen angel John Howard Yoder Conspiracy theories (a collection) Prayer The Chronicles of Narnia Monotheism Pacifism Cain Baptism Alan Campbell (pastor) Evangelicalism Classification of demons Whore of Babylon Dispensationalism Abrahamic religion Incarnations of Immortality Christian right Biblical canon Gospel of Mark Adam and Eve Barabbas Christian denomination Satanic ritual abuse Blood libel Ethics in the Bible Goth Witchcraft Marvel Universe Great Apostasy Creation according to Genesis Christadelphians David Mormonism Gospel of John Paul of Tarsus Religion and abortion Salvation Baptist Kuzari Witch trial Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Karl Marx Cultural and historical background of Jesus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Sacred text Dionysus Christian Zionism Millennialism Abington School District v.
