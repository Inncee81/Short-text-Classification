i have a problem i keep forgetting things alot an example would be someone would tell me to do something and then i say ok then i forget right away well like a few seconds right away and sometimes while i talk in conversations i am talking about something then someone else talks about something and i forget what i was gonna say because i talk about the other subject its pissing me and i cant fuckingdo do anything about it and then when i call on someone they are too busy thinking about something and then i call their name again and they still wont respond finally when i yell they get mad and say why do you yell how can i stop forgetting its pissing me off and everyone else that happens to a lot of people it doesn't mean that you have in particular a problem some ideas to help when someone asks you to do something repeat it to yourself in your head until you go and perform the task if you repeat it and focus on that you won't forget it or you can simply write it down when you are talking to someone about something and get interrupted do the same thing remember the subject you were discussing and repeat it to yourself silently this will help you remember Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule She Loves You Milton H.
