my friends got hit by group of gangs i'm very sad i want be good but thing like this happen wat should i do we all know i fight u and you fight me then over and over again revenge and revenge when will it stop therefore its not wise to fight back and im sad i can fight back but im wise enough to know its not good to fight because itll just cause more trouble i dont know what to do now they want revenge and i dont want no one to get hurt what can i do nothing sit back and wait till they slice each other go hospital and stuff my friends are okay lolz jaz your funny a fight was over a story in the pass and i do not no much of it i was just at that place and they were there and an argument happened and they start hiting earth other i was in the middle trying to block kick and punch i push them out and they hit me a litle and we manage to get get going because the cops arive and i told them to leave the area in the city they didnt want to hit me so im fine to stay back do you want to rule the world and control it i don't think it can ever be done the world is sacred vessel and it can not be controlled you will only it make it worse if you try it may slip through your fingers and disappear some are meant to lead and others are meant to follow some must always strain and others have an easy time some are naturally big and strong and others will always be small some will be protected and nurtured and others will meet with destruction the master accepts things as they are and out of compassion avoids extravagance excess and the extremes i am really surprised by your question what came in my mind is this is this the wisdom i know are you making a philosophical situationer or are you into a gang of sort gang for us here in my country connotes a bad thing i don't think you belong to anyone of this it is just too far from the wisdom i knew besides wisdom wouldn't ask this kind of question because you are indeed wisdom i would rather consider this as one of your philosophical question and i will clearly say unto you you surely knows to handle yourself you know what is better to your cammaraderie wisdon has full of wisdom to answer such question Piccolo Junior Saga Socrates Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Shaggy dog story EastEnders The nature of God in Western theology Sin City Tenshinhan Vegeta Pitaten Theodicy Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Milton H.
