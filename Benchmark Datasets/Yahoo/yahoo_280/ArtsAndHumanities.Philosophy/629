what do u think this statement means the moral status of an action resides in the motives of the agent pls help me its important this is a very popular view point often linked to deontologists it basically means whether an action is right or wrong is not dependent upon the consequences of the action but is judged by the intentions of the person doing the action this is directly opposed to the utilitarian view that only consequences matter and is summed up by the popular proverb there are no perfect actions only perfect intentions despite what some have answered regarding kant he would in part agree with this statement the consequences of any specific act were for kant irrelevant just as the statement suggests only for kant it was necessary for an action to meet the criteria of the categorical imperative about which this quote says nothuing the statement makes to claims to the intrinsic worth of actions only that what makes them moral is the intentions though when examined in depth this view point has flaws it does also raise some vaid points for instance if one saved as life merely so one could better ones own position would this be morally right most would feel it would be wrong to treat people as a means to an end kant especially believed that people were ends in themselves also lying to save a life though lying is generally considered morally reprehensible in this case would be considered morally justified this type of morality is a type of situation ethics where the motives for an action need to be assessed on an individual basis this system is also employed to an extent in legal ethics else self defence would never be a defence to a murder charge there are many more examples of society endorsing this view at the end however like most system of ethics its not without its faults and no definitive universally accepted system has yet been devised Categorical imperative Ethics Deontological ethics Immanuel Kant Peter Singer Objectivist philosophy Discourse ethics Value system Bernard Williams Moral relativism Cultural relativism Evil Friedrich Schleiermacher Morality Anarcho-capitalism David Hume Abortion debate Consequentialism Universal pragmatics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Merit Economics Democracy Falsifiability Coercion Epistemology Religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Philosophy of science Theodicy Atheism Animal rights Liberalism Microeconomics Lie Determinism Moral absolutism Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals Causality Existence of God Reparations for slavery Contract Philosophy of language Murder Non-aggression principle Business ethics Sin Philosophy of business Patriotism Estoppel Biblical inerrancy Nicomachean Ethics Rape Fallacy Socrates Summa Theologiae Birth control Capitalism Bertrand Russell Ontological argument Just War theory Free market Postmodernism Philosophy of law Altruism Friedrich Nietzsche Zoophilia A Course In Miracles Alignment (role-playing games) Consciousness Ten Commandments Capital punishment Sexual orientation Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Scientific method Polyamory Jacob Neusner Divine command theory Slander and libel Game theory Motivation New Testament
