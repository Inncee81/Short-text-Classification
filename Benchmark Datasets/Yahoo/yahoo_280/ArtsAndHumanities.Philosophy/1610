if time travel is ever possible would we know already if people proceed through the future without killing themselves off then eventually it would have to be possible even if we are long gone from earth which could explain ufo's even if we were catious it seems like somebody would come back irresponsibly unless people are flawless and do not disobey i'm just curious what other people think aside from physical limitations because entirely new science may be known then it may be possible that traveling in time would disable our ability to interact with the first three dimensions in other words if time travel prevents us from interacting with our physical world it is possible to discover it in the future with no current evidence that it will have happened this time travel is the opposite of what we currently experience where we can return to an identical physical location at will but not arrive at the same time twice future time travel would allow you to return to an identical time location but not allow you to share the same physical location at the same time it would be possible that we would be more like ghosts able to see history once again but unable to act in it's dimensions Time travel Supernatural Intelligent design Fermi paradox Bob and George Black hole Fundamental interaction DC Universe Predestination paradox Science New Age Multiverse Kain (Legacy of Kain) Physics Day of the Daleks Gravity String theory Legacy of Kain Grandfather paradox Terra Obscura Ecco the Dolphin Classical mechanics Extraterrestrial hypothesis Special relativity Particle physics Ufology Tide Many-worlds interpretation Guns, Germs, and Steel Black (people) Dirac equation Theory of everything Artificial consciousness Many worlds and possible worlds in literature and art Marvel Universe Unidentified flying object Lazarus Long The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases G-Man (Half-Life) Incarnations of Immortality Krypton (planet) Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Anomalous phenomenon Quantum mechanics Creation science God Emperor of Dune Sluggy Freelance The Dalek Invasion of Earth The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever The Time Machine Bah__'__ Faith and Science Cyberspace Supersymmetry Thor (Marvel Comics) Nuclear magnetic resonance Particle accelerator John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Zhao Yun Jacques Vallee Green Goblin Immortality Stroke Sri Aurobindo Geography Pyramids of Mars Physical cosmology Vulcan (Star Trek) Abortion debate Galvatron Star Trek: First Contact Time Magical thinking Captain Britain Rave Master Atomism Science fiction on television Project Blue Book Neutrino Big Bang Quantum mind Creationism Universal pragmatics Dimension Micronauts Francis Crick Doctor (Doctor Who) Megatron Timecop Cordelia Chase Father's Day (Doctor Who) Teleportation Hawkman Causality Space Tunguska event Highlander (film) Non-standard cosmology Extraterrestrial life TimeSplitters: Future Perfect Determinism
