what number do you dial to hear your home phone ringing one of the kids have lost one of our cordless phones there used to be a number you dialed in to get the home phone ringing i know is the one you dial to see who has last phoned up its just i forgotten the other number thanks ps i would use my mobile but there is no credit on it it's called a ring back test ringback is a test used by many phone companies to quickly determine whether or not a new phone line is working correctly and the phone number is routing properly typically it works by calling a ringback number and then hanging up often the ringback number plays a low frequency tone into the line to indicate that it's working at which point the technician flashes the line hangs up very briefly to indicate they want a ringback this makes the ringback play a higher tone to indicate it is working and then the technician hangs up the phone will then ring answering only with a tone if picked up the tone is added so that telephone subscribers will not be able to easily use the ringback system as an intercom to call other extensions of their own phone line by simply initiating a ringback test and waiting for the phone to stop ringing so as to know when the other person has answered Phreaking Telephone exchange Telephone GSM services Vertical service code Modem UK telephone numbering plan North American Numbering Plan Dual-tone multi-frequency 9-1-1 Telephone numbering plan Session Initiation Protocol Caller ID Blue box Emergency telephone number Telephone number Dial tone Telephone tapping Telephone call Automatic number announcement circuit Cordless telephone Bluetooth Telephone switchboard Toll-free telephone number Taxicab Mobile phone Rotary dial Digital Subscriber Line Call for help Ring tone Dial Skype Argentine telephone numbering plan Dial M for Murder NorthwesTel Key telephone system Cellular network Embedded system Integrated Services Digital Network Password Federal Standard 1037C Musical Instrument Digital Interface Intelligent network Violin Crossbar switch Call centre International Phonetic Alphabet IP Multimedia Subsystem Payphone 1-1-1 Global System for Mobile Communications Amateur radio Decibel Morse Code Autovon Radiotelephone Broadband Internet access Antenna (radio) 555 telephone number Trapped in the Closet Avalanche Microphone FidoNet Data retention Short message service Double bass Phone sex Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications Automatic number identification WiMAX IS-95 Sound design Hearing impairment Weighing scale VHF omnidirectional range Burglar alarm Radio Donald Neilson Beatmania IIDX Konica Minolta Phoneme Speech synthesis Oscilloscope Telephone booth Enhanced 911 Quiz Call Nordic Mobile Telephone Tag Cable television Timeline of the telephone Gmail Electric motor Public Switched Telephone Network Winning Streak Harmonic series (music)
