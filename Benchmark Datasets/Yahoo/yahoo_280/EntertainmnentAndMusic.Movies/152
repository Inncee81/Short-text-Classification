your opinion on directors changing once they get famous tarantino anderson read for more info it was hard to pick a title i ll explain im not talking about versatility like spielberg who directed e t and schindlers list im talking about this examples tarantino first three films were crime related very similar then kill bill im not a fan but i know most people liked it aronofsky he does pi and requiem for a dream very similar in style then the fountain p t anderson boogie nights and magnolia very similar in style then punch drunk love what do you think should they keep doing what they do best or do you like their new movies im sorry phliburt but i dont think the departed is the best scorsese film although i enjoy it next to his works with deniro the departed is at best acceptable yes you re right about peter jackson i forgot to include him in my examples directors have to be as concerned with being pigeon holed as much as actors do if they continue to turn out one genre of movie then the producers start to believe that is all that they can do but it is the versatility of a director that marks the masters above the rest of the pack if they do the same style over and over then they get control of a niche market and do not reach the diverse audience pool soon they have hard time getting budgets because they have such a definitive group of fans one director who has done things that are quite different is tim burton his nightmare before christmas and batman were very different than big fish but all are very good movies Quentin Tarantino Tim Burton Pulp Fiction Martin Scorsese Batman Begins Cinema of the United States Schindler's List John Carpenter Academy Award for Directing Batman Forever Steven Spielberg Paul W.
