is breakfast at tiffany's a good movie reccommendations please i just want to know is it a good movie or not how so thanks aloha from down unda short answer yes long answer do you wanna know our answer or do you wanna let us decide for you here's a coupla comments a source audrey hepburn the it girl of the s april author misslv i've loved breakfast at tiffany's since i was nine even before i completely understood about holly's profession i was captivated by the grace and magic that was audrey hepburn george peppard plays paul varjak a writer who has to earn his living through a wealthy socialite patricia neal as her kept man audrey who plays holly golightly is a gold digging call girl who is looking for the right rich man to marry though you would think these two would be unflattering characters they are both very charming and put on phony personas especially in holly's case in order to survive you have to marvel at how a woman like audrey could look so good in anything she wore at the beginning of the movie when she first meets peppard she's only wearing a simple white shirt that she wears as a nightgown or at the party scene when she first comes out and greets her friend o j berman wearing nothing but a sheet made up to look like a dress gorgeous it's a marvelous piece of acting when holly first meets paul in her apartment and she's talking about how she has to get ready to meet one of her clients in jail sally tomato and she's talking about her profession looking at herself in the mirror getting dressed asking paul to find one of her shoes etc and then voila the famous basic black dress and hat with the wide brim very stylish and in the scene she is given much to work with the way she has to juggle the dialogue and the action of what she is doing all at once very natural and sophisticated at the same time audrey is very believable as holly because her character is someone who is pretending to be sophisticated hanging around with phony people but really comes from humble beginnings once in a while you will hear in her voice the country girl drawl and you will see through the facade of holly golightly who she really is george peppard is also very handsome and believable as the starving writer who also has to sell himself out in order to earn a living many complaints have been made about mickey rooney and the stereotypical portrayal of the landlord mr yunioshi yes it is stereotyped but nonetheless i still thought it was funny the party scene is one of the best in the movie hilarious wonderful score by henry mancini of course it's a classic scene when holly pulls up in front of tiffany's in the new york taxi drinking coffee and eating a danish in front of the window new york city itself is like a vibrant interesting character in the movie i could go on and on and to top it all off it's a very romantic love story about two people who find happiness in the crazy mixed up world we live in a classic recommended to anyone who loves old hollywood cinema audrey as holly absolutely september author jslack from usa this comment may contain spoilers those who know holly golightly from the truman capote autobiographical sketch disguised as a novella may be dismayed that wholesome gorgeous audrey hepburn plays her as an irresistible fashion plate but could marilyn monroe really have been this good miss hepburn the epitome of early s chic creates a character that seems the essence of an era when naughtiness was implied but not spelled out and happy endings and no sour tastes prevailed it's a running the gamut performance she's charming sexy devious funny tender hysterical and vulnerable and audrey hepburn it is perhaps her most famous performance and one of her greatest capote changed many things names incidents genders but this is obviously a memorial to his beginnings as a new york writer with george peppard who doesn't look remotely like a writer and especially not like capote but who fills the bill quite nicely as spectator and eventual romantic leading man blake's love for nyc is apparent throughout henry mancini's score is a classic and all the supporting players except mickey rooney at his most shameless are good there are unforgettable moments a wildly hilarious party sequence a shoplifting scene inside a five and dime and a superior feel good scene inside tiffany's with a kindly salesman john mcgiver the film finally takes on added universal dimensions about the need for love and the delusional lifestyle we may resort when we don't find it and more at
