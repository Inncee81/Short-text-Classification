rush hour is it funny is it as good as one and two note only answer if you have seen one and two compare with all the complexities of the final installments of this years trilogies this should be a welcome change of pace probably the worst of the series but really not bad highly predictable were as i told the people i was sitting with who was behind it all and who the accomplices were the movie in a whole is about an hour and twenty minutes it has pretty humorous parts throughout and some good action scenes but in all honesty they could have been better the chemistry between the two leads is still there which makes these movies fun in the first place this was an unneeded yet entertaining entry into the series but it is basically the love child of the first two the outtakes as usual are the best part of the film to wrap it up if you enjoyed the first two you will probably enjoy this one as well sure you can see everything coming from a mile away but it still makes you laugh and still entertains take this for what it is and you will have a good time Anime Manos: The Hands of Fate Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Blooper Comedy film Good Morning, Vietnam The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Martin Lawrence Machinima The Ashlee Simpson Show Our Gang Joker (comics) Milton H.
