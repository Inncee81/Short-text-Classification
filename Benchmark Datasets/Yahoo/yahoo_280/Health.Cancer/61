can radiation therapy cure kill cancer of the liver external beam radiation is difficult to use with liver cancer due to the sensitivity of the normal liver it is difficult to deliver significantly high enough doses to kill the cancer in the liver without damaging the rest of the normal tissue so just a few years ago there was limited treatment for liver cancer but that has significantly changed there are now other treatments some based on radiation therapy others not that have been effective treatment for liver cancer depend on the stage of the disease and whether it is a primary or secondary cancer surgery is not always ruled out in the case of liver cancer the liver is able to regenerate itself and surgery is performed using a laser that will seal any type of bleeding as they go along so surgery is an option for liver cancer patients but many patients are now being treated with rfa chemoembolization and proton therapy some of the new tools now used to control or eliminate liver tumors include proton beam therapy a type of radiation that can be tightly controlled to deliver high dose radiation precisely to the correct location there is far more control using the proton beam since it can now focus directly on the tumor and spare the surrounding tissue not all liver cancer patients are candidates for this treatment proton beam therapy to liver http www medicinenet com proton beam therapy of liver article htm proton beam therapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma hcc http www oncolink com conferences article cfm c s ss id radiofrequency ablation long thin electrode wires are guided by ct into a tumor a current is sent through the wire and heats the tumor which is than 'ablated' or 'disintegrates' this is non invasive tool can be done on smaller symetrically shaped nodules and tumors rfa of liver tumors http www radiologyinfo org en info cfm pg rfa bhcp chemoembolization a cathetar is used to deliver high dose chemotherapy directly into the liver instead of systemically chemoembolization of the liver http www radiologyinfo org en info cfm pg chemoembol there are other treatments including cryoblation isolated liver perfusion alcohol injection laser photocoagulation radiation beads and in some cases liver transplant not all patients are candidates for these treatments so they should be discussed with the oncologist as possible options Cirrhosis Oncology Brain tumor Soft tissue sarcoma Folic acid Medicine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Esophageal cancer Stem cell Ionizing radiation Ovarian cancer Leukemia Thyroid cancer Diabetes mellitus Testicular cancer Endometrial cancer Psoriasis Positron emission tomography Atrial fibrillation Cervical cancer Acromegaly Proton therapy Hypoglycemia Mesothelioma Acoustic neuroma Stroke Hodgkin's lymphoma Multiple sclerosis History of cancer chemotherapy Acne X-ray Kaposi's sarcoma Magnetic resonance imaging Growth hormone treatment Multiple myeloma Osteosarcoma Aortic dissection Antiretroviral drug Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Paracetamol Growth hormone Diazepam Insulin Haloperidol Hepatitis Radiology Chlorpromazine Gene therapy Immunosuppressive drug DNA repair Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Wilms' tumor Bupropion Computed tomography Homeopathy Penile cancer Clomipramine Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Anemia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Nuclear fusion Polycythemia AIDS Radiation poisoning Alcoholism Chondrosarcoma Tocopherol Gynecomastia Directed-energy weapon Crohn's disease Chronic fatigue syndrome Syringomyelia Particle accelerator Tuberculosis Herpes simplex virus Interferon
