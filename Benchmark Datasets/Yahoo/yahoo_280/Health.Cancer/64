has anyone recovered from high dose chemo and stem cell transplant with renal failure for germ cell cancer just curious my husband is still recovering although the cancer isn't completely gone he needs dialysis now and occasionally more blood for low platelets he's pretty tired slow moving we have to watch his diet i'm not sure what your question is but yes people have recovered from high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant usually the doctors explain this process and the fact that there is no guarantee with this treatment it is a chance much depends on his overall health but i would be more concerned that the cancer is not completely gone my understanding is that stem cell transplant is used as the period at the end of treatment if he still has cancer present than further treatment options may now be limited we decided not to do stem cell transplant once this was explained to us it is something that is best used when there is minimal or no detectable disease present we still have the option of going to this treatment once the disease is smaller Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Prostate cancer Chemotherapy Bone marrow transplant Stomach cancer Folic acid Stem cell Multiple myeloma Diabetes mellitus Radiation therapy Colorectal cancer Lung cancer Myelodysplastic syndrome Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Leukemia Growth hormone treatment Dialysis Paracetamol Hypertension Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cirrhosis Multiple sclerosis Coeliac disease Hypoglycemia Lupus erythematosus Nephrology Medicine Immunosuppressive drug Ionizing radiation Stroke Diabetic nephropathy Renal cell carcinoma Thrombocytopenia Liver Polycythemia Acute renal failure IgA nephropathy Vitamin C Organ transplant Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psoriasis Chronic renal failure Rabies Tocopherol Atherosclerosis Testicular cancer Vitamin D Hodgkin's lymphoma History of cancer chemotherapy Schistosomiasis Metastasis Malaria Glycogen storage disease type I Antiretroviral drug Nutrition Erythropoietin Wilson's disease Cytomegalovirus Duesberg hypothesis Atheroma Omega-3 fatty acid Ovarian cancer Mesothelioma Crohn's disease Malignant melanoma Homeopathy Soft tissue sarcoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Human cloning Alcoholism Thyroid cancer Platelet Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Brain tumor American Red Cross Chronic fatigue syndrome Gene therapy Glucocorticoid Goodpasture's syndrome Chronic lymphocytic leukemia Positron emission tomography Cord blood Baldness treatments Cancer of the larynx Esophageal cancer Kaposi's sarcoma Traditional Chinese medicine Radiosurgery DNA repair Experimental cancer treatment
