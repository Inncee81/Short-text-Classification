should i go vegan i am a year old girl who became a lacto ovo vegetarian a year ago and i've decided i want to go vegan but my parents already get annoyed with me being a vegetarian and i know they'll get even more annoyed if i become a vegan so should i go vegan now secretly or wait until i turn when i am by myself in college i've seen how animals are treated for dairy end eggs and i think it's just as bad as for meat there are numerous benefits i would suggest you try it out for awhile and see how it goes your parents may not even notice if it becomes too much of a harship you can compromise occasionally don't get too bogged down in the semantics of what to call yourself just do what you think is right Vegetarianism Egg (food) Meat analogue Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Vegetarian nutrition Animal rights Dairy Cheese Buddhist cuisine Peter Singer Punk ideology Coronary heart disease People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Vegetarianism and religion Raw food diet Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Lisa the Vegetarian Food guide pyramid Animal Liberation Front Factory farming Cyanocobalamin Kashrut Dieting Soybean Tofu Pizza Taboo food and drink Teen Girl Squad Milk Lothlorien Hall Cuisine of Brazil Kosher foods Christian vegetarianism Fruitarianism Food Soy milk Chocolate Tom Regan Korean cuisine Robin Webb Lecithin Straight edge French cuisine Hard-line Fiona Apple Sausage Friends Day-Age Creationism Pitaten Christian anarchism The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Environmental vegetarianism Calvin and Hobbes Lisa Simpson Meat Crohn's disease Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine Pancake The Simpsons Code: Lyoko Barry Horne Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paleolithic diet Animal liberation movement About a Boy Perfect Dark Hindu Pok__mon Live!
