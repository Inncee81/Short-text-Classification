why are people on answers so mean about vegans vegetarians pesetarians i don't understand why if they hate us so that they answer in the vegan vegetarian section i have a lot i want to say that's not so appropriet about them but i guess the only nice way to say it is to shove it up where the sun don t shine i'd just like to know why they think it's any of their bussiness about how vegetarians and vegans are if they don't like us the webster dictionary definition of vegetarian is one who believes in or practices vegetarianism a diet consisting wholly of vegetables fruits and sometimes eggs or dairy products if you eat living creatures sea animals or not you are not a vegetarian pesco vegetarians fish eating or pollo vegetarians poultry eating are made up terms neither category can technically call themselves vegetarians as they are eating flesh from a formerly living creature not a plant which is in direct disagreement with the textbook definition of vegetarianism so i don't think people on answers are particularly mean to vegas or vegetarians but pesetarians and other categories are made up terms if you eat meat you are not a vegetarian Vegetarianism Veganism Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Kashrut Vegetarian nutrition Environmental vegetarianism Meat analogue Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Egg (food) Food Tofu Raw food diet Kosher foods Animal rights Coronary heart disease Buddhist cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Meat French cuisine Hindu Punk ideology Food guide pyramid Sausage Unclean animals Livestock Taboo food and drink Buddhism Factory farming Fruitarianism Cheese Soybean Chicken Korean cuisine Agriculture Chinese cuisine Lisa the Vegetarian Hinduism Brahmanism Pizza McDonald's MyPyramid Healthy eating Day-Age Creationism Christian anarchism Halaal Russian cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Economic vegetarianism Compost Paleolithic diet Animal Liberation Front Carnivore Phytochemical Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Natural Hygiene Christian vegetarianism Eastern Orthodox Church Theory of conduct Leather Slaughterhouse Cat food 613 mitzvot Japanese cuisine Reason Peter Singer Taiwanese cuisine Peruvian cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach Cyanocobalamin Marshmallow Cuisine of Singapore Chili con carne Fruit Tung Chung Freeganism Soup Organic food Gelatin German cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Bengali cuisine Cuisine of Ethiopia Hard-line Ayyavazhi religious practices Watermelon Cuisine of Africa Soy milk Book of Isaiah Whaling Gluten Cake Discordianism Person Clean animals Christian Vegetarian Association
