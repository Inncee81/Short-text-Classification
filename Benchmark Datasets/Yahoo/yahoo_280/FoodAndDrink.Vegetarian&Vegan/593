say you live in an igloo if you are a vegan what would you do if you lived in a place that had more than a foot of snow on the ground for several months out of the year crops don't grow the weather is too bad for too long there are no grocery stores and the weather is too bad for too long for planes to land or boats to get to shore and bring you anything you can't move away you are poor the only way you eat is to fish or hunt do you just choose to starve to death there are people in the world who either live in areas like this or in deserts where pretty much the same applies and access to food means anything that's living in the desert with you how can you rationalize that people shouldn't eat meat when there are places in the world where that's all that is available to them that's a pretty harsh judgment on those living in poverty with nothing other than animals to keep them alive would you starve your children to save the animals that's what you are asking of them to not eat meat okay it's not that easy if there are other things to eat what are they it's easy to say see if you can come up with some i think it's a lot easier for you guys to pass judgment than it is to justify what you are saying there are places where things don't grow even if you wouldn't live there many people do whether you are willing to admit it or not they can only eat what they can catch in some places that even includes insects so it's not natural or even possible for them to survive without meat so these same people are to poor to walk ok fine survive on what you come across until you come to civilization i'll give you that eat what manner of wildlife to survive i have always and will always maintain do what you have to to survive but these people on the outskirts of existence could just walk here realistically they could stay along the coast fish for food until they reach an intelligent area to live in and settle when possible to grow food what stops them ignorance my children don't starve why because we live in a climate conducive to plant life i didn't stay in the desert or the arctic fact of matter those who chose this are fools they are mearly surviving as opposed to thriving they should only eat meat on a survival basis only you tell me who requires them to stay in the harshest of climates they do they know how to walk its called migration migrate to a temperate climate as opposed to frigid only an idiot would live in the middle of a frozen wasteland Inuit Bird migration Theory of conduct Gray Wolf Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Taboo food and drink Anorexia nervosa Tlingit Ecology Whaling Veganism Kosher foods Food 613 mitzvot Poker jargon Operation Barbarossa Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Potato The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Peter Singer Tofu Food preservation Comanche Shark Guns, Germs, and Steel RuneScape locations Pork Economy of Africa Hiking Buddhism Neolithic Revolution Yosemite National Park Organic farming Genetic engineering Shaggy dog story Famine Environmental vegetarianism Livestock Theodicy Dog Desert The Amber Spyglass Orca Food storage Biodiversity Kashrut Buddhist cuisine Western United States Two Treatises of Government Acorn Capercaillie Life in the Freezer Pea Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Animal rights Earth People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Nile crocodile Latitude Organic food Mountaineering Stone Age Geography of India Fishing Garfield Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Salmon Lake Global warming and agriculture Reindeer Extinction Domesticated turkey Apple Space colonization Natural disaster MRE Volleyball Animism Desertification Disaster Mediterranean climate Atheism Fish farming Fast bowling Overpopulation Fox hunting Summa Theologiae
