'suitable for vegans' are some things in the uk suitable for vegans even if they don't say it on the packaging also if it says 'may contain traces of milk' but doesn't have milk in the ingredients list does this mean they actually have been prepared with milk or that they just so happen to have milk in the same factory i'm assuming if it was prepared with milk then it would say this in the ingrediets right yep plenty of pre packaged things are vegan but don't say so on the packaging don't know what part of the uk you're in but euroshopper never says suitable for vegans on the packaging that i've ever seen even if the ingredients for corn tortillas for example are just corn and salt just have to read ingredients and use common sense on some products same with the traces of milk thing it's just an allergy religious warning from being made in the same factory or on the same conveyor belt on a different day after being washed down i actually use the traces of milk warning to tell if breakfast cereals are vegan or not if it has the allergy warning stated like that i at least know there isn't milk product in the product otherwise it says contains milk ingredients Veganism Food Vegetarianism Dairy Kosher foods Tofu Breakfast Soy milk Soybean Bread Cheese Pizza Vegetarian cuisine Breakfast cereal Ice cream Flour Porridge Pancake Milk Tortilla Chocolate Coffee Sausage Cuisine of Brazil Rice pudding Sushi Peanut Muesli Rice Nestl__ Egg (food) Organic food Fecal incontinence Bengali cuisine Pop-Tarts Oreo Gluten-free diet Cuisine of Africa Food allergy Maize Soul food Cuisine of Denmark Ammonia Starch Milkshake Peruvian cuisine Jewish cuisine Soy protein Cuisine of the Philippines Leather Tea Gluten Polish cuisine Ovaltine Corn flakes Cereal Sugar beet Idli Cuisine of Singapore Honey Dieting Soap French cuisine Infant formula Food preservation Curry Cadbury Schweppes Biscuit Cuisine of Malaysia Cake Hong Kong-style milk tea Margarine Philosophical skepticism Theory of conduct Kitchen German cuisine Chicken M__m__lig__ Diarrhea Sorghum Chili con carne Nestl__ Nesquik Little Britain Breastfeeding Taco Natt__ Kraft Dinner Lactose intolerance Cuisine of the Southern United States Rice Krispies Dairy farming Organic farming Full English breakfast Futurama (TV series - season 2) Post office
