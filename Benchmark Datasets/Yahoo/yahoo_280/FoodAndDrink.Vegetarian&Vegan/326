vegetarian vegan i was a vegetarian for over a year and i have just recently became a vegan the diet change is the easy part but i'm and i love to shop i don't really know of any vegan clothing stores and i was wondering if i could still shop at my favorite stores american eagle aeropostale hollister abercrombie and fitch victoria's secret ect any other stores you can think of would be great thanks in advance oh as most said shop where you want and just don't buy things with leather wool silk etc this isn't directly part of your question but anyway i've had huge problems finding vegan shoes in stores and can't really afford to order online so if you have the same problem when it comes to shoes just buy whatever shoes you can that will last the world wasn't meant for vegans yet so shoes are still an issue don't worry yourself over it as long as you try to be to as cruelty free as possible that should be what counts Veganism Animal rights Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
