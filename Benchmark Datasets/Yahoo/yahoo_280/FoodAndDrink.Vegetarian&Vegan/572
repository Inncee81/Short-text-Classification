how do you actually and succesfully become a vegetarian at age forty is it better to change gradually or to simply ban all meat at once all input will be appreciated it's only too late if you're already dead forty sounds like the perfect age to become vegetarian if you're forty p you have your independence and don't have to listen to your parents tell you that you'll waste away without meat and if anyone else does you'll be too mature to even respond to their thoughtless comments the best way to do it is to study up on nutrition nothing major and start exploring vegetarian cuisine as you gradually eat less and less meat or types of meat it is as broad as traditional food choices and you will probably end up expanding the range of your diet there have been vegan olympic gold medalists and a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential http en wikipedia org wiki carl lewis http www eatright org cps rde xchg ada hs xsl advocacy enu html draft htm if you want to become a lacto ovo vegetarian the transition should be quite simple almost all meats have widely available commercial replacements all that you have to do is replace any flesh in your diet beef pork poultry seafood with meat analogs or just leave it out altogether you should keep in mind that a journey such as this can be quite short but should just be the beginning of a longer one to a plant based diet with no animal products this is because of the reality of factory farming in which animals that are kept alive to produce milk eggs etc suffer much more and longer than animals that are raised to a certain weight and then slaughtered http www veganoutreach org whyvegan http meat org some people use the word vegan in reference to this idea but be aware that applying that label to yourself should always come with the inclusion of wise activism and advocacy http www veganoutreach org advocacy index html two extremely important examples of this are that you should never speak to someone about vegetarianism veganism without their consent and genuine interest or as a comment on what they are eating and your dietary beliefs should never be used as an introduction or explanation of who you are as a person veg ism should be something that comes up after people get to know you and they offer you a situation that makes it confusing to withhold the information discussion also if you are presented something that you choose not to eat or you are ordering food eating together somewhere picking the best place to eat when you you hold off on the subject until it's necessary and then act like it isn't a big deal at all people are usually surprised and way more interested and curious than if you were to bring it up when someone's eating or just using it as a conversation starter a responsible vegan always studies the subject of their own health and how to keep their body completely provided for in every sense http www veganhealth org sh to neglect their body is to define a plant based diet as unhealthy and is the opposite of helping the animals just to clear things up the vegetarian vegan diet is not composed of salads vegetables fruit and fake meat fruits and vegetables are always important but they do not make up the largest portion of any healthy diet a balanced plant based diet includes grains breads pasta rice cereal legumes soy beans peas lentils fruit and vegetables http www pcrm org health veginfo vsk food groups html http www peta org accidentallyvegan http www veganoutreach org whyvegan eating html being vegan can be an art one whose challenge is to take things that involve the suffering of the innocent and change them into something free of cruelty a vegan woman can create an entirely new healthy human being inside of her many of these children stay vegan and grow up to be perfectly healthy adults so just keep yourself educated about what you eat and don't let anyone tell you that a veg diet is lacking anything essential technically the term vegetarian does imply that you don't consume anything that comes from the body of an animal that requires killing it many ingredients such as gelatin and glycerin are found in many candies fig newtons and many of other foods as well as rennet found in many cheeses http www happycow net health animal ingredients html the best thing to remember is to take your time so that for example when you are comfortable not eating beef and pork you can then give up chicken when you are sure you can make the commitment permanently depending on your age or reliance on parents or regional options it may not be best to give yourself a label the important thing is to do your best to make progress and be committed to your compassion towards animals never put your focus onto what you or other people use to describe yourself if you meet someone that talks down to people for eating meat dairy etc or to you because they think they are more veg than you laugh in their face and tell them they are a disgrace to the entire philosophy people like this only hurt the idea of veg ism and the animals the point of all of this is to live compassionately and and as free from cruelty
