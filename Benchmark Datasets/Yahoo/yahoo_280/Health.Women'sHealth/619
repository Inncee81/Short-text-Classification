menstrual suppression and bad pms so i have panic attacks and frequent depression which is of course exaherbated by my menstrual cycle damn being a woman some times well anyways i'm on 'the pill' which helps a lot with making the pms blues a lot easier and shorter lived and wondering about menstrual supression since i get pms before i'm even finished taking my active pills would moving on to the next pack help or make this problem last longer pms goes away after a day or few of bleeding obviously our bodies adjust to 'the pill' and the artificial cycle so maybe my body knows that cylce if i go on a three month cycle would i only get pms once every three months or would i have month of stability and months of my 'pms hell' any sources on this subject would be greatly appreciated and yes of course in addition to 'the pill' i do try improving my lifestyle and thought processes in order and am considering antidepressants to combat my anxiety mood issues this isn't really based on any source but just on my own slight knowledge of how 'the pill' works and the menstrual cycle pms actually occurs before your period although it can extend to the week of your period as well if you're dealing with pmdd and it sounds like you are on top of the other issues you mentioned i have them too then it's obviously a lot worse if the pill regulates the cycle then it's really the pills you take the week before that cause the pmdd hormones to be released and it seems like something like seasonale would be weeks at a time of that hormone of course this is just a guess but it seems like it could exacerbate the problem some women have had success with it and naturally others haven't i would try to talk to a specialist if you can and see what they have to say try looking up anything you can about menstrual suppression and it's side effects and multiply any possible mood disorders caused by it since i'm sure you know it may be just that much worse for you that's actually the main reason i didn't go for seasonale when it came out i'm just not really sure of how my own emotional health would be affected Menstrual cycle Premenstrual stress syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dysmenorrhea Clinical depression Oral contraceptive Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Sleep Chronic fatigue syndrome Anorexia nervosa Birth control Borderline personality disorder Antidepressant Polycystic ovary syndrome Psoriasis Menstrual cup Chlorpromazine Diazepam Stuttering Multiple sclerosis Postpartum depression Progesterone Transsexuality Puberty Stroke Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Panic attack Traumatic brain injury Nutrition Estrus cycle Paroxetine Migraine Depo Provera Female genital cutting Glucocorticoid Sexual abstinence Clomipramine Electroconvulsive therapy Ovulation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Baldness treatments Emergency contraception Baldness Childbirth Niddah Dog Cannabis (drug) Obesity Endometrium Hypoglycemia Hebrew calendar Alanis Morissette Breast Dieting Venlafaxine Insulin Breast cancer EastEnders Cognitive therapy Babe Ruth The Ashlee Simpson Show Extreme Programming Miscarriage Obsessive-compulsive disorder Divorce Anabolic steroid God Emperor of Dune Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Post-traumatic stress disorder Asthma Procrastination Vitamin D Primidone Menopause Mental illness Bupropion Anxiety Drug addiction Scientology beliefs and practices Chemotherapy Atkins Nutritional Approach Caffeine Orgasm Eczema
