tamponhelp hi i use the lightest s possile i can put them in but it takes along time to put them in im usally in the bathroom for like minutes putting them in cause im always scared to and i shake im only and sometimes they dont feel right so i take it out and put a new in and this happens everytime i think im putting them in right but how could this be maybe this is because you're still a beginner and you're only years old when you get used to them tampons should take only seconds to put in if your tampon doesn't feel right when it's inside then you probably have it in wrong or don't have it on high enough when you put in your tampon make sure you're angling it towards your tailbone the vagina lays flat so pushing back instead of up will help also make sure your applicater is inside of you all the way before you push in the nd tube this will ensure you have the tampon in the right spot good luck Menstrual cup Strap-on dildo Weight training Kenny McCormick Water polo Sanitary towel Professional wrestling holds Condom Menstrual cycle Toxic shock syndrome Herbert Garrison Vagina Professional wrestling throws The Amazing Race Time Out of Mind Equine conformation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Campfire Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Shuffle Pittsburgh Steelers Poker jargon Chess strategy and tactics Professional wrestling match types Avenue Q Glossary of climbing terms Cleveland Browns Homer Simpson Kurt Angle Milton H.
