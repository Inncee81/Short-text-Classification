shaving question girls only please this is kinda personal but when u shave down there how do you prevent from getting those red bumps any suggestions would be greatly appreciated thanks girls when you start doing it shave with the hairs not against it makes it a little stubbly but start with that to get the skin used to it use a ton of shave gel and be very gentle after a while start to shave against the hairs around the top closest to your belly button then with them everywhere else and gradually make the part you are shaving against the hairs bigger as in over the course of several weeks it worked for me you will probably still get them but not as much and eventually your shin will get used to it and it will be no problem Shaving Pubic hair Baldness Hair Haircut Skinhead Razor Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Acne Head shaving Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ron and Fez Depilation Waxing Professional wrestling throws Violin Aerial (dance move) Beard Global Gillette Pseudofolliculitis barbae Dilbert Kurt Angle Puberty Stomach cancer Black (people) Fancy rat Laser hair removal R.
