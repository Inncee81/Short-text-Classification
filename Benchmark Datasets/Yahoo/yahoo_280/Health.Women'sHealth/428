does this mean i am pregnant i took a pregnancy test during my period which came out negative however i only have a spotty period of five days and minor cramps am i pregnant i have took other pregnancy tests the first one was days before my period and the other was the day before my period both negative and the blood isnt pink or brown its like the regular color i also have minor cramps any pregnancy test in the pharmacy or cent shops are all accurate so to say that during this time you might not be pregnant as you are going through your period as i had read many of the comments on here so far they are all correct in what they are saying following the recommended waiting period of weeks and then take another test just to be on the safe side for you if you don't really want a baby yet plus also if you are having cramps and not having a real regular period as you thought you would then do this before knowing your period coming drink watermelon juice and coconut water if applicable these fruit drinks are great to help your body detoxify themselves and eases the menstration pains as it helps to clear and detox the heavy toxins that your body is getting rid off while you are 'on the rag' hope this helps Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Obstetrics Fertility awareness Breastfeeding Miscarriage Drug test Pregnancy test Coeliac disease Endometriosis Coffee Prenatal diagnosis Cytomegalovirus Psoriasis Childbirth Folic acid HIV test Tattoo Vitamin C Escherichia coli O157:H7 Prostate cancer Friends Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prolactinoma Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion Fasting Vampire EastEnders Cramp Multiple sclerosis Paracetamol Spina bifida Urinary incontinence First aid Turner syndrome Tocopherol Fecal incontinence Alcoholism Neighbours Raw food diet Rum Stomach cancer Chemical abortion Cannabis (drug) Clinical depression Fanta Premature birth Sami Brady Big Brother UK series 6 Cephalic disorder Tooth enamel Menstrual cup Animal testing Abortion debate Ben Johnson (athlete) Dialysis Hepatitis GED Malaria Diabetic retinopathy Hypertension Infantilism Apollo 8 Watermelon Humphrey Bogart Twin Group A streptococcal infection Person Guinea pig Polycystic ovary syndrome LSD Plutonium Emergency contraception Scientology beliefs and practices Sydney Riot of 1879 Knots Landing Mattress Intact dilation and extraction Abortion in the United States Ectopic pregnancy Cyanide Chronic fatigue syndrome Condom Maprotiline Human sexual behavior Coconut crab Pneumonia Schizophrenia Sharon Tate Tooth Breech birth Ja Rule Paget's disease of bone Lemonade Boston Public Sento
