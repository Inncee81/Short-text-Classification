i ended my pregnancy at weeks with an abortion due to fetal anomoly i barely have any pain and light bleeding is this normal i feel like i should be in alot of pain and lots of bleeding the termination was on friday has anyone else done this at this stage in the pregnancy when will my body realize it is no longer preg and reduce cravings will my breasts leak please call your doctor tomorrow they'll have the best answers to your questions no need to worry needlessly you know my uneducated guess as a woman who's been through pregnancy childbirth and a miscarriage is that it takes a while for the body to stop making those hormones after you're no longer pregnant you'll likely be physically free of them a few weeks if your breasts aren't leaking now i doubt they will in the future since your pregnancy is no more hope you feel better soon Pregnancy Miscarriage Obstetrics Abortion Abortion debate Breastfeeding Childbirth Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Premature birth Fertility awareness Roe v.
