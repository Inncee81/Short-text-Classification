is spanking harmful i have been chatting to this really nice guy on the net and we are close to meeting up for the first time soon but he has just said he is really into spanking i was spanked often as a child and have a bit of an issue with it it still sort of scares me is there any medical problems with being spanked i mean can it do any lasting harm i don't really want to give up on him but his last message made it quite clear that if i didn't let him he would have a problem with fulfilling himself in the bedroom help he seemed so nice and i don't want to lose out will it do me any harm should i take a chance is there anything i can do to make it easier to take he is so very nice otherwise and this seems like a little sacrafice on my part what does anyone think hi catherine i don't suppose there are any 'medical' issues unless the spanking is overly aggressive many people find spanking bondage highly erotic but i'm sure that there are also people that don't share the same view imho sex between two people improves the more you get to know your partner i e what they like and what they don't like if somebody wants you to indulge in bondage spanking please don't do it until you trust the person and you feel completely secure in their company my only concern here is that this guy has told you his desire before you've even met if you are going to meet this guy make sure your first meeting is in a very public place pub club etc and keep an eye on your drink not trying to scare you google 'date rape' and you'll see lots of unpleasant stories just proceed with caution and don't feel you have to make sacrifices if you don't like it don't do it boris BDSM Human sexual behavior Social rule Bondage (BDSM) Theory of conduct Human sexuality Spanking Serial killer Infantilism Extreme Programming Erotic spanking Divorce Sexual orientation Plame affair Liam Gallagher Rape Masturbation Avenue Q Abortion debate Corporal punishment The Apprentice 2 Polyamory Birthday Stewie Griffin Paraphilia Breastfeeding Current teachings of Prem Rawat Censorship in Australia Jam (TV series) Single Transferable Vote Prisoner's dilemma Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Privacy Sin City Shaggy dog story The Smoking Room Zoophilia Cybersex Child sexuality Childlove movement About a Boy Slash fiction Surveillance Religious Society of Friends James Dobson Alcoholics Anonymous Pretty Good Privacy Humphrey Bogart Domination & submission (BDSM) Transactional analysis Motivation Jon Secada Homophobia Anarchism and society Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Friends W.I.T.C.H.
