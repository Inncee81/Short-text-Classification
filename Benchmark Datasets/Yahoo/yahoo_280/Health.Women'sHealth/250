i had sex two weeks after my period and a week before the next period i 've been experiencing some cramping my period was due last week but it has not come as of yet i've taken pregnacy test but both have come back to being negative could i still be pregnant or not you had sex right around the time you were likely ovulating so yes there is a good possibility of pregnancy and cramps are a symptom of early pregnancy despite what the first answerer said i am weeks pregnant and had cramping in early pregnancy that felt just like i was about to get my period false negatives are very common in pregnancy tests because your body may not have produced enough of the pregnancy hormone to be detected by them yet i would take another test making sure to take it first thing in the morning before using the bathroom any other time and if it still comes out neg and you don't get your period see a doctor for a blood test Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Miscarriage Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Obstetrics Turner syndrome Human chorionic gonadotropin Endometriosis Twin HIV test Gonorrhoea Prenatal diagnosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Oral contraceptive Ovarian cancer Cytomegalovirus Abortion Ectopic pregnancy Cephalic disorder Urinary incontinence Prolactinoma Coeliac disease Morning sickness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Anemia Puberty In vitro fertilisation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hypoglycemia Haloperidol Abortion debate Ovulation Breastfeeding Endometrial cancer Sexual intercourse Drug test Hypertension Birth control Guinea pig Friends Child sexuality Gynecologic hemorrhage Hyperprolactinaemia Psoriasis Malaria Emergency contraception AIDS Diabetes mellitus Clinical depression Breast cancer Childbirth Diabetes insipidus Androgen insensitivity syndrome Alcoholism Sexual abstinence Folic acid Medicine Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Chemical abortion Spina bifida Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Sexual reproduction Diabetic retinopathy Doxepin Cancer Aortic dissection Hepatitis C Tobacco smoking Stroke EastEnders Pelvic inflammatory disease Sex education Premature birth Blood type Multiple sclerosis Cramp Autism Chronic fatigue syndrome HIV Human sexual behavior Lupus erythematosus Cardiac stress test Estrus cycle Progesterone Pneumonia Group A streptococcal infection Infertility Marilyn Monroe Breech birth Niddah Cervical cancer Transsexuality Stillbirth Health issues and the effects of cannabis Neighbours Estradiol
