early withdrawal bleed on the pill i am currently on yasmin the pill and have been for months usally when i take my last pill in my pack it takes about days for me to get my 'period' however this month i got my 'period' the day after i took the last pill in my pack surely my hormone levels would still be high in my body if i it was only hours since i took my last pill any answers to why this happened i think you might be over analyzing why this happened day or days can be a diffence but i doubt it is anything significant yea you should still have the hormones from taking the pill but sometimes periods are just a little goofy if you didn't get your period that is when i would worry if you are really concerned about it call your doctor he would know you and your body better than we do Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sleep Tocopherol Prostate cancer Vitamin D Puberty Urinary incontinence Apollo 8 Hormone Endometriosis Nutrition Breastfeeding Caffeine Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2 Acne Antidepressant Diazepam Baldness treatments Mid-Autumn Festival Growth hormone Abortion debate Growth hormone deficiency Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sedative Tide Depo Provera Transsexuality Glucocorticoid Traumatic brain injury Father's Day (Doctor Who) Psoriasis Growth hormone treatment Hypoglycemia Miscarriage God Emperor of Dune Ben Johnson (athlete) Social rule Folic acid Resident Evil Outbreak Theodicy Endometrium The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Angiodysplasia Progesterone Vaginal bleeding Veganism Glycogen storage disease type I Human penis size Gallstone Buprenorphine The Virgin Suicides Radiation poisoning Cannabis (drug) Chronic fatigue syndrome Breast cancer Hypertension Insulin Ovulation Stomach cancer Sadism and masochism Migraine EastEnders The Inside Neighbours Polycystic ovary syndrome Bupropion Pac-Man Paget's disease of bone Alanis Morissette Destiny of the Daleks First aid Aspirin Antiretroviral drug Guinea pig Hormone replacement therapy Human height A Canticle for Leibowitz Dehydroepiandrosterone Theodore Morell Signal transduction Ovarian cyst Tour de France Sant Thakar Singh Turner syndrome Sexual differentiation Gregory Goodwin Pincus Progesterone only pill Feminism Birth control Ectopic pregnancy President of Germany The Star Wars Holiday Special COX-2 inhibitor Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Limp Bizkit
