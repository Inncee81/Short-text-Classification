regular anal sex worry hi there my boyfriend and i have been together for a few years and for two of them we've been having anal as well as vaginal sex we're are faithful to each other and we're both our 'first' so we've never had a need to use a condom for either activity and have never been the worse for not doing so the thing is lately i've taken to preferring anal sex to vaginal sex it's not that vaginal isn't fun it still is and i get good orgasms it's just that i get great feeling from anal i love the naughtiness of it my question is whether all this anal sex we do it about twice or three times a week is going to be bad for me and whether i'm nor normal for wanting it so often i've never passed blood i've not gone all loose or anything like that i do need to know if it'll affect me eventually though am i a freak there is nothing wrong with anal sex you could have it every day if your boyfriend could handle it but i would recommend a few things to you just to make sure that you are going to be able enjoy having sex for a long time you really should be using condoms whether or not your partner and you are monogamous and you are both each other's firsts it is still really important you may not have had any problems with pregnancy or stis yet but you might in fact statistics show that you will also just be sure that you are using enough lubrication when you are having anal sex because unlike your vagina your anus does not produce lubrication lastly be sure that you are not having vaginal sex right after having anal sex this is very bad you will be sure to get an infection a very painful and uncomfortable one you really need to make sure that you either change the condom in between each act or you wash it thoroughly with soap and water but no you aren't a freak enjoy Safe sex Sexual intercourse Human sexual behavior Condom Oral sex Personal lubricant Birth control Menstrual cup Sex toy Masturbation Vulvovaginal health Child sexuality Anus AIDS Rape Fecal incontinence Orgasm Group sex Anal masturbation Sexual dysfunction Sexually-transmitted infection Pornographic movie Fisting Childbirth Intersex surgery Unsafe sexual practices Herpes simplex virus Genital wart Barebacking Gonorrhoea Prostate cancer Human sexuality Human sexual response cycle Gay slang Oral contraceptive HIV Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sex and the City Fertility awareness Vaginal lubrication Medical analysis of circumcision Dyspareunia Sexual abstinence Social rule Pedophilia Sex education Androgen insensitivity syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Menstrual cycle Physical intimacy BDSM Puberty Urinary incontinence Proper Condom Use Methamphetamine Sexual orientation Penis Pelvic inflammatory disease Gay bathhouse Soap opera Cervical cancer Theory of conduct Recurring South Park characters Anorgasmia Child sexual abuse Dildo Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Avenue Q Butt plug Vagina Human penis size Orgy Enema Knots Landing Virginity pledge Female genital cutting Transmission (medicine) Old wives' tale Premature ejaculation Zoophilia Infantilism Sybian Nonoxynol-9 Cervix History of intersex surgery Neighbours Radiation therapy Anal fissure Pregnancy Breastfeeding Breech birth Douche Obstetrics
