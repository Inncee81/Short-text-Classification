how u felt during ur first sex it felt burning ur vagina or it pains in any other way hai i m married and in way to final sex lol why i said in way because me and my husband still trying to do its hurting me a lot i heard from many ppl also that it hurts but in my case my i feel a burning feeling in my vagina is this the common pain described by ppl or ppl get hurt in any other way thnx it could very well be that your vagina is too small to accommodate his penis that's very normal and quite common just remember to relax and if it still hurts when he puts it inside of you try getting on top of him this allows you to open up more and to inadvertently relax at the same time and if you find that you're tightening up while you're having sex a lot of that is psychologically caused it's not your fault but sometimes sex can be very traumatic to the psyche even under the safest of circumstances talk with your husband about this and never rush anything that can only make it worse if you are trying to have sex while you're dry that can damage both you and him either use an artificial lubricant such as ky or have lots of foreplay to get you loosened up juiced up and more into what you are doing oral sex is a very good idea just remember if all else fails get drunk and screw trust me honey you won't feel a thing good luck and take care of yourself desiree Sexual intercourse Birth control Condom Masturbation Human sexual behavior Strap-on dildo Anal sex Intersex surgery Vagina Social rule Urinary incontinence Fecal incontinence Rape Theory of conduct Sexual dysfunction Human sexual response cycle Androgen insensitivity syndrome Premature ejaculation Human sexuality Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Orgasm Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Domestic violence Child sexuality Vulva Sex assignment The Shining (film) Narcissism Sex toy Piccolo Junior Saga David Reimer Anorgasmia Prostate cancer Infantilism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vaginal lubrication Alcoholics Anonymous Pitaten History of intersex surgery Female genital cutting Penis Violin Sexual arousal Erectile dysfunction Dyspareunia Penis removal Safe sex Transactional analysis Sigmund Freud Pain Grief One Tree Hill (TV series) Herpes simplex virus Gay slang Hypnosis Transsexuality Adoption Intersexuality Polyamory Katelyn Faber Equine conformation Happiness Sexual differentiation Out-of-body experience Sexuality in Christian demonology Yerba mate Dissociative identity disorder Maison Ikkoku Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jon Secada Gender role Jam (TV series) Transmission (medicine) About a Boy Medical analysis of circumcision Personal lubricant Sexual orientation Penis envy Sauna Women in Islam Characters in the Smurfs Karen Horney Fertility awareness Laura Schlessinger Sex and the City EastEnders Marilyn Monroe Vulvovaginal health Terri Schiavo Screw Tooth Big Brother UK series 6 Vernon Schillinger Breastfeeding Inhibited sexual desire Utilitarianism Episodes of Lost (Season 1)
