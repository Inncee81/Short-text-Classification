i need tips about the pill i'm year old girl and i'm on birth control for the purpose of regualting my periods since i've been on it i haven't noticed any side affects but are there any long term side affects i've been taking it for months now and i'll only be taking it for a couple more months also how does the pill make you skip your period is it safe does taking the pill cause any cancers diseases disorders or osteoporosis or any ohter health alterations there really are no long term side affects but you should talk to your gyn likely you are on a low dosage being that if you stopped taking your pill for days all its affects would leave your system sometimes with a strong pill there can be side affects such as weight gain or lack of sex drive but again this is all based on the pill you are taking at that time and no pills really have long standing affects if you were taking the pill of the next years and honeslty if you're periods were irregular like mine were when i was that age why even stop then i'd say you have something to worry about long term maybe but if only a few months then no nothing to worry about i personally do not see the big deal about pills that make you skip your period other people like it personally anytime my period has gotten close to not showing up it worries me one way or another it's dumping enough in your system to make your body think it's pregnant i'm sure there isn't anything bad about it just a personal preference at your age and just on it for as little a time as you are i would go on a pill where you have your period every month especially if the whole purpose of it is to regulate it Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Tocopherol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Birth control Fertility awareness Psoriasis Folic acid Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Apollo 8 Nutrition Abortion debate Binge eating disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sleep Urinary incontinence Neighbours Puberty Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bipolar disorder Clinical depression Oral sex Milk Medical cannabis Equine conformation Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy Transsexuality Anorexia nervosa Pharmaceutical company Childbirth The Inside Alcoholism Progesterone only pill Social rule EastEnders Alanis Morissette Caffeine Antiretroviral drug Hypoglycemia Osteoporosis Cerebral palsy Radiation therapy Obesity Doxepin Diabetic neuropathy Depo Provera Acne Creatine AIDS Child sexuality Aerial (dance move) TLC Charles Darwin's illness The Jam Breastfeeding Saved by the Bell Guinea pig Cephalic disorder Mutation Human penis size Human sexual behavior Medicine Condom Atkins Nutritional Approach Volleyball Glossary of partner dance terms Mid-Autumn Festival Insulin Hypertension Senescence Hearing impairment Dieting Sexual orientation Chlorpromazine Alzheimer's disease Sexually-transmitted infection Tobacco smoking Paget's disease of bone Drug abuse BDSM Procrastination Migraine Swingout Polyamory Kodocha Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Turner syndrome Knots Landing The Virgin Suicides Malaria Methamphetamine
