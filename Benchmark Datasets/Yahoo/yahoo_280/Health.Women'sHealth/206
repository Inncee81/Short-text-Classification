bathroom with dizzyness okay so this is kind of gross but its really confusing this is the second time that i've really been stressed out and had to go to the bathroom but im busy all the time so i just never have time to sit in the bathroom and go after like one or two days of not going i'll start getting dizzy and sweaty and have to sit or lay down because i start to black out why does this happen it is only natural to go to the bathroom it is our body's way of getting rid of waste and as you know the colon has bacteria that your body needs to get rid of when you do not go it makes everything worse and could cause serious trouble it may be your colon spasming for it needs to come out poop everyone does it and you must find time to empty your bowels it is waste you do not want to hold for it can make you sick just find time in your busy day to take the time you will feel much better Menstrual cup Urinary incontinence Japanese toilet Toilet Toilet humour Dietary fiber Chronic fatigue syndrome Hydrogen sulfide Tetanus Ileostomy Vomiting Colorectal cancer Hemorrhoid Infantilism Crohn's disease About Schmidt Dizziness Irritable bowel syndrome Saw (film) Altitude sickness Elvis Presley Traumatic brain injury Ulcerative colitis Opioid Pitaten Dialysis The Shining (film) Multiple sclerosis Housebreaking Feces Toilet-related injury Endosymbiont George Costanza Ron Weasley Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Time Out of Mind Dutch Schultz Diarrhea Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
