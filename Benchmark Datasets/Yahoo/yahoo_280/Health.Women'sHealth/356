what kind of ultrasound would they do if they are looking at my fallopian tubes i have really bad cramps and the doctor said she was going to do an ultrasound to see if there is something wrong with my fallopian tube i was just wondering if anybody else had this done and what type of ultrasound did they use as far as ultrasounds go you will most likely have both the external abdominal and transvaginal ones done the external u s is done via the outer belly pelvic area for that you will be drinking a certain amount of water to fill the bladder so that the images are clear the transvaginal u s is done via a probe inserted into the vagina it's not painful at all don't worry it gives a clearer view sometimes and the bladder is empty for it what a relief i'm wondering if you will also be scheduled for an hsg hysterosalpingogram which is a test to actually check the fallopian tubes for blockage a dye is injected via catheter through the cervix while an x ray is done the dye makes it possible for the radiologist and physicians to see the fallopian tubes this is a test that may cause some cramping either during the procedure and or afterwards before this particular test it's a good idea to take some ibuprofen to prevent too much cramping good luck to you i hope that all is well Urinary incontinence Ectopic pregnancy Prostate cancer Endometriosis Gynaecology Obstetrics Gonorrhoea In vitro fertilisation Cystoscopy Acupuncture Dialysis Pelvic inflammatory disease Gastroparesis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ovarian cancer Menstrual cycle Cervix Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Radiology Pregnancy Radiation therapy Intersex surgery Menstrual cup Intact dilation and extraction Medicine X-ray Intravenous therapy Abortion Medical imaging Sexual intercourse Abdomen Urinary system Cervical cancer Interventional radiology Vagina Medical ultrasonography Hepatitis Fertilisation Vaginal bleeding Sexual reproduction Computed tomography Fecal incontinence Aortic dissection Lethal injection Spina bifida Sex organ Syringomyelia Cholecystitis Bowel obstruction Malignant melanoma Cramp Intravascular ultrasound Miscarriage Prenatal diagnosis Stroke Brewery Traditional Chinese medicine Epidural Varicocele Terri Schiavo Erectile dysfunction Philips Osteoarthritis Female reproductive system (human) Kidney Intersexuality Premature birth Renal cell carcinoma Abdominal pain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infertility Oscilloscope Echocardiography Tattoo Lung cancer Sex assignment Cathode ray tube Uterine fibroids Mesothelioma Gynecologic hemorrhage Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures Cancer Strap-on dildo Breast cancer Local anesthesia Apollo 8 Ultrasound Cryptorchidism Hemorrhoid Endoscopy Venipuncture Non-invasive (medical) Insulin Atherosclerosis Condom Artificial insemination Guinea pig
