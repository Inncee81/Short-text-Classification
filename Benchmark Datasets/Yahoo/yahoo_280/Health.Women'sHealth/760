first off i know this is a kind of a wierd question to ask on yahoo it's about ovcon ok i got on ovcon when i was for irregular cycle and i just went off it completely in january i am now up until last month july i had a period every month and for the last weeks i've been experiencing vaginal spotting out of those weeks maybe i had to use a light pad for of those days b c it was a little more than usual i read that it could be a hormonal problem but i was just wondering has anyone else had this problem when going off ovcon i know for a fact that i am not pregnant so what are some possibilites if you had irregular periods etc before you went on the pill i would expect you to still have irregular periods when you come off it again the pill totally overrides your natural cycle it doesn't fix it also expect three months of screwed up cycles when you come off same as when you first started Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Urinary incontinence Hebrew calendar Birth control Tocopherol Apollo 8 Sleep Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Estrus cycle Gregorian calendar Solar eclipse Variable star Emergency contraception Acne Time Year Miscarriage Month Baldness treatments Computus Guinea pig 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Theodicy Calendar Puberty Circadian rhythm Ovarian cyst Alanis Morissette Julian day Infertility Obstetrics Menstrual cup Orgasm Julian calendar Extreme Programming Abortion debate Sphenoid bone Psoriasis Maya calendar 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, exit polls Ozone depletion Caffeine Hyperprolactinaemia 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Chronic fatigue syndrome Poker jargon Endometriosis Depo Provera Public domain ISO 8601 Sexual intercourse Roman calendar Vitamin D Hubble Space Telescope Isaac Newton's early life and achievements UK Singles Chart Subud Neighbours Electrophysiology Ectopic pregnancy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mercury Atlas 6 Dominical letter STS-114 Game programming Vaginal bleeding Ozone hole Ricci flow CPU cache Keynesian economics Esperanto as an international language Young Earth creationism Hormone replacement therapy USS Chicago (CA-136) Progesterone Toyota Prius USS Albemarle (AV-5) Endometrium Drill bit Sex assignment Homosexuality and transgender Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Hyperinflation Full moon cycle In vitro fertilisation USS George Washington (CVN-73) Japanese calendar Heinkel He 112 Black hole Malaria Niddah USS Alamo Prolactinoma Cardiac arrhythmia Abortion William Wakefield Chinese calendar
