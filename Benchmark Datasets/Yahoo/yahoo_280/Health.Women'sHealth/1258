could i get pregnant with no periods i missed my period months ago due to weight loss maybe however itis slow weight loss i am trying to have a baby with my husband all my tests were negative i have nothing wrong with my hormones can i still get pregnant if my period is lost i am and used to have regular periods i think the answer is yes i know that when you are breastfeeding you are still ovulating even tho' you might go without getting your period i don't know how it works but i do know that just because you don't get your period doesn't mean you aren't ovulating the key is trying to figure out when you are ovulating to have the best chances of conceiving i used to think that you ovulated in the middle of your cycle but then i read that you ovulate days from the end of your cycle so if you have a long cycle it can be quite a few days off from the middle since you aren't getting periods try to get in touch with your body and try to see if you can feel middleschmertz yes it really is called that pain the pain that comes with ovaulation then you might have a better idea of the best time to conceive good luck Fertility awareness Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Ovulation Polycystic ovary syndrome Breastfeeding In vitro fertilisation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Pregnancy test Miscarriage Infertility Prostate cancer Puberty Childbirth Ovarian cyst Human chorionic gonadotropin Birth control Estrus cycle EastEnders Ovarian cancer Emergency contraception Hebrew calendar Abortion debate Urinary incontinence Anne Rice Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Fecal incontinence Breast cancer Weight training Equine conformation Dualism (philosophy of mind) The Death Gate Cycle Friends Niddah Theory of conduct Coeliac disease Guinea pig Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Quicksort Kender Mountain Gorilla Haloperidol Ontological argument Transactional analysis Human adaptation to space Brassiere Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dieting Mary, the mother of Jesus Humphrey Bogart Maya calendar Stomach cancer Prolactinoma Ravi Shastri Endometriosis Neighbours Sharon Tate Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Fertilisation Weight loss Folic acid Ovary Philosophical skepticism Traumatic incident reduction Goodness and value theory Hair Carpel Conifer cones Cleveland Browns The Cursed Videotape Singlish Cancer Butterfly stroke Chronic fatigue syndrome Bene Gesserit Kurt Cobain Clinical depression Simone Weil Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 CPU cache Ra (board game) Eternal return Eclipse cycle Baldness treatments Premature birth Rosa Parks Sleep Craps Tocopherol Prolactin Hypothyroidism Addison's disease Flowering plant Traumatic brain injury New York Knicks Friedrich Schleiermacher
