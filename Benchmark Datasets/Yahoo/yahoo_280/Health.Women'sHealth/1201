thinking about having a mirena coil fitted i have been having problems with my current form of contaception depo vera injection due to continuous break through bleeding and my gp has suggested this type of coil what are the advantages disadvantages of it thanks well i ve done some reasearch because i want to got it too and the webpage says it is very similar to esterilization in terms of effectivity it has a very low dose of hormones so you have practically no side effects but the great side effect i saw testimonies of women with n period foe two years or very low discharge of blood qhen period i think it has no disadvantages forget about pills patches shots it looks like a great iud but i also found out the insertion is painful s it couldn t be perfect but women seem to be happy because it lasts for years the only uncomfortable thing is the insertion it seems the gyn measures your cervix in order to see if the iud will fit and that hurts some women say other thing is that till your body gets used to it you may have like days of cramps but you can use some analgesic for that i also found they recommend it for women that have had a child before because they re cervix is more open but if you have no child you can have it too but i guess the insertion must be more painful anyway i have a bad history in my family of brain stroke from my mom i have some spider vains and bad circulation so i found out it has no precaution on women like me with bad history so i guess it is the one for me as i cannot take hormones and it won t damage my body i think it is good as you know hormones are not good for your body unless you need them this is what i researched hope i helped and good luck d Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Intrauterine device Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tocopherol Insulin Emergency contraception Miscarriage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Migraine Childbirth Growth hormone deficiency Stroke Endometriosis Growth hormone treatment Obstetrics Breastfeeding Birth control Psoriasis Puberty Abortion Intravenous therapy Traumatic brain injury Menstrual cup Aspirin Multiple sclerosis Premature birth Gonorrhoea Ectopic pregnancy First aid Strap-on dildo Nutrition Chlorpromazine Chronic fatigue syndrome Breast cancer Acupuncture Transformer Stomach cancer Folic acid Cervix Malaria Blood pressure Paracetamol Polycystic ovary syndrome Dialysis Methamphetamine Tesla coil Pain Spider Drug abuse Analgesic Radiation therapy Herpes simplex virus Clinical depression Condom Tobacco smoking Atherosclerosis Electrophysiology Intact dilation and extraction Depo Provera Autoimmune diseases Ketamine Swimming Acne Mattress Local anesthesia Haloperidol Blood (computer game) Myocardial infarction Orgasm Medicine Gynaecology Turner syndrome Buprenorphine Diazepam Doxepin Brain Chemotherapy Animal testing Pregnancy Cervical cancer Intersex surgery Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cryptorchidism
