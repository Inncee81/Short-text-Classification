fibroids women only please i went to my gynecologist a few weeks ago and the pap smear was normal but he said i have some fibroids and he wants to do an ultrasound that will be in more weeks i h b reading on the internet about fibroids and they are non cancerous and normal for women to get them but i'm concerned about the treatment one method is a non operational procedure called uterine fibroid embolization done in the hospital to shrink them this can also trigger menopause i'm so this wouldn't be too much of a concern another method of treatment is an experimental drug that can have side effects it didn't give the name of the drug or the possible side effects so my question is have any of you ever taken this drug for fibroids and if so did you experience any side effects or did you have the fibroid embolization procedure and what was your opinion i'm not really worried about anything but would just like to know what to expect thanks in advance for your input i second the natural progesterone approach fibroids are estrogen driven give your body the anti estrogen it needs and you may be able to avoid surgery altogether at natural progesterone is something you should probably be using anyway these fibroids give you a good reason to look into it do not do the lupron treatment your doctor is talking about this is some bad bad stuff or he may be talking about the newer alternative to lupron called lyrica equally bad dr john lee was very successful in treating fibroids with progesterone check out his book called what your doctor may not tell you about menopause he does a fantastic job of explaining in plain english what hormone imbalance does to us and how to correct it Uterine fibroids Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cycle Endometriosis Breast cancer Cancer Stomach cancer Hysterectomy Gynaecology Endometrial cancer Urinary incontinence Obstetrics Medicine Progesterone Stroke Oral contraceptive Chemotherapy Gynecologic hemorrhage Osteoporosis Prolactinoma Polycystic ovary syndrome Ectopic pregnancy Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Clinical depression Acne Menopause Abortion Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Baldness treatments Breastfeeding Puberty Adenomyosis Radiation therapy Anorexia nervosa Baldness Chiropractic Atherosclerosis Castration Traditional Chinese medicine Estrogen Traumatic brain injury Experimental cancer treatment Childbirth Migraine Testosterone Growth hormone treatment Ovarian cancer Publicly funded medicine Health insurance Transsexuality Hypoglycemia Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Folic acid Turner syndrome Post-traumatic stress disorder Vaginal bleeding Dysmenorrhea Bipolar disorder Sexual dysfunction Intravenous therapy Insulin Malaria Atrial fibrillation Haloperidol Adverse effect (medicine) Oral sex Amenorrhoea Natural Hygiene Air embolism Cholesterol Depo Provera Theory of conduct Human chorionic gonadotropin Acromegaly Alternative medicine Schizophrenia Estrus cycle Aromatase Scientology beliefs and practices Gastroparesis Lung cancer Epilepsy Phimosis Gynecomastia
