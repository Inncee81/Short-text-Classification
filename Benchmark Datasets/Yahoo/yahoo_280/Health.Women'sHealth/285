allrite i need to get this straight allright so i have been seeing all kinds of messages about sex hurting the first time my b f and i have been talking about it and as been said before he is trying to push me towards having sex but i just want to get it straight what would help to make it not hurt why does it hurt and anything else i should be aware of i already know there is a risk of pregnancy std etc but i just want some striaghtfoward answers thank you the reason for the pain discomfort burning sensation is that the hymen is stretched and broken essentially tearing it away from the vaginal wall there isn't really a whole lot that can be done to prevent the discomfort if he has used a finger before this may also create tears in the hymen but there will still be an element of pain discomfort with the initial act don't let the fear of what you may experience the first time make you afraid to do it again your bf needs to let you heal for a few days before trying again as you gain more experience it will become pleasurable just take your time and don't rush things edit about minutes later too a guy will say if you love me you will do it well he is not showing you respect aka love by telling you that most guys have this thing i don't know something to put another notch on their belt or something don't get into a situation where you do this then all of a sudden he stops calling and talking to you because essentially he has used you to place that notch he will give reassurances promises but remember presents aren't promises kisses aren't contracts know yourself and how you think of yourself respect yourself to hold off another day taking your time as above Anal sex Human sexual behavior Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
