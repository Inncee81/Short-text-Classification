how do you bring up a smell my fiance works with a woman who has a very very strong feminine scent not a good one he doesn't feel comfortable addressing this with her and the boss is male there are some women who work with them who should talk to her about it and how to bring it up and what to say that is a tough one if it makes the workplace uncomfortable as i'm sure it does yes it can be overpowering and really disguisting would it be any worse if someone was coming in without deodorant on and had massive body odor i'm sure someone would say something then i would address the issue to hr first to be sure it is handled properly so no one gets in trouble over trying to clarify the situation Social rule Odor Friends Sin City Gender-neutral language Perfume Olfaction Maison Ikkoku Ranma __ characters The Critic Sanitary towel EastEnders W.I.T.C.H.
