anal iitching bleeding from wiping too hard i didn't know how else to put it for the heading for a long time i've been having anal itching and when i wipe the anal area too rough it bleeds i've tried over the counter medicines and it helps but only for a little while i use baby wipes to cleanse that area until i take a shower whenever i have a bowel movement it itches really bad and i can't help but to wipe that area hard to keep it from itching i don't need nobody to be teasing me about my problem i just need advice as to what i can use or what it could be thanks most likely the result of hemorrhoids try dabbing your rectum with a witch hazel pad or preparation h wipes you could also try hemorrhoidal creams and suppositories in case you have internal hemorrhoids too in addition you may consider taking a stool softener daily and drinking more water to reduce your strain during bowel movements and thus easing some of the pressure on your bowel if it continues to be bothersome see your doctor for further evaluation Hemorrhoid Fecal incontinence Constipation Anus Urinary incontinence Anal fissure Ulcerative colitis Breastfeeding Diarrhea Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Laxative Psoriasis Enema Irritable bowel syndrome Defecation Toilet humour Anal masturbation Yarrow Escherichia coli O157:H7 Colorectal cancer Diverticulosis Crohn's disease Colonoscopy Chlorpromazine Prostate cancer Childbirth Rectocele Hard water Radiation therapy Flatulence Coeliac disease Eczema Allergy Folic acid Stomach cancer Sento Rectum Sigmoidoscopy Dietary fiber Anal sex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Wack Pack Vitamin C Strap-on dildo Earwax Apoplexy Medical prescription Tocopherol Wound Mesalazine First aid Certified Nursing Assistant Mattress Group A streptococcal infection Japanese tea ceremony Human feces Spina bifida Gonorrhoea Abortion Birth control Japanese toilet Diving Malignant melanoma Butt plug Computer virus Traumatic brain injury Rectal prolapse Migraine Cancer Fisting Chair Urticaria Otitis externa Transmission (medicine) Vulvovaginal health Menstrual cup Stroke Oral sex Tea Water purification Equine conformation Clostridium difficile Hirschsprung's disease Manicure Sulfasalazine Dairy COX-2 inhibitor Condom Syringomyelia Bidet Ebola Obstetrics The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Fistula Gout Oral contraceptive Rum Homeopathy Angiodysplasia
