understanding abortion how does one wrap their mind around this concept i have looked at pictures of aborted babies seen what is done to them i can see it going on before the baby is actually fully formed but how can this go on when the baby is fully formed how can the doctor do this and feel nothing how can they do it day after day for that matter what about the nurses who witness these abortions how do they live with it the pics i have seen broght me to tears instantly yet they do this daily i'm really not trying to judge i just simply don't understand anyone out there work in these clinics how do you live with yourself seeing this go on daily how do you get past it i have judges others then i have tried to be compassionate and give helpful info but it is so difficult to do when you have seen such horrific pictures and i do realize that it has to be done to save a mothers life rape incest it's still tough not to judge i find myslf getting more and more upset so i will no longer read or answer questions about abortion form this point on i need to keep my sanity how do you live with yourself seeing this go on daily ok it sounds like i am judging but this isn't how i meant it let me word it differently how do you deal with this line of work on a daily basis sometimes people have to make hard decisions it is important to try to have compassion i could never abort but then again i have never been pregnant as a result of rape or incest i have never been and pregnant either it's tough but it's important to try not to judge although it's hard for me not to judge with doctors they do what they have to do if the mother is going to die as a result of carrying to full term who do you sacrifice the mother or a baby who probably won't make it anyway with a teenager they might so something rash like overdose on pills to try to make them abort or try to injure themselves i had a friend commit suicide in high school because she got pregnant and was too afraid to tell her parents that's two lives wasted she shot herself in the stomach by the way it took her hours to die and she died alone with no help until it was way too late i know it's awful it's hard to see it's a terrible choice to make but there are times in our lives where we come up against very difficult choices sometimes the only option is the most difficult of all Abortion debate Abortion EastEnders Pregnancy Theory of conduct Kurt Cobain Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Days of our Lives Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Kodocha Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Religion and abortion Stomach cancer Boston Public Miscarriage Pro-choice Abortion in Canada Jam (TV series) Mother Teresa Charmed Emergency contraception Humphrey Bogart A Course In Miracles Oral contraceptive Coming of Age (TNG episode) Marilyn Monroe History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Partial-birth abortion One Tree Hill (TV series) Polyamory Traumatic incident reduction Friends Alignment (role-playing games) Jon Secada Incarnations of Immortality The nature of God in Western theology Serial killer Drawn Together Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist YuYu Hakusho Ten Commandments Mid-Autumn Festival Terri Schiavo Fathers' rights Psychiatric hospital Neighbours Past teachings of Prem Rawat Prostate cancer Prenatal diagnosis Controversies in autism The O.C.
