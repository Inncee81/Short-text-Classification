sex health question everytime my husband and i have sex if i do not immediatly get up and use the restroom i always end up with a bladder infection i would like to spend time with my husband afterwards but instead i always have to go to the restroom why is this and what can i do about it also are there any related topics where i can read about this on the internet the exact location of the urethra varies in women for some of us it is very close to the vaginal opening or even a little inside we are the ones who are more prone to uti's because bacteria gets pushed into the opening of the urethra during sex even if you're clean there will always be some bacteria normal the problem is that unlike the vagina the environment in the urethra can't inhibit their growth very well also previous utis can leave behind some scarring which provides an even better environment for the bacteria to grab hold and start multiplying cranberry helps but is no substitute for flushing out by peeing right away bottom line is that you should just snuggle for a minute jump up and pee then come back for more snuggle time just do it without thinking about how much you resent it and it won't interfere with the moment that much make sure hubby knows the whole story and can be supportive Urinary incontinence Menstrual cup Urinary tract infection Intersex surgery Urethra Urine Medical analysis of circumcision Strap-on dildo Penis Vulvovaginal health Orgasm Gonorrhoea Prostate cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Urination Vagina Anal sex Sexual intercourse Oral sex Hypospadias Condom Multiple sclerosis Toilet Safe sex Acne Tampon Herpes simplex virus Intersexuality Candidiasis Urinary system AIDS Physical intimacy Fecal incontinence Sexual dysfunction Vulva HIV Human sexual behavior Washroom Cystoscopy Puberty Sex toy Female ejaculation Cancer Human sexuality Pneumonia Childbirth Sexually-transmitted infection Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Cat Diving Lactobacillus acidophilus Anorgasmia Group sex Pornographic movie Sexual orientation Birth control Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fisting Vaginal lubrication Wound healing phases Child sexuality Escherichia coli Swingout Sexual differentiation Intravenous therapy Antibiotic B3ta Transmission (medicine) Aerial (dance move) Social rule Cervical cancer Carnivorous plant Caesarean section Lymphogranuloma venereum Domestic rabbit Douche Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Autism Dyspareunia Antiseptic Equine conformation Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Skene's gland Incest Poker jargon Dyslexia Female genital cutting Endometriosis History of intersex surgery Benign prostatic hyperplasia Drill bit Joke Sexual reproduction Tooth enamel Psoriasis Urinal Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans)
