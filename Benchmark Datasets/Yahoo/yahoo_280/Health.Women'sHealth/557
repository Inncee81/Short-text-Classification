questions about hymens girls only please okay i am a virgin and when i went in for my first pap with my obgyn about years ago he started the exam and than asked are you sure that you are a virgin i said yes and than his next question was have you used a tampon i had i asked the nurses assistant after the doctor left what she thought he meant by his question and she said she thought maybe that meant the hymen was broken but he didn't write anything in the chart so my question is does that mean that the hymen was broken the first time i used a tampon it hurt alot this was a about years ago and i know that i was not inserting it in correcty your hymen could have been broken by the tampon the hymen is a thin membrane and it usually is flexible enough to stretch with tampon use but not always some women have a thicker hymen which can tear and cause pain if the doctor asked then there was probably more damage to the hymen than would normally be caused by tampon use there are a number of different causes for this anything from a bike accident to masturbation if you had difficulty using a tampon you probably had a thicker hymen and if you were definitely inserting it incorrectly then you could have done extra damage to your hymen which won't hurt anything in the long run Virgin Deconstruction Anal sex Prostate cancer Menstrual cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Toxic shock syndrome Traumatic brain injury Strap-on dildo Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind H.D.
