help me please i dont know what to do ok so i work at frys electronics i work there as a service tech today i was working on a customers machine and i admit i was being stupid and forgrtting that i have the mother board on the case touching metal i turned it on and the motherboard fried my soupervider gave me a day suspension and said that he will send this out to home office that i damaged frys property i know it was my mistake even wanted to pay for the motherboard but no he suspended me for days i really love my job but i am scared i might get fired on tuesday because of my stupidity this is my first time i made a big mistake like that i have been working there for months and fixed the most computers and the made the most money for the department i really dont want to get fired i am going to college and have to pay for college to i dont want to be jobless please i am really impatient and feel like kiling myself seriously wow i still cant believed that i got suspended i like my job alot from a legal standpoint you probably do not want to admit in writing that you made an error however you probably do want to tell your supervisor that you are very sorry for the mistake and that it will not happen again legally they could have fired you on the spot so the fact that all you got was a suspension is a good thing the length of your suspension time is probably required by the corporate hr due to the seriousness of the error what you do is go back into work when your suspension is up apologize to your supervisor tell the supervisor you will never make another careless mistake and then work your tail off your supervisor gave you a second chance here make the most of it good luck United States Postal Service Plame affair 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Philip J.
