can a employer legally deduct your lunch break from your pay my employer deducts our lunch break from our pay so instead of getting paid for hours per day we get paid for is this legal and if not whom do i need to contact i've never heard of this before my state is north carolina thanks remember the saying there's no such thing as a free lunch i'm sorry to say that's your answer there are rules that your employer has to follow that say when they have to give you a break but there's nothing in the rule book that says you have to get paid for that break for example when i worked for an insurance company back in the mid 's we worked an hour day with a minute lunch break each day now our salary was based on a hour week so our lunch breaks were unpaid then when i worked for the federal government one of their agencies we were paid for a hour week but we actually worked an hour day or a hour week again our minute lunch breaks were unpaid the key is are you paid a yearly salary or are you paid an hourly wage if you're paid a yearly salary it really doesn't matter if you get paid for lunch or not since you get a salary since you get paid by the hour you have to look at it the other way your boss is deducting that half hour's pay because you didn't work it right in actuality it should never have been recorded in the first place since you did not work it your time worked should have been recorded as hours not correct okay bear with me one more minute please does your employer by their putting hours down first does it give you an advantage or does it disadvantage you here's what i'm trying to say a by their putting down you worked hours is more money going into your fica account b by their putting down you worked hours is more money going toward federal or state or local income taxes c by their putting down you worked hours instead of is more money being taken out for anything else understand what i'm getting at if you boss if putting down instead of it may in fact provide an advantage to you or it may in fact be a disadvantage to you ken noto Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Unemployment benefit Gross domestic product Minimum wage Annuity 401(k) Wal-Mart Child support Insurance Compensation of employees National Insurance Flat tax Progressive tax Productive and unproductive labour Student loan Blackjack FairTax Health insurance Surplus value Air traffic controller Anarchism and capitalism Day care Working time Payroll Salary Publicly funded medicine Reaganomics National Football League School choice Surplus labour Supply-side economics Trade union Income trust Economic inequality Labour economics Labor theory of value Salary cap Labor-power Education in the United States New Deal Tax protester Class struggle Ken Jennings United States Postal Service Education in Romania George W.
