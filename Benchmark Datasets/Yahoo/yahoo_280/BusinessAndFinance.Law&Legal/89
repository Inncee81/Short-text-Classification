law career question what is the difference between a paralegal and a lawyer and what is the difference in pay thanks job description paralegal busy lawyers often find that there is not enough time to do all of the research and preparation required for each case to help overcome this problem lawyers often employ the services of paralegals paralegals assist lawyers they do the preparatory research for hearings trials closings and corporate meetings they look up anything relevant to the cases on which they work they prepare legal documents and they might even assist lawyers during trials perhaps preparing legal arguments however unlike lawyers they are not permitted to appear in court alone they are also not permitted to set legal fees or give legal advice the lawyers for whom they work assume all responsibility for their work paralegals duties vary depending on the type of employer for example paralegals working for civil litigators spend most of their time drafting and filing documents in the field of family law they might draft pleadings and motions and calculate child support those working for a corporation s legal department will assist in the preparation of financial reports employee contracts and employee benefit plans often a paralegal specializes in only one area of the law such as labor law bankruptcy or real estate job description lawyer if you are interested in justice enjoy arguing about important issues or feel that you would like to help people learn about their rights then you might consider becoming a lawyer most of us are familiar with tv shows like law and order that dramatize the lives of lawyers but that s only part of the picture in fact most lawyers spend a lot more time reading writing and researching than they do in court there are also many types of lawyers some work for the government and prosecute people accused of crimes others defend people accused of crimes both of these types of lawyers are known as criminal lawyers other lawyers focus on business related matters like taxation commercial transactions and the incorporation of new companies generally called corporate lawyers their work involves fewer court appearances and more negotiations and careful reading of contracts some lawyers specialize in litigation of non criminal matters such as wrongful dismissal suits and negligence actions lawyers living in small towns may practice in all of these areas whatever their specialty lawyers share many of the same basic duties one of their main tasks is advising clients of their legal rights responsibilities and potential problems they also represent clients in negotiations and in front of courts and tribunals researching rules regulations and previous cases is another major part of their job much of their time is spent preparing legal documents like contracts and wills it s their job to make sure that the wording is clear and covers all eventualities so that conflict won t arise in the future in all these situations lawyers are responsible for interpreting the law and applying it to specific situations they use their knowledge of the law to help their clients and ensure that the legal system works properly wages these are from my area it's different in everyone but you can see the big difference occupation paralegals and legal assistants entry wage hourly annual median wage h a experienced wage h a occupation lawyers entry wage h a median wage h a experienced wage h a good luck hope this helps Law firm Trade union Tort reform Microeconomics Slander and libel Insurance Government of France Tax Scots law Legal system of Hong Kong Due process Corporation Jury Intellectual property Supreme Court of the United States Estoppel Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Adversarial system Australian constitutional law Civil rights Jury trial Constitution of Ireland Cour de cassation Minimum wage Corporate governance Corporate personhood Economic inequality Judicial functions of the House of Lords International law Government of India SCO-Linux controversies Probation officer Public domain Ethics Same-sex marriage in Canada Capitalism Keynesian economics Fathers' rights 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Trademark Theory of conduct Treaty Legal research Enron Corporation Leasing Democracy Unemployment Equal Protection Clause Trust (Law) USA Taxation in the United States First Amendment to the United States Constitution Judicial review Administrative law of the United States Tom DeLay Life insurance International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Negligence Medical malpractice Article One of the United States Constitution Free trade American Civil Liberties Union John Edwards Tax protester Inflation Construction Copyright Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Enterprise content management SCO v.
