if most people are making gains on the stock market where is the money coming from say the stock markets double in value over a year where does the money come from who is losing money it's a hypothetical question similarly if the stock markets crash big time where does the money go who is making big gains when the markets flatline this is kind of a strange question to ask if you know how the stock market works it doesn't make sense because there is no real money being lost if the stock market doubles in value in the market you don't have to have a loser to get a winner it's difficult to explain if you buy the share at and someone is willing to buy it for you have made but that doesn't mean the person who bought it lost since he now owns something that other people are willing to buy at if something happened so that others were no longer willing to pay but only then the person owning the stock would have theoretically lost Mutual fund Warren Buffett Capital accumulation Stock Short selling Corporation PE ratio Surplus value Stock market Option Microeconomics Mad Money Financial markets Dot-com Monopoly (game) Citigroup Supply-side economics Annuity Economics Finance Wall Street Crash of 1929 Enron Corporation Theory of conduct Law of value Dividend Privatization Blackjack Gross domestic product Life insurance Arbitrage Gambling Bond Call option Institutional fund management Insider trading Great Depression World Series Internet fraud Wheel of Fortune MMORPG Poker jargon Fixed income Day trading Derivative (finance) Hyperinflation Mergers and acquisitions Neopets Labor theory of value Speculation Asian financial crisis Socialism Money Technical analysis Money supply Sears Holdings Corporation Security (finance) Association of Tennis Professionals Federal Reserve Temasek Holdings Surplus product Video game crash of 1983 Capitalism Joseph P.
