i've newly gotten a stock broker and i'd like to put my money where my mouth is so if you were me what proverbs say's the rich rule over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender so sence i've spent enough time being poor and ruled over the wrong way and a borrower owing the lender more then i borrowed i figured way not go it i'll end up making more in stoke's then i'm making being poor so why not what do i have to lose i'm already poor but i was asked what comoditie's would you like to invest in and i said hum let me get back to you on that now who do i ask that know's what i don't know i know i have yahoo answers to ask so here i am to ask what is a comoditie which one do i invest in i know somebody knows and no i don't have any shame in asking i was alway's taught if you don't know ask lots of good advice given so far by others educate yourself read look at the journey good stuff the best advice for long term investing is just that invest for the long term get an and stay in lots of folks chase yesterday's winners now today's dogs buying high and selling low being in the market over time is the best and most proven way there will a small number of days to see gains losses inthe stock market if you are on the sidelines you will miss this i see it all the time a commodity like gold oil cash crops etc carries a high risk due to volatility it is certainly a specialty i wouldn't advise this as your first only entry into the market regarding where to look international has done well i would imagine that trend would continue but this is a area with zero guarantees a wholesaler at conservative firm witha track record of less volatilty than most other firms told me their research says that now is the time to look into large cap stocks if you look at the top companies listed in the s p these large companies are trading at a very low price relative to their earnings essentially they are on sale their performance and balance sheets are strong especially when compared to the internet stocks of years ago this looks good for the more immediate time horizon but be sure to do your own homework and review items periodically reviewing asset allocation is also key checking daily on a long term investment takes a strong stomach ask around for a referral to a good advisor start simple and conservatively to see how you feel about market swings you have to be able to sleep at night the market will go up the market will go down if you are ok with the risk and it meets your individual profile then adjust accordingly your advisor registered rep can assist here systematic investments are great ways to contribute and build something these allow you to toss in a month or whatever into a mutual fund the important thing is that it be consistent if the market is down you are buying items on sale just get a plan and keep with your plan Bond Finance Short selling Bank Investment bank Mortgage Capital accumulation Financial markets Microeconomics Hedge fund Insurance Mergers and acquisitions Citigroup Security (finance) Stock market Derivative (finance) Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Debt Privatization Arbitrage Institutional fund management Gross domestic product Capitalism Technical analysis NASDAQ Eugene Fama Free trade Ra (board game) Economy of India Social Security debate (United States) Supply-side economics Interest Economy of Pakistan Temasek Holdings Capital asset pricing model Warren Buffett Gold as an investment Annuity Day trading Economy of the United States Tax History of the United States (1918-1945) FairTax The Apprentice 2 Option Economy of Africa Tesco Asset Financial services Wal-Mart Exchange-traded fund Economics Economy of Nigeria Supply and demand Stock broker Keynesian economics Asian financial crisis Predatory lending Berkshire Hathaway Political economy Bank fraud Gold standard Income trust Poker jargon Student loan Strategic management Inventory United Kingdom corporation tax Commodity markets Modern portfolio theory Economic history of Japan Arthur Laffer Economy of Chile American Broadcasting Company Bretton Woods system Common Agricultural Policy Internet fraud Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Trade Money supply Islamic banking Donald Trump Model (economics) Personal finance Enron Corporation Great Depression Surplus value Commodity Usury Economy of C__te d'Ivoire
