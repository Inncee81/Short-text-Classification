what's your take on the stock markets declining it's not just ours japan and europe as well someone give me a more complex answer as to why all this is going on or your thoughtful opinion on it the news treats us like idiots it seems and i would like a more thorough explanation see pj's answer read much like a newspaper it seems they tell you the surface and don't explain why things change the market so drastically and why other markets are reacting mainstream just states it doesn't explain it i always figured media should educate and inform i'm sorry for offending you and making it sound like i don't read the news what's important is this matter is that i wondered about it enough to find more info via yahoo answers please don't criticize me and keep this a friendly informative question truthfully as an economist and really one of the best investors in the world no one knows the news needs to report something and if we answered the news with shrugged shoulders they wouldn't be happy there are a lot of specific things going on here the big one is true liquidity crisis cash is king as the saying goes for a long time private investors were buying subprime mortgages and at very low interest rates but at interest rates above market rates the problem with subprime and alt a loans is that we do not know how they will react under stress the subprime market is now defaulting on of the outstanding loans if you are charging a interest rate that is a huge loss this should just be a blip on the screen except these loans are in portfolios and since no one will buy them their price is effectively if you owe hundreds of millions of dollars have no cash on hand cannot sell your mortgages then you start selling anything you can sell to meet cash needs because lenders are getting jittery and demanding either repayment or additional collateral that is the public story now the rest of the story the us stock market is way overvalued especially under inflationary expectations and considering the level of global uncertainty but prices in markets are rarely rational they are just the result of bidding many institutional investor s are seeking liquidity or alternative higher yielding investments in other global markets additionally this white house has way overspent the last time the us was this indebted to foreign governments was the civil war but bush would never have been able to meet his campaign promises on our money alone he promised things america actually doesn't have the money to buy but he bought it anyway to add to the pain the average us citizen is indebted substantially to the people's republic of china china has been happily loaning billion per day to keep america floating about three months ago they said it is time to diversify their foreign holdings in other words the party is over and as if we needed more the current retirement commitments of the us government exceed the present value of all private assets in the united states in other words under this administration they have not only mortgaged the entire nation but extra there is a nice set of papers by gokhale on intergenerational obligations and then you have simple panic stock prices are cauchy distributed to put that in ordinary terms stock prices swing far wider than a normal distribution ever would and we experience a normal world when it stops behaving normally we either get excited in an asset bubble or panicked as in a crash people are afraid and there is a lot of money to be made in fear stocks are gyrating in weird ways weird stocks make huge gains and weird stocks crash stocks that should not move together are now moving together and stocks that should move together have stopped doing so and these are just observations not reasons there are no reasons it just is we live in a global society now if you think as an american you are missing the point borders mean far less than they ever did among the developed nations a crisis anywhere is a crisis here oh yes and i left out risks to the energy supply and iraq iran and of course our beloved leader w and these are just the issues going on on the surface how many people out there are cashing in money to have money for health care but we cannot see them doing it it is easy to attribute stock movements to big macro events but the real answer is that millions of small transactions are occurring simultaneously and the stock market is the residual of left over money not put in the bank and not eaten driven slept under slept on or slept with Mergers and acquisitions
