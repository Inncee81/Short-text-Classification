do i need a stock broker to invest in shares or can i do it my self any suggestions you can pick the stocks to purchase yourself without the advice of a stock broker but in general you will need an account with a stock brokerage firm to conveniently pruchase shares of common stock or mutual funds some companies offer direct share purchase programs but this limits your choices also if you use an online brokerage firm you get the benefits of their analysis and charts but don't have to deal with pushy brokers trying to sell you their hot picks sometimes motivated by commissions they receive for selling i would recommend an online broker like scottrade etrade or tdwaterhouse fidelity has higher minums and fees i use scottrade only flat fee per transaction buy or sell no inactivity fees no minimum account balance and great website with all the tools charts and info for any level trader good luck investing remeber money at work is better than man or woman at work Mutual fund Stock broker Insurance Short selling Mergers and acquisitions Stock Day trading Citigroup Investment bank Hedge fund Eliot Spitzer Financial services Stock market ETrading Warren Buffett Bank Finance Annuity Foreign exchange market Internet fraud Corporate governance Social Security debate (United States) Real estate broker Tesco Enron Corporation Corporate finance Financial analyst Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Life insurance Institutional fund management Free trade Exchange-traded fund Stock exchange Security (finance) Venture capital Corporation Investment advisor MMORPG Variable universal life insurance Mutual-fund scandal (2003) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act PE ratio Monetary policy Economics Gold as an investment Gross domestic product Capitalism Wal-Mart Price discrimination American International Group 401(k) Auction New Deal Temasek Holdings Trade Option Morgan Stanley Technical analysis Neopets Margin (finance) Mortgage Bond Ethical consumerism Economy of Russia Privatization Equity investment Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Capital accumulation Primerica Financial Services Supply and demand Advance fee fraud Deflation (economics) Bank fraud American Express Financial markets Insider trading Ameritrade Tax Great Depression Harken Energy Scandal Cable television Lehman Brothers Electronic commerce Password Derivative (finance) Islamic banking Wall Street Crash of 1929 Mad Money
