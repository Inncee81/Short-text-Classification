how do people drowned in the ocean i have always swam in fresh water never salt but i when i went to hawii i went snorkling off a boat we were given oval floaties to hang onto in the water to float on when i finally got the courage to let go and try to swim i couldn't i couldnt go under the water i tried driving under but the water kept me afloat as if i had a life jacket on or something then i tried will all my strength to go as far under the water as i could but my ears hurt then the second i stopped tring to go under i floated back up with out doing anything i tried over over to swim down as far as i could but the same problem so how do people actually drowned in the ocean were you wearing anything that would keep you afloat people will usually drown if they've been drinking and decide to swim in the ocean or if they're in the ocean sober and there's a rough current causing the water to be very edgy and full of mini waves and when they get caught in the current and tired of keeping themself afloat their body's just get exhausted and sometimes all of your muscles can just lock up and you go under and once you're under most people tend to panic and they start losing control and start swallowing water and breathign in the water filling their lungs and so they drown usually it's when people panic and don't know what to do when they're pulled under the water because once you panic and start moving around in the water your intake of oxygen in your lungs releases a lot faster than if you were to calmly swim up and relax once your oxygen is running out you have less oxygen and time to actually get to the surface when you've been sinking that's why it's best to not panic and try to stay in contol to maintain those last bits of oxygen left in your lungs i'm not too sure why you couldn't swim under the water it's very easy to do and get pulled under the water unless you were holding onto something someone was holding onto you or you were wearing some sort of contraption that helps keep you afloat also if you had lots of air in your lungs that also helps you keep afloat divers usually intake breaths very deep before they dive and once they dive they slowly let it out so they can sink to the bottom even if you let all of your air out you'll still have air left in your lungs but you won't be able to be as afloat as when you had all of their air filling your lungs take care xx Swimming Diving Scuba set Lung Snorkel Diver rescue Breathing gas Waterworld Carburetor Swimming pool Suicide methods Shaggy dog story Diving suit Backstroke Breaststroke Water (molecule) Submarine Bong Equine conformation Sailing Sea-Monkey Personal flotation device Seine (fishing) Underwater First Battle of the Atlantic Cetacea Hiccup Diving cylinder RMS Titanic Buoyancy compensator Fishing Water Scuba diving Front crawl Butterfly stroke Motorcycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Carbon dioxide Diving regulator Siphon Cave diving Pneumonia Naval mine First aid Blood (computer game) Fire fighting Thermohaline circulation Asthma Sea ice Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) USS Thresher (SS-200) Lifeguard Tide Free-diving Coconut crab Sperm Whale Circulatory system Ocean thermal energy conversion Gas bladder Albatross Shock Sport rowing Jet engine Aerial (dance move) Barotrauma Tetrapod Moon USS Tunny (SS-282) Diver training Out-of-body experience Traumatic brain injury Canal lock USS Yorktown (CV-5) Professional wrestling holds Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma USS Tang (SS-306) Water polo Apnea Breastfeeding Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Cruising (maritime) Aircraft carrier Energy development
