any skydivers out there i have a question i went skydiving last weekend and loved it i could see myself taking the classes and doing it by myself my only concern is having the upper body strength when the instructor and i were comming down he asked me to help him pull the cords down to my waist i know that this is to slow us down i had a really hard time and couldn't do it it is really hard i honestly gave it my all but couldn't quite get there of course he did the rest i saw several girls do it by themselves and wondered how they could do it they weren't any bigger than me i guess it just takes a lot of practice i just didn't want to pay for something and not be able to physically do it any thoughts the tandem instructor was trying to teach you how to flair slow down and level out your parachute for landing he didn't necessarily ask for your help because it was too hard for him to do alone but in order to teach you in case you might later choose to do this yourself i am a pound woman with normal upper body strength i don't workout and have been skydiving for over years i have never had a problem flairing or controlling my parachute due to any strength problems go for it it is fun and doesn t require exceptional strength as much as exceptional mental awareness like any high speed sport Parachuting Parachute Paragliding Weight training Piccolo Junior Saga Equine conformation Fast bowling Martial art Aerial (dance move) B-47 Stratojet Urinary incontinence BASE jumping Joke Education in the United States Volleyball Drag racing Tai Chi Chuan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Ashlee Simpson Show Blood on the Tracks Gliding Pilotwings Paratrooper Taekwondo FOXHOUND Theory of conduct Social rule The Apprentice 2 Drill instructor Scientology beliefs and practices W.
