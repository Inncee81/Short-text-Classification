scuba diving allergy to compressed air i've been scuba diving for years now since i was i love diving and i've always been safe decompression stops never below feet etc etc however for some reason i always get ill after or during a dive i do get sea sick easily but i always take medicine for it and i often feel nauseated even during shore dives motion sickness aside what else could be causing this is it possible to have an allergy or adverse reaction to compressed air can picking up the sport at a young age increase your chances of developing a medical condition such as an a g e you won't be having an alergic reaction to the air in the tank unless you have a problem with air in general if anything when filled at a proper air station it's even cleaner it may be the medication you're taking or it may be nerves the only other thing i can think of is a possible alergen to silicone or latex some people have issues with skin contact with both your reg's mouthpiece is made of silicone if it's an off the shelf one and if your suit is a semi dry or a dry then it may have latex seals i haven't heard of any divers having issues in this regard but i guess anything is possible Scuba set Diving suit Breathing gas Scuba diving Diver rescue Rebreather Diving equipment Diving regulator Timeline of underwater technology Diving cylinder Cave diving Allergy Diver training Drowning Decompression stop Frogman First aid Barotrauma Dive computer Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Technical diving Eczema Enriched Air Nitrox Menstrual cup Urinary incontinence Recreational diving SS Andrea Doria Asthma Nitrogen narcosis Spina bifida Energy development Swimming Condom Air embolism Snorkel Sperm Whale Medicine Traumatic brain injury Mattress Buoy Food allergy Full face diving mask Anti-frogman techniques Equine conformation Multiple chemical sensitivity Buoyancy compensator Tattoo USS Tunny (SS-282) Hearing impairment Hay fever Liquid breathing USS Yorktown (CV-5) Charles Momsen Common cold Diving locations Charles Darwin's illness Professional Association of Diving Instructors Hard disk Latex allergy Strap-on dildo Kitesurfing Vomiting Circuit breaker Antihistamine Health insurance Pebble bed reactor Decompression illness Aspartame Diving bell Psychosis Mouthpiece Michael L.
