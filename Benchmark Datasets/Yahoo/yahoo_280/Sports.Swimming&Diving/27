survival swimming hello i am in the red cross water safety instructor class and as one of my assignments i am to teach survival swimming i don't even know how to do it the book devotes very little space to it and explains very poorly i was wondering if anyone could describe it or even think of a lesson plan i'm a swimmer so i can catch on how to do it quickly by the way it is not elementary backstroke sidestroke etc it is actually called survival swimming hi in my country they introduce water safety skill survival to be blend in with the normal swimming lessons to kids here is what i am required to teach water threading minutes dead man's float making float with pyjamas i will explain each point water threading the participants are required to thread water for minutes in their pyjamas clothes i think this is to simulate an environment where they happened to be accidentally in the water since you are a swimmer i think you should know theres different water threading kicks just teach them the easier one or both this is very simple just explain to them that this position is required if you dont have any floating device and you are waiting to be rescued you need to ask them to hold their breath and head down completely relax in the water pretend dead if done correctly you will find that your leg will sink but the rest of the body will be floating i think this is to conserve energy to survive while waiting for help we are required to teach the participants to make a float with their trousers pyjamas step remove trousers inside the water pool step tied a knot at each side of the leg's opening a trousers will have openings one left leg one right leg and one on the waist so need to seal both the legs opening step blow through the pyjamas waist opening if done correctly the two tied knots will be sealed leaving the waist opening for you to blow air inside this will be come a float step once inflating the pyjames hold tight to the waist opening so that the air wont go out if done correctly you will see a v shape float step you have a float now i think it is quite hard to explain in words but i hope this helps cheers Swimming Diving Butterfly stroke Aerial (dance move) Front crawl Breaststroke Swimming pool Undergarment Lifeguard Glossary of American football History of swimming Personal flotation device Volleyball Strap-on dildo Frogman Glossary of climbing terms Suplex Water polo Tag Textile manufacturing Fast bowling Medley swimming Professional wrestling holds Scuba set Triathlon Trousers Swingout Aikido Skateboarding trick Billiards Diving suit Kitesurfing Avalanche Equine conformation CPU design Japanese tea ceremony Boxing Mercury 4 Menstrual cup Bong Lathe Mattress Suicide methods Bladderwort Naruto jutsu Screw Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Glossary of partner dance terms Fire fighting Rebreather Marching band Professional wrestling slang Fishing Sailing Sauna Diving cylinder Thread (computer science) Professional wrestling throws Fencing Swimsuit Piccolo Junior Saga Naval mine Poker jargon Russian submarine Kursk explosion Boy Scouts of America Lightning Suit (clothes) Martial art Taekwondo Timeline of underwater technology Wing Chun Shirt Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Figure skating Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Carburetor Escape from New York Electrophysiology Mouse (computing) Spanking Mach kernel Trumpet Mixed martial arts Diver rescue RuneScape quests Jon Secada Futurama (TV series - season 5)
