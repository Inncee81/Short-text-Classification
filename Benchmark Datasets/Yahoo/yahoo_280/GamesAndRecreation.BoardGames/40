hi i was just wondering if anyone knew where i could buy question refills for trivial pursit the board game also if anyone knows whether there is a trivial pursuit game for harry potter or something similar that would be great first i know it sounds crazy but check your local thrift stores for triava pursuit refils many people ditch the games when they clean out the closet you can pick them up for a buck or two ditch the board and any unnecessary pieces and have fun also about the harry potter game our family loves the harry potter scene it game i think they just came out with a newer addition of the game check it out it has movie clips and questions one downside though there is a category about the actors names and crazy film info so if your not into this stuff and you draw that category you may have to make a house rule that you can skip it d Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Trivial Pursuit Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Game show Whose Line Is It Anyway?
