i want to bring my budgie parakeet out of it's cage to exercise but she is avoiding my hand ok so i've had this parakeet since fathers day the day after we got her we brought her in my bathroom to fly it was so hard to get her out and she nearly killed herself when she was out so we haven't taken her out since no way now today i try to take her out with the windows and mirrors covered and she won't come out she flies away from my hand and clings to the side of her cage i even left the door opened and she just stares i feel so bad for her because she just sits there all day and all we can do is talk to her and sing and read she also doesn't play with her toys we have a swing with a bell on it and a ladder w a mirror she doesn't even know how to sit on my finger because everytime i put my hand in the cage like i said she clings to the side until my hand is out of there my poor bird what can i do i feel so bad patience is the key most parakeets are shy when it comes to coming out or sitting on someone's hand most of our budgies don't come out of the cage although some do it is a matter of choice for them we started with one that we took in because he had a birth defect with the way one of his wings grew no one wanted him so we gave him a home we had a similar concern for him so we decided the best thing to do was to get him a friend that helped tremendously and they both started playing and enjoying life over time we have taken in more unwanted budgies and we now have of them in two large cages most play some enjoy sitting and talking and some will actually come out and visit the cockatiels at times so my suggestion is to do one of two things you could get her a friend which might help her like it did with ours if you don't want to do that just take time each day and sit and talk with her after a few days start putting you hand in the cage and talking to her don't try to get her just hold your hand in the cage little by little try to move a little closer when she seems to accept it being there this could take days or months but just work with her every day around the same time for around minutes each time once you are able to get near her she may eventually sit on your hand leave it in the cage for a while and slowly build up to removing her from the cage always use calm slow tones when you talk to her it will take time most likely but if you are patient she will eventually come around good luck Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Social rule John Cage Hamster Aerial (dance move) Blonde on Blonde Salad Fingers Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Budgerigar Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
