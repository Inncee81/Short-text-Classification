are albino animals generally as healthy as regular animals i got an albino bird yesterday just curious it's just a parakeet i have noticed that birds with white feathers are more susceptible to external parasite damage such as lice because there is a lack of melanin pigments that would normally reinforce the feather structure also their eyes have no pigment so they have more trouble seeing especially in bright sun becuase it penetrates deeper with no pigment to reflect off of however if it is a parakeet in a cage inside i dont think you have much to worry about Albinism Eye color Pigment Melanin Human skin color Conure Color Chicken Budgerigar Ultraviolet Heterochromia Dog Cat coat genetics Thermoregulation Monk Parakeet Red-masked Parakeet Egg (food) Egg (biology) Carnivorous plant Sun tanning Hair color Hamster Cheetah Peafowl Dinosaur Color vision Cuttlefish Retina Animal testing Carolina Parakeet Chlorophyta Sunscreen Fancy rat Black supremacy Animal Chameleon Sun Dobermann Nuclear explosion Leaf White Tooth Crocodilia Reptile Hair Sunlight Feather Alexandrine Parakeet White tiger Ostrich Domesticated turkey Plum-headed Parakeet Hair coloring Eye Sperm Whale Parrot Penguin Bird strike Nuwaubianism Guinea pig White buffalo Staining (biology) Bird Acanthocephala Sleep Tooth enamel Black Myxobolus cerebralis The Time Machine Lapis lazuli Macular degeneration Mealy Parrot Chromium Black panther Blood Rose-ringed Parakeet Yami to B__shi to Hon no Tabibito Primary color Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Motorcycle helmet Horse Human Pneumonia Camp Lazlo Uncanny Valley Tuatara Blue Jay Radiation therapy Melasma Pet Skin Piccolo Junior Saga Xenomorph Hyacinth Macaw Discus (fish) Race House Mouse Fish farming Paint
