what is the best place to keep a parrot's cage i have a parrot and i have a problem with him he remains quiet in my room but when i bring its cage outside he starts to be more active and makes different sounds my cage also has shade so where should i keep it my parrots also love to be outside but i do not keep them in a cage their wings are clipped so they can be on my shoulder or on a t stand if i have them on a stand they have some shade and some sunlight so if can move around if they get too hot since being outside is natural to them it doe make them have a change in behavior because they are enjoying the fresh air and sunlight now when you do have them outside just be careful about wild bird droppings since domesticated can catch wild bird's illness'es don't keep your bird in direct sunlight half shade and sun will give the bird the choice to where it wants to sit and not get over heated parrots are social animals and they like to be where they can see family members they also love to have their cage in front of a window so they can see what is going on outside the benefits of being in front of a window is to also be able to get some sunlight which is import to their overall health a bird that sits in a dark room or poorly lit room will develop feathers problems and have a higher chance of becoming depressed sapphyre certified avian specialist http www borrowed rainbow com http groups yahoo com group borrowedrainbowaviary Mealy Parrot Bird Chicken Solar power Hamster Guinea pig Fancy rat H5N1 Equine conformation John Cage Thermoregulation Ferret Lighting Aerial (dance move) Kakapo Fan (implement) Chinchilla Rainbow Horse Canary Professional wrestling throws Renewable energy Dinosaur Sun Domestic rabbit Sento Clinical depression Upholstery Trapping Parrot RuneScape quests Light Pok__mon Abilities Jon Secada The Time Machine Pysanka Scarlet Macaw Falconry Sleep Daylight saving time Extinction Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Psittaciformes Feral cat Professional wrestling holds Reptile Sauna Joy Division (band) Solar variation Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Suplex Japanese tea ceremony Chocolate Autonomous building Swimming Health insurance Weather lore Delta Goodrem Lung Exotic pet Fire fighting RuneScape Random Events Shade Mercury Atlas 6 Animal Divorce Simone Weil HVAC Dead Parrot Heat index Kea The Dalek Invasion of Earth Domesticated turkey Psychiatry Behavioral ecology Light-emitting diode Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine Euphemism Energy development African Grey Parrot Shaggy dog story Roxette The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Comet Tetrapod Internal ballistics Green tea Conure Aladdin (1992 film) Comparative psychology Vitamin D Animal cognition Wind power Traumatic brain injury
