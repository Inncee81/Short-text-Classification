help meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ok so i got parakeets on the same day on january and they really love each other but then the male flew out of the window on june so i got another male parakeet that week after and so the new male and the female that i had before like each other so my question is since i got them on diffrent months i dont know when theyre going to breed or if theyre going to breed first of all when you get a new bird you should quarantine if you haven't done this then there is a chance that your female could get any diseases that the new male may have if you haven't taken him to the vet to see how his health is as for breeding they should be at least a year old for them to breed no sooner than that by a year they will be full mature and ready to to have clutches eggs you should do some research on what to epect as a breeder and how to maintain the heatlth of your budgies and their offspring Pet skunk Budgerigar Mallard Capercaillie Kakapo Bird Dog Condor Platypus Parrot House Mouse Sexual reproduction Seabird Canary Emu Ferret Monk Parakeet Ostrich Mountain Gorilla Dobermann Non-human animal sexuality Guinea pig Chicken Species Leatherback Sea Turtle Spider Liger Mixed-breed dog Menstrual cycle H5N1 Clownfish Hamster Falconry Dog show Albatross Tarantula Koala Dog breeding Progress of the SARS outbreak Breastfeeding Kakariki Bird migration Hybrid Quarantine Bagworm moth Twin Sea Otter Mosquito Selective breeding Lion Red-winged Blackbird Musk Duck Queen bee Plum-headed Parakeet Domestic rabbit Manx (cat) Brolga Mule Red Phalarope Estrus cycle Kea Polychrotidae Peafowl Drosophila melanogaster Honeybee Schistosomiasis Reproduction Osprey Conure Discus (fish) Plant breeding Docking Baboon Bobwhite Quail Fancy rat Honeymoon Cattle Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Extinction Prairie Falcon Rhea (bird) Great Bustard Life in the Freezer Chocobo American Robin Spanish flu Rabies Red Squirrel Kitten Inception of Darwin's theory Golden Retriever Abortion debate Agriculture Dunnock Domestication Rose-ringed Parakeet Anopheles Auk
