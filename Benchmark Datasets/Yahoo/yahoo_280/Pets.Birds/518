cockateil problem hi there can anyone tell me how long it takes feathers to grow i rescued my cockateil months ago from a bad enviroment within the first few months her feathers were growing back lovely but now they seem to have stopped and look terrible again i dont think she is pulling them out herself as i havnt seen her doing it but she is looking dreadfull i have tried tonics etc in her water is this normal and how long does it normally take for them to recover or will they ever thanks there could be many problems causing this i would suggest you first take the bird to the vet to determine if there is anything physically wrong with it mites or vitamin deficiency are possible causes that the vet should be able to identify if there are no physical causes then it may be stress rescue birds can take a long time to fully recover from their bad experiences they need extra time and patience spend lots of time with your bird give it good healthy treats praise it and tell it what a good bird it is in time it will come to trust you and the stress should lessen good luck Guinea pig Folic acid Tocopherol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Diseases of the honeybee RuneScape quests Vitamin C Color Chronic fatigue syndrome Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Coeliac disease 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dinosaur Anorexia nervosa Piccolo Junior Saga Garfield Domestic rabbit Controversies in autism Multiple sclerosis Cancer Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Seabird Stomach cancer Psoriasis Dog Anemia Equine conformation The Contender (television series) Thermoregulation Carpal tunnel syndrome Scientology beliefs and practices Post-traumatic stress disorder Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Bipolar disorder Fancy rat Dissociative identity disorder Alcoholics Anonymous Chicken Pitaten Church of Christ, Scientist Randomness Growth hormone treatment Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Clinical depression Menstrual cycle Animal rights Vitamin D Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Final Fantasy magic Nutrition Non-native pronunciations of English Mattress Utilitarianism Albatross Characters in the Smurfs Marathon (sport) Unemployment Theory of conduct Haibane Renmei National Kidney Foundation Singapore Jet engine Ferret Vitamin Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fitz Hugh Ludlow Insulin Mental illness Rastafari movement Human adaptation to space Alzheimer's disease Species Growth hormone deficiency John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Paget's disease of bone Chlorpromazine Swimming Osteoporosis Traumatic incident reduction Atherosclerosis Meat Loaf Speed of light Inflation Current teachings of Prem Rawat EastEnders Diabetes mellitus Pneumonia Oh My Goddess!
