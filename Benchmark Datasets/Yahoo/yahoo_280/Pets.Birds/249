is there any hope i have a month old congo african grey and he is a peach to my husband and i but no so much to the kids he will let them pet him on occasion but he is a brat for the most part is there anything i can do to make him friendlier i tried socializing him but he tries to eat everyone therefore noone will touch him he is not my first bird i have plenty of experience i know how hard it is to raise a grey and i wasnt interested but my husband got him for himself and now here he is he wanst meant to be mine but he is very bonded to me anyway i give him plenty of attention since he is practically attached to my head and i try to get the kids involved but he is not having it is it too late to help him be more social giving him up is not an option since we have grown quite attached to him and his antics but it would be nice if he was friendlier at least to my kids also he has been weaned for about weeks now but he is starting to beg for food again should i let him regress and go back to formula or can i gently deter him from it im an experienced hand feeder oh boy he does step up but i do allow him to come out on his own he eats anything and everything you put in front of him and drinks water i stopped feeding him because he started refusing it we tried everything to get him to take his formula but he wouldnt take it im guessing i shouldnt let him fly to my head huh he tried it on my bald husband with painful results and i do get him off and tell him no but as soon as he sees me he flies to my head greys really are like another child patience patience he is a young bird and therefore will learn very easily the problem is that you have been letting him make the decisions every time you let him get away with these things it reinforces his belief that he is doing the right thing spend less time with him yourself and have the other family members spend more time with him i know that you want to spend time with him but cut back drastically on the time you give him let his companionship come mostly from the others do not give him any treats yourself let him learn that if he wants yummy treats he will have to take them from the children if he refuses these treats have them taken away and do not let the children drop them into his food bowl or into his cage when he sees that he gets treats only by socializing with the children he will eventually open up if he bites or misbehaves make him to or repetitions of step up to show him that you are in charge he will open up to the rest of the family as long as you make it clear to him that he must good luck Breastfeeding Dog training Domestic rabbit Infantilism Guinea pig Social rule Maison Ikkoku Son Goku (Dragon Ball) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Contender (television series) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Stuttering Trapping 2000 Australian Grand Prix Falconry Alcoholics Anonymous Fancy rat Hamster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Aerial (dance move) Microeconomics Chicken Burrhus Frederic Skinner Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dog Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 About a Boy Capercaillie Transactional analysis W.I.T.C.H.
