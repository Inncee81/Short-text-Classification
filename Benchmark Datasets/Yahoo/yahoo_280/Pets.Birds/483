i feed the birds in my backyard and lately a couple of cats have been hanging around i found some feathers on the ground the other day how can i get rid of these cats without bringing them any harm irresponsible animal owners who allow their cats to roam free are a major problem domestic cats are not a part of nature and they are responsible for the killing of countless wild birds if you know who owns the cats talk to them about keeping their cats inside but don't expect a very kind response most people who allow their cats to run free believe that the cat can't be happy indoors and that it has no major impact on wildlife if you are lucky enough to live in a municipality where there is a leash law for cats as well as dogs report the cats to animal control if not you can try to catch them and take them to a shelter or you can try to chase them any time you see them in your yard you can clap your hands and yell or you can use a hose or a super soaker on them but cats being predatory by nature will keep coming back as long as there are birds there to prey upon Cat Ferret Feral cat Dog Hunting Domestic rabbit Phantom cat RuneScape quests Fox hunting Kakapo Tyrannosaurus rex Pet skunk Tick Gray Wolf Bird strike Domestication Trapping Working animal Feral Housebreaking Puma Cheetah Animal rights Spider Bat Tiger Hamster Piccolo Junior Saga H5N1 Manx (cat) Domestic violence Animal communication Obedience training Tag Gerald Durrell Rabbit Lion People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Theory of conduct Garfield Livestock House Pet Skunk Tasmanian Devil Shaggy dog story Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Joker (comics) Fancy rat Dinosaur Caracal Glossary of American football Domesticated turkey Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Felix the Cat Biological pest control Marching band Microchip implant (animal) Rabies The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Shannara creatures Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Introduced species Brown Bear Richard Chase Carnivore American Alligator Canary Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Kevin and Kell Oliver and Company Gun politics Zoo Viva La Bam Sheikh Abdullah Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Volleyball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bird of prey Foie gras Chicken Mutts Orca The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Rocko's Modern Life Holocene extinction event Asiatic Golden Cat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pittsburgh Steelers Hedgehog Redbone Coonhound Albatross Minor Harry Potter Beasts
