parakeet talking i am getting a parakeet tomarrow but it is a baby i want it to talk because i always wanted a talking bird i know that you have to earn it's trust do you have any ideas on what how help them learn example making wood blocks to teach them shapes yay my website www prettiep t com and yes they can talk a young male three four months of age is ideal males are better talkers to teach a bird to talk you will need time dedication and above all patience all the birds i have trained said their first word s at the end of three weeks intensive training the key to teaching a parakeets to talk is to have the parakeet think it's part of the human flock and therefore that it needs to communicate with its human friends if you have a mirror in the cage or other parakeets it will see parakeets around it and want to talk like them i e chirp so step one is to have your young parakeet on its own surrounded by humans that talk to it while male parakeets tend to talk better than female parakeets do both can certainly talk birds learn best in the morning when their mind is fresh and ready for new information if you use a towel or cover over your bird's cage talk to them for hr before you remove it each morning repeat the same phrases loudly slowly and clearly parakeets do best with hard letters like k and t so the traditional hello is actually sort of hard for a parakeet cutie would be much better parakeets tend to mumble and to talk quickly so the more slowly you talk the more normal it will sound when the bird starts to repeat it have patience and eventually hopefully your parakeet will start to answer back to you once they get the hang of it they'll learn more and more quickly as you go it works best if you physically talk to your parakeet and that you do it often parakeets can also learn to mimic other sounds around them parakeets are capable of learning many many words phrases with dedication from the owner Parrot Hearing impairment Conure Dog training B3ta Stuttering Shaggy dog story Music Kender Red-masked Parakeet Avenue Q Social rule Guinea pig Koan Blood on the Tracks Scientology beliefs and practices Japanese tea ceremony God Emperor of Dune Canary Marching band Carolina Parakeet Martial art Philosophy of language Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
