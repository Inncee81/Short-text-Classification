parakeet bites i bought my parakeet about a month ago and always went on my finger now he opens his mouth and tries to jab at my finger as i approach i read some advice about letting them bite your finger yet i am a bit afraid and it always freaks me out how much do parakeet bites hurt is there a better way to tame my parakeet im still trying to bond again with him and work with my parakeet any animal on the planet has a potential to bite and leave a nasty mark and any bite hurts thats why we call it a bite lol it sounds like maybe yes he is hormonal and or you stopped giving him attention with the hand and he has gone wild again which can happen pretty much you have to start all over again once you get him tame again interact with him everyday if he is being that aggressive when you go in the cage then try using a perch to retrieve him out first and be firm with that step up command never grab him with your whole hand and never force him too much to take your finger and never ever use a towel to capture him he may be being territorial too maybe once you get him out to clean his cage rearrange his cage toys etc give him a new cage environment it may help him to stop being territorial take him into a room totaly away from the cage work with him in quiet area if he bites do not make a peep do not scream and do not pull your hand away abruptly rock your hand gently and tell him no show him who is boss you must be flock leader i am hand training my parrotlett and let me tell you that little budgie beak has nothing on my little guys chompers lol be patience be confident with him he will be purring in your hand again soon Ferret Milton H.
