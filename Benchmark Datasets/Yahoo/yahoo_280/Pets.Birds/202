does any one have taming tip for a budgie i have had a bought a budgie a week ago it is about month old does any have tip to get the budgie to trust me and sit on my finger i tamed many budgies in my time sweet things if you want him to sit on your finger you must be very patient first put your hand in the cage with your finger posing as a perch then wait be very still and wait he'll be afraid for the most part but if you do it regularly he'll get curious eventually he will sit on your finger and he'll like it he'll really like it much more comfortable than a hard perch the other thing that works which you can do also is let the bird out of the cage make sure all windows and doors are closed let him fly every time he lands put your finger in front of him he'll keep flying it won't take too long before he's tired he will give up he will get on your finger in fact your finger will rescue him from the floor or wherever he lands in fatigue your finger will be his best friend after that i also taught my birds to talk some of it was just by accident because i kept calling my bird pretty bird after awhile i heard him saying pretty bird p's and b's are easy for them some words they will never be able to say i then went on to teach them to say praise god you have to say it a lot you'll see how the bird listens to you then when they are enjoying the sound they make they will start to repeat what you have taught them hope this helps have fun Dog training Time Out of Mind Hamster Milton H.
