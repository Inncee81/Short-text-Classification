a few budgie parakeet questions i just got these birds yesterday and i am new to birdkeeping mine have tiny black dots near the middle of their feathers are they mites how to get rid they preen themselves and each other and seem to pick out dry skin is this normal sickness they are scared of anyone who opens the cage but i have managed to feed the male food from my hand i don't know how old they are but what is the best way to tame them thank you budgies are friendly fellas and they can be taught to fly around the room sit on your shoulder and take food from your hand the males are very clever at learning to talk but it takes time the tiny black dots sounds odd maybe get a vet to check them out yes the preening is quite normal behaviour as for training it takes patience and persistence frequently talking to your budgie using a soft voice to sooth them each training session should last between minutes slowly put your hand in the cage and keep it in there until the bird has a chance to settle itself down resist the urge to grab or move your hand over to the budgie in the first few sessions give him some time to come used to the presence of your hand when he stops freaking out at the sight of your hand in the cage it is time to slowly push your finger towards his belly like a perch say up when you press your finger against his belly when you return him to his cage or perch say down continue talking to the budgie when he is on your finger when it seems like he is comfortable sitting on your finger you may slowly take him out of the cage on your finger do not be over zealous the first time you take him out of the cage always keep these training sessions short at first eventually the time out of the cage will increase and you will have a trusting budgie friend don't try to handle them in the first few days in their new home give him some time to get used to his new home and environment have the cage in a room where you are alot of the time spend lots of time with him talking to him and putting your hands in the cage only to change their water and give them fresh food make a point to show them that you are merely doing good things for him and not trying to hurt him it may take some time before he will decide to come out to you and you may try to bribe him to come out of his cage by leaving some budgie treats right outside the cage door or even in your hand right inside or outside the cage eventually he will learn to accept you and be your friend enjoy your new birds Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hamster Milton H.
