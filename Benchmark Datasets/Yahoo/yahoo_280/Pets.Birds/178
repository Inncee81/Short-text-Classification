what do you feed a baby woodpecker me and my friend found a baby woodpcker and we dont know what to feed it we tried feeding it worms but it wont eat we got it to drink water and it keeps flapping its wings but cant fly please answer if you know what could help if the baby has most of its feathers it is a fledgling baby birds fledge leave the nest several days before they can fly they need time to hop around on the ground climb low branches and exercise their wings until they have strengthened them enough for flight the parent birds continue to feed and care for the fledglings until they are self sufficient if this is a fledgling put it back where you found it if the parents can hear it they will return to it and continue to care for it if it is not feathered that much and you think it was still a nestling try to place the bird back in the nest do not worry that you have touched it birds do not have an acute sense of smell the parent birds will not detect your scent on the baby and will not reject it wildlife biologists and bird banders handle baby birds all the time with thier bare hands and the parents never reject the babies if you can not find the nest and place the bird back contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator you can find one here http www tc umn edu devo contact htm please under no circumstances attempt to care for the baby bird yourself there is so much more to rehabilitation than keeping the animal alive until you think it is ready to be released you have to know not only what to feed the bird but how please do not attempt to give the bird any liquid by dropper baby birds can aspirate and die how much and how often you also have to know how to assess the birds general health and condition a baby bird kept in captivity must be taught to recognize and find the type of food it will eat in the wild if it is being hand fed it may not associate the bugs and berries and seeds in nature as being food it must also have the opportunity to exercise its wings a lot so it will be able to fly on or shortly after release when i volunteered at the avian rehabilitation center we kept the rehabilitating fledglings in a large walk in cage with lots of shelves and branches leading from one shelf to the other and down to the ground we would place different types of food in the cage for them as they were being weaned from the hand feeding formula we offered seed meal worms and chopped up fruit no fledgling was released until it was eating on its own had sufficient weight gain had all of its flight feathers in good condition had no sign of diarreah or nasal discharge had clear eyes and could fly at least a few feet in a straight line these are the reasons to get the bird to a licensed rehabilitator they have the training and the resources necessary to do all this in addition to having the permits to do it all legally all native migratory birds in the us are protected under the migratory bird treaty act and you must have the proper permits to have them even for a short time even for good reasons like saving them many other countries also have similar laws regarding their native species Breastfeeding Hamster Kakapo Chicken Albatross Bird Seabird Falconry Bird migration Pet skunk Cat Ivory-billed Woodpecker Capercaillie Domestic rabbit Mealy Parrot Condor Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hunting Species Bird ringing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Acorn Terri Schiavo 613 mitzvot Bat Dinosaur RuneScape quests Livestock Bird flight Insulin Mosquito Guinea pig Gliding Tetrapod H5N1 Foie gras Red Squirrel Elephant Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Comanche Fancy rat Extinction Genetically modified food Ant Kashrut Vegetarianism Dog Hemp Archaeopteryx Airport Insect Hedgehog Sewage treatment Gray Wolf Agriculture Trapping Fox hunting American Black Bear Saruman Heinkel He 112 Dodo Ferret Ostrich Pterosaur Vermicompost Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 Animal testing Rock Dove Gas metal arc welding Infantilism Public domain Baptism Mid-levels Insurance Nurse GNU General Public License Weight training Gypsy moth Coconut crab Shrimp farm Domesticated turkey Fish farming Clark's Nutcracker Egg (food) Mountain Gorilla Alcoholic beverage Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Fecal incontinence Scientology beliefs and practices Trademark Salad Fingers
