my lovebird doesn't trust me im getting frustrated i talk to my lovebird mango everyday for mins he'll let me sing him to sleep or whatever but i still cant touch him with my fingers he likes to sit at the top of his cage at night and i always go up to him to say good night and he will let me kiss his stomach only through the cage but when hes outside his cage he bites really hard he bites inside his cage to but thats only when he sees my finger i dont understand if he trusts me or not did you buy your bird handfed or wild if it is comfortable enough to bite you instead of running away i'm going to assume it was handfed but whoever did it did not do it with care is it biting you just because you have your hand inside the cage or because you are trying to grab it by the way lovebirds that bite all the time are more likely to be females than males anyways if you are trying to grab it touch it hold it and it is biting you it is because the bird does not trust you don't keep doing it because if you do the bird will never trust you if it is biting you simply because you have your hand inside the cage than your bird is a territorial female who doesn't like her space being invaded some ways to solve this problem are to buy a bigger cage so she doesn't feel like she has a nest to be protecting and to rearrange all her toys food bowls etc once a week how do you get your bird outside the cage do you take her out forcibly if your bird isn't comfortable coming outside by herself then you shouldn't force it unfortunately most people will tell you that if you buy a lovebird that was not tamed with care as a baby it is very hard to socialize the bird it is possible to try here is what you should do buy a bag of millet from a pet store lovebird's are absolutely addicted to millet leave little snippets of millet in her pet food for a few days so she knows it tastes good after a few days stop giving her millet if you feed her a bird seed mix instead of pellet take all of the sunflower seeds out of her food when you feed her this is so she doesn't have any treats in her regular feed start offering her millet and sunflower seeds through the cage bars if she seems scared don't approach her sit very still and let her come to you this builds trust as she will realize you aren't going to attack her or make any sudden scary movements once she is comfortable being fed through the bars start putting millet and sunflower seeds in the palm of your hand put your hand inside the cage and wait for the bird to come to you again never approach the bird wait for the bird to come to you this can take upwards of minutes but patience is the only way to tame a lovebird that does not trust you after she is comfortable with the above you should start teaching her to step up on your hand only let her have the millet if she is willing to come to you and step onto your hands start using millet to bait her into coming outside her cage your bird needs to know that going outside of her home is her choice not yours hold the millet outside her open cage door and let her come outside herself don't ever get too excited when doing any of the above steps because your excitement will scare the bird more than anything keep this in mind especially when you let the bird outside of its cage birds are usually a little scared outside of their homes and if you start acting too excited and playful she will be scared of you too you need to be calm and let her get familiar with her surroundings those are my tips for training a wild lovebird in the future when you buy a lovebird you need to make sure it is a well tamed pet that was raised by someone that paid attention to the bird lovebirds that are good for the home are ones that are already very friendly in the pet store and look for human attention good luck with this for both yours and the bird's sake if this doesn't work out i would really consider getting your lovebird a friend lovebirds need attention whether it is from humans or other lovebirds cranky lovebirds easily become depressed on their own and will become even crankier as a result Shaggy dog story Dog training RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Salad Fingers Kodocha Domestic rabbit Chicken Fancy rat Guinea pig Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
