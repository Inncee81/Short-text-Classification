i am going to start homeschooling my year old th grade this school year we moved to fl years ago from va schools in va were great schools in fl are a disgrace i have decided no more of this for her i will home school instead i am new at this so even after checking into it i am still not sure about the best methods or best programs i know i do not want a religious or christian based program not because we don't feel those things don't have a place in our lives but i do not want her education to be based on slanted views i want it to be based on historical and scientific facts with openess to variying opinions and theories sorry not trying to offend anyone here we plan to move back to va at some point until then how do i make sure she is getting the education she needs to be able to at least re enter the public school at her correct grade level for when we get back to va my desire and goal for homeschooling is to improve her education not make is suffer any more than what the fl system has already done to her in response to some answers i saw florida at least our school district does not require or provide standardized tests they do not provide me with a curriculum they do not require i submit an educational plan the only thing the county told me is you're on your own we already did the living in virginia with relatives thing for the last school year and she had to come back as that relative was unable to keep her indefinitely and after our house had been on the market for that entire school year and did not sell the market is dead here we are unable to say for sure when we will be able to move to va in response to some answers i saw florida at least our school district does not require or provide standardized tests or any other tests they do not provide me with a curriculum or books or even require any particular books they do not require i submit an educational plan the only thing the county told me is you're on your own we already did the living in virginia with relatives thing for the last school year and she had to come back as that relative was unable to keep her indefinitely and after our house had been on the market for that entire school year and did not sell the market is dead here we are unable to say for sure when we will be able to move to va thank you everyone for your responses you have provided me with many ideas and web resources to check out as for panama i did not ask for your judgement of me and my abilities as you do not know me nor did i ask for insults i just wanted honest guidance without personal attacks i emphathize with where you are at i was there a year ago with my dd i could not fathom homeschooling i thought i was too inadequate and so i sent her back to her school with trepidation it lasted only weeks and then i pulled her out i now found myself homeschooling her and no plan or any idea what to do next i cannot advise what to do in fl as i live in ca the rules in ca may be different i am only offering you what i discovered along the way in ca you do not have have to register with the school district althought the local schools have homeschool and independent study programs and they would like the children enrolled in one so they can receive money for their attendance in the homeschool independent study program there are several charter schools set up in ca that act as schools for the homeschoolers this has advantages and disadvantages advantages you receive money and or books tutoring or programs for the child paid for by the charter school as long as the program or books do not have a religious content most programs books will fly all these schools have an es educational specialist teacher who visits the child and parent to discuss curriculum review work by the child and discuss progress or strategies some charter schools are very hands off as to what you use to teach others have specific texts and curriculum many of these charter schools also give money to the parents to spend for the child's education including enrichment such as music lessons dance lessons art lessons etc all these wonderful things that have disappeared from the ca public schools disadvantage you must follow the rules of the charter school for home schoolers some charters schools have pretty rigid curriculum and there is not much in the way of flexibility all the charter schools require you take the state standardized tests the schools receive money for each student who tests in addition if a certain percentage of students do not take the test then the school may loose funding and its license and credentials to continue that is why there is so much pressure in ca public schools its all tied to money what the powers that be will not tell parents is that you can opt out of the standardized testing it is afterall the usa and we still have rights you simply write a note to the school stating that you do not want your child to be tested i know this for a fact as i opted my son out ot the tests from st grade through th grade in public school as i disagreed with how the school district was using the tests as far as what to teach to keep her up with her grade level you should be able to find state standards for each grade in ca the state standards are king right now and you can find the standards posted on the school district websites you might try the fl and va school district websites for standards by grade by subject if they are not there call the district offices and request as to how to obtain them they should be public information the school district office might mail them to you or direct you to the appropriate website if you strike out there try the state board of education for the states back to the next step after i found myself homeschooling i reached out to everyone i knew who was homeschooling to seek advise on materials i choose to sign with a charter school so i could get funds my particular charter school is very open and flexible its philosophy is that parents should decide what is best for their child it supports every method out there from unschooling to waldorf to montessori to classical to traditional plus several others i cannot remember i would sugget that you reach out to friends and search out other local homeschoolers for help and advise i have found other homeschoolers to be very helpful and supportive look on the web for local homeschool message boards and support groups if you have friends that are teachers seek their advise too figure out your strenghths and figure on teaching those subjects then if you can afford it hire some one to tutor what ever you feel you cannot possible teach in ca we have lots of businesses that teach math and reading which is often cheaper than hiring a private tutor you can also contact the local colleges to find a student to tutor your child but if your child is a very good student you may be able to use the homeschool texts that are available you can buy canned curriculums by grades from several different publishers some with a strong christian basis and some without a religious basis these curriculum package cover all subjects so you do not have to worry what to choose or you can do what i did which was piece stuff together subject materials based on advise from my daughters tutor all of which i threw out cause it was awful and advise from other homeschoolers which was more practical and helpful just know that few homeschoolers have hit on the perfect program for every subject the first time i was surprised and relieved when i realized that it was really ok to experiment to find what works for you and your child i found if i hated the program text then my child hated it too its hard to teach what you do not like and often what works for one kid does not work for anyother look to your instincts when you review materials you know your child so review the materials by asking yourself will she would like the material and its approach does it cover what you want her to know do you think it is straightforward enough to implement easily are you interested in it does it grab you etc do a search on web for curriculum reviews you will find lots of homeschoolers giving reviews of programs or books they have used or read i have found those reviews helpful go to websites that sell to homeschoolers and look at what they offer or suggest one website that i use alot is ww rainbowresources com they sell to homeschoolers and they have tons and tons of books games reference material etc every thing is very nicely reviewed and they often let you take a peak inside the books i have also done searches at amazon for books and reference materials whatever you do decide it will be ok i am sure that your daughter will be fine if she is weak or behind in any areas especially reading or math focus on getting those areas up to grade level if she is doing fine at school and is at grade level then at the minimum read alot write alot do research papers and most importantly keep up with the math everything else will fall into place good luck i hope this helps Tripartite System National Certificate of
