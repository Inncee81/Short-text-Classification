does your child use k products to homeschool your child or does your child attend a school that uses it how are they doing how long have they been involved are you all enjoying the experience how do you feel about the curriculum i know some of you can't stand k why i just posted a long reply to your cost of k question you can get some of my info there we're starting our th year with k as independent homeschoolers not involved with any virtual public school some people assume that's the only way to use k and it's not true you can purchase it just like you would any other curriculum and only do one course or all six first i'll tell you why some hs'er are opposed to k they are opposed to any public school at home program because it's not true and pure homeschooling they don't think you should invite the government into your home i'm not going to start a flame war about it here it's been done too many times the past six years since k started what really gets my goat about it though is the same hs'ers are not anti calvert who also runs virtual public school programs as connections academy i've seen the virtual schools help way way too many people many my friends and it's a wonderful option for many families it's great as a bridge between public schooling and hs'ing it gives parents who are gun shy a chance to try out home education it helps families where both parents are not all the way on board etc my son has done awesome in k he's scored in the th percentile on all standardized tests even when tested a year ahead i love k 's dynamic not static like a printed one from most curricula planning and progress tools i am in awe by the depth and breadth of the curriculum i learn so much that i never had even in college i love the ease of use and the professional online and offline components my son enjoys it immensely not all of the time is on the computer like many think and i can't say enough good about it you can attend an online seminar about the program and gain access to a one week demonstration account to see the online component in detail please note that until the middle school years you as a parent will still need to be involved in teaching it's not a sit your kid at the computer and let it do the teaching program far from it yes there are things they do independently more so as the grades progress but you'll need to guide and lead them k 's science history and art are so good you won't find an equal anywhere language arts is very strong too and has many strands literature phonics spelling composition vocabulary analogies grammar usage mechanics public speaking etc the history from st th is a four year coverage from the stone age to the space age th and th are american history using the history of us books as a spine and middle school repeats world history in more depth art is paralleled with history which is so much fun it not only covers art methods and artists but also architecture clothing furniture etc music trains with the kodaly and solfege methods we did switch out of k math at their pre algebra level th and now use teaching textbooks for algebra the math just wasn't a good fit for him like st th was a great thing about k is how you can have different grade levels for your child and they can progress through each course at differing speeds the spine of the curriculum is based on the core knowledge foundation scope and sequence you can view download copies of the k scope and sequences for each course at their site it will show you a portion of the depth and breadth of each course let me know if you need
