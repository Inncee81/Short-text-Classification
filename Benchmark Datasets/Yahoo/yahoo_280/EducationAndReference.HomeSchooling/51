how do you get organized to homeschool elementary kids i will be homeschooling my first grader next year along with a preschooler and a new baby last year when i did kindergarten we broke up the curriculum and did subjects each day totaling about an hour a day of instruction time but this year he definitely needs more instruction time maybe hours and my preschooler needs about an hour of my time just with her too so how do you schedule it all i'm planning on doing art music and science social studies with them together but reading and math really needs to be separate the way i've been planning my days i feel like there will be no time for outings errands and social interactions how do you do it are homeschooling moms mostly staying home all day if not please tell me your secret i never did get organized i provide lots of reading material and i make sure it is available at all times i enforce a bit of writing and math occasionally but i don't get into a strict schedule until between the ages and i'm always amazed at what can be accomplished when one just lets it happen we stay home in the mornings and are usually out of the house by pm so that's how i schedule it all i don't but i know that's not for everyone that being said for a first grader i would say hours of actual school time is plenty i like the idea of focusing on one or two subjects a day rather than jumping from subject to subject for a pre schooler one hour i think is more than enough play it by ear and see what works for each child try not to over schedule things rather leave time in a day week for you to just be with your kids enjoying their company doing chores gardening going on social outings or just being still and quiet for me that has always been the joy of homeschooling dropping that frenzied schedule that so many people are on and just enjoying life at a slower pace with my kids good luck Homeschooling Education in the United States Kindergarten Waldorf Education Education in Taiwan Social rule Education in Romania GED Education in Japan Mathematics Montessori method The Adventures of Pete & Pete Doug Music Hopkins School High school Baseball CPU design Murdock-Portal Elementary School The Fairly OddParents Education in Germany Graduate school EastEnders Avenue Q JumpStart International League Recurring South Park characters CPU cache Scientology beliefs and practices Harrow School 1957 World Series Jon Secada Theory of conduct Recess (TV series) Daylight saving time Swingout Education A Course In Miracles Education in France The Amazing Race SAT Master's degree Education in Hong Kong Education in Albania Glen Ridge, New Jersey Hikikomori Secondary education in Japan Rudolf Steiner Bah__'__ Faith and Education Hogwarts subjects Primary education No Child Left Behind Act Baby Blues Professor X NUS High School of Mathematics and Science Science Bowl Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Love and Theft Compiler optimization Early childhood education Fairfax County Public Schools Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Pitaten Bart chalkboard gags Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Family from One End Street About a Boy Junior Certificate W.
