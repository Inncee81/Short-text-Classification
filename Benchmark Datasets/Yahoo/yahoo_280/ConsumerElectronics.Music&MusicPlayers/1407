buying an ipod so i have a job and have i want an ipod i was thinking of a ipod mini the color ones where should i buy it at the stores i can go to are target then the mall or circuit city i would suggust you buy it at walmart they offer a proctecion plan for just a few dollars more or buy it online they sell them a lil cheaper online at apple com i was skeptical of buying an ipod but i needed to mp player when my stereo went out in my car i went to walmart and priced the ipods as well as the other mp players i went back and forth for about an hour and settled on the ipod nano gb i am glad i picked this one it holds about songs and is so easy to use i have seen other mp players and this one by far is the easier to use and navigate through when you go looking for an mp you want to by something that has definite gb and just doesnt say it can hold so many songs also only buy what you need i had just over songs in my computer that i wanted to take with me so that is why i got the gb if i only had about then i would have chose a smaller gb one they are more expensive but worth it by far IPod Apple Computer ITunes Music Store IPod nano IPod shuffle ITunes Apple Macintosh IPod mini IPod photo Digital audio player Online music store Walkman FairPlay Creative Zen MP3 Gramophone record Steve Jobs USB flash drive IMac IBM PC compatible Apple typography Podcasting Napster (pay service) Compact audio cassette Apple Newton Digital rights management FireWire Arbitrage DVD High fidelity Digital photography Laserdisc Mac mini Best Buy RealNetworks Headphones Commodore 64 Monopoly (game) Rhapsody (online music service) Microeconomics Sears Holdings Corporation Loss leader Advanced Audio Coding PLATO Disc jockey Hard disk Atari 8-bit family Donald Trump Nintendo DS $ale of the Century Supply and demand Mac OS X v10.4 Atari ST Online shop Neopets H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Game Boy Advance U2 (band) Marshall Field's Acorn Computers MMORPG High-definition television Floppy disk Wheel of Fortune Internet fraud Nintendo Filling station Computer CPU design EMusic Karaoke Electronic Arts Mutual fund RISC MiniDisc Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks History of computing hardware (1960s-present) NeXT System/36 PowerBook Digital circuit Doom Jonathan Ive Personal rapid transit Amiga Day trading RuneScape skills ASDA Creative Technology Bulk vending Grand Theft Auto III Apple II family UK Singles Chart Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Logo Cork
