why cant i get past my restore on my ipod i have a video ipod but something happened to it and i had to restore it it turns on fine and everything but whenever i try to update it it say i have to restore it so i do it and i keep getting the restore error whats the matter with my ipod do you think apple will give me a new one p s the screen also doesn't light up if i got a new screen would it fix that i don't think apple will give you a new one just because you need to restore however i think it may be something more than just your ipod needing to be restored first i would try reinstalling itunes since there may be a problem with the software keep in mind you'll most likely have to re add and reorganize your music playlists if you do this also try plugging the ipod into a different port on your computer it's possible that there may be a short in the port that's preventing it from restoring properly or possibly the cable if you have access to another ipod cable try that as well if after doing this and restoring again it still doesn't work and it still doesn't light up i'd say there's most likely a problem with the hardware i'd take it to the apple store if you have one near you they may be able to take care of it right there otherwise you'll need to go through apple's website http depot info apple com ipod IPod ITunes ITunes Music Store Apple Computer FairPlay IMac IPod nano Apple Macintosh Digital rights management Podcasting IPod shuffle Apple Newton ILife IPod photo Disc jockey Online music store QuickTime Walkman Atari 8-bit family Advanced Audio Coding IPod mini Digital audio player AmigaOS Floppy disk Microsoft Universal Serial Bus Apple IIGS Apple typography Commodore 64 X Window System Embedded system USB flash drive Creative Zen Windows XP Mac OS X v10.4 Xbox 360 Computer virus WebObjects Mouse (computing) Personal computer NeXT MP3 Amiga Modem PlayStation Portable Game Boy Micro Spyware Screenshot Mac mini Nintendo Entertainment System Virtual memory IBM PC compatible Year 2000 problem Linux kernel Mac OS X PowerBook Ethernet Windows Vista H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Phishing Mach kernel TRS-80 RealNetworks Motorola 68000 Desktop computer Redundant array of independent disks History of Microsoft Windows Blue screen of death Copy protection DragonFly BSD Apple Store Rhapsody (online music service) Computer hardware Common Unix Printing System AOL Instant Messenger Game programmer Jon Lech Johansen Nintendo GameCube IBM PC System 7 (Macintosh) Hard disk Musical Instrument Digital Interface Napster (pay service) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Pretty Good Privacy Computer bus Oscilloscope Password Color Microsoft Windows Wi-Fi
