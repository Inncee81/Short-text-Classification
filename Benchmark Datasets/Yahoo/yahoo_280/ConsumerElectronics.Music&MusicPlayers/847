why doesn't the reverb on my roland jc amp work i just bought this amp new from kennelly keys music store but i noticed that the reverb on it doesn't work i've even tried turning it on by using a foot switch but it still doesn't work what could be causing this do i have to take it to the repair shop i'm so pissed because i can't return it or exchange it becasue of the stupid store policy and because this store isn't a real roland dealer i can't even use the warranty this sucks i have several jc 's and i've never had a single one break during use though i have heard of them being defective from the factory or at least on delivery since you can't use the warranty you might as well open it up yourself and see if there's anything obviously wrong make sure the warranty is useless before you do this if you are handy and you know what things are supposed to look like you can take apart the reverb unit and inspect it to see what is wrong the reverb in the jc is a spring reverb type sometimes when amps with spring reverb are dropped hard i e during roughly handled shipping the spring breaks loose my best advice would be to take it to a repair shop and ask them for an estimate if the repair cost is too high and the amp works fine aside from the reverb you might just consider getting a good reverb fx pedal if you go this route you should get a good quality fx pedal with low noise the jc is one of the cleanest amps out there and will easily reveal noise that other amps don't it's a shame you are having this problem because the reverb on the jc is rich and beautiful hopefully you'll get things sorted out and be able to enjoy it soon good luck Warranty Loss leader Poker jargon Harp Instrument amplifier USS Vestal (AR-4) Gross domestic product Extreme Programming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Gramophone record High fidelity Bulk vending Carburetor Musical Instrument Digital Interface Sears Holdings Corporation Electronic amplifier IPod Avenue Q Shit Equine conformation Hearing impairment Procrastination Bicycle lighting Surveillance Effects unit E85 USS Tunny (SS-282) Digital photography Piano Thermal power station Little Britain Piccolo Junior Saga XML Electronic organ Floppy disk Great Teacher Onizuka Cellular network Lac operon The Death Gate Cycle Sampling (music) Laserdisc De Lorean DMC-12 Timpani Mercury Atlas 6 Theory of conduct Pebble bed reactor Helicopter 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Bass guitar Reverberation Best Buy Shaggy dog story Mutual fund Password Pitaten Badly Drawn Kitties Electrophysiology Law of value Microeconomics Social rule USS Thresher (SS-200) Craps Oscilloscope Assignment (law) Time Out of Mind Toyota Prius GunZ The Duel Cruising (maritime) Galactic Civilizations Effects pedal Sin City Mountain bike Resonance Tesco Buddy Guy Digital circuit FoxTrot Synthesizer Insurance Trademark Upholstery BS 1363 Non-native pronunciations of English The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Friends Ethical consumerism Colony in Space CPU cache Quicksort Mike Watt Spirit of Ontario I RuneScape locations Rail tracks My Parents are Aliens Recumbent bicycle
