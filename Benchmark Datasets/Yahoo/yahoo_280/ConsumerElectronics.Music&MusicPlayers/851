lost ipod so i've seen a bunch of questions here about people wanting to know if they can recover their lost or stolen ipods well i was just watching dateline and they proved that apple doesn't help but you could go to a website called unloseit com and insert your serial number and your info and they will help you find it here is the link http www unlose it good luck all thought it will be helpful never been there never heard it how many users out there know about that website what are the chances that the person who found the ipod know about it in todays society would it be more likely for people to keep it for their own use how many people remember their serial number i don't know whether to trust it or what to be honest i'm not really sure what it does there's a very slim to none chances it'll actually work apple does not cover lost items which means it'll be lost just wait for your ipod to come back to you one day x like that's even going to happen but there's nothing else you can do but report it to a lost and found near the missing location of the ipod or go on a big ipod search party with your friends IPod nano ITunes Apple Computer IPod Digital rights management Redundant array of independent disks IPod photo Domain Name System Apple Newton Social rule World Wide Web Podcasting Phishing Uniform Resource Locator Online music store Luck ITunes Music Store USB flash drive Digital audio player Poker jargon Walkman Theory of conduct IPod shuffle Cross site scripting Ocean's Twelve FireWire RuneScape quests IMac The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Inside The End of the World (Doctor Who) Nico Robin Steve Jobs Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Apple typography Google bomb Bluetooth Shaggy dog story American Pie (song) Freenet Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Mac OS X v10.4 Apple Macintosh Current teachings of Prem Rawat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fahrenheit 451 Time Out of Mind The Daleks' Master Plan Aliens of London RuneScape cheats Internet fraud Piccolo Junior Saga Gramophone record Serialism The Ashlee Simpson Show John F.
