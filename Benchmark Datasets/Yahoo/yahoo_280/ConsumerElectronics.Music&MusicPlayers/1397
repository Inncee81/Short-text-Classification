what s wrong about wiping a cd in a circular pattern everybody tells me not to do so but i ve already carefully tried this and noted no damage no scratch at all so what s wrong about it could it damage the information on cd anyway because of the way that the data on the cd is arranged the laser reads it like a record player reads a vinyl record as the cd spins it reads around the cd moving in or out after it goes all the way around so if you wipe in a circular pattern and if tiny dirt particles scratch the cd or even if the material that you're wiping with isn't soft enough it's going to make a whole bunch of data in a row unreadable if you wipe from inside to outside and scratch the cd then the laser will only encounter the unreadable data once each time the cd goes around if your cd player gets a little but of data that it can't read it takes the last readable bit and the next bit that it can read passing up the unreadable bits and can still play the music by filling in the gaps with sounds that are in between the notes that it knows so the less bad data the less you'll notice if the scratch goes around the cd then it won't have enough good bits in a row to be able to figure out what the music in between should sound like and that's when the cd player stops reading or takes long pauses as it's trying to make sense of what it can't read just because you didn't scratch the cd with your test doesn't mean that you wont scratch it in the future it doesn't take much just enough of a scratch to bend the laser light as it tries to pass through the protective coating and the particles of dirt can be too small for you to see and still can do damage of course the only thing at risk is the life of your cd so wipe it however you want if you're careful and use a clean soft cloth like the kind that come in eyeglass repair kits you should be fine i'll continue to wipe from inside to outside though i don't like replacing my cd's Compact disc Gramophone record Hard disk CPU cache Floppy disk Drill bit Volleyball Movie projector Speed of light R-Type Theory of conduct Galileo spacecraft Glasses Violin DVD Laserdisc Textile manufacturing Cat Piccolo Junior Saga Inertial guidance system Sampling (music) Time Out of Mind Glass Vacuum tube GunBound Dynamic random access memory Casting Tank The Price Is Right Poker jargon CD-R StarCraft Secret Missions Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Particle accelerator Modem Laser Dance Dance Revolution Atari 8-bit family Morse Code Winning Streak Blood (computer game) Corrosion MP3 Virtual memory Randomness Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Upholstery CPU design Polarization Philosophical skepticism Doctor (Doctor Who) Billiards Jean-Luc Picard Harmonica Pitaten The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Redundant array of independent disks Diode Quantum computer Super Audio CD Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Milton H.
