how do you combine songs on itunes to make a album for example i have a dumb and dumber sound track with a bunch of different artist and it drives me crazy that the album is all spreed through itunes how do i put all the songs together personally i use list view and organize by album where the songs will line up correctly this can be done using the far left button above view on the pane at the top itunes already considers them on the same album but the view you are using breaks them up regardless if you put it on an ipod they will show up as the same album otherwise you can change the artist on all of them by right clicking on the track going to get info then the info tab and making them the same artist it's tedious but about the only effective way ITunes IPod ITunes Music Store Mixtape Podcasting IPod mini We Belong Together FairPlay Gramophone record U2 (band) QuickTime Billboard magazine Madonna (entertainer) Online music store Billboard Hot 100 Van Halen The Emancipation of Mimi IPod shuffle Tori Amos Stevie Wonder Metallica Macintosh Finder SonicStage Journey (band) Alanis Morissette Crazy in Love Pearl Jam Last.fm The Chemical Brothers Sampling (music) Pump It Up Dumb & Dumber Melanie Chisholm Led Zeppelin Radiohead Mouse (computing) Incubus (band) IMac Apple Computer Quarashi Pink Floyd Emotions (album) Delta Goodrem Boards of Canada Vanilla Ninja Rhapsody (online music service) Cyndi Lauper IPod photo Silverchair Black Eyed Peas Extraordinary Machine The Four Tops OutKast Robbie Williams C__line Dion Whitney Houston Hidden track ILife Girls Aloud Walkman Guy Sigsworth The Wall Namie Amuro Jessica Simpson ABBA TLC Bananarama Video game music Rufus Wainwright Gwen Stefani Massive Attack Gary Numan Good Vibrations 2Step Jay-Z Trip hop The Presidents of the United States of America (band) Waylon Jennings Med__lla Ja Rule Single (music) Fort Minor Queen (band) Blink-182 Iggy Pop Toni Braxton Boyz II Men Pixies Missy Elliott IPod nano Bee Gees Grammy Award Drag racing Jennifer Lopez Hall & Oates Sheryl Crow Shakira Amy Grant Jody Watley Simon and Garfunkel
