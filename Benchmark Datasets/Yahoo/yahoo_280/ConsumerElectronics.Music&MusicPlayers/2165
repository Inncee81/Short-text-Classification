is there an mp player that is a drag and drop and is bigger than gb of space i want to save all my music in a portable mp player is there one that is drag and drop that doesn't require programs like zune or itunes to import and is gb or bigger i'll start off by clarifying that the ipod is not drag n drop compatible you probably know this already but considering the other answers i thought it was worth mentioning if you want true drag n drop ie an mp player that acts like a portable hard drive what you need is an msc mass storage compliant player which the ipod is not now there aren't a whole lot of msc compatible hard drive players out there what i would recommend if your primary interest is music is the creative zen vision m it comes in gb and gb sizes and appears to be a pretty soild player earning an and an editors choice at cnet com it may not be the most elegant device on the market but it got great reviews and has way more features than the ipod or zune for that matter edit my bad the zen vision m is not msc however if you use windows xp or vista it'd still be fine with drag n drop IPod Digital audio player Creative Zen Windows XP Apple Macintosh Podcasting USB flash drive Walkman Apple Computer Floppy disk Windows Vista Creative Nomad IPod nano IBM PC compatible Mouse (computing) IPod shuffle Digital rights management Windows 2000 IPod mini MP3 USB mass storage device class Hard disk Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis ITunes Music Store Vorbis FireWire Xbox 360 QuickTime Gramophone record Macintosh Finder Visual Basic PlayStation 3 Redundant array of independent disks AmigaOS Windows Server 2003 RealNetworks Macromedia Flash Archos Personal computer C programming language Universal Serial Bus Laptop Bicycle lighting FairPlay Mac OS X Video game music Creative Technology History of Microsoft Windows Computer IBM PC IPod photo Touchpad 64-bit NTFS Game Boy Advance Master's degree Apple Newton History of the graphical user interface Windows Mobile Commodore International Discordianism DVD Online music store OpenStep Unix AVN Awards Booting Linux kernel MUMPS Object Desktop Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Nintendo DS Dell Digital Jukebox Compact audio cassette The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) PowerBook Apple II family PlayStation Portable Linux Embedded system Michael Griffin Arianne Sega Copy protection OpenDocument Sony SonicStage Kingston University Portable Document Format Cascading Style Sheets
