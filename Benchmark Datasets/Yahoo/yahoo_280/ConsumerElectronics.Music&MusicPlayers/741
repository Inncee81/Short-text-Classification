should i get and ipod video or should i consider just sticking with my nano i currantally have an ipod nano gb and i have filled it up i was thinking of asking for my birthday for an ipod video gb i wanted to know if i should ask for that or maybe the zune or a new nano or just forget the idea completely and stick with my nano i've heard that the video works really slow sometimes and it takes forever to download movies and videos on itunes anyway thanks for helping well i have a video only a gb but i love it it holds tons of songs currently over on mine have over photos and about videos and with videos you can buy new games on itunes for them and theyre pretty cool so i think it would be a great thing and you can put a lot of the songs on your nano to your video and if for yourr birthday nobody wants to buy an expensive gb then suggest paying for some or get a gb IPod Apple Computer ITunes Music Store IPod shuffle We Belong Together IPod nano Madonna (entertainer) U2 (band) The Emancipation of Mimi Marilyn Monroe ILife Nine Inch Nails Video game music Podcasting IPod mini Billboard Hot 100 Girls Aloud Journey (band) FairPlay Napster (pay service) Creative Zen Online music store The Chemical Brothers TLC Real Love (song) Steve Jobs IPod photo Digital audio player PlayStation Portable Shake It Off Humphrey Bogart The Beatles' influence Digital rights management Disc jockey QuickTime The Ashlee Simpson Show Computer and video games Remix Blonde on Blonde Vanilla Ninja Kylie Minogue Empire Burlesque Delta Goodrem Mixtape Hung Up (song) Tenchi Muyo!
