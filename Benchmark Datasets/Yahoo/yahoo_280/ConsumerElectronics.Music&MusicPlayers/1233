ipod syncing i'm going to get a gb nano ipod and in my itunes library it says on the bottom i have songs and it uses up gb thats more than the ipod can hold rite the apple site says to break it up into playlists and how do you do that and why would that help will the ipod categorize the songs automatically by artists or genre after syncing or do you have to do that yourself and how do you do that i am so sorry i mistaken it it was mb lol i think you need to check on your itunes on that song gb no way are you sure it's not mb because that would make more sense if it is mb then it will fit on a gb nano mb gb i have songs on my ipod and they only about gb no way songs can be gb ITunes IPod IPod nano ITunes Music Store IPod shuffle Apple Computer FairPlay IPod mini Online music store Rhapsody (online music service) Digital audio player Podcasting Madonna (entertainer) IPod photo Digital rights management U2 (band) Rhythmbox Creative Zen Advanced Audio Coding Napster (pay service) ILife Playlist RealNetworks Walkman Gramophone record Disc jockey We Belong Together IPhoto QuickTime Apple Macintosh Steve Jobs Music genre Mac OS X v10.4 Billboard Hot 100 Mixtape Mac rumors community Vorbis Apple Store FireWire Copyleft Lip sync Apple typography Vertigo (song) MP3 Handheld video game USB flash drive Adult contemporary music Swingout Classic rock IMac Winamp Jack FM SonicStage Progressive rock Delta Goodrem Touchpad Video game music Burl Ives WebObjects Triple J Black Eyed Peas Vlog Redundant array of independent disks Carnatic music Nu metal Stevie Wonder Sarah McLachlan Pearl Jam Traditional animation Freestyle music CDBaby Ironic (song) Loss leader ABBA Logo Blink-182 Smooth jazz CD Baby Last.fm Band Aid (band) Flash memory Compact audio cassette AmaroK MPEG-4 Part 14 Mac mini Apple Newton Tori Amos The Cure Vodcast Lindy Hop Melanie Chisholm Chicago (typeface) Foobar2000 Beat It Linux kernel Hey Jude Parallel computing April 1, 2005
