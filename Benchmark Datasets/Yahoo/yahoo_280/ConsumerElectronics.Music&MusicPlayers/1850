how do i get rid of it you know how when you press the play pause button there is a sign on thetop left corner well my bro got hold of my ipod and now instead of the play pause sign it's a fast forward signand i can't get rid of it plus when i play my songs it sound times faster how do i get rid of it well i think the only way you can do is to reset your ipod to it's original state all you have to do is using your usb cable plug the i pod to the computer then toggle the hold switch on and off a few times and then restart it by holding the menu and select middle at the same time until the screen goes black and the apple logo is up grrrr my bro did that to me once too and after i fixed it i banned him from touching my ipod lol good luck with your ipod problem IPod IPod shuffle Apple Computer IPod nano Mouse (computing) IPod mini ITunes Music Store Embedded system Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) PlayStation Portable IMac FireWire USB flash drive Apple Macintosh Pump It Up Universal Serial Bus Digital audio player Creative Zen IBM PC keyboard Nintendo GameCube Super Mario Bros. 3 Podcasting Konami Code FairPlay Atari 8-bit family Danger Hiptop Super Mario Bros.
