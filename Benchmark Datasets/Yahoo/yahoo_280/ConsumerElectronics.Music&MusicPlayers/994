itunes and limewire's pieces of shit okay today when i was syncing my ipod songs went missing from itunes like the mark beside the song name and it said it couldnt be found so when i tried to relocate it it was nowhere to be found in the share file in limewire but the counter on the bottom of the screen on limewire still counted which was the same as before is there any way to fix this or do i have to redownload all the songs p s coincidentally ot happened right after i updated itunes to im not really sure how you can find the songs but i will suggest to you that whenever you download something make a seperate folder called music or something to that nature and make that the music folder that you continually add to itunes so you dont lose any of it and you always know where it is i think its a flaw with limewire or itunes i forgot but ive been just moving them after i download them and no problems hope that helps a bit ITunes ITunes Music Store ILife Apple Computer Podcasting LimeWire Online music store We Belong Together FairPlay MGM Studios, Inc. v.
