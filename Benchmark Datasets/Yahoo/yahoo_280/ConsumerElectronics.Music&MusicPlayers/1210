what kind of ipod should i get i've had a first generation nano for a bit over a year now gig but now it's too small i like the nano it's small and mine doesn't cuase me any problems at all so i'm saving up for a new ipod i've heard the since the videos have hard drive they get messed up easier if you drop them or something is this true so i wasn't sure what to get help technically yes the nanos have a flash memory drive also known as a solid state drive what this means is that there aren't any moving parts being utilized in reading the data on it ipod videos have standard hard drives which is a series of discs that spin and are read by a moving arm similar to an old record player since the parts move and aren't welded into place they are more prone to breaking when dropped however i have had hard drive ipods since the ipod first came out and dropped them several times and have never had a hard drive fail whether it will fail or not depends on the hard drive itself the level of shock it absorbed by being dropped and how often it's dropped getting a case with some cushioning the latex rubber cases or a hard case with padding inside can minimize the likelihood of major damage in addition to protecting that easily scratched ipod surface the reason apple uses the regular hard drives rather than flash drives in the regular ipods has to do with size and price getting a flash drive with gbs is not only more expensive than a standard hard drive note that the gb ipod and the gb nano are the same price but getting a flash drive that size would most likely make the ipod unreasonably large if you take care of your ipod i doubt it will be a problem but if you do have a problem your warranty should cover you so long as it's not blatently obvious just by looking at it that you dropped the ipod i think they'll cover it for the first year and there are companies that will replace the hard drive if your out of warranty also contrary to what may be said zune currently suffers from the same potential problem as it's also a hard drive based media player there were rumors that microsoft may eventually release a flash based zune with a smaller capacity a zune nano if you will but i don't believe microsoft has officially announced such a product yet Hard disk IPod nano USB flash drive Floppy disk Apple Computer Gramophone record Creative Zen Redundant array of independent disks IPod shuffle Atari 8-bit family Laserdisc ITunes Equine conformation ITunes Music Store Apple Macintosh DVD Digital rights management Mattress Flash memory IMac Digital audio player Digital photography File Allocation Table Walkman IPod mini Mach kernel Xbox Compact audio cassette IBM PC compatible PlayStation 3 Seismic retrofit FireWire Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Computer virus Modchip Strap-on dildo Compact disc Windows XP High-definition television Tire Universal Serial Bus Commodore 64 Copy protection MP3 Macromedia Flash Beatmania IIDX Drill bit Surveillance Archos Apple Newton PlayStation 2 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Volleyball Bicycle Early IBM disk storage Xbox 360 Theory of conduct Motorcycle Car handling M4 Sherman H.264/MPEG-4 AVC CPU design Thermal power station Vorbis Dance Dance Revolution Virtual memory Casting IBook Explosive material Electrophysiology QuickTime Traffic light Upholstery Nintendo Revolution Sega Saturn Combine (Half-Life 2) Screenshot PowerBook Billiards In The Groove (game) Binary prefix Enterprise content management Overclocking Warranty Computer forensics Menstrual cup Single Transferable Vote CompactFlash
