more ipod battery after reseting i heard somewhere that after an ipod loses all battery you can reset it and you can get about another hrs of battery is that true and how do i do that when the ipod battery goes dead once and for all as in can't be charged ever again it will burn out eventually there's nothing you can do but send in for a new one or buy a ipod when the ipod battery is simply out of juice for the day you have to recharge it resetting won't do anything but reset and may even freeze the ipod if it doesn't have enough battery to reset it all the way ITunes Music Store IPod Apple Computer Battery (electricity) IPod shuffle IPod nano Reset button technique Walkman IPod mini IPod photo Lithium ion battery FireWire FairPlay Lead-acid battery PlayStation Portable Daylight saving time Laptop Game Boy Advance Creative Zen Protoss Nickel-cadmium battery Apple Newton Digital rights management The End of the World (Doctor Who) Nickel metal hydride Diablo II: Lord of Destruction ITunes Animal Crossing Torpedo Online music store Toyota Prius Redundant array of independent disks Green Lantern Treo 650 Apple Macintosh Firearm The Vines Bicycle lighting Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day Digital audio player Halo: Combat Evolved Second Battle of the Atlantic Green Lantern Corps Sluggy Freelance Lithium ion polymer battery Cosmic Era technology USS S-42 (SS-153) Auto insurance Jump start (vehicle) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Game Boy Micro Characters of Lost Gambit (comics) IMac Flash memory The Price Is Right Doraemon Mars Exploration Rover Battery electric vehicle Soyuz T-13 Minor Discworld concepts Airsoft Jack plug Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory General Motors EV1 Hybrid vehicle Flashlight Fuel cell Uninterruptible power supply Static (superhero) PIAT USS Thresher (SS-200) Virgin Mobile Danger Hiptop Guild Wars Wheelchair USS S-37 (SS-142) Excel Saga USS S-44 (SS-155) BattleTech technology Loss leader MiniDisc Bob and George Memory effect Ocean's Twelve Audio data compression USS S-35 (SS-140) Game Boy Disc jockey Apollo Lunar Module Battle of Ulundi Oscilloscope USS Triton (SS-201) Xbox 360 USS Whale (SS-239) GP2X USS Wahoo (SS-238) Solar power Pinball Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
