is a reissue cd better than the original or the other way around i want to buy europe's cd however the store has both the original and the reissue the reissue is more i want the original songs not sped up or anything but i do want the sound to be clear and crisp they both look the same so which one is the better buy i doubt they did anything to make the reissue worse than the original therefore i would buy the reissue however you should check the back if it's digitally remastered that is good that means the quality has been improved and noise like hissing clicking or scratching has been digitally removed if tracks are missing on the cd that were on the original that is not good if tracks are cut shorter than the original or remixed that's also not good you'll have to read the back and see i couldn't tell you Remaster Sound recording Digital photography DVD Remix Compact disc The Beatles discography Phonograph The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Laserdisc Movie projector Sampling (music) Atari ST Double Nickels on the Dime Hard disk Floppy disk Peter Gabriel Super Audio CD Fender Telecaster IBM PC compatible Rio (album) Frankie Goes to Hollywood Multitrack recording Reel-to-reel audio tape recording Megadeth All Things Must Pass Video game music Nine Inch Nails Joy Division (band) Compact audio cassette Disc jockey Cray-1 Nintendo Entertainment System Digital image editing Jimi Hendrix A Day in the Life Queen (album) Virginia Astley ZX Spectrum Duran Duran (album) Neu!
