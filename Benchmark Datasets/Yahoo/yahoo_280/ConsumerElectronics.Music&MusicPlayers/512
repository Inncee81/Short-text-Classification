how do i use my laptop as a music source hi i have a show tonight and we typically use a cd player to play the background music through our sound system well on the last show the cd player kept skipping i was wondering how i could use my laptop instead we have a input mixing board an amplifier and two speakers i didn't know if there was a special cable wire i needed to buy if anyone could help me i'd appreciate it thanks real simple you probably have options first for all of them you need to start with one side of the cable being the sterio plug that's your main output or headphone jack first option other end of cable adapted to sterio that will go in to one of the channels on the board into the instrument input the second option keep that same cable but go into the direct box then using a mic xlr cable go into one of the channels on the board the benifit there is the di box will keep any hum out of the sound that can interfere i've been at a lot of gigs with poor grounding and hum in all kinds of things that aren't a balanced cable third option most sound boards have an in out connection with red white rca jacks if yours does then adapt the cable to left right rca jacks and plug it in there the only difference is that the volume on this connection will be controlled by the laptop's output volume where as when you go into a mic channel you can mix the volume with the faders i don't know what resources you have for stores to shop at but radioshack or guitar center would probably be the first choices of mine that will definately have the cables Jack plug Mixing console Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Musical Instrument Digital Interface RCA connector IPod Microphone Oscilloscope TRS connector XLR connector DVD Audiophile Synthesizer Loudspeaker Amstrad CPC SCART Gramophone record Computer bus Laptop Cable television Television Bluetooth Universal Serial Bus Computer Bass guitar Grateful Dead Nominal impedance Telephone exchange Effects pedal Balanced audio Advanced Technology Attachment Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Atari 8-bit family Instrument amplifier Vacuum tube Computer hardware Atari ST Color Headphones Karaoke Walkman TIA-568A/B Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Xbox 360 High-definition television Game Boy PC Engine Ethernet Impedance matching Composite video Stereophonic sound Programmable logic controller DMX (lighting) Multitrack recording Hard disk Laserdisc Xbox S/PDIF Operational amplifier Digital audio workstation Pickup (music) D-subminiature Wi-Fi Software-defined radio Three-phase electric power Dimmer Disc jockey Personal computer Communications satellite Sound card Phantom power Lighting TurboGrafx 16 Guitar USB flash drive MP3 High fidelity Binaural recording Circuit design Embedded system Hearing aid Field-programmable gate array Carburetor MTV2 TV game Nintendo Entertainment System Central processing unit Electrophysiology Alternating current Game Boy Advance SP Original Amiga chipset Logic gate Harp XERF Marching band
