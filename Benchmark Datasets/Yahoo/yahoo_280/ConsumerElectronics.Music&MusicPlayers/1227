consolidating my itunes library so at first i had all of my library on one hard drive disk d but later on i had to make it so that the default library was on a different disk hard drive with more room disk k because it wouldnt fit on d the bad thing is that i now have two copies of my library in places taking up alot of room and my library still has alot of songs that are located on disk d so i cant wipe out disk d and replaying the songs so that they are all from k will take a long time so what im wondering is if consolidating my itunes library will fix this problem whatever is in your itunes library will be saved to your computer when you consolidate it i don't even use disks ITunes IPod Floppy disk Computer virus AmigaOS Macintosh Finder Disk storage Cache Library (computer science) Redundant array of independent disks Virtual memory NeXT System/36 Linux Sorting algorithm Hard disk IBM PC compatible Windows XP Digital rights management System/34 Commodore 1541 ILife Atari 8-bit family ITunes Music Store Action Replay Apple Computer Enterprise content management Apple II family IBM PC Commodore 64 NTFS Early IBM disk storage ZX Spectrum File Allocation Table Computer forensics DOS Backup Video game music IPod shuffle Sound recording Partition (computing) Disk image Computer FairPlay Copy protection Disk cloning File system Memory (computers) USB flash drive Apple Macintosh PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Coldplay Computer storage MS-DOS Emacs PlayStation 2 Library Digital photography Linker Linux kernel Windows 2000 QuickTime Atari ST GNOME Famicom Disk System FreeDOS Knoppix Data remanence Master Control Program Multitrack recording Computer file PlayStation 3 RAM disk Screenshot Pretty Good Privacy Mouse (computing) System 7 (Macintosh) Gramophone record Booting Digital video recorder Xserve Advanced Technology Attachment IBook Karaoke TRS-80 Embedded system Zip drive Computer hardware Online music store Apple IIGS Warez SCSI Syphon Filter CP/M Password Files-11 Macromedia Flash CompactFlash Disk formatting Computer bus
