ipod or zune i saved up enough but i dont know ipod are kewl but zunes are more user friendly and have an fm radio what's ur opinion top reasons to get an ipod instead of a zune i must say that i have not been particularly impressed by the zune this is my top list of reasons for sticking with apple was simply not enough the ipod has more accessories the ipod offers better integration with cars itunes offers seamless podcast support unlike the zune which requires third party software apple has a clear personal digital media strategy that goes beyond the ipod as demonstrated with products such as airport express and the upcoming itv itunes is the best software to manage digital media itunes is multi platform windows and mac unlike the zune software that is windows only and still does not work on vista airlines are starting to offer ipod integration with their in flight entertainment systems ipods can play and buy games hard disk drive models the itunes store offers more songs than any competitor ipods are smaller and lighter apple offers worldwide support for the ipod the songs bought on the itunes store can be used more liberally from my experience when i had a zune it had a problem and contact the store and also microsoft they wouldnt even bother to help me so i emailed them but no reply later on i bought an ipod sure it freezes sometimes and can get easily scratch buy what the hey u can just buy cheap clear film to protect the ipod from scratches and whether i have a problem w it just call apple and they help u instantly not like other stores the only problem why people say ipods has a low battery life is because they dont read instructions the manual said for the first time charge your ipod for about hours to get better results but people are too excited they charge it about an hour or so its there own fault ipods have a few of advantages over the zune firstly the songs purchased for the ipod has less restrictive digital rights management which means that songs can be played on up to networked pc's or macs songs from the zune marketplace cannot be played on macs there is a lot of hype surrounding the built in wifi on the zune but this is only used to exchange songs between zunes and songs received using zune are restricted to be played three times or for three days secondly most of the after market accessories are for ipods most high end home and car stereos interface directly with ipods not zunes thirdly ipods have been around since and command of the market zunes on the other hand have only been on the market a few months have have less than percent market share it's possible that microsoft will discontinue the zune within the near future fourthly there ipods of different capacities from gb to gb so you can find one that meets your needs and your budget with the zune there is only one model gb fifth apple's itunes music store has the best selection with almost two million songs for sale some microsoft fanboys on yahoo answers promote the ability to rent music on the zune marketplace offering music for rent in nothing new both napster and rhapsody have been renting the entire catalog of songs but not too many have been using these are using the rental mode most users of these services are buying their songs outright so what do you think did i forget something hope this helps Hard disk FairPlay IPod nano USB flash drive Windows Vista Floppy disk Windows XP Digital photography PlayStation Portable Microsoft Xbox 360 MP3 History of Microsoft Windows Atari 8-bit family Mach kernel Redundant array of independent disks Atari ST NeXT Mouse (computing) X Window System Apple II family IPod photo Apple Newton Mac OS X v10.4 QuickTime Gramophone record Laserdisc Creative Zen Computer virus Windows 2000 System 7 (Macintosh) Microsoft Office Microsoft Windows Disc jockey Linux IPod mini Pretty Good Privacy MMORPG Mozilla Firefox DVD AmigaOS PlayStation 2 Enterprise content management WebObjects Commodore 64 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Compact audio cassette Voice over IP Operating system Timeline of computing 1990-forward Napster Nintendo DS Amstrad CPC Digital Equipment Corporation Apple typography Steve Jobs RealNetworks Wi-Fi Ashton-Tate Copy protection File sharing HyperCard FireWire TiVo Nintendo Amiga Nintendo GameCube Gmail Rhapsody (online music service) Sega Napster (pay service) High-definition television Sound Blaster TRS-80 WordPerfect Stardock History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Sega Dreamcast Cable television Microeconomics Emacs
