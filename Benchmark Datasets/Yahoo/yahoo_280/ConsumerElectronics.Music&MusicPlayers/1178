ipod being dumb ok so i just plugged my ipod into my computer to add a few songs right well itunes isnt coming up or nething it jus starts charging idk whats wrong with it piece of crap i have synced it with more than library but i dont think that matters i really need some help here ppl thnx peace it doesn't sound like there's anything wrong the option to open itunes automatically whenever the ipod is connected is probably not checked connect the ipod and open itunes manually and check that option first of all if you sync either automatically or manually you'll lose what's already on the ipod if you don't want that to happen choose manage music manually from the front tab of the ipod options then you can just drag drop songs or playlists onto your ipod ITunes IPod ITunes Music Store IPod shuffle Apple Computer IPod nano Podcasting Walkman Online music store Digital audio player Digital rights management ILife SonicStage Gramophone record Manual transmission IMac Disc jockey Floppy disk Rhythmbox Redundant array of independent disks Apple typography Carburetor IPod photo Aerial (dance move) RealNetworks C programming language Windows 2000 Sinclair ZX81 Apple Macintosh Windows XP Steve Jobs QuickTime Video game music Advanced Audio Coding IPhoto Visual Basic Jack plug Napster (pay service) Btrieve Xiangqi Movie projector FireWire Last.fm Rhapsody (online music service) Copy protection Shit SCART Blackjack MP3 Mac mini WebObjects Compact audio cassette Playlist Telephone exchange Apostrophe (mark) Creative Zen Vorbis Poker jargon Baseball Stars AmigaOS Coupling (railway) We Belong Together HTTP cookie Copyleft Automatic transmission Black Eyed Peas Modem Buffer overflow Embedded system Tori Amos Daylight saving time Chess strategy and tactics Macintosh Finder U2 (band) Lip sync Shogi Mouse (computing) Mac OS X v10.4 Craps Thermal power station Apple Newton Secure Digital card Danger Hiptop United States Postal Service Halting problem PlayStation Portable Ethernet Virtual memory Microsoft Jet Database Engine Halo 2 Singlish Chess Object Desktop MOS Technology SID Canon T90 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory USB flash drive
