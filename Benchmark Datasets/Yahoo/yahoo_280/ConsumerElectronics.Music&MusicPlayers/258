cd player in car i'm thinking of putting a cd player in my car am i a step behind technologically here also what problems would i run into once i got the cd player out of the box if your going to install it yourself make sure to get a wiring harness based on your type of car this will make installing the chassis easier make sure to screw the cd chassis with the securing bolt which will make it harder to steal some cds don't come with this so you may need to buy it separately if you are running an amplifier or the cd player directly to the battery use an inline fuse this will stop surges from frying all your cables and possibly the cd and or amplifier make sure that the amplification of each channel coming out of the cd player isn't too much for your existing speakers if you do any bridging of an amplifier or speaker box make sure you account for the change in ohms that's all that i can think of Bass guitar Loudspeaker Ethernet IPod Fuse (electrical) Electrophysiology Vacuum tube Audiophile Operational amplifier High fidelity Coaxial cable Windows XP Guitar Motorcycle Transformer Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Car audio TGV Audi A2 Impedance matching Back to the Future Cable television Electric guitar Hearing aid Naval mine Instrument amplifier Transistor String instrument Copy protection DVD Circuit design Battery (electricity) Subwoofer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Drill bit Resistor IBM PC compatible BS 1363 Electronic amplifier Solar car Bluetooth Glossary of climbing terms Sound recording Energy development Wayne Corporation Universal Serial Bus Grateful Dead Burglar alarm Electrical wiring Surveillance Case modding Internet fraud Double bass Semiconductor device Fuel cell Submarine communications cable Jack plug Ford Crown Victoria Pioneer Corporation Violin Non-native pronunciations of English DIY audio Strap-on dildo Electricity Lightning Computer forensics Welding Audio power Microphone Polymerase chain reaction Directed-energy weapon Cray-1 RuneScape skills Equine conformation De Lorean DMC-12 Amplifier Hard disk Poker jargon Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Baseball Universal Century Technology Fender Telecaster Wi-Fi Pump It Up Television Solar power Computer case Wind turbine Satellite dish Star Trek Customizable Card Game Nickel-cadmium battery Laptop Screw Digital audio player Automobile Spark plug Passenger car Light rail Marshall Amplification
