how do i change the battery pack in a norelco rx razor from i'm not sure how to take the old pack out and put a new one in i just recently changed a battery on one and the razor is held together by very small torx screws i didn't have a torx bit that small but was able to use a small screw driver to take them out the replacement batteries are two separate volt batteries connected together by a metal band i ordered mine off line from http www totalvac com parts norelcobattery html for plus shipping if you plan on doing so i would recommend having them shipped by mail it's quicker and cheaper the wires to the old batteries have to be un soldered and the new ones soldered in to the tabs on each end of the new ones good luck they are the bt sc and the price is for both i mis read the model of your razor but i'm sure the procedure would be the same so the battery for your razor would be one of the others on the page sorry Screw IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Xbox 360 Battery (electricity) Oscilloscope Bicycle lighting PlayStation 2 Soldering Printed circuit board Wrench Second Battle of the Atlantic Solar cell Earring HyperText Transfer Protocol Hybrid vehicle Battery electric vehicle Solder Dodge Charger Nickel-cadmium battery Electrical wiring Manual transmission Harmonica Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Atari 8-bit family RS-232 Torpedo Windows XP Oxy-fuel welding and cutting PlayStation Portable Federal Standard 1037C Fuse (electrical) Radio controlled airplane RFID Incandescent light bulb Hearing aid Razor Trombone D-subminiature Mozilla Firefox Atari ST PCB layout guidelines Drill bit Knife Uniform Resource Identifier Laptop Nintendo 64 Thermostat HTML Uniform Resource Locator Radio controlled car Carburetor Submarine Razor and blades business model Toyota Prius Binoculars Modem Bass guitar World Wide Web Johnny 5 USB flash drive Xbox Lighting Welding Universal Serial Bus HTTP cookie Nintendo DS Autonomous building Tungsten Handheld ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam Electrical element USS Whale (SS-239) Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program USS Tunny (SS-282) Common Unix Printing System Cascading Style Sheets Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) Screwdriver Norwegian Campaign ITU-T Violin Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Combine (Half-Life 2) Floppy disk Euro Mouse (computing) Web crawler Internet Explorer Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Internet Web browser Die (manufacturing) Point-to-point construction XHTML Oplan Bojinka Electrical generator System/36 Battle of Lissa (1866) IBM PC compatible
