can you change the can you change the number of ohms on an power amp not without rebuilding it the impedance or ohms is designed into the amp while some actually have a switch to change the impedance or are designed to meet a range of impedances say from ohms to ohms there is no practical way to change the ohms of an amp that doesn't have it designed in Resistor Circuit design Operational amplifier Impedance matching Electrophysiology Transformer Impedance Ohm Electronic amplifier Electricity Output impedance Decibel Negligible Loudspeaker Voltage drop Ohm's law Capacitor Voltage source Cellular network Current source Electrical resistance Electrical network Input impedance Transmission line Ampere Coaxial cable Phasor (electronics) Radar cross section Antenna (radio) BS 1363 Adenosine monophosphate Nominal impedance Advanced Mobile Phone System Instrument amplifier RLC circuit Analysis of resistive circuits Kenwood Electronics Volt X10 (industry standard) Electrical wiring (UK) Scientific units named after people Transistor Low voltage differential signaling Negative resistance RC circuit RL circuit Audio power Bass guitar Electric guitar Ethernet Telephone numbering plan Thermistor ARPANET Central processing unit Electrometer Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency Residual-current device Water turbine Analog computer Parnall Randomness Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects XML Bicycle lighting Digital AMPS Dipole antenna Maundy money Time-domain reflectometer Damping factor Lac operon 10BASE5 2-8-2 Maximum power theorem Bootstrapping Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Electric motor Electrical generator Audio system measurements Mike Watt Information warfare Arch Enemy Physical constant Body mass index Acorn Atom Signal transduction Amplifier Mountain bike Vacuum cleaner Logic gate Lawn mower Transconductance Electrical engineering Welding power supply DMX (lighting) Serial Storage Architecture E85 Heinkel He 100 Core War Ceramics New York City Subway nomenclature
