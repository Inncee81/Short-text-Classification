how does a toaster work notice how yes notice how i asked how it works not how to use one so i was thinking when u select the settings to change how long ur bread is in there gettin toasted how does it work do toasters have thermostats or are they like old style microwaves where u turn the dial to say and it unwinds slowly n when it hits the toast pops out so if u put ur settings on and then after a few mins put it on would the toast pop out straight away as dani pointed out i would try this but i dont like dark or burnt toast lol so basically thermostats timers or something else i'm not sure if they have thermostats i dont think they have different heat settings thanks it is like a thermostat notice that when you cook toast on say lvl and wait till it pops up then turn around and immediately try to cook toast on lvl the toaster wont keep the toast down that is because the coils are too hot for that lvl so the toaster thinks the toast has reached its doneness for a better more scientific answer go check out this site http www energyquest ca gov how it works toaster html Toaster Toast Grilling Refrigerator Red Dwarf characters Bread Solar power Hot dog Rice cooker Embedded system Treehouse of Horror V Heat Atomic Kitten Billboard Hot 100 Breakfast Bi-metal Pop-Tarts Bagel HyperText Transfer Protocol Apollo 13 Barbecue The Shining (film) Heating element Fire Toasting HVAC Roxette Domain Name System Kitchen Stove Transmission Control Protocol English muffin Application programming interface French toast Fire fighting Jennifer Lopez Sandwich Slow cooker Modem Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Burglar alarm Jon Secada Music of Jamaica Textile manufacturing Diana Ross Hall & Oates World Wide Web Bubble Bobble Willa Ford Abraham Simpson Tesla coil Ironing Conspiracy (TNG episode) Inception of Darwin's theory Roux Shaggy dog story New York Giants Furnace Make money fast Britpop Hysteresis Cuisine of Brazil Uniform Resource Locator Big Bang GunBound Quotation mark French fries Exception handling Waffle Cuisine of Denmark Aaliyah Dial M for Murder The Isley Brothers Pizza Temperature The Toasters Schlock Mercenary HTTP cookie German cuisine Happy Tree Friends She Loves You Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina GED Apollo 8 Dolly Parton Oxyacetylene Slashdot subculture Equine conformation Cooking on a campfire Poker jargon Common Unix Printing System Internal ballistics Columbine High School massacre Microwave oven Rod Stewart RuneScape quests VHF omnidirectional range Major appliance
