i have bought a new telly and fitted an outside ariel but when a persons speaking the sound isnt in sync the problem may not be with your antenna but i can't be sure how to advise you as you are not very specific when you say out of sync what do you mean you see actors lips move before hearing their voices or you have a crackling sound or what i am assuming that you are in the uk if your tv is new it could be that it is set up for european pal instead of uk pal where you could tune in the sound or the picture but not at the same time go into your settings menu and find tuning and make sure it is set for uk pal which i believe is pal b bad memory haven't lived in the uk for a number of years just set it to one of the other choices and see if that helps otherwise try asking again being a bit more specific Television Super Nintendo Entertainment System S__CAM NTSC DV PAL Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IS-95 Laserdisc Whose Line Is It Anyway?
