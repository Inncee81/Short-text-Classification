is it bad to mix two different brands of batteries in a remote i have one energizer and one duracel left aaa i put them both in my tv remote and they seem to work fine but i've heard that you shouldn't do it so can someone explain if i need to take them out or if they're okay the battery companies will of course recommend that you not mix brands see energizer faq link below because it means that they can sell more of their brand batteries however when you read a little more about how batteries actually work see how stuff works link below you might decide that there is some cause for concern when it comes to mixing battery types mixing old batteries with new batteries is commonly discouraged check your manual for whatever device takes batteries and it's also safe to assume that different brands may use different agents in their batteries putting them together and throwing current and heat into the equation sounds like a bad idea it's probably best to play it safe use the same types of batteries and change all batteries when performance starts to wane hope this helps Battery (electricity) Johnny 5 Nickel-cadmium battery Bicycle lighting Battery electric vehicle Apple Computer Nickel metal hydride Avenue Q Lithium ion battery Thermal power station Remote control Manual transmission Embedded system Parody advertisement Anti-aircraft warfare C plus plus Bass guitar RFID Daylight saving time Digital photography The Star Wars Holiday Special Hybrid vehicle Xbox 360 Hearing aid IPod Redundant array of independent disks Naval mine Jack plug Nuclear reactor Fuel cell Dance Dance Revolution Smoke detector Sears Holdings Corporation PlayStation Portable Light-emitting diode Windows XP Vacuum tube Solar power Explosive material Game Boy MUMPS Credit card Jumpstart 3rd Grade Toyota Prius High-voltage hazards Superconductivity Energy development Autonomous building Jet engine Poker jargon Oscilloscope Energizer Bunny MiniDisc Laptop Diode Television commercial Microphone Second Battle of the Atlantic Global Gillette Torpedo Electric motor Incandescent light bulb X Window System Electroshock gun Cruising (maritime) C programming language Internal combustion engine Carburetor Advertising Ford Motor Company Solar cell The Dalek Invasion of Earth Modem Telephone exchange Baseball Canon T90 Lewis Urry Musical Instrument Digital Interface Atari 8-bit family Enigma machine Hey Jude Nintendo Scientology beliefs and practices Subwoofer Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Lincoln LS Pun GED TiVo Street-Legal Traffic light Heat Photography ExxonMobil E85 Altruism Volt ITV
