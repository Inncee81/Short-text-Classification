my speakers are buzzing and making weird sounds like bad interference recently whenever i turn my speakers on i hear a buzzing hissing sound with sound interference this also happens with my headset i have juggles around with the sound options since and it's only better when muted which is not good when i want to listen to music help would be grately appreciated it sounds like either a ground loop or a hardware problem you didn't mention what kind of sound system this is but the first thing to try is unplug everything else from the wall socket or power strip just plug the sound sytem directly into the wall outlet if the buzz goes away it is possible it was a ground loop if it doesn't it is probably a hardware problem Sampling (music) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Musical Instrument Digital Interface BS 1363 Nintendo Entertainment System IBM PC compatible Audiophile Loudspeaker Game Boy Sound recording Grateful Dead Video game music Headphones Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Commodore 64 Hearing impairment Nirvana (band) Universal Serial Bus Personal computer Real Love (song) Non-native pronunciations of English Bluetooth Thread (computer science) Hearing aid Ground (electricity) Computer hardware Modem Atari 8-bit family Shaggy dog story Stereophonic sound Capacitor plague Residual-current device Royal Assent Jack plug "Weird Al" Yankovic Cellular network Music genre TRS-80 Pop punk FL Studio Equine conformation Time Out of Mind Power strip Embedded system World music VJ Electronic voice phenomena CPU cache System/360 Meaning Bad Wolf Game programming Shit Radar Hiberno-English Disc jockey Hey Jude Commodore 128 N-Gage Xbox Amiga International Phonetic Alphabet Information warfare Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Whose Line Is It Anyway?
