how long would a power stepdown last im planning to use a v to v for my xbox and would like to know how many hours i can use it for before it heats or before it melts or even how many hours is it recommended to use these tyoe of converters thanks what you have described is a step down transformers as long as they are rated at or above the load they will last indefinitely i don't know what the xbox takes but lets say it draws amp if the transformer is rated for amp or higher there should be no time limit as far as use you can also compare watts if the xbox draws watts and the transformer is rated at watts or more no problem Transformer Incandescent light bulb Solar power Xbox Electronic amplifier BS 1363 Explosive material Three-phase electric power Horsepower Circuit design Galileo spacecraft Power (physics) Renewable energy Audiophile Wind power Solar panel XML Switched-mode power supply Universal Serial Bus Electric motor Solar cell Nuclear reactor Fusion power Armored Core RISC Fossil fuel power plant Future energy development Welding power supply Jet engine Resistor Microwave oven Electrophysiology Halo: Combat Evolved Electricity meter X10 (industry standard) Pump It Up Marshall Amplification Loudspeaker Operational amplifier RollerCoaster Tycoon Central processing unit Grand Theft Auto III Fuse (electrical) Electric power transmission Bicycle lighting Audio power High-voltage direct current Electrodeless lamp War of Currents Welding Energy development Athlon 64 Electronic Arts Fluorescent lamp Steam engine E85 Impedance matching PlayStation 2 Battery (electricity) Console game Carbon dioxide Casting Decibel CPU design Tesla coil Power factor correction Wind turbine Speed limit ATI Technologies Electrical generator Relay NX bit Greenhouse effect Dance Dance Revolution Nuclear power Sonic Heroes Nintendo GameCube Carburetor Pebble bed reactor Diesel engine Light-emitting diode Fuel injection Xbox 360 Turbocharger Hydropower James Watt Diabetes mellitus Gas metal arc welding Thermal power station Diode Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 British Rail Class 42 Spacecraft propulsion Soul Calibur II Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Nuclear fusion Ceramics Eric Bischoff
