iwant to hook up a marine radio to my rock speakers do i need a converter for this if i need a converter where can i purchase a cabinet to hold the marine radio and converter it shouldn't be a problem to plug the speakers directly into the radio to be sure check the owner's manual for your radio to determine what the speaker output impedance is it should be either or ohms i'm guessing that your rock speakers are ohm if that is the case simply connect both speakers in parallel to the jack that plugs into the radio Loudspeaker Electrophysiology Circuit design Transformer Nominal impedance Impedance Modem Output impedance Resistor Ohm's law Spark plug Commodore 64 IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Telephone exchange Ethernet Transmission line Capacitor S-Video Atari ST Advanced Technology Attachment Input impedance Enterprise content management Coaxial cable Operational amplifier Audio power SCSI RCA connector Electrical resistance Jack plug Voltage source Decibel Desktop computer Current source TRS connector Antenna (radio) ALOHAnet Ohm Damping factor Membrane potential DMX (lighting) Speaker of the British House of Commons Microphone Software-defined radio Oscilloscope Universal Serial Bus Audio crossover Electronic amplifier Manual transmission Common Unix Printing System Carburetor United States House of Representatives Battery electric vehicle XERF Audiophile RC circuit Parliament of Canada Classic rock Bose Corporation Burglar alarm Computer bus Series and parallel circuits Low voltage differential signaling Seismometer Presidential system Atari 8-bit family Computer hardware Reflection seismology RLC circuit TIA-568A/B Fluorescent lamp Acorn Electron Residual-current device Motor oil Electrical network Compiler optimization Xbox RL circuit Phoneme Artificial neural network Sound Blaster D-subminiature Two-stroke cycle Subwoofer Btrieve Enigma machine Sinclair ZX81 Congress of the United States Bass guitar CPU cache BS 1363 Lord Chancellor De Lorean DMC-12 Alternating current Automatic transmission Bombe Marine aquarium Headphones
