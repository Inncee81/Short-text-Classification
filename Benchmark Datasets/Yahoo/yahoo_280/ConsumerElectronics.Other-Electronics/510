ti silver edition problem alright i just bought a new ti se caculator two days ago recently i have put mirageos on my caculator and nothing else now when i try to put other programs and apps on my caculator nothing works when i plug the usb cord in the computer a little window pops up in the lower right hand corner saying that the computer doesnt recognize the device and that it has malfunctioned nothing odd is going on with the caculator though it is functioning normally can anybody tell me what the problem may be i reset everything and it still isnt being recognized by the computer it says that there isnt a driver for the device alright now the message isn't coming up but when i try to send a new file over the device is plugged in the whole time yet the sound signifying that the device is being unplugged beeps twice as in the device is unplugged in plugged back in though i havent touched it this is getting annoying alright at this point the device is recognized but i cannot complete a transfer because the computer keeps denying my access to the file i guess i can download it just fine but i cannot transfer it mirageos so annoying on my calculator it took away all apps and programs anyways on your calculator delete everything that has anything to do with mirageos i think that's just the app as well as an appvar how to do that nd mem scroll down and find one of the things that says mirageos press del and then press scroll down and find the other thing that says mirageos do the same thing then restart your calculator see if it works with your computer if it does make a full backup of everything on your calculator using ti connect then you can attempt to re install mirageos on your calculator if you have any more questions post them on yahoo answers and i will most likely see them IPod Windows 2000 Commodore 64 Mouse (computing) Bluetooth Architecture of Windows 2000 Windows XP Blue screen of death History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows Modem TI-83 series Linux Computer virus Floppy disk USB flash drive Steam (content delivery) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Common Unix Printing System System/36 CPU cache File system Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer Computer bus MDAC E-mail AmigaOS Palm OS Cheating in Counter-Strike Danger Hiptop CPU design Backup Xbox 360 Windows Vista Nintendo Entertainment System MSN Messenger Booting IBM PC compatible Personal computer Windows API Embedded system Laptop USB mass storage device class Atari 8-bit family PlayStation 3 Kernel (computer science) Computer security Computer forensics ALGOL 68 Opera (web browser) Virtual memory Mach kernel Ethernet Password Windows Me Windows 3.x Computer insecurity Gmail WordPerfect Copy protection Redundant array of independent disks STS-61 Apple Desktop Bus Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Plug-and-play DragonFly BSD Apple Computer Domain Name System Internet Relay Chat Windows Server 2003 BitTorrent IP (complexity) Common criticisms of Microsoft Halting problem ZX Spectrum Digital camera IBM PC Turing machine Jumpstart 3rd Grade Calculator BS 1363 AlphaSmart Digital photography Plan 9 (operating system) N-Gage Numerical analysis Java programming language Public-key cryptography ITunes
