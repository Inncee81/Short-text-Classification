what's the difference with an hd dvd player and an hd upconvert why does it matter and should i go with hd dvd player or blu ray high def picture is considered to have lines of resolution and an hd dvd has all lines stored on its disc which is displayed by your tv an upconverting player takes a dvd which has lines of resolution and using a mathematical algorithm attempts to fill in the picture to reach lines of resolution the extra detail isn't there but the technology does its best guess approximation the end result is a better than dvd picture quality but worse than hd picture quality to get the best picture quality you'll need either and hd dvd player or a blu ray player both are equal in quality but blu ray is supported by more companies while hd dvd is cheaper i'd tend to side with blu ray if i picked one but i wouldn't buy any existing blu ray players outside the ps current hd dvd players i would buy and at a cheaper cost but know that hd dvd has a lesser selection of titles than blu ray DVD Blu-ray Disc Digital photography Gramophone record Anamorphic widescreen Video CD Handheld game console Compact disc Color MP3 Super Video CD DualDisc NTSC Television Computer Digital rights management VHS Movie projector PostScript H.264/MPEG-4 AVC GamePark Pornography CPU cache S__CAM MPEG-2 Quicksort Solar cell Video codec Videocassette recorder Copy protection Final Fantasy XI High fidelity Digital image editing PlayStation Portable Online DVD rental ATI Technologies Sony RuneScape economy Widescreen Regional lockout Super Audio CD Wheel of Fortune HD DVD Compact audio cassette Search engine optimization Windows Vista Floppy disk Deinterlacing Machinima Atari ST Scientific method Rugby union Camcorder Rendering (computer graphics) Stereoscopy Image file formats Hash table Manga Nintendo Revolution Motion picture rating system Prisoner's dilemma Warez Digital cinema Publicly funded medicine Slot machine Poker jargon Vorbis Inflation JPEG Violin Betting (poker) Pok__mon Chronicles Microeconomics Digital television ELO rating system SCART The Criterion Collection Blockbuster Video Audiophile 2004-05 NHL lockout Nintendo 64 Def Leppard Digital cinematography Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure Atari 8-bit family Anti-aliasing Tetris Condorcet method Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Plasma display Doctor Who missing episodes Password cracking Pixel Analog-to-digital converter Halting problem Modchip Page replacement algorithms
