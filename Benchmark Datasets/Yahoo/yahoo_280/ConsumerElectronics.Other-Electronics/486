what is a good paint to use on a pc tower i want to paint this new tower i bought high gloss black so who knows what the best paint to use is and where i'd get ti i know i heard of a paint that's good for this sort of thing electronics but i can't remember what it is or where i heard of it keep in mind that this is a tower nothing inside it yet and that it it primarily steel actually a black matte will dissipate more heat but the gloss should work too not that the difference will be noticeable it does on a heat sink which is why it puzzles me that most are silver or brass i guess the previous answer assume u are going to paint over the air holes Wheel of Fortune Heat sink Internal ballistics Door Handloading Vacuum tube Zinc Ocean's Twelve The Curse of Fenric Explosive material Soldering Black Stirling engine Shen Gong Wu Solar power Tire Heat Casting Lightning Central processing unit Microeconomics Piccolo Junior Saga Little Britain Electronic amplifier Titanium BMW M5 Transformer Black hole thermodynamics Cryptic crossword The nature of God in Western theology Gospel of Mark Charles Goodyear Blacksmith Circuit design Gas tungsten arc welding Printed circuit board Extreme Programming Mastermind (board game) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Transistor Aluminium Barium G-Man (Half-Life) Microwave oven Nuclear fusion Welding Fuel injection Philosophical skepticism Weather lore September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Water (molecule) Nickel Gilding Gloss (material appearance) Super Mario 64 Silver Disc brake Phoebe Buffay's songs Atomism Wind turbine Coriolis effect Furnace Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Bad Wolf Theory of conduct Aliens of London Resistor The Five Doctors The Black Hole Ohm's law Manganese Ontological argument Spark plug Fritz Leiber M16 (rifle) Brazing Entropy Legacy of Kain Black hole 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Vickers Valiant Transmitter 9/11 conspiracy theories Thermal power station Diode Drill bit Opportunity rover Table tennis Brett Whiteley The Doctor Dances Oakland Cemetery Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Thermal resistance Copper Hiberno-English Swamp cooler Light-emitting diode Merit
