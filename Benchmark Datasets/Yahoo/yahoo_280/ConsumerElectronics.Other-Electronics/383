can i use my watt transformer on multi plug extension cord somewhat like a surge protector i want to use my gamecube it's us voltage but im in asia using v so i need a transformer i know the transformer is watts but i want to make sure i can use it on that extension cord before i plug it in and short circuit the power i looked at the extension cord for any electric consumption indicators on the label it says v v amp w it is a plug extension cord the other plugs are used they are being used for a stationary phone a tv and a dvd player thanks for your help please note that ' w' at the end of your description of the cord that stands for watts your transformer uses watts that leaves watts for the rest of the stuff the phone and dvd probably don't use too much check your tv if it's less than watts you're probably ok also make sure that your fuse or circuit breaker for the plug is rated for amps or higher Fuse (electrical) BS 1363 Circuit breaker Power strip Transformer Circuit design Extension Cord Fluorescent lamp Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Bass guitar Power cord Incandescent light bulb Universal Serial Bus Resistor Three-phase electric power Electricity meter Ground and neutral Audiophile Operational amplifier Mike Watt Electrical wiring (UK) Volt Alternating current Electronic amplifier X10 (industry standard) Jack plug Battery (electricity) Distribution board Spark plug Vacuum tube Capacitor Transmitter Electrical generator Loudspeaker Relay Power (physics) STS-61 Armored Core Electrician Electricity distribution DVD Spark gap Earthing system Electricity Enigma machine Ford Ranger EV Ground (electricity) Voltage drop Ampere Tesla coil Membrane potential Battery electric vehicle Decibel High-voltage direct current Action potential Bicycle lighting Thermal power station Carburetor Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Welding power supply Light-emitting diode Impedance Lightning Electric motor Short circuit Diode Power line communication Electrical breakdown Switch Secure Digital card Vacuum cleaner Voltage source CPU electrical consumption National Electrical Code (US) Antenna (radio) Superconductivity Audio power Wi-Fi Electrical network Lightning rod Xbox Electrophysiology Ignition system Lithium ion battery Static inverter plant Horsepower Power supply Wind power Telephone switchboard Read-only memory Voltmeter Solar power 2003 North America blackout Steam engine FireWire
