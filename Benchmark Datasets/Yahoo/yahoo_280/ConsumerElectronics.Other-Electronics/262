can't get progressive scan to work i have a samsung sa model hd tv which seemed like a wonderful purchase when i bought it since i was told that it has hd capability as well as progressive scan capability however i'm trying to get the progressive scan mode on however every time i try to turn it on the screen goes blank do i need the usb upgrade or something i found out by looking at the back of the tv that you need to hook up the component video in to the ps but each time i try that the signal is black and white do i need a special converter i am not familiar with your tv but tvs automatically detect the input and scale to their native resolution so there is no need to set your ps to progressive output what progressive resolution do you try p p or p perhaps your tv supports only p and p and not p actually for p you will need an hdmi cable as well set your ps at p and it should work just fine Television SCART Digital Visual Interface Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation Portable Xbox 360 High-definition television Original Amiga chipset 1080p Digital photography Universal Serial Bus ATSC DVD High-Definition Multimedia Interface Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Super Nintendo Entertainment System Apple IIGS Geographic information system Sound Blaster Atari 8-bit family Interlace Oscilloscope Sinclair ZX81 Digital television Video codec Bluetooth Teletext Game Boy Amiga Home cinema Laserdisc Image scanner Nintendo GameCube Liquid crystal display television Laptop S__CAM Digital circuit Computer display NTSC Commodore 128 Mouse (computing) Widescreen PlayStation 3 Analog-to-digital converter Steam (content delivery) Video ZX Spectrum Hard disk VHS MPEG-2 Atari ST PC Engine RGB color model Light-emitting diode Creative Zen IBM PC compatible Air traffic control Enterprise content management Amstrad CPC Broadcast television system SETI Game Boy Advance Sound card Acorn Electron MIM-23 Hawk IMac Vorbis Windows Vista Video Graphics Array Windows XP FireWire Betacam Camcorder Color Graphics Adapter Macrovision Windows 2000 Compact disc Copy protection Commodore 64 RCA connector IBook Digital Atari 2600 Floppy disk Refresh rate Digital signal processing Blu-ray Disc IPAQ Portable Document Format Halting problem Mass spectrometry Functional magnetic resonance imaging Digital cinematography DV Galileo spacecraft Nintendo DS Computer display standard Advanced Technology Attachment
