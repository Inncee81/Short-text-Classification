is it possible to use a way antenna splitter in this situation i am in college and am about to room with someone that i don't know i've tried contacting her multiple times but she won't get back to me so i was wondering about using a way signal splitter i've heard of other students doing this my only concern is whether we would be able to watch seperate channels at the same time the dorms have cable but no box it just plugs into the wall like regular antenna would this be a problem anything is much appreciated that should be ok the cable sounds like it uses the tuner in your tv to set change the channels the only concern would be if the signal were degraded by being split try it out and see if the signal is too bad and you get very poor picture quality you can purchase an amplifier at radio shack or other places for under most likely tho it will be no problem at all Cable television Audiophile Television Coaxial cable High-definition television Antenna (radio) Wi-Fi SCART Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Modem Loudspeaker Digital Subscriber Line Radar Microphone Digital television Impedance matching Oscilloscope XERF DVD Home Box Office Federal Communications Commission High fidelity Software-defined radio Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Musical Instrument Digital Interface Amateur radio Radio Gramophone record Set-top box TiVo Ethernet TV-FM DX Freeview Sound reinforcement system Satellite television Federal Standard 1037C NTSC Crystal radio receiver Code division multiple access RS-232 DMX (lighting) Global System for Mobile Communications Decibel Digital cable Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Jack plug Kenwood Electronics Diplexer Transmitter Electrophysiology WWOR-TV Cellular network Sound recording Citizens' band radio Analog signal Bluetooth Television in the United States Receiver (radio) Electronic amplifier Electric guitar Composite video Aliasing Stereophonic sound ANT1 Ultra high frequency Advanced Technology Attachment Wavelength-division multiplexing Sound card S-Video FM broadcasting Sound Blaster Foxtel Wardenclyffe Tower Atari 8-bit family Audio data compression TGV Remote control Satellite dish Mixing console Universal Serial Bus Escape from New York Headphones Wireless access point Pirate decryption IEEE 802.11 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Laserdisc Whose Line Is It Anyway?
