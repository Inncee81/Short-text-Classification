i need something called an ear mic or ear microphone any suggestions it's supposed to help you hear yourself while you're singing so that you are able to better fine tune your voice does anyone possibly know where i can find one at a reasonable price i wouldn't use an ear mic this is normally a microphone worn in the ear it won't help you hear yourself as other hear you the best thing is to record yourself on a cassette or cd or any audio recorder you have then listen to yourself after you are done recording you sound different to yourself because your voice travels through the bones and sinus cavities in your head to your eardrums this colors your voice even wearing a good set of headphones isn't ideal because your voice is still getting to your eardrums through your head and coloring the audio you hear it's best to completely separate hearing your voice completely from the speaking process Microphone Binaural recording Stereophonic sound Multitrack recording Ear Headphones Sound Hearing impairment Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Highway 61 Revisited Audiophile Mixtape Loudspeaker Pet Sounds Gramophone record Sound effect Electronic voice phenomena I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Decibel Compact disc Ear canal It's All Gone Pete Tong Timpani Social rule Audio data compression Skull Karaoke Sound design Sound recording Temporal bone Traumatic brain injury Blood on the Tracks Jack plug MP3 Sampling (music) Tuatara Vowel The Who Earwax Psychoacoustics NTSC Time Out of Mind Sense Walkman High fidelity Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Ossicles Stereoscopy Sound film Head Nashville Skyline Circuit design Compact audio cassette Laserdisc Music Mixing console Louie, Louie Acoustics Radiotelephone Grateful Dead Joy Division (band) Rush Limbaugh Video game music The Microphones Dubbing (filmmaking) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases This Week in Tech Hearing (sense) Dither Radio drama Whale song Steve Reich Shure Incorporated Empire Burlesque Equal-loudness contour Noise-cancelling headphone The Empty Child Diving (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction Bose Corporation Freddie Mercury Sphenoid bone English grammar Cyberspace Echo chamber Stuttering Hip hop rivalries Covert listening device God Save the Queen Neuros Maxilla Apple IIGS Tetrapod A Day in the Life MOS Technology SID Ontological argument IPod Weighting filter Disc jockey
