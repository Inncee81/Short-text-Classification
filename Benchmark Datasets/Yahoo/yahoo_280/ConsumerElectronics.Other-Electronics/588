who invented radio was it a alexander stepanovich popov was a russian physicist inventor of communication equipment and lecturer the best years of popov's short life were spent in a school that was destined to become the cradle of radio here he worked for eighteen years from to he came a youth without a stable place in life and left the torpedo school a recognized scientist that had glorified russian science with an epoch making contribution b heinrich hertz in some call him the father of radio because his experiments created interest by marconi radio waves were commonly called hertzian waves in the early days hertz studied maxwell's theories and in attempting to develop further data actually set up the first spark transmitter and receiver c in a serbian nikola tesla suggested a means of conduction using the earth he invented the tesla coil which created high frequency oscillations in marconi experimented with hertzian guglielmo marconi History of radio Guglielmo Marconi Nikola Tesla Ionosphere Magnifying Transmitter Wardenclyffe Tower Alexander Popov (physicist) History of radar Transformer SETI Electromagnetic radiation Alternating current Heinrich Rudolf Hertz Maxwell's equations High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program Lightning Thomas Edison Timeline of invention Lee De Forest X-ray Wireless telegraphy Oliver Heaviside Reginald Fessenden Ronald N.
