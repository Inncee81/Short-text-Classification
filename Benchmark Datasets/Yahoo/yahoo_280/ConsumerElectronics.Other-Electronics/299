why do guitar amps with high wattage have head amps maybe i don't understand head amps exactly but when you look at guitar amps with low wattage they have the control switches and knobs attached to the amp however when you move onto taller amps with higher wattage why do they all have head amps that need to be attached couldn't manufacturers make all amps with the controls attached onto it can someone explain how a head amp also works some of them have a lower part that appears like a speaker is there a tiny speaker built in to it but why do some head amps like this http www musiciansbuy com mmmbcom images marshall avt h jpg appear to have a bit of space for what seems like a tiny speaker built in is there even one there how would you know what guitar amp and amp head combo you would go for it seems like a lot of mixing and matching that would be hard to try out i mean if let's say i get a marshall amp that comes with a head amp wouldn't that be the best choice for a head amp since it was basically built for that kind of amp this is a very good question but there are many parts to it guitar amp head are seperate from the cabnets speakers for a couple of reasons high wattage heads are more so designed to be taken on the road and amp heads are easier to carry then a huge heavy all in one unit second professional amp heads and cabinets can be interchangable for example maybe you like the quality of a marshal amp head but the sound quality of a mesa cabinet this can be done easily and third is cost a amp head almost always has a seperate price tag from the cabinet this allows you to do the second thing i mentioned and it makes the retailer a lot more money floor units or the all in one amps with the speakers built in are to us guitar players more of a means to practice without lugging around a huge half or full stack amp setup although there are a few amps liek this that have been played thourgh a lot for small venues such as the glorious fender twin amp heads work much in the way that a built in amp works in a all in one unit does the only differences is the power they draw and the amp circuit used to amplify the signal but these can amplify using one of many technologies such as all tube or all solid state or hybrid solid states use mosfit transistors to amplify sound tubes use ac bias and hybrids use a little bit of both Marshall Amplification Electronic amplifier Instrument amplifier Operational amplifier Audiophile Electric guitar Vacuum tube Transistor Loudspeaker Guitar Oscilloscope Electrophysiology Central processing unit Kenwood Electronics Kirk Hammett Solar power Synthesizer Computer Valve sound Amplifier Bicycle lighting Effects unit Transformer Phonograph Clarinet John Myung XML Subwoofer Fender Telecaster Digital circuit Ampeg CPU design Semiconductor device Circuit design MP3 Electronic organ Bicycle frame Mesa Boogie Adam Jones Pump It Up Harmonica Optical fiber MOSFET Hard disk Microphone Electric motor Integrated circuit Modem Diode Violin PlayStation 3 DIY audio Extreme Programming Stevie Ray Vaughan Vacuum cleaner Mountain bike Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Jack plug Double bass Jimi Hendrix Time Out of Mind Microeconomics Xbox Floppy disk Paintball Electrical wiring Thermal power station Decibel Strap-on dildo Poker jargon Impedance matching High-voltage direct current Drill bit Gramophone record Inflation Tire Bipolar junction transistor High fidelity DVD Spacecraft propulsion Analog computer Carburetor Car audio Eddie Van Halen Logic gate Dynamic random access memory BS 1363 Sport utility vehicle Trombone Printed circuit board Relay Atari 8-bit family Table saw
