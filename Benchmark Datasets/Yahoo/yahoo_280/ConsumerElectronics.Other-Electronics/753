i need a schematic diagram of a power supply for a yukon mini osprey night sight power supply is failing i think at a component level but as its all incased in resin or silicon i need to scratch build or get a replacement it makes no difference what make or number it is any scematic will do it makes no difference what make or number it is any schematic will do hold on i think i have got one in the garage is that a mark or mark Solar cell Operational amplifier Dislocation Circuit design Capacitor Transistor Oscilloscope Electrophysiology Central processing unit Thermal power station Logic gate Electronics Apple Macintosh Labour economics Cooper Car Company Airsoft Printed circuit board Slide rule Bipolar junction transistor Vacuum tube Transformer Field-programmable gate array CPU cache Miniature figure Coriolis effect Plastic Biochemistry Hawker Hart Antenna (radio) Quito Amplitude modulation Universal Serial Bus Railgun Circuit diagram Electric motor MOSFET B-24 Liberator TGV Seismic retrofit Menstrual cup Silicon PaX Combinatorial species Billiards Bong Galileo spacecraft White Pass and Yukon Route Battle of Crete Casting Alaska Highway Evidence of evolution IPod nano CMOS Resistor Monopsony Breadboard Programmable logic controller DIY audio Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Soldering Atomic spectral line Benzene Wardenclyffe Tower Inflation Yukon Microphone Resin NVIDIA Electrical network Special relativity Optical fiber Berlin Paint Fusion power Monopoly Sten Reliability engineering Provinces and territories of Canada Fuse (electrical) Tube map Semiconductor device RISC Solar power Dishwasher Contact lens Battery electric vehicle Aggregate demand Dundas Square Operation Barbarossa Outpost 2 Electronic design automation Solar power satellite Diode Kilroy was here Switched-mode power supply ITER Nuclear power Parliament of Canada Redundant array of independent disks Overclocking
