can someone further explain the insert i o on a mixing board in re small mixing board behringer ch can anyone explain to me a good way of using the insert i o on a mixing board i understand that it can be used in conjuction with a eq or compressor but right now we have a computer hooked into the insert i o and it sounds good in fact if its hooked into the line in jack it doesn't work please a little explanation goes a long way thanks the insert point on a mixing console is use prodominantly to take a split copy of the signal for use with external dynamics and processing harware or to take a split and send it to other channels for double tracking and broad stereo panning the reason i beleive that the line in isn't working is because the signal strengh sent from you pc would be a speaker level signal not a line level signal the insert points are a pretty basic standard thing and there aint much you can do with them beyond that Mixing console Multitrack recording Microphone Jack plug SCART Gramophone record Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis TRS connector Compact disc Audio level compression Stereophonic sound Sound recording Digital audio workstation MP3 Modem Compact audio cassette Sound Blaster Original Amiga chipset Floppy disk Hangul Musical Instrument Digital Interface Electrophysiology Sound reinforcement system Bass guitar Color Theory of conduct Effects pedal Radio ZX Spectrum Redundant array of independent disks Magnetic cartridge Federal Standard 1037C Atari 2600 8 mm video format Windows 2000 Atari ST Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Speech recognition Laserdisc Commodore 64 DVD Remix Intelligent design System/34 Jet engine Bluetooth Telephone exchange Movie projector Poker jargon Effects unit Teach the Controversy Wind turbine Many-worlds interpretation Quicksort Atari 8-bit family Game Boy Universal Serial Bus Action potential Visual Basic Public-key cryptography S__CAM System/36 Super Audio CD Amstrad CPC God Emperor of Dune AmigaOS Data compression Hash table XML Blackjack Karaoke Expert system D-subminiature Central processing unit Digital audio broadcasting Linked list Cyberspace Computer role-playing game Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Morse Code Microeconomics Extreme Programming Non-native pronunciations of English Public domain PHP Seismometer Sound effect Intelligent design movement Headphones Cognitive science Bad Wolf Nintendo Entertainment System Scientology beliefs and practices Prisoner's dilemma TGV IPod Magnet
