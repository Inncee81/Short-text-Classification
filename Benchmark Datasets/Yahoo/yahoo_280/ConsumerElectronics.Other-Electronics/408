who to seek for diagnosing repairing vintage stereo unit's sound months ago i inherited grundig fleetwood stereo system made sometime around the early to mid s in germany from my great grandmother who passed away in december it has an am fm radio a turntable for s s s as well as many sound preset buttons including an option for stereo sound and the speakers line the bottom portion of the unit the physical unit itself is in amazing condition and has not been used in the last years for anything other than a table decoration piece i was amazed to see that the radio still works on the stereo producing very clear reception however the sound fades in and out during play it starts off strong clear and loud then slowly fades out only to slowly reach its original volume again after several seconds we have not be successful in getting the turntable to work but i am more concerned with sound who do you think i should seek to look into this problem for me and potentially repair it so the stereo can be enjoyed again any decent audio repair shop should be able to help you if the unit hasn't been on for over years some of the capacitors may have dried out or the electrolytic may have deformed it's probably a tube unit and some of the tubes could be showing their age switch contacts could have oxidized over the years and need cleaning the turntable has rubber drive parts that have probably deteriorated Gramophone record Phonograph Audiophile Radio Oscilloscope Microphone Compact disc Capacitor plague Disc jockey Stereophonic sound Synthesizer IPod Loudspeaker 8-track cartridge Arcade cabinet Sound recording De Lorean DMC-12 Receiver (radio) Vacuum tube Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Toyota Prius Digital audio broadcasting Violin FM broadcasting N-Gage Pinball Floppy disk Transistor High fidelity Car audio Bass guitar Tony Banks (musician) Computer Guitar Multitrack recording Battery (electricity) Explosive material Bong Tire USS Thresher (SS-200) Wheel of Fortune Nintendo Entertainment System Movie projector Laserdisc Mixing console Urinary incontinence Atari ST Prank flash Central processing unit Capacitor Jack plug Digital audio workstation USS Trigger (SS-237) Transformer Unusual types of gramophone record Sound effect Switch USS Sea Devil (SS-400) Wood Phonograph cylinder Thermal power station Game Boy Circuit design Dairy Seismic retrofit Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tesla coil Electric motor Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Mercury Atlas 6 Panasonic House music USS Tunny (SS-282) DIY audio Apple IIGS The Beatles discography Harp ZX Spectrum USS Whale (SS-239) Sega Saturn The Jam Effects pedal Upholstery Rod Stewart Heinkel He 112 Ceramics Japanese toilet 8 mm video format John Cage Sound Blaster Electronic amplifier MiniDisc Titanium Echo chamber Nakamichi Walkman Sampling (music) Electric guitar
