lamp keeps burning light bulbs can it be fixed i purchased a lamp that is used for photo lighting it uses day light v bulbs and it has worked fine for about a year now out of no where the lamp now burns the light bulbs does this sound like something that could be fixed the manufacturer does not make replacement parts for this item or so i was told so i trying to see if there is anything that i can do thanks so much a lamp itself cannot 'add' voltage to circuit although a high amperage draw appliance such as an air conditioner on the same circut may be giving you a local brown out condition a qualified electrician can measure this for you something else may be at play here maybe really really cheap bulbs or significant vibration while the lamp is on if you can't track the cause just add a dimmer for the lamp only and keep it set slightly below max Incandescent light bulb Compact fluorescent lamp Light-emitting diode Bicycle lighting Lighting Fluorescent lamp Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Stage lighting Dimmer Electrodeless lamp X10 (industry standard) Vacuum tube Street light Mercury-vapor lamp Neon lamp Split phase Transistor Thomas Edison Transformer Relay Photometry (optics) Solar power Strap-on dildo Color temperature Electrophysiology Thermal power station Current (electricity) Carburetor Diode BS 1363 Switch Welding Fuse (electrical) Glass Three-phase electric power Bus models used in New York City Transit High-voltage direct current George Westinghouse Lojban Daytime running lamp Christmas lights Light Railway signal Thermostat Ultraviolet Alternating current Traffic light Loudspeaker Cannabis cultivation Automotive lighting Solar cell Operational amplifier Piezoelectricity Helicopter Oscilloscope Series and parallel circuits Rotor machine Kerosene lamp E85 Sodium vapor lamp Battery (electricity) Electrical wiring (UK) Switched-mode power supply Xenon flash lamp Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Fan (implement) Photoelectric effect Enigma machine Spectroscopy Railway signalling Security lighting Light switch Spectrophotometry Circuit design Movie projector Volt Thermocouple Color Irving Langmuir Spark plug Joseph Swan Service life Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.
