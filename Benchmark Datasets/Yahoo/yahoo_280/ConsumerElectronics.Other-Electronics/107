what is a good heater for a bedroom apartment i know i know it's like degrees outside and i am asking about heaters anyway i live in an apartment where the heat is not controlled by the tenent can anyone recommend one that they have tried or heard good things about i really don't want to use a kerosene heater i'm no expert but i've heard the ones that are oil based non flammable i believe and am quite sure of are the safest and most efficient the idea is electricity heats the oil to the temperature you set the thermostat at and then the electricity turns off when it hits the temperature you set the thermostat at the oil is still the same temperature and radiates this heat out till it drops below the setting then the electricity turns back on and the process repeats itself again this keeps the heater from going on and off all the time which is annoying and uses a lot more electricity i would go to a store and ask an expert about this form of heater i hope i'm close to being right or i just wasted a whole bunch of cartridge ink your time and mine Thermostat Furnace HVAC Refrigerator Carburetor Fossil fuel power plant Autonomous building Diesel engine Process control Nuclear power Portable stove Vacuum tube Temperature Energy development Alcohol fuel Thermal power station Heat Explosive material Transformer Torpedo Renewable energy Slow cooker Kerosene Spark plug Fire Water Nuclear reactor Soldering iron Ocean thermal energy conversion Town gas Alternative fuel Phase change heat pump Turbocharger Kitchen Air conditioning Fuel cell Gas turbine Hysteresis Washing machine Internal combustion engine Heating element Motor oil Petroleum Coal Nuclear weapon design Future energy development Pebble bed reactor Nuclear fusion Chevrolet Corvair Internal ballistics Ceramics Power station Water heater Solar cell Waterbed Ironing Incandescent light bulb High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program Vacuum Negative feedback Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Steam engine Hydrogen Thermocouple Radiator Sodium Gas absorption refrigerator Wood fuel Carbon Electrical wiring Dry cleaning Deep lake water cooling Solar panel Sewage treatment Water (molecule) Sun Peltier-Seebeck effect Oxygen sensor Aquarium Spacecraft propulsion Optical fiber Hydropower Nuclear power phase-out Space manufacturing Plastic Ammonia Combined cycle Tank Cogeneration Ford Ranger EV Control system Natural gas Fan death
