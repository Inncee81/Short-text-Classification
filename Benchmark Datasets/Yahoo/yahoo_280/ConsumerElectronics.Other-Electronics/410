do surge protectors have to be replaced every years is there any truth to the rumor that surge protectors should be replaced every years surge protectors use metal oxide varistors to clamp the surge they are only good for one surge of damaging capacity the power strip will continue to work beyond the one shot mov i wouldnt wait years if you have a severe storm and the lights flicker i would consider replacement espcially the el cheapo units as the prior said with no indicator if you have anything that has been damaged by lightning or surges replace all of them in your home surge protectors are not lightning arrestors they are designed for small to moderate electrical spikes from the electrical companty in america the voltage is volts this can fluctuate from to most surge protectors kick in around to a direct hit by lightning can not be stopped by anything you can just hope to reduce the amount of damage inflicted Lightning rod Circuit design Varistor Electricity Power strip Lightning Diode Welding Fuse (electrical) Volt Lightning safety Transistor Hurricane Rita Incandescent light bulb Spark plug Battery (electricity) GunBound Ceramics Arc welding Fluorescent lamp Electricity meter Alternating current High-voltage hazards Nickel-cadmium battery Electrical wiring Vacuum tube Oscilloscope 2003 North America blackout Wind power Rayden Disaster Radiation hardening Lineman (occupation) Electrical generator Nuclear power Hurricane Wilma Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Circuit breaker Electrophysiology Gas metal arc welding Aircraft carrier Items in the Metroid series 1995-1999 North Indian cyclone seasons High-voltage direct current Petroleum Solar cell Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Semiconductor device Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Diablo II CMOS 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Capacitor Electricity distribution Ice hockey Terminal ballistics Overvoltage Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Quake III Arena Impedance matching Light-emitting diode Thermostat Electroshock gun Electrical resistance Overhead powerline Hurricane Katrina effects by region MOSFET Sacrifice (computer game) Wild ARMs 2 E85 Hall effect Light switch Pok__mon Abilities Pebble bed reactor Antenna (radio) Turbofan Sewage treatment Variable Frequency Drive Transmitter Fossil fuel power plant Jet engine George Westinghouse Decibel Electric shock Maverick (Mega Man) Electric chair Tropical cyclone Uninterruptible power supply Airsoft Potentiometer Akuma (Street Fighter) Surge (comics) Corrosion Lead-acid battery
