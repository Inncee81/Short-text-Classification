my central air run capacitor went out it was volts microfarads can i use a capacitor with v mf anyways bottom line will a volt micro farad work it takes a volt micro farad capacitor its hot and i want to know if this will work till tommarrow ac motor capacitors in general you may make substitutions for oil filled run capacitors on permanent split capacitor psc motors by going to the next higher standard or stock microfarad rating for example a microfarad capacitor may be substituted for a microfarad capacitor even in an emergency situation you should never substitute a capacitor with a lower capacitance value or voltage rating for the proper capacitor otherwise you run the very real risk of permanent motor damage another possibility when substituting capacitors is to wire them together in parallel to add microfarad ratings for example you may wire a microfarad capacitor in parallel with a microfarad capacitor to achieve the equivalent capacitance of a microfarad capacitor you also may use the same procedures when making substitutions for the start capacitor on a motor be sure you maintain the correct voltage rating for all capacitors when combining caps to avoid damage or personal injury you should always use the exact replacement capacitor whenever possible a little extra advice never discharge a capacitor using a screwdriver or other dead short method instead use a ohm w or higher power resistor or a watt light bulb to slowly and safely drain the capacitor's residual charge using a light bulb thread the bulb into either a pigtail socket like the type used with temporary light strings or use a handlamp aka drop light with a homemade pigtail cord end or plug the male plug into a homemade pigtail cord fitted with a standard a parallel blade female plug on the pigtail end use either a pair of heavy duty insulated alligator clips or inch female quick disconnects to connect the lamp assembly to the capacitor p s when you purchase the proper replacement caps buy an extra start and run cap for just such emergency situations you may also want to consider purchasing a replacement relay and overload as well these parts may be available as a kit Battery (electricity) Electrical element Transformer Incandescent light bulb Series and parallel circuits Electrophysiology Fluorescent lamp Tesla coil Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Electric motor Action potential Vacuum tube Volt Resistor Impedance Diode Light-emitting diode Transistor Thermal power station Capacitance Electrical generator Operational amplifier Universal Serial Bus Spark plug Bicycle lighting Capacitor plague Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Low-pass filter Circuit breaker Oscilloscope Electric power transmission Voltage source Three-phase electric power X10 (industry standard) Membrane potential Loudspeaker Solar cell E85 Motor oil Transmission line Jet engine Strap-on dildo Impedance matching Internal ballistics Toyota Prius Electricity Headlight High-voltage hazards Lineman (occupation) RC circuit Phase-locked loop Screw Carburetor Electrical wiring AC power Electronic amplifier Electrostatic discharge Christmas lights Welding Lawn mower Enigma machine Residual-current device Tire Power factor correction Gas metal arc welding Relay Lightning Electrical resistance Decibel Street light CMOS Split phase Lighting RLC circuit Phantom power Alternating current TGV MOSFET Intravenous therapy Fusor Resonance Light switch Printed circuit board Coaxial cable Rail terminology Central processing unit Commodore 64 Explosive material Computer
