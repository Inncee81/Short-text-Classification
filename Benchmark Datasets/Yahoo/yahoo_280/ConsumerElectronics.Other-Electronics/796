how can i connect two pair coaxial cables via a fiber optic cable in between to use it for audio signal i want to connect coaxial cable telephone lines by a fiber optic cable how can i do that and what kind of interface am i going to use each coaxial is pair we need more details to properly answer this question if you are saying that you have two pair cables that you need to interconnect using a fiber optic cable then i would interpret this to mean that you need to transport separate audio signals over the fiber this could probably be done over one or more pairs of single mode fiber using multiplexers but it would be incredibly expensive give more details number of audio signals bandwidth of signal distance signals will be carried etc and perhaps we can give a better answer Ethernet Optical fiber Coaxial cable Cable television Modem ITU-T Universal Serial Bus Asynchronous Transfer Mode AES/EBU Telephone Bluetooth S/PDIF T-carrier Synchronous optical networking Telephone exchange Wavelength-division multiplexing Submarine communications cable Digital Subscriber Line Musical Instrument Digital Interface GSM services Federal Standard 1037C Transformer RS-232 Integrated Services Digital Network Television Telegraphy Digital audio Radio Public Switched Telephone Network Impedance matching Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Internet IP Multimedia Subsystem Action potential Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Passive optical network Cable modem Oscilloscope RCA connector Transmission line S-Video Satellite television Compact disc Electric power transmission DVD Internet protocol suite Serial communications Time-division multiplexing Dispersion (optics) Movie projector High-voltage direct current Digital Visual Interface Decibel 10-gigabit Ethernet FireWire Amateur radio NSA encryption systems Light-emitting diode VHS Bandwidth Twisted pair High-definition television Audiophile WiMAX Power line communication Signalling System 7 ATSC Telephone tapping Voice over IP Digital circuit Freeview Fiber distributed data interface Laserdisc MPEG-2 Transistor Mouse (computing) Rail terminology High fidelity Computer network NTSC USB flash drive Alcatel Port (computing) Set-top box Semaphore (communication) Electronic amplifier Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Distortion Communications satellite SCART Fibre Channel Brain Advanced Technology Attachment TIA-568A/B FM broadcasting
