frigidaire ice maker not working properly i just bought this ice maker a week ago it won't dump the ice on its own i have to raise and lower the bar in order for it to dump the ice and even then there are only three ice cubes coming out instead of the it is supposed to dump is there some way i can adjust it myself or do i need to take it back help first check to make sure enough water is getting in at the beginning of a cycle the bar is normally a shut off so raising it and leaving it raised won't produce ice Sea level rise Ice cream Violin N.W.A Dishwasher Thermal power station Internal combustion engine Neighbours Poker jargon Backgammon New York Giants Coffee The Apprentice 2 Turbocharger Glacier Volleyball Ice age M-209 Microeconomics Bicycle Ice hockey Entropy Asset Little Ice Age EastEnders Short selling Carbon dioxide Paleoclimatology Genericized trademark Gatorade Solar variation Andrew Dice Clay Climate change Futurama (TV series - season 4) Rhine San Francisco 49ers GLOCK Ice Sea ice UK Singles Chart Winter Olympic Games Oral contraceptive Wal-Mart Betting (poker) Effects of global warming Transformer Yosemite National Park Barbershop (film) Cacha__a Mount St. Helens United States Postal Service Cello Toyota Prius Ice Cube Tofu Chess terminology Mozilla Firefox Espresso machine Fossil fuel power plant Hard disk Champagne (beverage) Town gas 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Cider Summit Series Scuba set Ozone depletion Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Peter Shilton Hip hop collaborations Frederic Thesiger, 1st Baron Chelmsford Magnetic core memory SMPTE color bars Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Tea Blue screen of death Sealab 2021 Blackjack Eddie Murphy Fighting in ice hockey Water (molecule) Martini cocktail Phase (matter) Space opera in Scientology doctrine Money Global cooling Pollution Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Ice core Something Awful Forums Free trade Refrigerator Shaggy dog story Motorcycle MAME Ozone hole Sin City Ice T Iditarod Steam engine
