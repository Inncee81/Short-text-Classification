after an air bed is inflated using d batteries how many more inflations will they provide for i just got an air bed and i now know that one the bed is pumped completely the batteries wont be used until i want to reinflate again how many more times will the d sized batteries inflate depends on how big a bed and the type of batteries used one thing to keep in mind is that each time you inflate the bed it will take longer than the previous time there will come a point when it takes too long for you to want to wait for a full inflate beyond that there will come a point where the batteries will only turn the fan so fast such as a point where the fan turns but won't add any pressure this may be at a point that is too low a pressure for a comfortable bed Thermal power station Thermostat Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Strap-on dildo Diving regulator Jet engine Diving suit Energy development Ford Ranger EV Inflation Personal flotation device Battery electric vehicle Action potential Explosive material Internal combustion engine Mars Exploration Rover Paintball Nickel-cadmium battery Car handling Battery (electricity) Hubert H.
