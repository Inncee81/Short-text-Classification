how can you tell whether you need a battery or if the charger is faulty for a power tool great question i'll say this first batteries will die out way more often before the chargers ever do that being said let's try to figure this out you can try charging that same battery with a different charger that you may have in the house that is from another power tool the conditions that need to be met in order for another charger to qualify as good enough for that battery is that the battery end of the charger must fit the battery obvious the output voltage a number followed by v or volts printed on the primary charger must match that on the secondary testing charger the output current a number followed by a or amps printed on the primary charger must match that on the secondary testing charger if the battery receives a full charge from that testing charger then we know it is the primary charger is faulty if it doesn't then of course the battery is the problem now if you don't have another charger that matches the above criteria then i suggest banking on the fact that batteries almost always die before chargers and buying a new battery even if it turns out to be the charger if it can't fully charge the new battery at least you'll have a new second battery that can come in very handy i hope that helps Battery (electricity) Nickel-cadmium battery Nickel metal hydride Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Transformer Volt Battery electric vehicle Ford Ranger EV Electric boat Circuit design Hybrid vehicle San Diego Chargers Oscilloscope Hubble Space Telescope Operational amplifier CMOS Universal Serial Bus PlayStation Portable Electrophysiology Electronic amplifier Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Solar cell Three-phase electric power Lead-acid battery Wind power Incandescent light bulb Vacuum tube Toyota Prius Digital circuit Turbocharger GED Electrical generator Nuclear fusion Wind turbine Diode Airsoft Cincinnati Bengals Dodge Charger Electricity Output impedance Impedance matching Capacitor Memory effect Welding power supply Liquid crystal display Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Baghdad Battery Voltage source Headlight Electroshock gun Action potential Dan Fouts Laptop Solar panel Decibel New York Giants Oakland Raiders Lithium ion battery Dosimeter Renewable energy Welding Thermostat RS-232 Lithium ion polymer battery Hall effect Relay Thermal power station Blasting cap Monetary policy Extreme Programming Windmill Jumpstart 3rd Grade Fluorescent lamp Direct current Life insurance Telephone exchange New York Jets Electrical element Spark plug Solar car 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines MOSFET Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Pittsburgh Steelers Negligible Autism Phantom power Ampere Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Compiler optimization Loudspeaker Membrane potential Radio controlled car Education in the People's Republic of China ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity
