suggest me which dvd player is good but the cost should be around if you have an hdtv you should consider hd dvd and or blu ray they are true hd formats unlike dvd they go beyond the picture quality in hd cable and sattelite channels so far blu ray has more support and most likely to win the format so go with blu ray the cheapest blu ray player is the sony playstation it's you don't have to use it for gaming but there is other multimedia features on it that don't have anything to do with gaming like store songs on the hdd or you could go for a sony dvd player for very cheap at http www amazon com if you even have a hdtv but still on a budget there's one for that upconverts dvds to near hd just as good picture quality as hd cable and satellite channels i hope this helps you make the right buying decision DVD PlayStation Portable PlayStation 2 Blu-ray Disc Digital television Xbox Television Laserdisc Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 3 Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Sega Dreamcast GamePark Handheld game console TiVo Cable television Warez Xbox 360 MPEG-2 Sony Nintendo GameCube Computer and video games MP3 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC ATI Technologies Home Box Office Sound Blaster Video Video codec Video CD Columbia Pictures Digital cinematography Videotape Video game music Gran Turismo (game) Blu Cantrell Super Video CD Nintendo DS Dolby Digital Videocassette recorder Digital rights management British Sky Broadcasting Nintendo 64 Copy protection SCART Sony Computer Entertainment Dolby Laboratories Sega VHS S-VHS Compact disc Delta Goodrem Resident Evil (video game) Pornography Fahrenheit 9/11 Camcorder Ayumi Hamasaki Amstrad CPC Regional lockout Moving Picture Experts Group 8 mm video format Nintendo Betacam Musical Instrument Digital Interface Walkman Console wars PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Digital cinema Digital video recorder Girls Aloud HD DVD ITunes Music Store Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DualDisc BBC ATSC Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Digital photography Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMIX Console game DVB Streaming media 24 (television) Final Fantasy XI Secure Digital card Windows Vista PolyGram Digital audio broadcasting Macrovision Advanced Audio Coding Final Fantasy IX Amazon.com Machinima NTSC Outsourcing MiniDisc Enhanced remake Anamorphic widescreen
