is vac like volts im going on a trip and taking xbox should vac be enough to power it sense it runs at volts and the invertor is watts so it should work in theory it should work but how well it works will be another question first of all you can plug the xbox into it but most liekly the xbox will pull more then watts and you can garuantee it wont be enough if you are talkign about an xbox also most inverters are can not produce true sine wave output meaning the ac current is slightly distorted some devices don't take well to this that is why inverters are most commonly used for simple devices like power drills and lamps and sometimes the occasional tv only way to see if it works is to try it first and see if it pops your fuse if it doesn't then enjoy the gaming also hard drives are very prone to damage from small shock such as holes in the road this is something you may want to consider Volt Transformer Three-phase electric power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Loudspeaker Universal Serial Bus Inverter (electrical) Switched-mode power supply Xbox Fluorescent lamp Diode Electric motor Relay Circuit design Fuse (electrical) Electronic amplifier Operational amplifier Vacuum cleaner Xbox 360 Decibel Power (physics) Electrical wiring Game controller Alternating current Vacuum tube Residual-current device Modchip Light-emitting diode Tesla coil BS 1363 Battery (electricity) SCART Mouse (computing) Impedance matching USB flash drive CMOS Solar cell Bubble Bobble Nintendo GameCube Oscilloscope Drill bit Transistor Carburetor Spark plug X10 (industry standard) Trigonometric function Electronic Arts Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Capacitor Professional wrestling throws High-voltage direct current Super Nintendo Entertainment System Horsepower Variable Frequency Drive Professional wrestling holds Synthesizer Pump It Up Directed-energy weapon Laser Headlight Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Piezoelectricity Seismometer Nintendo Entertainment System Dimmer Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Tire Floppy disk Logic gate Electrical generator Strap-on dildo Analog-to-digital converter Phase-locked loop Solar panel Computer forensics Ford Crown Victoria Audiophile Current source Hall effect Optical fiber Neon lamp Goatse.cx Spark gap Resistor Armored Core Energy development Power strip Lightning Tractor Powerbomb Audio power Bethesda Softworks Hand grenade Power supply Computer and video games Screw Circuit breaker PlayStation 2
