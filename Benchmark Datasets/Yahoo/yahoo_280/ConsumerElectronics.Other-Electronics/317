can someone explain whats a pnp and a npn pnp and npn indicate the polarity of transistors a good way to remember it is it indicates forward bias negative on collector and emitter and positive on base forward biases both diodes the symbol for npn has the emitter arrow pointing out which would be the same for the internal diode pnp is inward mostly the use of either depends on the design and application a good explanation is here http www kpsec freeuk com components tran htm Transistor Bipolar junction transistor Operational amplifier Diode Current source Vacuum tube Light-emitting diode Logic gate IC power supply pins P-n junction Linear regulator Voltage source Zener diode Field effect transistor Photodiode Semiconductor Electric motor Cathode Emitter coupled logic Transconductance Transistor-transistor logic Colpitts oscillator Laser diode Organic light-emitting diode Solar cell Liquid crystal display Tunnel diode Integrated circuit Gallium Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Anode Rectifier Vector (spatial) Carbon nanotube Voltage regulator Cognitive science Electrical network Web crawler Federal Standard 1037C Peltier-Seebeck effect Central processing unit Hysteresis Thyristor Web service Politics of Puerto Rico Sputtering CPU design Electronic components Windows 2000 Schottky diode Water (molecule) Negative resistance Inflation Black Microwave Uniform Resource Locator USS Voyager (NCC-74656) Teen Girl Squad Quantum mechanics Transducer Expert system Logic families Circuit design Binary numeral system Valve amplifier Epoxy Uniform Resource Identifier Hardware random number generator Coordinates (mathematics) Architecture of Windows 2000 Entropy Phase-shift keying High-voltage direct current Photoelectric effect Mouse (computing) Data clustering Filename extension WebSphere Electrical engineering Nitrogen Arbitration Phase-locked loop Radiation hardening Special relativity Electrode Antenna (radio) Action potential Direct current Reincarnation Common Unix Printing System Plasma cosmology Germanium Amplitude modulation Corona discharge Microphone Gas tungsten arc welding Car handling
