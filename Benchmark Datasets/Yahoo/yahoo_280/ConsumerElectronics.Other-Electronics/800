what speed is the satalite connection with sky what is the transfer rate also is it much more with hd channels the normal channels are split into speeds some have a rate of mb s and others have a rate of mb s a lot of broadband connections are between and mb s and some are mb s so sky is pretty fast it has to be fast as sky uses mpeg which is the same as dvd so it's a lot of data to transfer not too sure about hd but i think the main rate is mb s so it's slightly faster also hd uses mpeg with a much bigger frame size which is why a regular sky box won't handle a hd channel Modem Redundant array of independent disks MP3 MPEG-2 Broadband Cable television Nintendo GameCube High-definition television IEEE 802.11 Broadband Internet access Asynchronous Transfer Mode Fast bowling Digital video recorder DVD DV Movie projector H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Speed of light Floppy disk General Packet Radio Service Streaming media SCSI Serial communications Computer bus Compact disc Digital television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Original Amiga chipset Xbox Universal Serial Bus RS-232 TiVo Congestion control Sega Saturn TGV FireWire Super Video CD Amstrad CPC Skype Gameplay of StarCraft ATSC Bluetooth Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Digital Subscriber Line Power line communication Freeview Satellite television Transmission Control Protocol Laserdisc Cheating in Counter-Strike Advanced Technology Attachment RISC Infrared Data Association Quake III Arena Ethernet Loudspeaker CPU design Computer Throughput Traffic contract ITU-T Pump It Up T-carrier Secure Digital card Sky Digital PlayStation 3 Dolby Digital Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Orders of magnitude (data) DOCSIS CD-ROM VHS Betacam Moving Picture Experts Group Time-division multiplexing Integrated Services Digital Network Communications satellite Oscilloscope Austar Frame relay Internet Relay Chat Overclocking Blu-ray Disc High-speed rail Telegraphy PlayStation Portable Computer and video games SCART Warez NTSC INMOS Transputer Transistor Sun Digital photography Jet engine Dial-up access Comparison of latency and throughput Dynamic random access memory Diablo II
