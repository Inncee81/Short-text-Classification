i have bass problems with my sound card too much bass from what i gather i have a legacy audo soundcard i don't know what version or model the last time it worked fine was a week ago now the bass is incredibly high i tried listening to cds bell whistle wav files mp s etc not only is the bass so high that it blew out my headphones into making rattling noises the treble is waaaaay down i can't even hear the singing it just sounds like some ghetto honda is rattling down the street boom boom boom my windows volume control are set to low bass my windows media equalizer is set to low bass in fact if i equalize it to have low bass the singing is nothing but a muffled uncomprehendible sound anyone have any ideas do soundcards just crap out like this well i dunno about legacy soundcard but i use creative external sound card i have different set of volume control the basic windows volue doesn't do anything you have to find your sound card volume setting and try to adjust that and sice you use headphone it can't be a blown subwoffer so check the soundcard settings if you can't find 'em search for 'device manager' and it should be listed under sound which you can right click and go under properties and change the settings IPod Musical Instrument Digital Interface Audiophile Windows 2000 Loudspeaker Sound Blaster Timpani Sound card Bluetooth Headphones Vorbis Creative Zen Windows XP SonicStage Yu-Gi-Oh!
