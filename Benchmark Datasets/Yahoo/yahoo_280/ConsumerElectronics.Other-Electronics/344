how do you order channels on comcast digital cable ok technically my question is a lot more specific than that i am a big fan of military shows on the discovery channel i like the show combat zone in particular whose episodes are many times available for free via on demand however i was interested in watching the military channel when i go to the channel it says i am not authorized to watch it leading me to believe i must order the channel it says hit info button for ordering information i hit the info button and it comes to a screen describing the show that's currently airing on the channel however none of the options presented are related to ordering the channel or unlocking it if anyone has had this problem in the past or to those who just know how to solve it please help thanks in advance thanks for the answers though i don't really get the relevance of the first one the general consensus seems to be to call comcast and order the channel s however does this cost anything and if so how much you don't unlock it you call comcast and ask to buy the package that the military channel comes with sorry as of now you can not just buy channel at a time Cable television Bluetooth Comcast Television in the United States Wheel of Fortune TiVo Digital television Public-key cryptography $ale of the Century OLN Home Box Office High-definition television Mouse (computing) Xbox 360 Oscilloscope Hollywood Squares MTV2 Advance Wars: Dual Strike News program MMORPG MapleStory DVD AmigaOS MTV Jams Media in Canada Dish Network Nintendo GameCube ITV Pump It Up Macromedia Flash Let's Make a Deal Whose Line Is It Anyway?
