puppy hardwood floors i just bought a condo with hardwood floors throughout i am worried about my puppy scratching the floors with her nails i can only throw down so many rugs so i am wondering is there anything else i can do to protect the floors i do clip her nails quite frequently but even doing that once a week they're still long enough to do damage to the floors you can have her nails trimmed at the groomer and ask for them to be filed you can also take her on walks on the sidewalk the sidewalk will naturally file and dull the nail another solution that i've heard of is this plastic rubber nail tip that goes over top of the nail they just go over the nail are not painful they are used on dogs and cats for purposes just like this i forget what they are called you may want to ask your vet about them my understanding is that they are somewhat easy to apply it's just a rubber nail tip that goes over their nail they are relatively inexpensive i wish i could recall the name of them for you they don't cause any discomfort to the pet what so ever call your vet or local pet store they should be able to point you in the right direction as to how to obtain and apply them good luck Guinea pig Cat Stairway Housebreaking Knife Fancy rat Garfield Nine Inch Nails Nail (anatomy) Ferret Horseshoe Milton H.
