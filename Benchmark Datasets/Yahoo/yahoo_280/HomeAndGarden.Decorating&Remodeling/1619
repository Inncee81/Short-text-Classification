what is the best way to wipe clean a wall that has flat paint without leaving scuff or water marks i am trying to keep my new apartment with it's cheap powder like paint job in it's tip top shape can someone tell me what is the best technique for getting rid of a smudge on the wall without having to paint over it sorry to be the bearer of bad news but no matter what you use to wash flat paint it will always show in fact it seems as if your landlord used either primer or ceiling paint to paint the whole flat to save money which is a joke if you don't want to paint over the smudge then i suggest you hang a really nice picture or mirror or something over the smudge because no matter what the minute you put water on flat paint and rub it will show oh and whoever said to use a magic eraser is soooo wrong they have bleach in them and are very harsh for flat paint Sundial Brush Professional wrestling slang Casting Menstrual cup Drawing Drill bit Glass Friends Tile Characters in the Smurfs Leaf Sento Francis Bacon (painter) Japanese tea ceremony Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Paint Printmaking Painting Handloading Car washing techniques Violin Surrealist techniques Avenue Q Diamond Upholstery Wrigley Field Wilton House Theory of conduct Pastel Anus Dial M for Murder Dishwashing Toilet paper Opportunity rover Internal ballistics Wood carving Volleyball Have I Got News For You Irish Houses of Parliament Tattoo Manicure Married... with Children Great Teacher Onizuka Magical objects in Harry Potter Russian Orthodox Church Ocean's Twelve Dry cleaning Social rule Wallpaper group Laundry Craps Glossary of climbing terms Paul Is Dead Bassoon Arthur Laffer Raphael Rooms Meta-reference Kitchen Brewery The Last Supper (Leonardo) 1957 World Series Pulp Fiction Washing machine Diagon Alley The Cure Typewriter Shen Gong Wu Black Books Phoebe Halliwell Blenheim Palace Link (Legend of Zelda) Luck Eastern Orthodox Church Stone Age M.C.
