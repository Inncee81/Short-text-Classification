how do i set up a small room with not much space in it should include a queens bed a tv nigtstands well there isn't much information here i assume it is a bedroom it is hard to tell how it should be set up without the dimensions or at least the shape of the room since i am not sure all of the details my first suggestion would be to avoid angles in other words don't angle any of the larger furniture into a corner sometimes it can provide interest in a room however if the room is quite small it can end up using too much space and making the room feel crowded or even confusing as if the piece doesn't belong i would also invest in a good sized mirror s which will create an illusion of a larger room some people feel that lighter paint can create an illusion of a larger space i don't think that is so common anymore i would try looking at hgtv com marthastewart com realsimple com or other websites that can offer some suggestions on how to create your space you'll want to draw the eye upward towards the celing which again creates the illusion that the room is larger than it actually is you can do this with mirrors or paintings or paint maybe even try looking at different magazines for ideas i also visit furniture stores or even model homes for the latest ideas maybe try making it warm cozy and intimate take advantage of the small space and most importantly be creative and put your personality into it good luck and have fun Upholstery Kitchen Wilton House Grace Cossington Smith Milton H.
