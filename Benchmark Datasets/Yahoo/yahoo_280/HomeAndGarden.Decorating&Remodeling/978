considering buying a painted stucco house the paint is chipping what is the best way to restore it for paint removal i've heard chemicals can damage the plant life grass and i wonder if wire brushing will make it look worse also i wonder what it'll look like after removing the paint if it'll need to be repainted again pressure wash the walls with at least a psi machine and use an oscillating tip to enhance the removal of old paint apply seal crete to the entire surface as it will not only be a good waterproofing sealer for bare masonry it'll stop chalking if any and aid in adhesion of your new coating chalking is evident if you rub your hand across and area of the wall and your palm has a white chalky type residue now i will advise you to paint your stucco with an elastomeric paint which is best for masonry applications just do not use elastomeric coatings on any wood where to buy your paints stay away from behr brand which is featured and sold at home depot behr is expensive in respect to it's poor coverage thus it's very labor intensive lowe's has an american tradition line by valspar which is a better choice in my personal professional opinion if you need any further help don't hesitate to ask best regards mike lonergan tradesprofessional inc http www tradesprofessional com Drill bit Stucco Masonry Brush Seismic retrofit Plastic Paint Knife Epoxy Printed circuit board Fan (implement) Shroud of Turin Gas metal arc welding Welding Tire Vacuum tube Upholstery Bulk vending Dairy Casting Mattress Climbing equipment Billiards Tattoo Hydraulic machinery Lighting Painting Dishwasher Drawing Manicure Adhesive Pottery McMansion Bong Thermal power station Deforestation Solar power Internal ballistics Aluminium Gilding Floppy disk Nuclear explosion Sewage treatment Spark plug Friction Transistor Screw Snooker Naval mine Solar cell Asbestos Ultraviolet Cookware and bakeware Wood carving Microphone Irrigation Drowning Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Lawn mower Straw-bale construction Light-emitting diode Electrophysiology Alcohol fuel Hearing aid Motorcycle Gypsy moth Combine (Half-Life 2) Hard disk Architecture of the California missions Airsoft Synthetic diamond Urinary incontinence Xanadu House Lionel Corporation Primer (paint) Fuel injection Arcade cabinet The Last Supper (Leonardo) Genericized trademark Graffiti Vulcanization Titanium Beast Wars Circuit design Terminal ballistics Electric motor Procrastination Bullet Shampoo Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Violin Diving suit GunBound Typewriter Stomach cancer Soldering Glossary of climbing terms
