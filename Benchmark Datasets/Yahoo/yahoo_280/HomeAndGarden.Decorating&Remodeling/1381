honestly what do you think of orange for a bedroom i'm redecorating my bedroom i'm and i'm thinking of painting the walls orange since i figure it'll go well with the wood floor and white trim ceiling and it's unique but i've heard people say that orange is a bad color for a bedroom is the color theory even true plus it might become obnoxious after a while even if it isn't neon so i was wondering what people's opinions were on what color i should paint my room if not orange than what color my room is sort of small any and all answers are appreciated thank you so much for answering although i think i'm probably the only girl who can't stand the color pink which leaves me in a rather tricky situation but thanks again orange is a warm color and in color theory books you will find it is a color that suggests lots of energy and movement it is a very stimulating color bold and perhaps suitable for a young girl such as yourself if you are naturally a very energetic person you should feel quite happy in an orange room if you are a more laid back person who likes to relax in his bedroom a less vivid color might be better if you want a good middle ground color go for a more faded subdued orange and make sure the other colors in the room aren't too bold that way a relaxing effect can still be achieved and as you get older your tastes might change a less vivid orange will adapt more easily to any new styles you might want to bring into the room in the future but there is nothing wrong with a bright orange room go with what makes you feel best and don't be afraid of color a bright room would also give you a great place for entertaining friends and would provide a warm friendly atmosphere Light-emitting diode Theory of conduct Color Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story Dragon Booster Wilton House Color theory Social rule Wood carving The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pitaten Meaning of life Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Goodness and value theory Kitchen Aesthetic Realism Buckingham Palace Futurama (TV series - season 5) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Lighting Grace Cossington Smith Blenheim Palace Hamster Sento Hiberno-English The Time Machine Transactional analysis Salad Fingers Fluorescent lamp One Tree Hill (TV series) Cliff Richard Taxi Driver Xanadu House Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sistine Chapel Upholstery Solar variation Enceladus (moon) Bocas del Toro Province Microeconomics The Marriage of Figaro The Death Gate Cycle Sin City The Ashlee Simpson Show Philosophical skepticism Global warming Russian joke Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Little Britain Pysanka Wassily Kandinsky Alexander Technique Phoebe Buffay's songs Comanche Menstrual cup Angel One (TNG episode) Ranma __ characters Rococo Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Chatsworth House Wonderland (McFly album) Scenes from a Memory The Wall Time Out of Mind Jumpstart 3rd Grade Ages of Myst Rei Ayanami Palladian architecture Novel Synaesthesia Humphrey Bogart Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Japanese tea ceremony Stereoscopy Milton H.
