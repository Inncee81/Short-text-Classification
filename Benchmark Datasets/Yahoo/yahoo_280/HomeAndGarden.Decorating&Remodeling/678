getting paint off wall paneling i painted my walls yellow today and it dripped onto the dark wood paneling on the bottom of the walls and on the door frame any suggestions on how to remove it if you painted today a bit of soap and water with a scrubber sponge should take most if not all of it off you may need a toothbrush as well if there is a bit of texture to the wood this is assuming you were using a latex paint if you were using oil you will need to substitute mineral spirits for the soap and water the sooner you get started the easier it will be to remove Paint Door Soap Sento Fire fighting Mattress Wood Menstrual cup Oil painting Brush Drill bit Icon Casting Car washing techniques Acrylic paint Soap bubble Shampoo Wok Wood carving De Lorean DMC-12 Plastic Molding (decorative) Textile manufacturing Condom Lionel Corporation Printmaking Light-frame construction Tooth enamel Painting Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Wilton House Fossil fuel power plant Chatsworth House Computer animation Bladderwort Seismic retrofit Intravenous therapy Vitreous enamel Flue gas desulfurization Toilet paper Titanium Tattoo Soda lime Opportunity rover Boat building Dinghy First aid Carlsbad Caverns National Park Timber framing Town gas School bus Dishwashing Tibetan people TeX Fan (implement) Window Veganism Cannabis cultivation Wassily Kandinsky Sprite (computer graphics) Dialysis Distribution board The Truman Show Olive oil Stucco Boy's surface Sulfuric acid Panel painting Asbestos Combine (Half-Life 2) Straw-bale construction Dundas Square Cruising (maritime) Scrubber Yellow Tommaso Masaccio Upholstery Punt (boat) Sandro Botticelli Bread Hand washing Soap opera Thermal depolymerization Hamster Liquid crystal Lighting Sodium Gansu Sponge Tofu Renewable energy Eastern Orthodox Church Drawing Aloe Elemental spirits (Seiken Densetsu) Strap-on dildo Vinegar St. Peter's Basilica Anal sex Light-emitting diode
