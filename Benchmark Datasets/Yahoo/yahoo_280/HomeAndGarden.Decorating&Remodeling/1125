run an ac unit off of a volt batter i want to run an air conditioner off of a volt battery it can be the smallest ac unit i can find how long will a fully charged marine battery sustain a load like that this isn't going to work very well or very long look at the ampere hours rating of the battery then look at the power draw of the ac unit then there's the issue of converting vdc to vac what you should look for is a solid state cooler i think the brand name was koolatron they were designed to run in a car or boat Battery (electricity) Volt Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Fuse (electrical) Circuit design Toyota Prius Ampere Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Renewable energy Electrical generator Wind power Capacitor Battery electric vehicle Current (electricity) Tesla coil Explosive material Uninterruptible power supply Energy development Nickel-cadmium battery Lithium ion battery Solar panel Vacuum cleaner Nickel metal hydride Switched-mode power supply Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets High-voltage hazards Electrical element Fossil fuel power plant Hybrid Synergy Drive Jet engine Electricity Transformer M16 (rifle) Solar cell BS 1363 Laptop Alternator United States Marine Corps Bicycle lighting Diesel cycle Spark plug Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Fuel injection Circuit breaker E85 Hybrid vehicle Fuel cell Variable Frequency Drive Solar car Thermostat MIM-23 Hawk Television commercial Battle of Iwo Jima Internal ballistics IPod Autonomous building Transistor Airsoft Incandescent light bulb Diode ISS Solar Arrays Electrical resistance Carburetor Hydrogen economy Motorcycle Electrical wiring Nuclear reactor PC Engine Membrane potential USS Tunny (SS-282) Nuclear fusion Lithium ion polymer battery Steam (content delivery) Thermal power station USS Waters (DD-115) Warrant Officer Parachutist Badge (U.S.) Electric boat Baseball Chevrolet Corvair Aircraft engine Nintendo GameCube Lead-acid battery Electric vehicle CMOS Air conditioning Submarine Microvision Power supply Decibel Environmental Protection Agency Oscilloscope Operational amplifier Vacuum tube Pentium M Automobile
