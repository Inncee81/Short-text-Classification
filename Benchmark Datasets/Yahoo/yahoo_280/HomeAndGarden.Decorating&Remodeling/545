what preperations should i take to prepare a room for painting i'm painting light green over light pink of course you'll need to protect the surface of the floor remove all wall light switch and plug plates remove all items on the walls using painters tape tape along the bottom of the walls where the floor meets the wall here's how to do it right wash the walls with liquid tsp you'll find it at any good home hardware store at little cost use the liquid instead of the powder as it's easier to mix it isn't toxic and you won't have to rinse it off after prime your walls with primer use latex primer only if you are certain that the paint already on the walls is latex paint if you aren't certain or the paint is oil based then you need to use oil based primer i suggest bull's eye or kilz primer is matte paint mixed with glue which allows the paint to stick properly it's never a good idea to paint a color over another color as the st color already on the wall will affect the color you are putting on and the new color will not be the true color if you want the true color the best way and least expensive by far is to prime the wall you'll only need one coat of primer and if you don't use it you'll need at least coats of paint instead of just let the primer dry completely paint your color since you've primed you'll only need coats of color for the true color if your color is dark have your primer tinted to match so the work is easier and cleaner you can use latex paint on top of oil primer but you can't use latex paint on top of oil paint as it will scratch right off peel and chip enjoy your new room Paint Casting Plastic Aluminium Handloading Internal ballistics Pottery Dry cleaning Mattress Glaze Floppy disk Gesso Vitreous enamel Glass Wok Color Japanese tea ceremony Tattoo Diamond Genericized trademark Drawing Eczema Epoxy Strap-on dildo Upholstery Primer (paint) Thermal power station Explosive material Menstrual cup Manicure Light-emitting diode Titanium Bong Fluorescent lamp Painting Lighting Radio controlled airplane Tofu Fancy rat Color theory Stucco Kitchen Diving suit Top-bar hive Lionel Corporation Solar power Condom Pastel Sunglasses Carpet Paper marbling Nintendo DS Material properties of diamond Items in the Metroid series Bullet Ammunition Coffee Traditional animation IPod Leather Iron Carburetor Georges-Pierre Seurat Commodore 64 Glacier Atari 8-bit family Chromium Dishwasher Fire extinguisher Mach kernel Vacuum cleaner Printed circuit board Motor oil Blue Oscilloscope Fecal incontinence Wood carving Fire fighting Vinegar Professional wrestling match types Amateur telescope making Drill bit Photography Brewery Nintendo 64 Professional wrestling slang Christmas tree Equine conformation Rocket fuel Space Shuttle external tank Transformer Sundial Television
