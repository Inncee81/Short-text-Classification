how hard is it to remove wallpaper good enough that you can paint the walls we just bought a house its got real ugly wallpaper i'm trying to decide what to do remove it and paint it re wallpaper it removing wallpaper is a cinch if you know how to do it right here is the easiest way to go about it use a scoring tool it looks like a pizza cutter with spikes you'll find it at any home hardware store at little cost run this cutter all over the wall every which way using a spray bottle an old windex bottle will do just fine put blue car windshield washer fluid in the bottle spray this all over the walls you have just scored wait minutes spray a second time and wait minutes easily peel large pieces or scrape easily off the wall if there is any glue left on the wall spray it with the blue windshield washer fluid one more time and scrape it off the wall don't waste your money on steamers or costly liquids they sell at the store with years experience i can safely say that blue windshield washer fluid is the best way to remove any wallpaper you can check my other answers here just recently i suggested this method to someone who had been trying to remove wallpaper with a steamer and scraping she tried my method and was blown away because it's sooooo easy and it works you'll easily be able to paint your walls after you remove the paper keep in mind that if you don't know what kind of paint is underneath the paper you'll want to use an oil based primer on the wall before painting with latex water based paint latex paint won't stick on oil based paint but it will stick to oil based primer unless your wallpaper is textured with a really nice visual texture it's not worth painting over the only time i paint over wallpaper is when it has a cool texture to it in that case it looks like a faux finish paint job oh and although some people here recommend using fabric softener you won't want to use that fabric softener is slimy and hard to remove from the walls after if you don't believe me go put your hands in fabric softener and try to remove it easily you'll have to wash and wash to remove it so your paint sticks properly and fabric softener is way more expensive than blue windshield washer liquid enjoy your new home Casting Wallpaper Plastic Mattress Textile manufacturing Upholstery Drag racing Condom Tattoo Menstrual cup Pottery Overclocking Fire fighting Handloading Motor oil Surrealist techniques Brewery Manicure Japanese toilet Drawing Champagne (beverage) Cruising (maritime) Tofu Strap-on dildo Dundas Square Bong Tlingit Diving suit Mach kernel Wood Nuclear power Genericized trademark PlayStation Portable Hamster Windows XP Poker jargon Bulk vending Soap Spark plug Hard water Autonomous building IPod Energy development Hand grenade Anal sex Dry cleaning Hard disk Ocean's Twelve Embedded system Hydrogen economy Redundant array of independent disks Wallpaper group Sewage treatment Knife Water Coffee Inflation Arcade cabinet Clinker (boat building) Thermal power station Laser engraving Indianapolis 500 CPU cache Fiberglass Solar power Detergent Prostate cancer Opportunity rover Dairy Jackass: The Movie Japanese tea ceremony The Apprentice 2 Sodium chloride Digital circuit Violin Animal Crossing Ice hockey Printed circuit board Water purification Filling station Extreme Programming Paper Kitchen Seismic retrofit Blood Simple Cheese Bicycle lighting Microeconomics Breastfeeding Straw-bale construction NeXT Cartridge (firearms) Vinegar
