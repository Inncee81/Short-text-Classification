will latex paint eventually peel off real natural wood im about to paint my bedroom and change everything in it make it more simple and nice you could say and i have real natural wood moulding and real wood doors closet bedroom door people say i shouldnt paint over real wood but i'd like to paint the moulding that runs alongside the floor and around and over the doorways and windows white my question is is there anything to protect the wood but still paint over it perhaps latex paint can latex paint be peeled off wood any time if needed or will it ruin the wood you can paint it with a latex paint and use a chemical stripper to remove the latex paint but this is a timely process and like i said its a chemical so you have to be careful and it can get messy lots of prep will need to be done to protect other areas i have done this many times just takes patience to learn about the steps no it will not ruin the wood but the stripper can not only take the latex off but existing finish thats on it right now so you will have to sand and finish these areas if you decide to paint and then strip it yes it is wise to keep a finish on wood choose a good primer and a good paint get what you pay for Casting Paint LaTeX Pottery Plastic Wood carving Explosive material Glossary of sculpting terms Striptease Mattress Stairway Menstrual cup Condom Brush Drill bit Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Wilton House Extreme Programming Rubber Japanese tea ceremony De Lorean DMC-12 Abbey Reality History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Strap-on dildo Hamster Epoxy The Brady Bunch Fire fighting Sin City Theory of conduct Handloading The Apprentice 2 Vertigo (film) Primer (paint) Tattoo Latex Tokusatsu History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Diving suit Varnish The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mathematics Campfire Wood Door John Peel Xanadu House Deck (ship) Cremation Jumpstart 3rd Grade Woodworking Sex doll CPU cache Architecture of the California missions Internal ballistics Sewage treatment Thuja plicata RuneScape quests Capital accumulation Molding (decorative) RISC Into the Woods Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Leather One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Socrates Brewery Textile manufacturing Ultraviolet Keynesian economics Vulcanization Soap Palladian architecture Vitreous enamel Pitaten Essential oil Columbine High School massacre Lebesgue integration Dairy Enzyme G-Man (Half-Life) 11001001 (TNG episode) Grace Cossington Smith Home improvement The Marriage of Figaro Arlington House Gold standard Hemp Lute Shellac Illegal drug trade Zuiderzee Works Expert system Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Quantum mechanics Infinity Boston and Lowell Railroad
