how do i convince my mom to let me paint my new room red or how do i pick another bold and bright color we just moved into my stepdad's dads house because he just passed away my mom says we have to take baby steps with the house because it still has his dad's stuff in it and my stedad is still dealing she said later we will redecorate our rooms and to start thinking of ideas right now i have my stuff from when i shared a room with my year old sister i'm i want to make my room red and lack but white walls will totally throw off the color scheme i asked my mom if i could paint the walls red but she said no because if we ever sell the house it won't look good i really want a red and black theme but i don't know what to do i've looked on decorating web sites and even some of them had red and black help get a job so you can pay for the redecorations yourself buy painter's tape to tape off the baseboards so you won't get paint on them buy a plastic sheet to cover the floor carpet to protect it buy red paint and kilz kilz is like white paint but a primer that totally covers dark or vivid colors tell mom and step dad you will repaint the room with no argument with the kilz if they ever decide to sell you have thereby eliminated most of their objections good luck peace be with you annamaria My Little Pony Tag The Adventures of Pete & Pete Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Color Paint Animal Crossing Red Carpet Viva La Bam White House Magical objects in Harry Potter Pittsburgh Steelers Monopoly (game) Calvin and Hobbes Union Pacific Railroad Piet Mondrian Plastic Rococo Cartman Joins NAMBLA Blenheim Palace Knots Landing Mr. and Mrs. Turner Shaggy dog story Color theory Black Wassily Kandinsky Sistine Chapel Sin City Basement Kyle Broflovski Escape from New York Chatsworth House Grandview, U.S.A.
