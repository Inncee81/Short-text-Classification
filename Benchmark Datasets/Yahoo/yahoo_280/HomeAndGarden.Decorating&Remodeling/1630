will i devalue my house my taking out the bath adding a shower i have a bedroom house with a small bathroom i want to create extra space to be able to add a full size sink my only worry is will this make the house worth less in years to come if i sell it bath easy to smash up and take out but not so easy to put back thanks it won't devalue your house but it could make it more difficult to sell people have fairly high expectations nowadays and prefer a fully equipped bathroom ie bath and shower especially if they have small kids if you have a small bathroom i understand the temptation to create more space but it would be more saleable to put a shower over your bath and use a space saving basin rather than full sized i'm looking for a house at the moment and i wouldn't go for one without a bath Sento Japanese toilet Bathroom Dormitory Social rule Hamster Inflation Trombone Washroom Changeroom Electrical wiring (UK) Chatsworth House Kitchen Bidet CPU cache Sauna Toilet Sin City Toilet paper The Shining (film) Duke Nukem 3D Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Electrophysiology Fecal incontinence Ron Weasley Table tennis Luminiferous aether Ultima Online Scuba set Poker jargon Niddah Redundant array of independent disks Dymaxion house Bathing Badminton Plumbing fixture Customs and etiquette of Japan The Brady Bunch Basement Cruising (maritime) The Apprentice 2 Clarinet American and British English differences Ecco the Dolphin Homosexuality and Islam Big Brother (USA TV series) RISC The Fairly OddParents Modesty Swimming pool University of Bath Baptism McMansion The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Bloody Stupid Johnson Gordon Banks IBM PC compatible Stocking Friends Diamond cut Wilton House Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Parsifal Sewage treatment Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Floppy disk The dozens Neutrino Menstrual cup Elvis Presley 1957 World Series German language Gay bathhouse Nudity Handloading Topps Bretton Woods system Kimberly-Clark Corporation Solar cell Textile manufacturing Cremation Milk FA Cup Templeogue Addressing mode Hyperinflation Farthing (coin) Recreational vehicle Brett Whiteley Internal ballistics Apartment Kandersteg International Scout Centre Buffer overflow String theory James Callaghan Ra (board game) Volleyball Richard Chase Katamari Damacy
