does anyone know how to remove old photos from the s from those stick on photo albums i have nice snapshots that i want to remove but they've been stuck in this album since they have a flimsy plastic over them they are not stuck to the plastic but have been stuck to the sticky sheet for yrs help yeah got those albums too i'd probably go for a spatula vs a knife larger prying surface and less likely to cut the pic since you'd be working under the entire photo and not just a small area most of the time it's sort of a waxy surface underneath if no pictures on the other side of the page maybe use a blow dryer to warm up the underside Knife Glacier Chopsticks Casting Collecting fossils Plastic Textile manufacturing Drill bit Printmaking Carnivorous plant Woodworking Manicure Gramophone record Bong Glass Laser engraving Leaf Mouse (computing) Brewery Pottery Paper size Orchidaceae Radio controlled airplane Toilet paper Campfire Textile manufacturing terminology Guitar Digital photography Sushi Floppy disk Printed circuit board Soap bubble Genericized trademark Sea ice Curling She Loves You Repouss__ and chasing Hand grenade Whitewater The Wedding Present Tooth Drawing Lake Dry cleaning Ice hockey Table saw Second Battle of the Atlantic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mars Wax Polyethylene terephthalate Glossary of firefighting equipment Tofu Patricia Ford Blood Simple Canoe Internal ballistics Weather lore Mushroom hunting Katamari Damacy Handloading Flax Christmas tree Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid (album) Puff pastry Violin Motor oil Cloud John Lennon Barbecue Plough Steak Steel Sea level rise Surrealist techniques Wind Cooking weights and measures Spider Carbon nanotube Deforestation Model aircraft Stereoscopy Def Leppard Sterilization (microbiology) PIC microcontroller Solar cell Angel (Neon Genesis Evangelion) Irrigation Swimming pool Game controller Paul Is Dead Amateur telescope making Radiohead Typewriter Infidels Spatula Land mine Angling Mango Wallpaper
