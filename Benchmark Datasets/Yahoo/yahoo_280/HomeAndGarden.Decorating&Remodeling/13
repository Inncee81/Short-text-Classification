help what should i do i live in a condo where the walls seem to be very thin my downstairs neighbors have the same floor plan as me so their master bedroom is right below mine they have a fan that is extremely loud and basically vibrates on and off throughout the night and day i am having a very difficult time sleeping and i don't know what to do i'm not very close with them it's basically a hi and bye relationship but i am too scared to approach them i don't want to make things awkward because i know that i make some noise as well they are renting through the same broker as i am so i am contemplating whether i should approach the landlord or not any suggestions i would first try and approach my neighbors in a friendly non treatening way they may not even be aware of the problem you might start by asking them if there is anything you are doing that bothers them as they live below you i guarentee they hear more from you ex your stereo speakers probably vibrate down into their condo then depending on the conversation take it from there and mention the fan maybe it is an old fan and needs to be replaced or just shot with wd if that doesn't work not knowing if you have carpet or not i would install a very thick padding and carpet at the owners expense if you do have carpet you may not have thick padding underneath check the padding you can also elevate your bed with a wooden framed box with padding underneath the box between the box and the floor and then more padding between the box and the matteress to absorb the sound and vibrations if they seem not to care or are not responsive the next step would be to check the condo by laws rules and regulations most condos have associations a board of directors and rules and regulations there is always a clause that pertains to noise and neighbors is the owner of your condo the same as theirs if so talk to the managment company to address this situation after talking to your neighbors i would definately try and approach the neighbors first nothing makes people more angry that not being given the first chance to remedy a situation good luck i wish you peaceful nights of sleep in your future Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Mattress Microphone Carpet Milton H.
