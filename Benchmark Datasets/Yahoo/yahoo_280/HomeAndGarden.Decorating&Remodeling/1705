redisigning my room need some ideas i have the basic idea of what i want okay so i am redisigning my room what i was thinking of doing was a low key classy room with a light shade of color on the wall idk what color though and some nice black and white photographs i got a beuro and desk and stuff and its a dark wood so i was wondering what i should use to decorate my room with and such any help would be greatly appreciated you should go with a neutral brown color for your walls or a light gray color if it is for a bedroom all you really need is a bed two nightstands a lamp on each nightstand along with maybe a frame and mini plant on each nightstand as well i would also add a fun x area rug at the foot of your bed to ground it maybe something that matches your bedding or photos on the wall and then out a standing floor mirror cuz every girl needs one of those and a nice indoor tree to fill up the space your bedding should be pretty neutral to go with the painted walls and photos on the wall and then add color in room by using an accent pillow on the bed so that it's easy to swtich out when you get tired of that color and other misc accessories inthe room that to me is a nice basic low key bedroom that is functional and classy my whole point is to have the major pieces all netural and add color in the accessories pillows art and drapery cuz all that is easier to switch out when you get bored of it than furniture pieces Lighting Wood carving Chatsworth House Wilton House Bedroom Color theory Color Wood Rococo Grace Cossington Smith Upholstery Buckingham Palace Hamster Mattress Mouse (computing) Symmetry Kitchen Francis Bacon (painter) Light-emitting diode Sicilian Baroque Volleyball Japanese tea ceremony Bicycle Disney's Contemporary Resort My Little Pony Le Corbusier Sundial Furniture Sunglasses Chair Fluorescent lamp Bed (furniture) The Brady Bunch Pottery Comanche Xanadu House Basement Color temperature Seismic retrofit Wallpaper group Perl Manual transmission The Shining (film) Milton H.
