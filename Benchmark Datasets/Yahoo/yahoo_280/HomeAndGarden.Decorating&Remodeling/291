how do i paint my room myself what is sheen how much paint will i need for a small room ft x ft walls will i need a base paint my wall is white can't i just paint over it what rollers equipment are good quality and also inexpensive is it possible to paint a door that is already attached hinged to the wall you've got several questions so i'll tackle them one at a time q what is sheen a sheen is the amount of light a paint reflects when dry it is created by a very thin clear layer that forms as the solvents dry lower sheen paints like 'flat' and 'eggshell satin' hide wall imperfections and are visually pleasing they are typically used on interior walls of bedrooms living rooms and hallways their downfall is that they hold dirt very well and are tough to clean higher sheen paints like 'semi gloss' and 'gloss' are much easier to clean but are harsher on the eyes they are typically used as trim in kitchens and bathrooms and rooms with small children i would recommend that you never hone in on one particular sheen and shop for that different companies use the same name for different sheens sometimes within their own product lines there is no standard 'flat' some products are more flat than others always look at each company's sheen samples to find the particular sheen that you like from that company q how much paint will i need a there's no easy answer to this do you plan on painting the ceiling how many windows and doors will there be a wallpaper trim in general you have about sq ft of wall space that would take about a half gallon or two quarts add in another quart of a relatively higher gloss trim if you go that route by overbuying and going with a gallon you will have plenty for touch up or recovering if you get poor coverage on the first coat you'll also guarantee that the paint will match if you underbuy and run short the paint may not match exactly the same color from the same store may still come from different manufacturing batches and there are always small batch to batch variances q will i need base paint a provided your walls are in good condition now and that you will use a lighter color then no if your walls are damaged or stained you will want to prime them or the stains will seep into your new topcoat alternately if you live in a state that sells alkyd paint that will seal out the stains but it is much more messy as you have to use paint thinner to clean not water also colors that are particularly deep like deep reds have notoriously poor coverage if you paint them directly over a white wall it will take many sometimes or more coats to completely block out the white if you use a color like this get some primer and have it tinted grey that will darken the wall and you'll get much better coverage q what inexpensive equipment can i use a don't go too cheap cheaper synthetic brushes and rollers tend to leave marks behind brush strokes and roller stipple natural rollers sheepskin are very nice but expensive try to get a natural synthetic blend it will be less expensive and it should be a good time solution when is comes to brushes buy the best you can afford and wash it thoroughly when done they store very well if you are using a latex water based paint do not get a natural bristle brush just trust me on that q can i paint without removing the door a yes you can i don't recommend it you're much more likely to have paint drip on the floor or pool at the bottom and dry in big clumps it also makes it hard to get into the small nooks and crannies some decorative doors have lastly do you want to paint the hardware no matter how hard you try you'll end up with paint on it Brewery Upholstery Casting Brush Mattress Leather Drill bit Glass Knife Textile manufacturing Strap-on dildo Handloading McMansion Pottery Coffee Dry cleaning De Lorean DMC-12 Basement Diamond Hard disk Drawing Illegal drug trade Lighting Light-emitting diode Hamster Anchor Bulk vending Kitchen Solar cell Floppy disk Poker jargon Bicycle lighting Wilton House Bong Menstrual cup Lionel Corporation Violin Textile manufacturing terminology Fire fighting Redundant array of independent disks Billiards Christmas tree Pebble bed reactor Gramophone record Oscilloscope Internal ballistics Diving suit Color theory Japanese tea ceremony Aluminium Motor oil The Brady Bunch Passenger car Sailing Titanium Fancy rat Wallpaper group Hydrogen economy Bus models used in New York City Transit Rum Carpet Sundial Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Combine (Half-Life 2) Microeconomics Gas metal arc welding Primer (paint) M16 (rifle) Opportunity rover Tattoo Diamond simulant Table tennis Synthetic diamond Lacquer Welding Milk Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Wood carving Automobile Chatsworth House Cookware and bakeware Japanese toilet Surveillance Dairy Windows XP Stairway Impressionism Fluorescent lamp Mutual fund
