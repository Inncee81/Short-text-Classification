is a light sanding between coats a good idea when using gloss paint i am using dulux non drip gloss i need to apply a second coat i seem to recall from somewhere that a light sanding is a good idea to give the surface a key if a second gloss coat is to be applied can anyone confirm this the instructions on the tin are silent on this point and i don't fancy minutes of menu options on the telephone thanks alan kj lyndsay cg sam and daf thats brilliant it's not really necessary but i still do it so you get rid of any faults from the first coat and also roughen up the surface so coat adheres better make sure you wipe down with a damp cloth before nd coat and allow to dry Casting Paint Glass Glaze Friction Wok Pottery Manicure Leather Stucco Sandpaper Solar cell Printmaking Brazing Vitreous enamel Table tennis Charles Wheatstone Etching Scientology beliefs and practices Diamond cut Titanium Seismic retrofit Sand casting Cookware and bakeware Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fire extinguisher Plastic Textile manufacturing terminology Mouse (computing) Lacquer Gloss (material appearance) System/34 Sand art and play Mirror L.
