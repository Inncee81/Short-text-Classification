my friend saw the room that i painted for my kids and asked me how much would i charge her to paint her girls' rooms and i told her for each room so i just wanted to know if that was fair or not she wont help cause she dont like to sweat it depends how the type of painting you are going to do for her if it was just one color throughout is very reasonable if you have to do some intricate painting i would charge a little bit more but if she is your friend and you want to do it for her kids and her than i would just stick to the Blood on the Tracks Vegeta Paint She Loves You One Tree Hill (TV series) Johnny the Homicidal Maniac The Catcher in the Rye The Late Show with David Letterman Paula Jones Atomic Kitten Humphrey Bogart Tintoretto About a Boy Operation Petticoat The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Jennifer Lopez Code: Lyoko The Brady Bunch PlayStation Portable Ocean's Twelve Irna Phillips Blenheim Palace Recess (TV series) Aliens of London Cupid and Psyche House of M Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) W.I.T.C.H.
