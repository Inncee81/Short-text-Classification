how to strip wallpaper and then paint the walls hello i've just stripped the wallpaper off the walls by using a wallpaper steamer in my new house but there's a few things i think i need to address before i start painting i think that there is probably some wallpaper paste still stuck on the walls i've see on here than sugar soap is probably the best for removing this what's the easiest and best way of using it mop and bucket for example i have already sanded the walls down with a power sander but i can't help but think there's something else i need to do before i paint partly because of the next point the walls were painted underneath the paper so now that i've took the wallpaper off it's pulled off some of the paint so i have patches of painted and non painted areas i'm worried that this will show up when i paint the walls how can i combat this i'm a completely new to diy so please assume i know nothing and can you explain in as much detail as possible thanks you can get wallpaper paste remover at home depot i use a grout sponge to remove it the grout sponge is large and it has an abrasive side and a smooth side great for removing paste when the paste is off prime the wall you can get a tinted primer if you want but in this case i would suggest kilz it is oil based it smells and it will stick to you like glue in short it's a pain to work with but it's the best way to make sure that no moisture seeps through your new paint job next you may need to do some spackling if the wall has holes or uneven areas sharp edges not slopes get them smoothed with the spackle and sand it down after it dries it is usually easier to tell the imperfections after you prime the wall but you will need to touch up these areas that you worked on with more primer before you paint now you are ready to paint good luck Wallpaper Drill bit Wallpaper group Internal ballistics Woodworking Knife Seismic retrofit Autostereogram Casting Pottery Manifold Opportunity rover Leather Sandpaper Table tennis Radio controlled airplane Stucco Handloading Menstrual cup Sento Basement Hamster SpongeBob SquarePants Fecal incontinence Toilet paper Soap Paint Diving suit Basic English Primer (paint) Glass Hoover Dam Carnivorous plant Comanche Spark plug Glossary of climbing terms Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Spidey Super Stories Fast bowling Plastic Bassoon Kitchen Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Textile manufacturing Items in the Metroid series Great Pyramid of Giza Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Condom Tofu Cartridge (firearms) Ammunition Psoriasis Idli Japanese toilet Wood Equine conformation Retinal detachment Painting Drawing Rachel Whiteread Tire Bong Hand grenade Tractor Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Wok Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Solar cell Lake District Naruto jutsu Tattoo Breaststroke Aerial (dance move) Tile Bulldozer Fire fighting Frans Hals Genericized trademark Advance Wars: Dual Strike Wood carving Cast iron Death Valley National Park Fencing Gesso Papier-m__ch__ Sand casting Combine (Half-Life 2) Eczema Brazing Cruising (maritime) Tlingit Shaving Manicure Carl Barks Desertification Computer animation
