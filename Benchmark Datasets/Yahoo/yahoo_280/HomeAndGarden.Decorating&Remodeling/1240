redoing my room i am open for some cool ideas i really like hippos but i don't want to go with an african theme i already tried that and it didn't work out so well try not to go for a theme although it's hard not to utilize africa in your room since you like hippo's so much instead opt for some neutral rich colors browns deep reds golden tones that will make your collectibles stand out i suggested these earthy colors since your collectibles will most likely be of hippo's as well the key is to let the accessories do the talking not your bedsheets walls etc a theme room can seem just that like you are going to an amusement park instead of a retreat buy yourself whimsical pieces and if paintings are out of the question consider landscape photography of africa utilize some silk plants for greenery http cgi ebay com new foot artificial cabbage palm tree plant n w qqitemz qqihz qqcategoryz qqsspagenamezwdvwqqrdz qqcmdzviewitem ebayphotohosting have fun with it hope it turns out fabulous RuneScape quests Art Rococo Wilton House Hippopotamus Milton H.
