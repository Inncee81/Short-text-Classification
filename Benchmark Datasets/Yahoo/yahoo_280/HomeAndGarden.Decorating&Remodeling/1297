i want to paint a wall bookshelf i was told i should use an oil based paint because i have a parrot i don't want to have the noxious fumes throughout the house what type of paint do you think would hold up on a book shelf besides oil based i realize i can use a latex but will it hold up on a bookshelf i'm sorry i shoud have said it's a newly made bookcase of unfinished wood the trim in my room is white and i'd like to keep the same continuity throughout the room the pro's take off all the paint that start from the ground up most of the pro's like only to use oil and wax this is really the best way to make wood furniture to look and feel its best and last the longest most of hotest and most expensive bookcase have no paint however if you meant colored paint moreover just wanted add another coat of paint this is where it gets trickiest paint can be added to paint but it should match everything especially base type moreover be on really clean and rough surfaces to hold on however if it has a clear coat finish on it you should think about taking everything off down to the wood the point is nothing you do with paint other than take all off thna starting with only water based paint spray system is a good idea this is the only real way to make it look and feel right moreover the only way to make look like new and last a long time it easy today to take off old paint with all the new stuff on the market plus paint or oil everything from the ground wood up i can do a x wall unit in under hours apply paint remover few hours than wait few hours wipe off old paint with a pain scraper few hours than wait few hours patch and sand few hours than wait a few hours spray or brush paint on few hours than wait a few days to add more or a clear coat however if just want a quick fix you can paint almost anything on anything in anyway but it won't last or look as nice ok about the smell you should always paint with all the windows open for hours even with water base moreover should wait at least hours between coats or putting anything on it the pros do it better and faster because they only use spray and heat system most only use all water base paints if you re in a rush use a spar and a hair dry or a fan if you re just going for touch up or the whole thing go to any place like home depot they all have everything you need last but not least never ever pour any paint down any drain or put it in the trash in most cities it is against the law all water and oil base paint must be hand taken to the proper place and people latex will hold if you do it right and do not bang into it much it is very sticky so let it dry for a long time Paint Casting Pottery Plastic Drill bit Fire fighting Thermal power station Woodworking Menstrual cup Motor oil Upholstery Japanese tea ceremony Mattress Fume hood Knife Sewage treatment Textile manufacturing Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Xanadu House Car washing techniques Basement Wood Fire extinguisher Kitchen Bacon Japanese toilet Radio controlled airplane Chewing gum Hamster Bong Drawing Painting Soap Solar power Skateboarding trick Chatsworth House Leather Diving suit Sento Volleyball History of Microsoft Windows Wok Oil painting GunBound Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Campfire Cannabis cultivation Strap-on dildo Stucco Printmaking Extreme Programming Tofu Poker jargon Bookcase Architecture of the California missions Dundas Square Sand casting Indianapolis 500 Wood carving Fancy rat Condom The Amazing Race Apollo 8 Cross-country skiing Naruto jutsu Heinkel He 100 Instant coffee Perfume Operation Market Garden Brewery Wood finishing Seismic retrofit Pubic hair Equine conformation Dialysis Golf Time Out of Mind Social rule Comanche Irrigation Sauna Violin Lacquer Chevrolet Corvair Second Battle of the Atlantic Ski wax I Want to Hold Your Hand CPU design Irna Phillips Microeconomics Diseases of the honeybee Sport rowing Library
