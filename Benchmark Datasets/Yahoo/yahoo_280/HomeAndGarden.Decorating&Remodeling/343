applying enamel based paint onto interior woodwork hello i am repainting internal timber door frames window frames and skirting boards they have previously been painted and have been sanded and primed i am using a high quality enamel based paint but find it is getting a little thick to apply through the job which makes it hard to apply and not smooth to apply like i expect it to be the manufacturer recommends against adding thinners what am i doing wrong or what should i do forget about the advice of the manufacturer add lacquer thinner but only enough to thin it so you can work with the enamel but you have to apply the paint faster because this will speed up the drying time also Woodworking Paint Vitreous enamel Leather Lacquer Casting Drill bit Titanium Knife Tooth enamel Pottery Wood Mattress Glass Table tennis Dodge Charger Upholstery Cartridge (firearms) Cloisonn__ Solar cell Stucco Textile manufacturing Japanese tea ceremony Architecture of the California missions Violin Gas metal arc welding Varnish Faster-than-light Piano Mouse (computing) Saxophone Welding Tempera Compact disc Radeon Handloading Glaze Seismic retrofit Tooth Bicycle frame Cross-country skiing Guqin Car handling Leica Fiberglass Acrylic paint White House RISC PowerBook Woodworking machine Gramophone record Toluene IPod Saw Motorcycle Hard disk Game programming Brush Arcade cabinet Sand casting Brazing Concrete Union Pacific Railroad Diving suit Corrosion IBM PC compatible Scrabble Lumber Lead paint MAME Chromium ISO 9000 Door British Rail Class 317 Pastel Plane (tool) Industrial engineering Oscilloscope Hockey rink Impressionism British Airways Art Francis Bacon (painter) Audio tape length and thickness Psoriasis Bassoon Molding (decorative) Zinc Automobile Bicycle Ford Explorer Chromatography Apple Macintosh M60 machine gun Portsmouth Block Mills NTFS CD-R San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Portrait miniature De Lorean DMC-12
