brawler competition fighter street fighter alright i have debated over the last few months on what martial art to take i am a fighter at heart but would like to be sufficient at fighting i want to be able to brawl street fight and competition fight now i know martial arts is supposed to teach self descripline but so what i took tae kwon doe biggest waste of money in my opinion what martial arts would fit street fighting competition fighting im leaning towards muay thai i am also wanting to be able to do mma competitions there are a number of different types of competition type fighting but from what it sounds like you want something with real contact muai tai would give you good stand up skills and many of those fighters also fight in kick boxing and they either fight united states rules or european rules the difference being no elbows or knees in u s rules and european rules allow knees but no elbows many states still don't allow elbows in stand up fighting and some of the states that were have recently changed back to not allow them in stand up or even in mma type events that change just came about recently in illinois for one and missouri for another that i know of by doing muai tai you could get more than enough fights in kick boxing and if you wanted to get into the mma type fighting you could also do that although you would probably want to pick up some good training in wrestling russian sambo or brazilian jiu jutsu to round out your ground fighting skills Ultimate Fighting Championship Taekwondo Kickboxing Jujutsu Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Tai Chi Chuan Wanderlei Silva Punch (strike) Royce Gracie Grappling Professional wrestling attacks Frank Mir PRIDE Chinese martial arts Sport Professional wrestling holds Wing Chun Fighting game Rickson Gracie Fedor Emelianenko Vale tudo Professional wrestling aerial techniques Antonio Inoki Wrestling Eskrima Shaolin (martial arts) K-1 Wushu Skateboarding trick Aikido Volleyball Hapkido Boxing Vitor Belfort Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira Muay Boran Jet Li Akuma (Street Fighter) Equine conformation Professional wrestling Professional wrestling match types Ryo Sakazaki Ken Shamrock Capoeira Naruto jutsu Jeet Kune Do Sambo (martial art) Rugby union Dan Hibiki Shawn Michaels Strike (attack) Bas Rutten Kyokugenryu Karate Tekken Welterweight Eternal Champions Ultimate (sport) Xingyiquan Hulk Hogan Adon Chun-Li Judo Breaststroke Football (soccer) Eagle Claw Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Sagat Professional wrestling slang Softball Silat Dog agility M.
