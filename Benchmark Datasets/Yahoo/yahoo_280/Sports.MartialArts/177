the old ufc i liked the old ufc when the rules were limited not this watered down stuff we have now it looks like glorified hugging nowadays agree dachman this question isn't about putting wrestling down you dumbass i agree in a way i do think that it should be the fighters responsiblity to get himself off the ground personally i've never been bored by ground fighting but thats because i understand it its like how europeans are bored by american football and americans are bored by soccer im bored by cricket and most modern mma fans are bored by groundfighting its hard to keep your interest when you don't understand whats going on i also don't like how almost every rule change has favored strikers gloves standing them back up rounds and standing up at the beginning of every round really most things that have made it less realistic have favored strikers so i did prefer the old rules because they were more realistic and didn't favor strikers so much the part i liked the most though was the style vs style part of the old ufc i thought it was fascintaing to see how they matched up against each other that being said i think the changes where inevitable all athletes want to win and cross training was the best way to ensure you'd be able to match your opponent or at least not be taken by suprise and be flailing around helplessly and with the rules well most of the public understands striking and finds it more exciting than grappling so its natural rules would change to encourage striking so that people find the fights more exciting and will thus pay more to watch them Martial art Ultimate Fighting Championship Laws of cricket Boxing Jujutsu Chuck Liddell Vitor Belfort Football (soccer) Professional wrestling holds Cricket Frank Mir Sydney Riot of 1879 Wanderlei Silva Randy Couture Australian rules football PRIDE Matt Hughes (fighter) Alex Ferguson Newcastle United F.C.
