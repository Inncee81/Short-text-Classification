how funny would it be if usc went undefeated and got left out of the championship game i think i'd still be laughing next july personally the point of this is simple it can happen it has happened and as long as we have the bcs it will happen again auburn is sorta what brought it to mind but more the folks saying usc has the greatest team ever according to anyone who actually saw a game in auburns team was the best team the south has produced in the last years they dated back to the miami teams of the 's the system is flawed everyone knows it it's a media based thing picked by people who for the most part have never even played football so large market teams and media darlings get early nods also look at last years michigan team lost game just like florida but florida got the shot at the title but i personally would laugh harder if usc got probation so they weren't even elidgable and went undefeated and couldn't win the title that my friends is a definate possibility and what if usc has a bum run wins games they should easily by like points or so gets jumped and left and to loveholio why's it so different that it happens to usc and not anyone else say boise st why would that make the bcs any more bogus because usc is the in team right now to be for and to pick for the title how about usc gets to share the title and they were not in the title game so does that not argue against the bcs system can't have it both ways so if the system is flawed in your favor then it's still flawed trust me i'm all for a playoff and have been for years even before and no one on the planet is going to convince me usc would have beaten auburn like they did that overrated oklahoma team btw to you usc fans look at who is laughing auburn fans michigan fans because if those two can get hosed anyone can auburn and michigan are two of the traditional powers in the country and play in bigtime bcs conferences not comparing conferences here just plainly stating that no one is immune the rivals one looks more truthful honestly notre dame will hurt usc because i see them losing at least maybe even games and the lower tier pac teams as well and nebraska will give a team like usc fits but over the long haul of the season will lose at least maybe games overall the only team what might threaten a bcs bowl that usc will play is cal with ucla getting at least a new years day bowl most of their vaunted schedule won't even make a bowl game though and everyone read km 's post and ask yourself why everyone hates on usc and usc has no history compared to those teams listed am i to understand that you think usc has a greater history than alabama and michigan i mean usc even tries to claim tailback u which is the most retarded thing ever only clean usc back in history was marcus allen otherwise you got a cheater and a killer on your resume now that is tradition running back u how about carnell williams starter tb ronnie brown starter miami brandon jacobs starter ny giants rudi johnson starter cincy bengals kenny irons recently injured last night on depth chart cincy heath evans starter fb ne patriots stephen davis legend washington redskins brent fullwood cf hof earl campbell cf hof who am i forgetting someone hmm oh yea bo jackson nuff said so ya'll boast back ups in the nfl solid rb marcus allen murderer oj is still paying off that civil suit and had to hock his heisman and reggie bush was bought and paid for and i'll compare depth at rb with ya and we can have this talk at the end of the season once espn shows clips of lester tate davis and fannin the next gen hmm davis is the only recruit out of that lot even rest are oh darn and enrique davis is coming next year and he was what the recruit behind devine last year running back u is au dude hey sok c actually no they do not have the number toughest schedule they have the number according to the espn power rankings as you've suggested http sports espn go com ncf columns story columnist schlabach mark id go look for yourself oh and that is totally relative because rivals puts them at number there are a lot of teams out there that could be cal and nebraska this year so that doesn't say much notre dame will be lucky to win or games this year so that doesn't help either http collegefootball rivals com content asp sid cid basic fact is though it won't happen if you start the season number and win all your games i don't see one let alone two teams jump over you to make it but it's possible if usc has a couple of close calls and lsu and texas blow out their opponents going undefeated well then it's up to the computers not the voters just another reason for a playoff i would find it funny actually yes Monday Night Football American Football League New York Knicks Dallas Cowboys
