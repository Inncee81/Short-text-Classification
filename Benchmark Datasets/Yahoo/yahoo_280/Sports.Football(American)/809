thoughts and views on the dallas cowboys pre season win over the colts i was personally impressed i really like how romo realsed the ball so quickly and efficently i enjoyed watching them eat time on the clock by nickle and dimeing the colts d julius jones really impressed me with his speed and how he hit the whole yes barber iii had more yards but he also had more carries and he dances around to much for me as far as the defense goes i was please but not as impressed as i hoped to be but i also think that is becuase it is still so early and they have to work alot of kinks out such as i personally noticed they were showing the blitz to early and not sitting back until the end and there were to many arm tackles the middle of the field seemded to be wide open for the majority of the night also on the plus side i really liked seeing how they were communicating with everyone and they all seemed to know was was going on anyway what do ya'll think please dont answer if your just going to put its still preseason dont get excited a if you're not exicted your not a real fan and b i know that this is a question to discuss what you like disliked about the game last night romo seemed to be getting out from under center faster new coach or experience don't know i'll tell you who really impressed me was the rookie competing for the third qb spot matt moore hadn't paid any attention to the guy until last night but he was cool under pressure and seemed to grasp the offensive scheme he looked pretty good you're right about there appearing to be holes in the middle of the defense st game it's fixable i'm expecting great things from this defense this year demarcus ware getting some support form the other side and roy williams playing closer to the line could be fun to watch fasano looked great they say that garrett likes to run a two tight end set that should complicate the lives of defensive coordinators the offense as a whole seemed a little more opened up with the receiving tandem of owens glenn and crayton that should be fun New York Giants Dallas Cowboys Cleveland Browns New England Patriots Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXVII National Football League Lore Super Bowl V American football strategy National Football League San Francisco 49ers Pittsburgh Steelers Cincinnati Bengals Glossary of American football Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl X Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXV New York Jets Super Bowl XII St. Louis Rams American football Super Bowl XIX Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XIV Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl VI Defensive team Buffalo Bills 1957 World Series Super Bowl IX Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XVII Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XI Super Bowl Offensive team Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl VII Washington Redskins Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXXV Wide receiver Water polo Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl I Volleyball Running back NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Quarterback American Football League Tight end Houston Astros Rugby union positions Super Bowl XXXVIII International League Terrell Owens Toronto Raptors Lineman (football) 2005 NFL season Super Bowl XXXIII Canadian football Major League Baseball television contracts October 2005 in sports September 2005 in sports Aerial (dance move) Donovan McNabb Comparison of Canadian and American football Steve Nash Super Bowl XXXII Tom Landry Cris Carter Toronto Blue Jays Poker jargon Yao Ming Boston Red Sox Minnesota Vikings Babe Ruth's Called Shot Rugby league positions Baseball Joe Gibbs Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl VIII Super Bowl XX Atlanta Falcons Los Angeles Dodgers
