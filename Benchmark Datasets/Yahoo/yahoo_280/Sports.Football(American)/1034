how do i find out which nfl games will be broadcast in my area i just moved to new hampshire and i am not a patriots fan i can't figure out how to look up what games will be shown in my area tru blu i was expecting to have to pay any way but i cant for the life of me find any information about which packages will show my steelers games no package is worth it if i have to leave the house to find a sports bar because im shelling out extra a month to still not see my games woe is me since you are a steelers fan you really look into getting a diectv satelite system and getting the sunday ticket package it will cost you like for the season in addition to the monthly costs but you will get to see every steeler game that way unless a game is moved to friday or saturday due to a weather problem due to a law that nfl games can't be televised on fridays or saturdays if there are regularly scheduled high school or college games played in the area otherwise this is the answer unfortunately the cbs and fox affiliates in local areas don't really tell what games they will show in advance now if your cbs affiliate is in new hampshire you will get more games on tv than you would if were stuck with boston affiliates you can probably check the websites on your local affilates a few days ahead of schedule here is my guess on what your sunday games will be week patroits jets cbs pm eagles packers pm fox bears chargers fox pm week buffalo steelers cbs pm cowboys dolphins fox jets baltimore cbs pm patrioits are on nbc night game week buffalo patriots cbs pm ers steelers fox pm giants redskins fox pm week rams dallas fox pm either raiders dolphins or jets buffalo cbs broncos colts pm cbs patriots are monday night game week browns patriots cbs pm seatlle steelers fox pm chargers broncos cbs pm week dolphins browns or bengals chiefs cbs eagles jets fox pm patriots cowboys cbs pm week patriots dolphins cbs pm ers giants fox pm bears eagles fox pm week giants vs dolphins in england fox pm colts panthers cbs pm redskins patriots fox pm week redskins jets fox pm bengals buffalo or jaguars saints cbs pm patriots colts cbs pm week eagles redskins fox pm either buffalo dolphins cbs pm or bengals ravens cbs pm cowboys giants fox pm patriots off week patriots buffalo cbs pm redskins dallas fox pm either giants detroit fox or rams ers fox if redskins cowboys moved to then the fox game will be panthers packers week broncos bears cbs pm either saints panthers or vikings giants fox pm ravens chargers cbs pm patriots nbc sunday night week jets dolphins cbs pm seattle eagles fox pm giants bears fox pm patroits on monday night week steelers patriots cbs pm giants eagles fox pm browns jets cbs pm if steelers patriots switched to pm then dolphins buffalo will be the cbs pm game week jets patriots cbs pm seattle panthers or packers rams fox pm eagles dallas fox pm week dolphins patriots cbs pm giants buffalo fox pm baltimore seattle fox pm week since the patriots play on saturday both affiliates will have games on fox pm game will be saints bears the cowboys redskins game likely gets moved to pm for cbs steelers baltimore likely pm and either tennessee colts or bengals dolphins gets moved to or possibly to nbc at night depending on playoff situations Super Bowl XXVII Super League (Australia) Super Bowl XXVIII NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Major League Baseball television contracts Super Bowl XXXV Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XXXVI NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl XVII Cris Carter Super Bowl XIV NFL playoffs, 1996-97 Brett Favre NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award Super Bowl XXXI Terrell Owens Robert F.
