can you honestly tell me that jerry rice isn't the greatest football player ever i challenge you to objectively explain how anyone was better here's my rationale ask a thousand hardcore football fans who the greatest qb is and you'll get an argument montana elway marino unitas etc running back same thing sanders brown e smith payton etc ask that same question about wide receivers and there is no legitimate argument it's jerry rice he is the only player whose superiority at his position is without dispute i await your feedback i see a lot of valid arguments i don't necessarily agree with them but some are valid nonetheless it's easy to say a wideout needs a qb to get him the ball but you can also say a qb needs a wideout to catch it and a running back needs linemen to block for him my basic rationale is this all those other guys were great but how can you say they're the best ever when you can't even necessarily say they were the best at their position yes i can he is undoubtedly the best wr by statistics in nfl history that does not make him ultimately the best player ever he played a team game on a very good team with hof teammates barry sanders played on a crappy team with almost no great talent around him walter payton played on a team that varied from horrible to sb champs some years he had great teammates others not so much jim brown played a very short time in the nfl and yet is one of the best ever so comparing players that have such differing supporting casts is really faulty to find a true best player overall comparing nfl players of different positions is very difficult what makes a great wr is different than rb qb ol or any defensive player what each position is required to do differs greatly the best player could easily be an o lineman but since they don't get highlight reels make sportscenter or endorsements you wouldn't know so to claim rice or any other player as the definitive best ever is really not a claim to be backed up is he a top player in nfl history hell yes best period maybe but not a definite yes American football Wide receiver San Francisco 49ers New York Giants National Football League Lore Running back Glossary of American football Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXVII Pittsburgh Steelers Walter Payton Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXII St. Louis Rams Super Bowl III Super Bowl I Miami Dolphins Barry Sanders Jerry Rice NFL Most Valuable Player Award Super Bowl XXI Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXV Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl XIV American football strategy Buffalo Bills Quarterback Pro Football Hall of Fame Offensive team Super Bowl XVIII Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XXXVI Dallas Cowboys Theory of conduct Super Bowl XXVIII Canadian football Super Bowl IX John Elway Super Bowl XXXII Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl V Michael Vick Super Bowl X Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl VII Terrell Owens Randy Moss Baseball Super Bowl XVII Indianapolis Colts Rugby union Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XVI College football Super Bowl XXX The NFL Today Jacksonville Jaguars Norway national football team Ontological argument Super Bowl XII Michael Jordan Madden NFL Jim Rice Oakland Raiders Football Team Fortress Classic Super Bowl XXXI Boomer Esiason Steve Nash Ty Cobb Brett Favre Football (soccer) Super Bowl XXXIV Deion Sanders Dan Marino Chicago Bears Ultimate (sport) Joe Paterno 2005 NFL season Water polo Table tennis Defensive team Super Bowl XV Theodicy
