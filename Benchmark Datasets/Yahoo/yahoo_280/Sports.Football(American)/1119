what team do you think has the best shot at winning the national championchip this year in ncaa football the three teams that stand out to me are usc lsu and michigan usc's lineup is stacked from top to bottom plus i think that they have a better chance of going undefeated than either lsu or michigan lsu has a great defense but they can't lose more than games in the sec without making the bcs championship game if they get into too many shootouts with in conference teams i don't see them making it michigan is a veteran team that's solid all around they have a strong o line and top level qb rb and wr their defense is also pretty good at the line and defensive back positions i think it wouldn't be out of the question to suggest a michigan usc championship but right now i'll take usc over lsu in the final game NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Nick Saban USC Trojans Football BCS title game Mack Brown Texas Longhorn Athletics NCAA Division I-A national football champions 2004 College World Series Tulane University Cleveland Browns Auburn University College basketball Houston Nutt NBA Finals 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament Arkansas Razorbacks University of Michigan Big East Conference NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship January 2005 in sports December 2004 in sports New York Jets Norway national football team University of Southern California Cincinnati Bengals New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets College football New York Giants Boston College Athletics Buffalo Bills Playoff Michigan Wolverines Miami Dolphins Joe Paterno Rose Bowl (game) Louisiana State University New York Knicks Brazil national football team National Football League Lore October 2005 in sports Pittsburgh Steelers National Basketball Association FA Cup March 2005 in sports Larry Bird Volleyball Bear Bryant Super Bowl I Atlantic Coast Conference Iron Bowl All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Indiana Pacers Dallas Cowboys Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXVII Baseball The Football League College rivalry Super Bowl XXXIV Penalty shootout (football) Ice hockey San Francisco 49ers Italy national football team Troms__ I.L.
