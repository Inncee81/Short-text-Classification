why will the houston texans make it to the playoffs this year they are on the right track they got rid of their bad qb and rb guys and now have schaub and ahman green in their place instead of drafting a high qb they traded for an underrated player and hope he can do something with the team because they have many team needs i like the move schaub was know as the best backup in the league for years and if he wasn't behind such a talented player as vick he would have played more ahman green has proven he can play in the nfl and came at about million less than bush did green will do a good job this year and i see them taking a good running back in a draft in the near future but green will be above average in the running department kubiak always gets the most out of players when he left denver plummer went from a high s qb rating to a low s and t bell went from a ypc to a ypc they actually are getting a lot better with some young talent on defense d ryans mario williams and a okoye who is like will play for many years will improve this run defense and hopefully start getting to the qb m greenwood and d robinson are also doing well do i think they can beat the colts no do i think they can beat the titans lost their starting rb and both starting wrs yes do i think they can beat jacksonsville no qb and no good wide recievers yes i think they have a chance at being the nd best team in the division will they make the wild card over cincy jets and broncos i don't know but there is a chance Pittsburgh Steelers Kansas City Chiefs New England Patriots National Football League Lore Buffalo Bills New York Giants National Football League New York Jets Miami Dolphins Cincinnati Bengals Denver Broncos American Football League Indianapolis Colts Dallas Cowboys Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXXIV Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl St. Louis Rams San Francisco 49ers Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXII NFL playoffs, 2004-05 New York Knicks Running back NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXVII Houston Astros Super Bowl IX October 2005 in sports January 2005 in sports Atlanta Falcons September 2005 in sports Super Bowl I Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl III Toronto Blue Jays Super Bowl XXIV Qu__bec Nordiques Tennessee Titans NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl XXXII Utah Jazz Ahman Green Cleveland Indians Super Bowl X Super Bowl XXXI Oakland Athletics Los Angeles Kings NFL Draft Houston Rockets Super Bowl XIX Pro Football Hall of Fame Washington Redskins Super Bowl XXV Indiana Pacers Super Bowl V Playoff Super Bowl XXXVI Mario Lemieux Professional American football championship games Boston Red Sox NFL playoffs, 1991-92 Montreal Canadiens Chicago Cubs Monday Night Football Los Angeles Clippers New York Mets Michael Vick New Jersey Nets National Basketball Association Houston Texans Toronto Raptors Super Bowl XIII World Series San Diego Chargers Baltimore Orioles National Football League championships Super Bowl XV Philadelphia Eagles Cris Carter San Antonio Spurs Peyton Manning NFL Most Valuable Player Award Nolan Ryan International League
