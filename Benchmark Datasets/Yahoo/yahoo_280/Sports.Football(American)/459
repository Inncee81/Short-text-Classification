will the ravens be real super bowl contenders if it wasnt for their offense sucking last year in the playoffs i think they had it all for another super bowl now with a running back that can get a little better than yards a carry do you think the offense can at least give a little bit of support i think they have what you need to win so lets hear it ravens fans i think mcgahee will make the ravens better offensively he should be more effective than jamal lewis was last season all though at times he did still help the ravens my only worry is that how often will mcnair go deep that seems to have hindered the ravens offensive attack at points during last season they had limited times where they stretched the feild on the deep ball and i don't think that forced as much respect out of opposing defenses as it could have mcnair tourched kc on a deep pass to mark clayton that in turn went to the house in kc otherwise he's very effective i think for the ravens to succeed they are going to have to create a real balance on the offensive ball like new england has and guess what so does indy effective enough guess what the ravens where the first road team in kansas city that won in december since i believe rk i disagree the ravens may have mouthed off at the steelers after their superbowl season and i admit that it came back to haunt them however i fail to see where the raevns since then have taken any cheap shots at the steelers since then the ravens last season beat the steelers to the likes of what is highly unlikely for any team vs any divisional rival to the likes of a combined score amongst the two games of you don't hear any animosity from the steelers about the way the ravens played during the games do you and ray lewis the first name to come to minds of all most any fan when you mention the world ravens shook the hand of steelers coach bill cohwer out of respect so where is the disrepect there where where the ravens boasting about their victories in the press after the game the ravens showed no ill will towards the colts even after getting beaten in their own house the persona of someone who is stuck up is likely to whine after getting beaten Super Bowl XIV Buffalo Bills Super Bowl IX Miami Dolphins New York Jets Super Bowl XXXV New England Patriots Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl X Super Bowl XIII Indianapolis Colts Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XIX San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl V Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXXIX NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXXVI Tennessee Titans Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XXVIII NFL playoffs, 2002-03 American Football League September 2005 in sports American football strategy Donovan McNabb Super Bowl VII American football Super Bowl XVII Tom Brady National Football League Super Bowl XXXIII January 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXI Running back November 2004 in sports December 2004 in sports Washington Redskins October 2004 in sports Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl II New York Knicks Dan Marino Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XX Ben Roethlisberger San Diego Chargers Baseball Super Bowl XV Minnesota Vikings Los Angeles Kings Joe Gibbs Oakland Raiders Iron Bowl Super Bowl XXX Glossary of American football Terrell Owens Cricket Super Bowl XXXVII Brett Favre Super Bowl IV Chicago White Sox Cris Carter Professional American football championship games Super Bowl XXXII NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 Super Bowl VIII 2005 English cricket season World Series Green Bay Packers AFC Central Brian Billick Reggie Jackson
