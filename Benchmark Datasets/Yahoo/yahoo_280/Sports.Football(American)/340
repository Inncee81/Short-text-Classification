boomer esiason would he be a hofer with a ring i've been reading questions like if aikman namath or even bradshaw would be in the hall of fame without the rings but what about the opposite situation boomer had one of the strongest arms a master of the play action kept the bengals winning after ken anderson retired and barely lost a super bowl against the comeback kid joe montana legendary qbs marino and elway were not even that closed when they faced montana in the super bowl as a member of the 's all decade team something that hall of famers like marino aikman jim kelly warren moon steve young didn't accomplish an mvp trophy pro bowls and finishing in the top in most passing categories at the time he retired do you think boomer would have made it to hof with a championship ring i mentioned qbs like young and kelly not in the all decade team because they did not make in the s i know some of them did not play in the s which is the equivalent the were not considered among the best in an entire decade boomer was the only one who gave a hard time to the niners in their super bowl victories i think he'd be considered for it with a championship ring he's the best qb to play for the bengals for now and i think a ring might take him over the hump that being said i don't think the players you compared him to were a good choice at all he's a member of the 's all decade team aikman kelly moon and young all had their best years in the 's of course they wouldn't be all decade players for the 's also your super bowl argument is pretty weak boomer went for no touchdowns and one int the only bengal touchdown came on a return the reason people don't remember boomer as the great qb that he was is due to the fact that the great qbs of the 's aikman young elway favre etc were all overshadowing him and his accomplishments of the 's maybe he'd make it in with a ring we'll never know New York Giants Dan Marino Super Bowl XXIV Kansas City Chiefs National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXVI Buffalo Bills John Elway Super Bowl XXI Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXV St. Louis Rams Monday Night Football Super Bowl XXVIII New England Patriots Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XXX Super Bowl XIX Brett Favre Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl VI Super Bowl XXXII Pro Football Hall of Fame Bernie Kosar Super Bowl Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl X Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXXI National Football League Super Bowl XVIII Indianapolis Colts NFL Most Valuable Player Award Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXIX Detroit Tigers NFL playoffs, 1998-99 Super Bowl XVII Joe Montana Denver Broncos American Football League Tennessee Titans Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XV NFL playoffs, 1993-94 Troy Aikman Joe Namath Super Bowl II Super Bowl XII Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl VII Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl VIII September 2005 in sports Boston Red Sox Peyton Manning Jerry Rice NFL playoffs, 1992-93 Al Michaels NFL playoffs, 1994-95 NFL playoffs, 1990-91 Jacksonville Jaguars October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXXVII NFL playoffs, 1995-96 Los Angeles Kings Kurt Warner NFL playoffs, 1989-90 Tom Brady Norway national football team Ravi Shastri NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Stanley Cup Bowl Championship Series
