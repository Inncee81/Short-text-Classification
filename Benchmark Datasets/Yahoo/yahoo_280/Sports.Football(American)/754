what football play made you most depressed i would say being a bills fan is when scott norwood missed the field goal against the giants in superbowl giants bills i probably cried because i was like maybe years old but still i'm still crying about it today ha a wide right special for the bills and most of all i feel bad for scott norwood he was such a great kicker i would have to agree with you on that one being the bills fan that i am i was loving the season with jim kelly thurman thomas and andre reed loved the defense with bruce smith darryl talley and cornelius bennett those were the days i was actually a young kid at that time as well and we were on a vacation trip we were in the car at that time and i specifically requested the radio channel with that game it was very tense but the bills drove all the way down and had the field goal unit ready to win the game then i heard norwood's kick and heard nothing but wide right wide right i was literally crushed inside that car i couldn't believe it i thought it was a fluke or the announcer had said it wrong but it was reality more years of hardship after that with the bills making the super bowl but losing it i wonder if the outcome would've been different for the other super bowls had they won that first one all those good seasons by those bills and no super bowl ring to show for it sad Super Bowl New York Giants Super Bowl XXVIII National Football League Lore Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXXVIII Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XXXIV New England Patriots Super Bowl XXI New York Jets San Francisco 49ers Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl II Super Bowl V Super Bowl VI Super Bowl III Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXXVI Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl IV Super Bowl XXII National Football League Super Bowl XI Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl VII Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XV NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXX Super Bowl VIII Super Bowl XXXII Philadelphia Eagles St. Louis Rams American football NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XX Indianapolis Colts 2005 NFL season Super Bowl XXIX NFL playoffs, 1989-90 Baltimore Ravens Al Michaels Super Bowl XVI Washington Redskins Super Bowl XXXVII Iron Bowl San Francisco Giants Chicago Blackhawks NFL playoffs, 1991-92 NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Janet Jackson San Diego Chargers Poker jargon Kurt Warner Tom Brady Toronto Maple Leafs American Football League New Orleans Saints October 2005 in sports Canadian football NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 September 2005 in sports Newcastle United F.C.
