cowboys steelers in the superbowl i think its about time these teams met again the steelers had a great finish last year going only losing to the ravens but they were both blowouts it could happen i don't know all that much about the cowboys at this point but i here good things i am a steeler fan all you people saying they can't even make the play offs are ridiculous what are you basing this on last season they missed the play offs by one game a couple of losses were directly from muffed punts ben's nearly dying before camp is an ok reason to be a bit off willie parker could have used a little help all fixable is it mike tomlin if you listened to the man i don't think you'd think they are rebuilding every year that's gone by without a first year coach winning the super bowl only means we're one year closer to it happening all you people show your envy of a team with a long history of success and shamefully jump on any reason that the steelers might stumble they might sure but there's no good reason why they should at this point go steelers and the cowboys or any other nfc team that wants to meet us in february Cleveland Browns Super Bowl Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXVII Dallas Cowboys New York Giants Super Bowl X Cincinnati Bengals National Football League Lore Buffalo Bills New England Patriots Indianapolis Colts Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XI New York Jets Super Bowl V Super Bowl XIII Carolina Panthers Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXVI Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXIV Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XXXIX Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XXX St. Louis Rams National Football League Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XIX San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XII Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl XXI November 2004 in sports Professional American football championship games Ben Roethlisberger Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl II Super Bowl XXXVII Tennessee Titans September 2005 in sports December 2004 in sports NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Washington Redskins Super Bowl XVII NBA Finals Kansas City Chiefs Cris Carter Oakland Raiders American Football League Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl I NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl VI New York Knicks January 2005 in sports Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXIX Joe Gibbs Monday Night Football AFC Central Green Bay Packers Terrell Owens Brett Favre Tom Brady 2004 NFL season NFL playoffs, 1996-97 Super Bowl XX Arizona Cardinals Atlanta Falcons Mike Ditka Bowl Championship Series NFL playoffs, 2001-02 1997 NFL season Tampa Bay Buccaneers Bud Adams Iron Bowl Boston Bruins Los Angeles Kings British Columbia Lions Detroit Lions XFL New Orleans Saints 1978 NFL season
