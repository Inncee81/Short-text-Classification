took a hit to the chest while playing football still feeling the injury about a year ago i took a hit to the chest during football practice it did not hurt then but it hurts when i bench press do push ups and even when i sneeze what is it and what do i do to rehab it i can't really answer your question but i can relate a personal experience to you that might shed some light on your situation years ago i was doing some demolition on an old house and i accidentally whacked myself in the chest with a pry bar i had been working for a long while and i was tired and frustrated and levered the pry bar towards myself even though i knew it was a bad idea as it broke free it came back and bashed my body apparently i ended up with a hairline fracture in a rib this injury hurt me for at least two years like you said every time i would do something that would put stress on the area even something as seemingly innocuous as sneezing i would experience pain whenever i would begin to think it was finally healed something else would set it off again you have probably injured a rib possibly near the attachment point where ligaments attach your ribs to your sternum there is nothing you can do to speed the healing process except to try to avoid re injuring the area eventually the area will heal and the pain will be a thing of the past as i said it hurt me for at least years and i was young and healthy with a good ability to recover from injuries a physician told me that i constantly reawakened the pain because i was continually reinjuring the area he said that the only prescription for a rib injury other than ice and a pressure bandage in the first week or so immediately following the initial injury was rest Equine conformation Sternum Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Leon White Weight training Rib Carpal tunnel syndrome Traumatic brain injury First aid Professional wrestling holds Anterior cruciate ligament Spanking Crash test dummy Breastfeeding Brian Close Dead Like Me Alexander Technique Hip fracture Kain (Legacy of Kain) Wound Babe Ruth Scientology beliefs and practices Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Aerial (dance move) Piccolo Junior Saga Tenshinhan Bruise Reflexology The Death Gate Cycle Eddie Guerrero Wild ARMs 2 A Course In Miracles EastEnders The Contender (television series) Narcissism Transactional analysis Football (soccer) Orthopedic surgery Drowning Massage Rei Ayanami Triage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Green Goblin Knife Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Socrates 1957 World Series One Tree Hill (TV series) Simone Weil Marathon (sport) Traditional Chinese medicine Common cold Stuttering Milton H.
