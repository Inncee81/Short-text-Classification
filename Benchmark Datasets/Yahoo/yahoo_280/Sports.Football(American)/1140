could the nfl be rigged this question isnt an easy answer and through cases i will explain why case the patriots win the super bowl after the attack on our country would make sense nfl trying to unite our country even the logo was patriotic picture of an america with red white and blue across it the pats started before and after they went on to win the super bowl completly out of the blue they went the year before case the texans have the first pick in the draft and look clear on taking the best player the draft as seen in years reggie bush hurricane katrina happens they pick williams and the saints whadu know get thier savior reggie bush the go onto have a great season again kind of out of the blue and unite the devestated city these are just a few scenarios but all seem too coincidental to me let me know what you think anything's possible but rigging anything in the nfl would be very difficult it would be possible that a team could intentionally choketo satisfy gamblers ala baseball's black sox but the huge salaries in the nfl and playoff super bowl money make that highly unlikely in addition any such conspiracy theory would require the involvement of dozens if not hundreds of individuals who would have to be absolutely silent to their involvement something i find to be absolutely impossible in today's modern age as to your specific case scenarios case the patriots sometimes the team gets a boost when they substitute in a new qb like the pats did when bledsoe got injured i don't think anyone particulary afc defensive co ordinators knew how good brady was also you have to take into account the fact that the pats upgraded their defense and there really was not a dominant afc team in the post elway afc you are also ignoring the fact that bill bellichek figured out that you shut down kurt warner and the ram's offense by flooding the backfield with db's rather than blitzing all the time case you have to remember that there was a degree of controvery swirling around reggie bush at the time of the draft yahoo news had broken the story that bush received payments from an individual who was going to be his agent the texans must have looked at the situation and decided that there were risks to drafting a player with legal and ethical baggage also there may be a dispute over commissions that the texans would not want to be dragged into St. Louis Rams Cleveland Browns Carolina Panthers New York Jets National Football League Lore Cincinnati Bengals American Football League Dallas Cowboys Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XXXI Indianapolis Colts Miami Dolphins Super Bowl Super Bowl XXVII Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXXIV September 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXVI Denver Broncos San Francisco 49ers Tennessee Titans John Elway Super Bowl XXI 2005 NFL season Super Bowl IX Kurt Warner Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl X Tom Brady Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXV NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Drew Bledsoe World Series Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XIV Boston Red Sox Super Bowl XXXVIII October 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXXIII San Diego Chargers NFL playoffs, 2003-04 American football New York Knicks Super Bowl XXXV New Orleans Saints Toronto Blue Jays Oakland Athletics Super Bowl XI Philadelphia Eagles Brett Favre Major League Baseball television contracts Houston Texans NFL playoffs, 2004-05 January 2005 in sports Super Bowl V Peyton Manning Salary cap Super Bowl XIII Dan Marino Plame affair Washington Redskins Super Bowl XVI NFL Draft Super Bowl XVIII Minnesota Vikings 1919 World Series Super Bowl XVII Monday Night Football Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XX Super Bowl I Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl II Professional American football championship games International League Match fixing Super Bowl XXIII Bud Adams Atlanta Falcons Super Bowl VII Reggie Jackson NFL playoffs Super Bowl XII Chicago White Sox Madden NFL Ben Roethlisberger Cris Carter
