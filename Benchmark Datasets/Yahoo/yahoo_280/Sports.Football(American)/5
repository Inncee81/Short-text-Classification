high school football experts please answer my son is a freshman and is playing football for the st time he is ' and weighs not flabby fat he's really stocky anyway why did the coach make him starting center i think he should have been a tackle considering the fact he's outrun just about everybody on the team as well as his build don't coaches take stuff like that into consideration it's just weird to me that he gave him center seems like a waste here are some of the considerations taken when placing an oline together one your center is usually the leader of your lineman he has to be able to command the guys to his right and left he sets the tone for them second you have to have the physical and mental ability to block in the middle very rarely is there someone lined up right in front of your center so he has to be smart enough to read and pick up a blitz or to shift down and help one of the guards typically your tackles are taller you would want the shorter men in the middle so that they dont interfer with the qb vision downfield and so that they can stay low when firing off the line and attacking down field tackles are almost upright in pass blocking and de's are usually tall as well his speed will actually serve him better at center there is more going on and he will have to move from one spot to the next in a hurry to be effective Glossary of American football American football American football strategy Offensive team Lineman (football) Cincinnati Bengals National Football League Lore New York Giants Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXVII Volleyball New England Patriots Quarterback National Football League Wide receiver Canadian football Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXVI Defensive team Rugby union Kansas City Chiefs Carolina Panthers Football (soccer) Super Bowl XIII San Francisco 49ers Ultimate (sport) New York Jets Official (American football) Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXXIV Water polo Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl X Marching band Super Bowl XIX Miami Dolphins Oakland Raiders Equine conformation Pittsburgh Steelers Yao Ming Super Bowl XVII Tank Combine (Half-Life 2) St. Louis Rams Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XII Ted Hendricks Super Bowl III Super Bowl V Football (soccer) positions TGV Sid Gillman Rugby football Field hockey Baseball Randy Moss Philadelphia Eagles Tight end Rugby union positions Super Bowl XXXIII Badminton Tag Aerial (dance move) Australian rules football Rigging Running back Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl I Tennessee Titans Universal Century Technology Georgia Institute of Technology World Football League Fast bowling Iron Bowl Steve Nash Tom Landry Norway national football team Toronto Raptors Clemson University Second Battle of the Atlantic Speed of light NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Minnesota Vikings Leeds United F.C.
