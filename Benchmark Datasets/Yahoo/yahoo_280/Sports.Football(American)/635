im looking for a favorite nfl team to root for in the nfl i live in ny but i dont like the giants but maybe the jets im a football fan but i dont know what team to root for i used to love the falcons b c of m vick but the dogfightin thing really got me away i really like chad johnson and the bengals and the baltimore ravens can u please help me with this decision perhaps what you should do is look at each division and see if there are any teams that you like based on what their outlook is for this season or the near future and go from there not to knock anyone here but if you start looking for opinions on who to root for most people are going to tell you to root for who they like which may lead to getting some biased opinions vs reviewing the teams for yourself with an unbiased perspective example walk in a sports bar in baltimore and ask which team should i root for what answer do you expect walk into a sports bar in denver ask the same question and what answer do you expect most people are going to tell you to root for whoever they like i would tell you to root for the baltimore ravens but i think you are better off revising what you all ready know about the teams in the league and make up your own mind all though since you seem to be luke warm to the jets i wonder why not just go with one of the ny hometeams that will give you at least opportunities a season attend a live game New York Jets New York Giants Super Bowl Baltimore Ravens Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers New England Patriots Buffalo Bills National Football League Philadelphia Eagles Michael Vick September 2005 in sports Indianapolis Colts Miami Dolphins San Francisco 49ers Carolina Panthers Professional American football championship games Jacksonville Jaguars Kansas City Chiefs Madden NFL Super Bowl XXXV January 2005 in sports Super Bowl V Terrell Owens Canadian Football League Washington Redskins Atlanta Falcons NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl III New Orleans Saints Brett Favre November 2004 in sports AFL-NFL Merger Monday Night Football St. Louis Rams NFL playoffs Pro Football Hall of Fame Super Bowl XII United States Football League Denver Broncos Dallas Cowboys Cris Carter New York Mets National Football League championships NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXI Running back Joe Namath Super Bowl XXV World Series Super Bowl XXVII Montreal Alouettes Sandy Koufax AFC Central Super Bowl XIX New York Yankees Tampa Bay Buccaneers Major League Baseball television contracts Detroit Lions Playoff Super Bowl IV Super Bowl XIV John Elway Minnesota Vikings Oakland Raiders San Antonio Spurs College football American football Super Bowl XXXI International League Super Bowl XIII Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Oakland Athletics Chicago White Sox Satchel Paige San Diego Chargers The NFL Today Ricky Ray National Basketball Association Super Bowl XXIV Baltimore Orioles Chad Johnson Detroit Tigers World Football League Atlanta Braves Negro league baseball
