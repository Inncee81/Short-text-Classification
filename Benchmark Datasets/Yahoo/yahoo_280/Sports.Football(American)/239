i been hearing rumor about john fox and bill cowher do you think bill cowher will come out of retirement to become the head coach of the panther and if so what happens to john fox maybe a offensive or defensive coordinator for panther or maybe my thinking is he'll become the giants head coach bill cowher now lives in carolina so thats the main reason for these rumours everyone says john fox is under pressure for some reason i dont know why he took them to a superbowl after taken over a team whose record was if this happens fox will probably go to the giants because he used to be defensive co ordinater there before he went to the panthers i think cowher would come out of retirement if fox was sacked and fox would become head coach of giants i dont see why the panthers would sack fox so easily though Pittsburgh Steelers Carolina Panthers Cincinnati Bengals New York Giants New England Patriots Jeff Fisher Super Bowl Cleveland Browns Dave Wannstedt San Francisco 49ers Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXXV NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXV New York Jets Kansas City Chiefs Troy Aikman Washington Redskins Florida Panthers Miami Dolphins Joe Gibbs Dallas Cowboys NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXXIX Green Bay Packers St. Louis Rams Charlie Weis Minnesota Vikings Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXI Marv Levy Florida Marlins September 2005 in sports Marty Schottenheimer Dick Vermeil Super Bowl XXXVIII Oakland Raiders Utah Jazz Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XXVII Indianapolis Colts Ben Roethlisberger Los Angeles Clippers Super Bowl XXVI Jim Thorpe Tampa Bay Buccaneers NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Essendon Football Club Toronto Argonauts Super Bowl V Kappa Alpha Psi Toronto Raptors Super Bowl XXIV Bill Belichick Paul Is Dead Bill Parcells Tom Brady American football strategy Dan Marino Super Bowl II New York Knicks Glossary of American football Running back Cris Carter December 2004 in sports Super Bowl XXXIII Romeo Crennel National Football League Lore October 2005 in sports Kurt Warner Leeds United F.C.
