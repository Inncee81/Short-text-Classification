houston nutt we razorback fans for the most part are not very happy with houston nutt and i've heard that if he dose crappy this year he will be let go by whoever sceeds frank broyles or if he wins ten games he'll walk because it would increase his stock to go elsewhere dont know if i buy the one where he walks so any way if we get rid of him where will he go and who will the razorbacks get ive heard talk of butch davis or steve spurrier i am a huge razorback fan and i don't know what is going to happen i think if nutt has a mediocre year he may be gone and if he has a great year and leaves then good bye to him i don't think we would get either davis or spurrier both would be very expensive and the admin at the u of a is cheap and not willing to pay the kind of money it would take to get one of these and most people i know do not like spurrier honestly i do not see nutt going anywhere in the near future his recruiting class is exceptional right now and the future looks really good for the hogs i think we are looking squarely at another years of nutt being the coach sorry to ruin your day still love those hogs though Houston Nutt Arkansas Razorbacks University of Arkansas Washington Redskins Frank Broyles Steve Spurrier Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers Tennessee Titans National Football League Toronto Raptors World Series Buffalo Bills Montreal Canadiens Theory of conduct Washington State University New York Rangers Portsmouth F.C.
