steelers fans what do you think about the new coach how do you think we will do this year and remember steelers rule i think he will do great he will also win coach of the year they will go and will make the playoffs this year if you consider everything that went wrong for them last year they only missed the playoffs by one game last year the steelers lost a few games just because of muffed punts but this year i expect them to have one of the best returners in the league with willie reid being healthy i also think several of their players will have a better year i expect ike taylor to have a breakout season i think he has talent and is becoming more skilled at the corner position i also expect lawernce timmons to play a big part in the steelers defensive with joey porter gone timmons will fill the role of a pass rushing linebacker very well ben roethlisberger is going to be better a quarterback this year he has had a full year to recover from his motorcycle accident ben also said that he usually takes months off in the off season but this year he said he only took weeks off this year this will make him a better quarterback and more resistant to injury the steelers second year players will really shine too santonio holmes will do great last year he showed flashes of greatness i also believe anthony smith will have a good year last year i did not think bill cowher did a good job coaching in all the years i could remember the steelers were always coached very well by cohwer they were always motivated and got very few penalties however last year was different they seemed sloppy and not very well coached however i am not saying that the new coach mike tomlin will be a big improvement his first year but he will not be a big drop off from what cowher was last year however one problem the steelers will have is their secondary there is no doubt that troy polamalu will have another pro bowl season but the other cornerbacks and safeties will have to make a big improvement i think tomlin will help these defensive backs tomlin was the defensive backs coach with the tampa bay buccaneers so my prediction for the steelers this year is this may be a very generous prediction if they make the playoffs anything can happen National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXVII Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XXIV Baltimore Ravens St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXVI Buffalo Bills Kansas City Chiefs September 2005 in sports National Football League Super Bowl XXIII San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XVIII American football Ben Roethlisberger Super Bowl V American football strategy NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl III Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl VII Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XII Jacksonville Jaguars Indianapolis Colts Glossary of American football Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XXII Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl XXXIX November 2004 in sports Super Bowl XXXI Brett Favre Super Bowl XXX Super Bowl I October 2005 in sports Tony Dungy Super Bowl XVII December 2004 in sports January 2005 in sports Super Bowl VI New York Knicks Tennessee Titans Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXXVII Donovan McNabb San Diego Chargers Joe Gibbs Super Bowl XIX NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Super Bowl XXXIII Boston Bruins NFL playoffs, 1982-83 Dan Marino Denver Broncos Running back NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Tampa Bay Lightning XFL Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl II Houston Rockets Super Bowl XXXII Indiana Pacers NFL playoffs, 1997-98 Green Bay Packers Monday Night Football Troy Aikman Terrell Owens Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl XXXVIII Defensive team American Football League Mario Lemieux
