why the lions will win a superbowl within the next three years not really a question i know but head coach rod marinelli won a superbowl as d line coach and asst head coach with the tampa bay buccaneers offensive coordinator mike martz won a superbowl as o coordinator with the st louis rams defensive coordinator joe barry won a superbowl as linebackers coach with the tampa bay buccaneers martz' offense martz was the orchestrator of one of the most productive offenses in nfl history with the rams he turned kurt warner from a guy working at a grocery store to a time league mvp his offense is arguably the most complex in the league and takes at least a year to get fully comfortable with but with the offensive talent the lions have there is no reason they can't become a reincarnation of the rams' offense tampa defense two teams bucs colts have won superbowls with the tampa in the past years with the bears also reaching the superbowl last year running the same defense calvin johnson your thoughts with so many assistant coaches now everybody has at least ring somewhere in there yeah how many teams have a head coach and both coordinators with rings it was vermeil's offense that won the superbowl lol what that's just asinine it was martz's offense everything about it was martz's offense he was the offensive coordinator and he designed the plays the terminology and the schemes and he called the plays how come martz's ram offense fell apart actually he went to the superbowl with the rams his first year as head coach they lost on a last second fg to the patriots and the lions coincidentally haven't done with him there well he's only been there one year and they were actually th in the nfl in passing yds last year despite being sacked more times than the colts saints and packers combined also williams and rogers had shitty attitudes calvin johnson does not and he's twice as good as either of them marinelli is doing the drafting now anyway man it's amazing how little you people know it's like all you know is the lions suck and therefore assume that everyone on the team sucks and that they have no talent the dre bly deal was a great trade dre bly is exactly the type of player rod marinelli is trying to get rid of he's a selfish player who didn't even want to be there he's way overrated too like someone said kitna is plenty good enough brad johnson and trent dilfer won superbowls and neither were as good as kitna i just don't think you guys understand the game of football coaching is more important in football than any other sport one great player cannot win games in the nfl there are guys that all have to work together so if you have just one guy not on the same page you will fail i'm telling you marinelli is one of the best coaches in the nfl there are just not many like him anymore why do you think the bucs refused to let him talk to any teams for years he'll be coach of the year this year simeon rice when talking about rod marinelli you are talking about a man a myth and a legend he evokes thoughts of those who have come before us in the game of coaching there s nothing like him he s definitely one of a kind he s a michelangelo an aristotle a socrates he s a great philosopher he changes coaching to an art form he understands the psyche of man and how to motivate men he understands how to speak to men and how to lead men what he has done for me and my life what he has brought to me and my life words can t describe it by me meeting this man and him being a part of my life for the short time he was he s been able to change my perspectives and my ideas about life the lions are getting much more than a coach they are getting much more than a man they say legends aren t born everyday but the detroit lions are getting one and i salute them if one more of you idiots say anything about the lions not having a quarterback i'm going to report you for stupidity did you not notice jon kitna threw for over yards did you not noticed that he took the bengals to before he was benched for carson plamer if you give this guy time he will rip a secondary in half just look at these stats from last year att comp pct yards tds ints sacked you tell what type of quaterback can put up these numbers gettings sacked a avg of times a game that is not mention all the time he was pressured get that man a line and its all over look at the las season with the bengals when he started i predict the loins make it to the playoff at least twice in the next for years w kitna or whoever it was they drafted as qb i actually a bengals fan so i don't know much except that kitna is a decent qb January 2005 in sports Super Bowl VII Joe Gibbs New York Knicks Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl VI Toronto Argonauts Steve Young
