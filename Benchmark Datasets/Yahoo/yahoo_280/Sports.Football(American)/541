do you think the hatred of notre dame by many fans would decrease if they joined a conference just a thought the big seems like a nice fit fo them considering they play half of the teams in the league anyway your thoughts and by big i meant big its just weird to me that they still call it that when they have schools no i think the reason people hate nd is the media and the fans they both overrate the team when they really aren't that good and they overate them even more when they do have a good team the fans especially are poor losers and winners if they lose they whine and if they win they rub it in whatever happened to saying good game guys instead of you suck Playoff Big East Conference University of Notre Dame Atlantic Coast Conference Bowl Championship Series San Francisco 49ers Donovan McNabb New England Patriots Paul Levesque College basketball Pacific Ten Conference Big Ten Conference College football Troms__ I.L.
