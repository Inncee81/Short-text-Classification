lsu and usc one loss let's say either usc or lsu go the whole season and either one of them ends up with one loss now let's say at team like west virgina boise state or even hawaii go undefeated do you think that they would let lsu and usc play for the championship anyways much like they did to auburn when oklahoma had one loss or do you think that one of those other teams would get there crack at it more to bucs fan so your saying that oklahoma with one loss that year to kansas state at that was in a far more superior conference then undefeated auburn in the sec or was it the fact that usc had domintated auburn in the coliseum and at their house and there was more hype to see them play oklahoma don't dog the pac cause your scared of them the sec is arguably still the strongest conference but the pac is up there either already or about to be at that level we leave it all on the field playing every team in our conference now i know playing a d aa team and sec powerhouses like kentucky vanderbilt ole miss mississippi south carolina and mediocre alabama and georgia is tough but luckily you get to prove yourselves from time to time when you play so save that weak conference bs for your one of your swamp buddies cause the conference of champions is over you persistent whining wv plays in a bcs conference they aren't a mid major like hawaii or boise st other than nd no non bcs school will play for the national title until the system changes but west virginia would definately get the nod over a one loss team Southeastern Conference NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Auburn University USC Trojans Football Houston Nutt Mack Brown 2004 College World Series 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament Louisiana State University Atlantic Coast Conference College rivalry Texas Longhorn Athletics BCS title game Fight song Sam Barry Big East Conference October 2005 in sports State university Boston College Athletics Arkansas Razorbacks College football Tulane University Bear Bryant Pacific Ten Conference University of Alabama College basketball January 2005 in sports Syracuse University Orange November 2004 in sports New York Jets University of South Carolina Joe Paterno March 2005 in sports NCAA Division I-A national football champions State supreme court Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act Pittsburgh Steelers Second Super Bowl New York Giants International League Steve Spurrier Sports Car Club of America Tennessee Titans Cincinnati Bengals U.S. state Boise State University American Football League Oakland Athletics Playoff Current sports events College town Kansas City Chiefs NBA Finals Indiana Pacers Phi Kappa Psi NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Pi Kappa Phi National Historic Landmark September 2005 in sports University of Kentucky Buffalo Bills United States district court Sigma Nu University of Southern California National Football League Indianapolis Colts Minnesota Twins United States Attorney Alpha Gamma Delta Toronto Blue Jays 1984 NBA Draft Clemson University Local access and transport area U.S. House election, 2004 Bud Adams Washington Redskins University of Mississippi Pittsburgh Pirates National Football League Lore Wahoo McDaniel University of Florida Oakland Raiders Bill Goldberg Southern United States Lowest-income counties in the United States U.S. National Cemetery St. Louis Rams Ric Flair Cooperative extension service
