when is brady quinn going to play i'm not particularly thrilled with him was never a notre dame fan but i'm hoping he's able to do something good for my brownies anyway loved that win over kc last night that was great mosely yeah the defense looked good thank god mike we were hoping the same thing he needs to get knocked down hard so we can see if he's able to get back up and keep playing needs to be 'up to snuff' edit no i don't want him knocked down so hard that we lose him for the season just enough to welcome him to nfl football brownp don't forget that amazing yard touchdown by i think his name was berkley loved it quinn will get his first action against the lions as the qb he should see plenty of time in the second half i think charlie frye played an outstanding game for the most part except for the last two minutes of the first half i would not be at all suprised if quinn became the starter a few weeks into the season as of right now i would say frye is the starter until brady takes the job i think derek anderson played himself out of contention last night honestly i think the browns dominated the chiefs joe thomas was every bit as good as advertised jamal lewis looked like the old lewis that steamrolled the browns a few seasons ago i'm definitely glad we have him on our side now antwaan peek looks like a great pick up in free agency the only problem areas i saw were run defense clock management and rookie mistakes overall i am happy with the game i think it is really a step in the right direction Cleveland Browns New England Patriots Pittsburgh Steelers Cincinnati Bengals National Football League Lore Buffalo Bills San Francisco 49ers New York Jets Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXVI Kansas City Chiefs St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XIII Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXV Miami Dolphins Super Bowl V National Football League October 2005 in sports 1957 World Series Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XVII Tom Brady Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl X American football Dallas Cowboys NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl XVIII NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXXV Super Bowl VII American Football League Super Bowl XII Super Bowl III Super Bowl XV Kurt Warner Super Bowl VI September 2005 in sports Super Bowl XVI NFL playoffs, 2003-04 NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Randy Moss Toronto Raptors Minnesota Vikings 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Orlando Magic Wide receiver Denver Broncos Super Bowl XI Indianapolis Colts Detroit Tigers Trent Dilfer Dan Marino Super Bowl XIV Ricky Ray New York Knicks Philadelphia Eagles November 2004 in sports Ty Cobb January 2005 in sports Super Bowl IV Brett Favre Glossary of American football Super Bowl I Iron Bowl Washington Redskins Toronto Argonauts Indiana Pacers Celtic F.C.
