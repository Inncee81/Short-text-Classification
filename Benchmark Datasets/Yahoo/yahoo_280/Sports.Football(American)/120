if vick get ban from the nfl do you think he will still be involved with dog fighting i hope not if he is guilty he should be ban from having or being near any animals what a sicko i don't think this is a stupid question kobe this has been my main concern in this entire ordeal to see to it that michael vick will never have the ability to do this to another animal money is the answer i hope his attorneys deplete his funds and the falcons find a clause where they can end his contract and not have to pay him another cent also there is a chance they may be able to force michael vick to repay some of the money they have already paid him i am hoping that arizona as it has been reported will charge him as well mostly for the purpose of forcing him to pay more attorney fees i hope he does some jail time but i believe it is essentially more important to get the money out of his hands if he doesn't have the funds he surely cannot run a dogfighting ring and also he wouldn't have the funds for betting on other dogfights i am with you on another point as well i hope part of his sentence is that he is never allowed to own another dog again 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Blackjack Evan Mecham Michael Vick NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Poker jargon Contract Plame affair Katelyn Faber Schabir Shaik Trial Match fixing Philadelphia Eagles George W.
