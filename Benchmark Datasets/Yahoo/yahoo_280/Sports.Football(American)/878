your projected top fantasy rbs and qbs for the upcoming season my rankings would be qbs p manning brady palmer mcnabb brees rbs lt gore alexander s jackson lj anyone got different thoughts especially for top qb and rb i think your top quarterbacks are right but your rankings are all jumbled haha qb peyton brady mcnabb palmer brees my runningbacks are a little different i have alexander above gore mostly because i think gore will get injured at some point i left lj off of this list for various reasons first he hasn't been in camp second i keep hearing very good things about kolby smith and i think he will sneak some carries from lj this year and i also think he is a big reason why the chiefs are not concerned about resigning johnson he's going to be very good you heard it here first rb lt steven jackson alexander gore parker i know what you all are thinking you dropped gore down for injury risks and yet you kept mcnabb up there valid criticism my reasoning is that i really think mcnabb has had some rotten luck the past few years his injury last season was not one that looked as if he would never play again a freak accident and after watching him in training camp i'm convinced he's just as good as he ever was i think gore will miss time towards the end of the season aka the playoffs when you need him most New England Patriots September 2005 in sports Donovan McNabb Pittsburgh Steelers NFL playoffs, 2003-04 NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Carolina Panthers New York Knicks Super Bowl XXI Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXXVI Buffalo Bills Peyton Manning Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXXVIII NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Madden NFL Super Bowl XXXIX New York Giants Doug Flutie Super Bowl XXII NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Drew Brees Super Bowl XIII Daunte Culpepper Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXV San Francisco 49ers Miami Dolphins Bernie Kosar October 2005 in sports Neighbours Steve Young (athlete) Dallas Cowboys Iron Bowl Boston Bruins Days of our Lives Los Angeles Kings American football Futurama (TV series - season 5) Knots Landing Columbine High School massacre Vince Young Brian Close December 2004 in sports Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XIV Norway national football team 1957 World Series Crystal Palace F.C.
