how to reproduce a painting i am painting a commissioned illustration in the future i think i may want to reproduce it for sale what should i do with it before i turn the original over to the new owners this is not about who has the rights to it this is just about the physical method to reproduce it in the future what kind of company do i take it to lithograph thanks no body does lithographs anymore the new printing is done with large format digital printers colors one at a time on canvas or watercolor paper depending on the medium the art work was originally done on these are called gicless and are printed out in far better reproductive quality than ever before dpi in archival inks you want a x transparency made or get a digital scan done on a cruse scanner which is a large flat bet not a drum scanner it will cost you between for x scan this is what professional artist do and a square foot to print the art even if you have a transparency approx cost it has to be scanned to be reproduced and you will not get the accuracy of a cruse scan you can use a expensive digital camera with a high dpi rating and good lighting for a digital file also you are looking for a company that makes gicless like que imaging in houston texas or harvest productions in la the great thing about gicless is you can order one and take orders off of it and only worry about more if you sell it Digital photography Image scanner Dots per inch Photography Konica Minolta Pixel Digital camera Traditional animation Television Drawing Inkjet printer Color Fax Computer printer Optical character recognition Dot matrix printer Digital rights management 2D computer graphics M.C.
