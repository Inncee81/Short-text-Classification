is it illegal to draw something that's copyrighted and distribute sell it say i draw an anime character and distribute sell it to my friends and or other people would that be considered illegal because i didn't get the permission of the owner of the copyrighted character if that is illegal why can people draw copyrighted characters and sell them at anime conventions i'm confused yes it's absolutely illegal all of it it's only legal to distribute copyrighted material if you're not making a profit on any of it such as a literary piece that has been distributed for educational purposes anything that's been created if you created it an idea song picture illustration software poem or movie and you took the trouble to have it copyrighted and protected for you to sell exclusively and someone else copied your idea i think you would take legal action especially if they profited off your idea technically the people selling stuff at conventions that you see as apparently not having permission from the owner of these characters are engaging in illegal activity and if you purchase those items you are supporting them similar to purchasing a pirated dvd Copyright Intellectual property Copyright infringement of software Copyright infringement Warez Digital rights management SCO v.
