why does abstract art sell for as much as figurative art this has always puzzled me why does abstract art sell for as much as or more than figurative art whenever i go into an art gallery or art auction i'm always blown away by the price tag put on the abstract art there much of the work is very simple so much so that someone just starting out with art could have created it as an illustrator i've had to spend literally thousands of hours practicing to get my skills where they are today i find it disheartening to see abstract pieces selling for as much or more than pieces which obviously have years of effort and dedication behind them i feel it cheapens the artist's efforts to consider their work as equal is that wrong why is abstract art not cheaper interesting question i think part of the blame lies with the consumers of the art itself abstract art is seen as much more fashionable than figurative more traditional style painting so the yuppies are willing to pay much more even the academies traditionally a sort of mecca for all aspiring artists have become omewhat dated over the years also just because there is obviously years of dedication behind some of these figurative works it doesn't necessarily mean that there is little effort in abstract works just that it is less obvious i have to say however that some of the stuff nowadays is tripe to put it politely many of the winners of the turner prize are so worthless it's unbelievable Wassily Kandinsky Labor theory of value Art Modernism Auction J.
