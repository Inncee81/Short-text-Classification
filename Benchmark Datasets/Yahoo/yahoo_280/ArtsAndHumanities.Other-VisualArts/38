monsters gnomes and weird creatures in d why i've begun learning d maya for the advertising industry but when i look up images on sites like yahoo or google for d artworks done by other artists all i see is weird looking creatures monsters and gnomes why do people like these things they're just so hideous and ugly to look at and do people actually pay for these type of images and most of the online tutorials focus on building these hideous things and i'm so sick of them does d mainly cater to nerds and geeks sorry for the harsh words but i'm just slightly annoyed i take your point but not all d artists do this sort of thing have you seen for instance http www raph com dartists artgallery ag ap php aid image Nerd PHP Spyware Website Frankenstein's monster NetHack ASCII art Python programming language Slashdot trolling phenomena Yu-Gi-Oh!
