do you despise minced whitefish editing i am drawing an analogy between tv programme editing and fish products on the one hand you get lovely long interesting substantial chunks that you can feast your eyes and metaphorically your teeth on and on the other you get just a mass of shredded little tiny bits of minced whitefish none of which last even as long as a full second and instead of giving you a visual area to explore at your leasure while you listen to the commentary you're battered by a blizzard of tiny cuts that make you feel like youve gone ten rounds with mike tyson after just a couple of minutes of the programme for the second time in two days ive had to turn the t v off because i cant stand being visually abused or visually raped by an intrusive editor is the minced whitefish editing style only suitable for the low attention span retard audience that watches mtv and should programmers sack talentless editors who just try to conceal their lack of talent behnd qikstyle yes i cannot stand that it is hard to watch they are trying to make it dynamic i suppose but are just not succeeding in other words their talent is still in hiding and they may not need to be hired by the hotshot companies until it comes out of its box a very interesting and true analogy Visual Basic Have I Got News For You Drill bit Kylie Minogue Mike Tyson Boxing Extreme Programming Euphemism Sound effect BASIC programming language IBM PC compatible Time Out of Mind PNG Gospel of Thomas Milton H.
