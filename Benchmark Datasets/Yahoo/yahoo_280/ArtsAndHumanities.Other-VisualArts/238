what is the role of visual communication in architecture i don't know if i fully understand your question but i will take a stab at it i guess my answer will be no worse for lack of details i think that in order to be appealing the work of an architect should visually communicate what was intended from the person having it built if i go to an architect to have my dream house designed but i really don't have an idea of what it should look like other than what i know it shouldn't look like the architect should be able to design a structure that is both what i want as well as what i don't want otherwise what is the point or you can ask yourself what do you think of when you see the sydney opera house that is one of the most recognized structures on earth for what it attempts to visually communicate to anyone who looks at it when i look at it i think of tall sailing ships with their masts of sails and when you look at its location i can't help but think the architect that designed it intended for it to visually communicate its connection with the sea to anyone who looks at it gone are the days when an architect simply built a box for people to either live or work in i think the demand for architects to visually engage the people for which they design is higher now than ever before and the sydney opera house is a perfect example in my opinion Sydney Opera House Architect Theory of conduct Gothic Revival architecture Rigging Biblical inerrancy World's tallest structures Wardenclyffe Tower Naval architecture CPU cache Freedom Tower Le Corbusier Intelligent design Palladian architecture StarCraft Episode VI Theodicy Object-oriented programming Radio masts and towers Aphasia Tudorbethan architecture Plame affair Skyscraper Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Frank Lloyd Wright Irish Houses of Parliament Ludwig Mies van der Rohe Sailing Sail-plan Architecture timeline The Matrix Reloaded United States Capitol The Fountainhead Parliament House, Canberra Stalinist architecture Battle of Trafalgar Giles Gilbert Scott Frank Gehry Louis Sullivan Sydney Harbour Bridge Classical order Manifold Sydney Francis Petre Sailing ship Art Gothic architecture Dundas Square New Urbanism Robert Lawson (architect) McKim, Mead, and White Harry Seidler God Emperor of Dune Firefly (television series) Oscar Niemeyer Evangelicalism Ship Discordianism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Philip Johnson Extreme Programming A Course In Miracles Paul W.
