what do you think is the best astrolodical sign to be born into and why capricorn aguarius virgo taurus leo cancer gemini sagitttarius aries libra pisces scorpio please don't just say because i was born into it nelly interesting point but can one could argue that not all months because a woman is only pregnant for months so how would you justify that we're all born under exactly the right combination of planets in signs to give us the skills we need to navigate our way through our present lifetimes remember too that we're all combinations of all twelve signs even if you don't have planets in a certain sign it's still there in your natal chart can't just skip a sign edit when you look at your birth chart it's a wheel comprised of twelve houses in which the twelve signs reside example my sun is in sagittarius in the fourth house however the sign on my fourth house cusp is scorpio sagittarius actually rules my th house capricorn rules the th aquarius the th pisces rules my th house and even though i have no planets in pisces the fact that it's there on the cusp of my th means that i express piscean energy in the area of my life that has to do with the th house house of death and regeneration also legacies and inheritances and psychic powers and occult studies so you see your birth chart is like a pie that has been divided into twelve slices and most of the time each of the twelve signs is going to be on one of the house cusps sometimes a sign is intercepted within a house meaning that it's completely contained within a house and doesn't touch a house cusp at all the sign cusps are all degrees apart the house cusps vary in distance to each other therefore even if there is no planet within a certain sign at the time of your birth that sign's energy will still be expressed through the house that it resides in no one is purely one sign alone does that make sense to you Zodiac The Twelve Labours Western astrology Medical astrology Solar system in astrology Ruling planet Birthday Capricornus Virgo Sabbat (neopaganism) Pisces Scorpius Aquarius Cancer (constellation) Wheel of the Year Sister Princess Libra Gemini Aries Leo Taurus (constellation) Sagittarius Astrology Solar Element Saga Mithraism Star of Bethlehem Astronomy on Mars W.I.T.C.H.
