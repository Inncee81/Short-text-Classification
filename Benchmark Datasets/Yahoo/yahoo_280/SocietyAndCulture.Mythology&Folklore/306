who do you think is the king of the jungle the lion or the ape my little brother was watching lion king and said to me that the gorilla could be the king of the jungle also i always thought the lion was the king but i m not sure hate to be honest but there's no lions in any jungle anywhere that term is only a playful term and lions actually roam prairies or savannahs as they're called in africa but lemme think about this i'd have to say that this term usually relates to 'what eats more of what' since lions eat everything they have the title gorillas would be deathly fearful of lions who can do serious damge to any gorilla lions are bigger than you think gorillas also while they can do eat meat don't set out hunting for it and attach other animals like a lion so you can't set a gorilla as king although they do live in 'jungles' technically a leopard or big jungle cat would technically be 'king' of a jungle a lion by the way frequently gets its rear end kicked up down sideways from everything from giraffes elephants who should qualify for 'king' water buffalo as a recent viral video shows in spades crocs snakes groups of hyenas and in fact anything of size strength and with some horns it ain't easy trying to kill something that can fight back and cripple maim you for trying but a lion has the sexy mane and it looks enough like a 'crown' to a european passing through on an expedition to assimilate that human characteristic of bygone 'royal' europe and today tell your brother though the toughest animal is the hippo giant nile crocodiles don't mess with crocs or their babies out of fear of them lions can't say that hippos also can kill eat meat when they want their jaws are powerful they are heavy strong if elephants weren't pure plant eaters they'd take the title but hippos are really it however we will always call lions the king because like actors parts in movies that aren't actually real' but look real enough a lion looks the part of king think about it who would go to a movie broadway play called the hippo king Lion Timon and Pumbaa Taikyoku shogi Tai shogi Disney's Animal Kingdom Mountain Gorilla Leopard Meat The Lion King Crocodile Nile crocodile Gray Wolf Lycanthropy Largest organism Elephant Puma Hippopotamus Dai dai shogi Animal Monster Rancher monsters Tyrannosaurus rex One Piece minor characters Giraffe RuneScape quests Tenjiku shogi Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ape Gorilla Cat Brown Bear Chu shogi Age of Mythology Unicorn Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Madagascar (film) Tarzan (1999 film) Carnivore Maximal (Transformers) SuperCroc Shark Snake Bristol Zoo Shaggy dog story Kimba the White Lion Bushmeat Fox Feature Syndicate Who Framed Roger Rabbit Mowgli The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Transformers: Cybertron Rugby union positions Taboo food and drink Super Mario Bros. television series Fictional crossover Humphrey Bogart Cattle Dai shogi Zords in Power Rangers: Wild Force Bigfoot Animaniacs Panthera hybrid Professional wrestling throws Care Bears Hunting Bloody Roar Orca The Late Show with David Letterman Hybrid The Jungle Book (1967 film) Jane Goodall Water Buffalo Endangered species Devil Fruit Batman: The Animated Series Meta-reference Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Jungle Action Sly Cooper YuYu Hakusho Crocodilia The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Poker jargon Orc (Warhammer) Dinosaur War elephant TaleSpin Holocene extinction event Conan the Barbarian
