help pls this woman from the philippines has placed or seen a mangkukulam get myman how can i get it off him hi i need help from someone who would know how to get this spell off of my man that this woman from the philippines has put or maybe seen a mangkukulam to do it for her and no everyone im not just in denial of a man who just left me for another woman we live in the u s a and she was living there in the philippines but she has found some way to get him to marry her and to make a long story short now she's here i am dead serious about my question and i am not a phycho in denial that's why i search for the answer to my question from the philippines because only they would know that im not kidding that is the sort of thing some people do there ive been with this man for years and all of the sudden this im open to tell you more if you believe that you can help me i'm filipino and i believe you i have seen the so called mangkukulams in our country who do these things and also undo these things in order to remove the spell you need to get hair from your man and the woman and some personal items of them both like clothing and bring it to one of the mangkukulams here so he can determine who was the mangkukulam who did the spell sounds kind of creepy but i swear on my grandfathers grave that filipinos know of their existence but consider the dark arts to be taboo if they use their powers for good they are called manggagamot or in english healer and if for evil they are the mangkukulam you need to see a healer here the mangkukulams are usually from the island of siquijor here in the philippines i believe there is a chance that the mangkukulam who did the spell is on that island or came from there if you need more help or have more questions e mail me at chuck torres yahoo com Philippine mythology Family name Lodge Committee Siquijor Philippine English Religion in the Philippines Aswang Philippines Palanca Awards Demographics of the Philippines Manananggal Filipino people Latin alphabet Darken Rahl Filipino language The Inside Manila Socrates Incarnations of Immortality Animism Aes Sedai Ethnic groups of the Philippines Hiberno-English Inuit mythology Social rule 613 mitzvot Theory of conduct Charmed Saruman Gender-neutral language Glen Jacobs Music of the Philippines Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Nicomachean Ethics Phaedo Angel (vampire) Witchcraft Australian English Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bislama University of the Philippines Arthur Schopenhauer Sugo Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Martial art Psychic surgery Pools of Darkness Iberian naming customs Elves (Elfquest) Hash table Vivian Solon The Amber Spyglass Presidential system Magical objects in Harry Potter Miss Universe Spanish language Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Genealogy Philippines at the 2004 Summer Olympics Priest (World of Warcraft) Simone Weil Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Hispanic culture in the Philippines Library catalog Sola fide Chuck Palahniuk Quest for Glory Juliana of the Netherlands Negros Oriental Philippine peso Magic (Harry Potter) Phoebe Halliwell Yeshu Malay people Joke Old English language Southeast Asia Resident Evil (film) Strap-on dildo Cross-dressing Death Euphemism Mail-order bride Black (people) Slayers Shamanism Same-sex marriage Current teachings of Prem Rawat Non-native pronunciations of English Iglesia ni Cristo Limit Break Cardcaptor Sakura Shaman King Spells of Dungeons & Dragons Battle of the Philippine Sea Extreme Programming Territory of Hawaii Professional wrestling match types Mestizo
