ghosts has any one ever had sex with a ghost just wondering but i mean how gullable can people get that was a sarcastic question not me but there was an interview with anna nicole smith and she claimed to have had sex with a ghost but we all know how anna turned out she has now passed away from sleeping pills so it couldhave been another illusion but i find this stuff fascinating mainly the ghosts not the banging them part and there was a special on tv i believe the history channel and people claimed to have been raped tortured and tourmented by ghosts beccause only evil ghosts will have sex with you apperently so i don't reccomend it not that i'm crazy or anything i have no clue how real or not real this stuff is but i none the less find it fascinating Days of our Lives Anna Nicole Smith The Venture Bros.
