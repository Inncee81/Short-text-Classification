whats your take on black and white magic when does magic become a black how far do you have to go can i use magic for anything and do i have to have candles and draw pentacles or can i soley rely on energy magick is not black or white it just is it's like electricity it can be wonderfully helpful or it can kill you it's how it is used that makes it positive or negative generally what is termed black magick is anything that interferes with another person's free will so many many things fall into that definition of black magick in that broad definition love magick when used to manipulate a specific person and domination magick getting the boss to promote you when generally you don't get along making someone bend to your will would count as black magick black magick could be limited to magick that causes specific malicious harm to someone so anything causing emotional mental spiritual or physical distress of any kind would fall under that definition however in some cultures black magick is only malicious magick that is cast without just cause for instance a killing spell would be justified if it was cast against someone who raped your wife girlfriend sister daughter etc but jinxing someone who simply rubbed you the wrong way would be black magick ethics are a very personal thing and one that everyone and especially any magickal practitioner should think long and hard about before beginning to cast anything Magic (paranormal) Witchcraft Wicca Abortion debate Evil Scientology beliefs and practices Neuro-linguistic programming L.
