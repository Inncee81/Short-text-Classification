is too much watermelon bad for the kidneys i love watermelon just love it to bits and since it's now in season i am enjoying it thoroughly i can eat half a melon in one day makes me pee a lot though of course the water just goes right through this brings me to my question concern is eating a lot of watermelon hard on the kidneys after all they deal with all that water don't they i mean it is just water yes but still i'd just like to know eating lots of watermelon makes you pee a lot the kidneys must 'clean the toxins' out of your body and put them 'into' the water that you pass as pee there are extremely few toxins in watermelon so no eating lots of watermelon is not 'bad' for your kidneys and since 'more water' is usually much better than 'less water' as long as you aren't taking in enough 'fluid' to 'drown from the inside' roughly gallons or more of liquid daily over several days you'll be fine and have a piece for me too i love watermelon and can eat a 'whole one' every day too but it's only a 'seedless mini melon' and not a 'huge watermelon' i can't eat that much of anything anymore Watermelon Urine Dialysis Kidney Jewish cuisine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dieting Theory of conduct Kit Kat Vampire Melon Time Out of Mind Fecal incontinence Skateboarding trick Coconut crab Toilet humour Social rule The Fairly OddParents Foodborne illness Water Cantonese cuisine Escherichia coli O157:H7 Brewery Jackass: The Movie Piccolo Junior Saga Common bean Kodocha Super Mario Sunshine Elis Prefecture Gastroparesis Bong Opportunity rover Andravida The Curse of Fenric Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fruit Kenny McCormick Diarrhea Folic acid El Chavo del Ocho Casting Equine conformation Teller-Ulam design Dry cleaning Sampling (music) Characters in the Smurfs Ocean thermal energy conversion Crohn's disease Uranium Caving Pikmin Vitamin C Raisin Colchicine Akatsuki (Naruto) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Drill bit Fancy rat Diabetes insipidus The Regina Monologues Ranma __ characters Clean animals Lou Gehrig Frog Hepatitis Nephron Drowning Son Goku (Dragon Ball) 613 mitzvot Blood Shaggy dog story Renal physiology Kt/V Morning Musume Chappelle's Show Fugu Little Britain Urinary system Fasting Rocko's Modern Life Melvin Van Peebles Gatorade RuneScape quests Camp Lazlo Kimi Finster Halitosis Depleted uranium Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
