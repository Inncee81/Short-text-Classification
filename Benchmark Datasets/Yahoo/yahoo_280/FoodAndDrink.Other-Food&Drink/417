fruit veggie i've always thought that tomatoes were a vegetable but i've been hearing that they are a fruit they say it has seeds so it's a fruit and it's grown from a vine from the ground so it's a veggie what is it becca it is a fruit though it probably taste like a veggie is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable the confusion about 'fruit' and 'vegetable' arises because of the differences in usage between scientists and cooks scientifically speaking a tomato is definitely a fruit true fruits are developed from the ovary in the base of the flower and contain the seeds of the plant though cultivated forms may be seedless blueberries raspberries and oranges are true fruits and so are many kinds of nut some plants have a soft part which supports the seeds and is also called a 'fruit' though it is not developed from the ovary the strawberry is an example as far as cooking is concerned some things which are strictly fruits may be called 'vegetables' because they are used in savoury rather than sweet cooking the tomato though technically a fruit is often used as a vegetable and a bean pod is also technically a fruit Fruit Flowering plant Berry Strawberry Watermelon Vegetarianism Peanut Orange (fruit) Date Palm Banana Pea Cuisine of Denmark Organic food Pollination Sweetcorn Pumpkin Seed French cuisine Breakfast Antioxidant Kiwifruit Pie Maize Sauce Capsicum Black pepper Pachypodium brevicaule MRE Hamburger Dumpling Perfume Hamster Blueberry Vanilla German cuisine Carpel Legume Roman eating and drinking Drupe Plant Ginkgo Squash (fruit) Cucumber Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Malaysia Flax Apple Food Genetically modified food Pachypodium baronii Loganberry Garden Strawberry Luther Burbank Coriander Pomegranate Vegetative reproduction Fanta Curry Basil Almond Cereal Cuisine of Singapore VeggieTales Ketchup Rambutan Soup Cashew Frugivore Apricot Nut (fruit) Cajun cuisine Lima bean Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Pachypodium bicolor Chili con carne Okra Tofu Flower Chocolate Coffea arabica Cuisine of Africa Morphology of Pachypodium Chile pepper Fennel Coconut Food preservation Rice
