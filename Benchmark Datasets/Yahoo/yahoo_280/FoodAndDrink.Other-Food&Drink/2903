instead of eating a regular healthy meal evry hours or so could i eat salada evry hours i hvae good apetite i am ' adn weigh pounds would it beokay to eat a leaf romaine salad with lemon juice and salt evry hours or so okay this is a sports and fitness question more than anything to do with food with that said i think i can answer your question you raise two very important questions here how often should i eat what should i eat first and foremost i don't think that eating the salad you described in the manner you described is going to be at all healthy all lettuce varieties have very little nutritional value a lettuce leaf is water there are some terpenoids odor chlorophyl color and cellulose the cellulose will look to your body very much like white sugar lettuce is a very simple carbohydrate and by volume not very much of that either your body actually consumes more calories digesting lettuce than the lettuce itself will provide salads are not a very good meal the right salad ingredients can add a little fiber but very little else of actual benefit furthermore the chlorophyl isn't the healthiest thing in the world and in some instances has been investigated as a carcinogen i suspect your question isn't as much about what to eat as much as it is about how often to eat no the human body should be fed on a need basis only as most people don't need their food on exact three times per day intervals eating smaller meals more frequently over the course of the day is a much healthier way to eat a person who eats or small meals per day is going to be much better off than someone who follows the old squares a day routine humans evolved to be very good at starving one way we developed to cope with sporadic food supply is to store food energy for times when it will be needed and food is unavailable sating your hunger every time you are hungry teaches the body that it will always have food when it wants it doing this will move your metabolism away from a storage mode and into a more on demand mode think of it as your body saying to itself okay i know there is more food coming so i guess it's alright to let myself be done for now eating a largish meal three times per day will lock your metabolism into panic mode you are eternally storing food for that biological rainy day lettuce is the enemy its fine as a garnish or as a side salad but you might as well just eat a couple of teaspoons of white sugar it is the same thing if you are trying to adopt this healthier on demand style of food intake there are better things to eat a simple way to start is to decrease your portion sizes with your three big meals per day add a bit of between meal complex carbohydrate eating and slowly wean your body off of regimented eating carbo's are important for this type of diet as long as they are of the complex variety found in unprocessed grains they are turned into sugar in the body which is the fuel your system runs on cutting carbs out as part of an intense diet can be okay but the idea is that you are trying to reduce body fat there where as you don't appear to have this issue you'd be better served by making darn sure you are getting enough carbohydrate in your diet starving the body of these carbs can exacerbate this storage mode to which i spoke earlier gotta have fuel in the tank at all times as i said above start reducing the size of your big three add some carbs i like the cliff brand supplemental bar for this it's easy and you don't have to think about it do this for a few months until your body adjusts then you can drop the cliff bars and trade them for things that suit your taste better the answer to your question then is no it would not be okay additionally any more than about mg a day of table salt is bad for your blood pressure a limit you would surely exceed with this plan furthermore the citric acid in the lemon juice is a natural diarrhetic and will just flush the already tiny amounts of nutrition yielded by the lettuce right on out the back door so to speak you literally would be served just as well by opening up a bag of white sugar and eating that Omega-3 fatty acid Tooth Insulin Carburetor Healthy
