what is the difference between pastry flour cake flour bread flour and regular flour i always wondered what the difference was between these fours and would it make a difference if i substituted the specialty flours with regular flour the main difference is protein content flavor can also be different between flours such as whole wheat which still contains the germ and endosperm and rye corn of all the grains wheat is the most important to the baker because it produces a flour that is capable of determining the textures of a baked product wheat flour all purpose or bread flour for instance is the basis of most yeast raised doughs wheat flours contain a high percentage of protein which gives a good texture to lean doughs although milled wheat contains about percent starch and only to percent protein it is the protein that affects the personality of a bread cake or pie pastry the two proteins in flour gliadin and glutenin are mixed with water then subjected to kneading their long gangly molecules coil and wrap around each other creaqting gluten an invisible superstructure in the dough this matrix is strong enough to stretch and then capture the carbon dioxide as the leavening dough rises the more of these protein a flour contains the tougher or rubbery the dough will be with enough kneading cake flour soft flour this is the lowest protein flour available to consumers pastry flour is another low protein flour that some bakers find works well in cakes and pastries unbleached all purpose flour at the oposite end of the flour spectrum are the higher protein flours which are usually reserved for bread making these higher protein flours are usually unbleached the bleaching process reduces the amount of protein this is the average supermarket flour with an average protein content of actually this flour is not all purpose as it does not make good cakes and pastries all purpose flour this flour is a blend of soft and hard wheat flours it can be used for cakes pastries and breads however professional bakers know its mid ranged protein content which varies from to percent is actually a little too high for silky cakes and a little low for hearty breads durum flour made from a variety of hard wheat durum makes an interesting addition to breads but it is primarilyused to make pasta dough rye flour this is milled for use in breads and crackers this grain's gluten lacks the extensibility of wheat so it won't produce loafty loaves in its own it is also slightly sticky even after kneading for bread it is usually mixed with about percent white flour although there are scandinavian recipes that make very dense rye bread from whole kernels other grains can be used in baking but because they have low protein and gluten contents they are usually augmented with white flour spelt kamut corn buckwheat actually more closely related to rhubarb than wheat and chestnuts not a grain are ground and added to baked goods you can sub specialty flour for allpurpose but know the more you do the more dense your product will be for cakes you want more cake flour than higher protein flours for rye and corn mixes of flour which has very little protein you will want a higher percentage of bread or bleached all purpose flours incorporated with them enjoy Food Tofu Japanese cuisine Alcoholic beverage Experiment Pancake Beer Cuisine of Denmark Coeliac disease White bread Breakfast Cake Cheese Carbon dioxide Rice Dumpling Brewing Sugar Maize Ice cream Alcohol fuel Muffin Bagel Food preservation Cider Bengali cuisine Tortilla Pumpernickel bread Kosher foods Honey Biochemistry Winter wheat XML Gasoline Puff pastry Seitan Mooncake Vodka Milk E85 Soybean Empanada Cuisine of Greece Coffee Scotch whisky Veganism Polish cuisine Global warming and agriculture Organic food Hemp Starch Microeconomics Naan Hypoglycemia Peruvian cuisine Dim sum Cookware and bakeware Cuisine of the Southern United States Cookie Barley Portland cement Wood Biodiesel Cheesecake Korean cuisine Explosive material Cuisine of Austria Folic acid Protein Rum Agriculture Fermentation Glutinous rice Pita Barbecue Cuisine of Argentina Arepa Magnesium Supply and demand Cuisine of Brazil Yeast (baking)
