if i made a burger out of hot dog pieces would it be a burger or a hotdog the hot dog is all beef there are burgers made out of products that are not beef turkey burgers bacon burgers that depends is it a beef hot dog if so i believe that if you ground up the beef hot dog it would in fact be a hamburger if you were to put it on a hamburger bun however if the hot dog in question is pork or turkey then it cannot be classified as a hamburger regardless of the type of bun you put it on because a hamburger is typically beef but i guess there is nothing that says you cant call it a turkey or pork burger but the above cases are under the assumption that the meat was to be ground up if it is just pieces of hotdog dropped on a bun beef pork or turkey it would be a hot dog sandwich right Hamburger Hot dog Burger Sandwich McDonald's Cuisine of Denmark MRE Burger King Barbecue Fast-food restaurant German cuisine Japanese cuisine In-N-Out Burger D__ner kebab A&W Restaurants Discordianism Sausage Surimi Bacon Dumpling Beef Breakfast Dim sum Takeru Kobayashi Korean cuisine Cajun cuisine Cuisine of the Midwest Meat Meat analogue Soul food Vegetarianism Cheeseburger Sloppy joe Escherichia coli O157:H7 Cuisine of Vietnam Bratwurst Lisa the Vegetarian Chili con carne Croquet (food) Chicago, Illinois Polish cuisine Taco Bell Cheesesteak Shawarma Big Mac Fallacy Foodborne illness Ramen Fish and chips Pork Gyros Chicago-style hot dog Cantonese cuisine Steak n Shake French cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Cha chaan teng National dish Where's the beef?
