balanced course meal for a teenager i've got to plan and prepare a balanced course meal for a teenager and i have no idea what to do what would you consider to be a balanced course meal for a teenager one that's preferably easy to cook help thanks well begin by eliminating all foods that your subject teenager cannot eat things forbidden by allergy religion and so on follow up by removing from your list of possibilities anything that your subject finds disgusting if in doubt eliminate animal entrails liver kidneys chitterlings etc strong smelling items certain cheeses and so on and keep it simple balance is a bit overrated in my opinion keep things healthy and balance will 'happen' whether it is done on a daily weekly or even monthly basis young people in particular always seem to get enough vitamins minerals and proteins it's the sugars and fats you should steer away from you didn't say 'which' meal but as breakfast and lunch are not usually thought of or prepared in courses i am assuming you mean dinner young people are not generally familiar with the concept of the 'soup salad fish meat etc etc ' structure of dining in any case so i wouldn't stand too heavily on that a nice colorful salad with something mildly out of the ordinary in it pine nuts dried cherries or an interesting cheese would be a good starter follow with something simple beef pork or chicken quickly cooked with a little garlic butter perhaps a side dish of noodles or potatoes and a steamed vegetable that adds color flavor and 'balance' all of these are familiar and will form a good healthy meal with low risk of rejection and while it may violate the course dictum dessert is quite popular this might be as simple as ice cream or sorbet or as complicated as your time skills and budget will allow best wishes Jewish cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Cantonese cuisine Tofu Cuisine of the Southern United States Meal Veganism Barbecue Peruvian cuisine Bengali cuisine Ramen Soul food Cajun cuisine Korean cuisine Vegetarianism Cuisine of Laos MRE Cuisine of Brazil McDonald's Roman eating and drinking Chicken soup British cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Milk Chinese cuisine Soup Polish cuisine Food preservation French fries American Chinese cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Cuisine of Greece Cuisine of Africa Russian cuisine Pizza Chili con carne Dumpling Potato Dieting Hamburger Omega-3 fatty acid Cuisine of Thailand Fish and chips Serbian cuisine Organic food Sandwich Cuisine of Cambodia Egg (food) Soy protein Curry Ice cream Domesticated turkey Taboo food and drink Vitamin C Irish cuisine Cuisine of Austria Cuisine of Argentina Foodborne illness Sausage Sauce Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Tamale Rice pudding Coffee Peanut butter Kosher foods Bread Hot dog Porridge Dinner Hot pot Hamster Tomato Insulin Pasta Swedish cuisine Cuisine of Turkey Kebab Culture of France Cha chaan teng Menu D__ner kebab Cuisine of Vietnam Taiwanese cuisine Nabemono Guinea pig In-N-Out Burger
