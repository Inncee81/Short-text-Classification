is it okay to suck on ice cubes this much i love sucking on ice cubes i don't know why but sometimes i wonder if i do it too much i used to suck on it constantly whenever i was home but i stopped for a while because there was a temporary period where i wasn't home that much i just started again today and sometimes i'll even skip a meal and substitute it with ice is this okay i don't usually skip meals only if i'm running really low on time or if i'm not even that hungry and i don't chew on the ice because that'd be hell on my braces as long as your not chewing them breaking teeth ice cubes are water and since it is recommended that we get oz glasses of water each day that is a good thing i would not think that you should skip meals though eventually that will affect your metabolism and you don't want that let me tell you it slows down anyway as you get older Tooth Coffee Tea Dental caries Happy Tree Friends Hip hop rivalries First aid Ice Cube Camp Lazlo The Amazing Race Ice Traumatic incident reduction Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Evidence of evolution Little Britain Cube (film) Passover Swimming Majin Buu Saga Andrew Dice Clay Food Hip hop collaborations Dokken Carburetor Sea level rise Lent Shen Gong Wu The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie N.W.A Equine conformation Carbon dioxide Tofu Cocaine Hong Kong-style milk tea Mojave people Dental brace Spidey Super Stories Hypoglycemia Fasting Paget's disease of bone Halitosis Tidal power Recurring South Park characters Fecal incontinence Ice hockey Garfield Tooth enamel Carnivorous plant Binge eating disorder Domestic rabbit Sake Avenue Q Sin City Gastroparesis Ken Chu Thermodynamic equilibrium Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Euphemism Diving Drill bit The Fairly OddParents Chlorpromazine Dieting Kitchen Reggie Jackson The Human Stain Pedro Mart__nez 613 mitzvot Procrastination Babe Ruth Hiccup Dog training Shaggy dog story Breastfeeding Ranma __ characters Roxette Entropy NeXT Phoebe Buffay's songs Tobacco Chris Candito Fishing Bob and George Water My Parents are Aliens Battle of the Bulge Customs and etiquette of Japan Cruising (maritime) Jean-Luc Picard Sleep Kosher foods The dozens Nine Inch Nails Nestl__ Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Weight training Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Breakfast The Marshall Mathers LP
