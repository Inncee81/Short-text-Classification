water purifying pitcher for dorm fridge i'm going to college this fall and i want to get a water purifying pitcher that will fit on the door of my fridge i have one of those smaller fridges but not the little ones shaped like a box for a visual it has a separate door for the freezer i think the water there tastes terrible otherwise i wouldn't bother the brita water filtration pitcher i believe is available in different sizes and or shapes this will be something you would have to order online as most stores just carry the standard liter size which may be to big for a mini frig the best option would to not keep the water in the frig if you have the freezer part just make ice cubes with the filtered water and keep pitcher full of clean water on top of fridge good luck in college and in finding suitable water also if you water source is coming from in your room i would recommend the pur water filter that attaches to the end of you faucet easy to atttach and remove can turn filter on or off when needed and they now offer flavoring dispenser built into the attachment to add fruit flavors to your drinking water Refrigerator Brewery Water Coffee Japanese tea ceremony Tofu Milk Textile manufacturing Sewage treatment Ice cream Marine aquarium Hamster Tea Vodka Baseball Yerba mate Mattress Anchor Glossary of firefighting equipment Dairy Windows XP Filtration Pickup truck Sailing Basement Leica M16 (rifle) Radio controlled airplane Hard water Punt (boat) Japanese toilet Nintendo GameCube 1957 World Series Station wagon Ramen Sugar Thermal power station Carnivorous plant Samovar Fume hood Cheese Customs and etiquette of Japan Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Vinegar Kitesurfing Air purifier Bulk vending Apple Solar power Vanilla XML Vacuum cleaner John Peel B-47 Stratojet Domestic rabbit Alcoholic beverage Organic food Betting (poker) Hard disk Motor oil Cuisine of Denmark Floppy disk Kosher foods On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Wine making Loudspeaker Bass guitar Soap Brassiere Synthesizer Toyota Prius RISC Fossil fuel power plant Champagne (beverage) NTSC Hong Kong-style milk tea Poker jargon Top-bar hive Tap (valve) Netfilter/iptables Sake Fire fighting Reverse osmosis Honey Hash table Watermelon Common Unix Printing System Fountain Dialysis Sodium chloride Gmail Visual Basic IBM PC compatible
