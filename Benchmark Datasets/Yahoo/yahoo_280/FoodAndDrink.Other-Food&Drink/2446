i have a few questions about p g tips tea actually it's more than a few questions i just bought some is this a typical english tea and how do you usually prepare it is it like lipton is for american's so what other teas do the english drink besides p g tips i'm getting bored with the teas they have here and i'm looking into teas from other culters first of all i've never seen tea that looks like coffee grounds is this typical of english tea or is it just this brand it said teaspoon for each cup does this mean an actual measuring spoon or just an ordinary spoon i made some and i used a regular spoon i'm wondering if i made it too strong is english tea normally stronger than american tea is there more caffeine in it than american tea i only steeped it for mins and it seemed really strong can you tell i just got done drinking some i'm really wired he he i probably should have added that i'm getting bored of lipton and some of the other american teas i do like earl grey to be honesty it was originally because captain picard liked it i wanted to see how good it was so i've been drinking that one for about years knowing that most europeans drink tea p g tips is just one brand which seems to be a very popular brand of tea just which teas are you bored of are you talking loose leaf tea or tea bags other popular teas in europe are earl grey and english breakfast if the instructions say one teaspoon get out a measuring spoon and measure out one teaspoon and level it youll find that some regular spoons measure out the same amount as one teaspoon but not exactly in my opinion english tea could be stronger than american tea but maybe not i think it's pretty subjective on tastes of tea just like coffee it doesn't have more caffiene than american tea since most tea leaves come from china and other asian countries steeping it minutes seems short i usually steep black tea for about min green tea is about min Tea Caffeine Coffee Turkish coffee Breakfast Japanese tea ceremony Hong Kong-style milk tea Yerba mate Black tea Green tea Rooibos Earl Grey tea Chinese tea culture Tea Classics Teapot PG Tips Korean cuisine Cooking weights and measures Halitosis Cha chaan teng Absinthe Pu-erh tea Singlish Starbucks Cuisine of Singapore Rice pudding Greasy spoon Insomnia Cuisine of the Philippines Tea bag White tea America's Cup British cuisine Beer Fecal incontinence Idli Rum Coffea arabica Full English breakfast Chinese cuisine Russian cuisine Cuisine of Denmark SoBe Hotel Word of Wisdom Chocolate Drill bit BoA Horehound Meal Cocaine Soft drink Tobacco Hong Kong tea culture Drink McDonald's Theory of conduct Caff__ Camellia sinensis Cider German cuisine Mid-levels Mushroom hunting Yum cha Korean tea ceremony Dim sum Tea (meal) Jean-Luc Picard Dialysis Mattress Chili con carne Moonshine Ramen RuneScape quests Instant coffee Volume Questionable Content Fujian tea ceremony Chopsticks Nepeta In-N-Out Burger Coffeehouse Debate Chinese tea Hiberno-English Cannabis (drug) Urinary incontinence Golf club (equipment) Peruvian cuisine Dixie Chicks Cricket American Revolution MRE Martini cocktail
