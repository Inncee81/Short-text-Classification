why do these cost so much why are macedamia nuts and beef jerkey so expensive this is why the nut is expensive but i don't think beef jerkey is here where i live the macadamia nut's kernel is extremely hard to mine out of its shell it requires about psi or kpa to crack but after some time in a warm and dry place the shell may develop big cracks the nut can be opened then with a screwdriver though the warm dry conditions also reduce the nutritional value of the nut the shell is most easily cracked with a metalworking bench vice but care must be taken not to crush the kernel in the process the nuts can be opened simply by locating the seam line on the shell this seam line can be located by looking carefully at the shell and placing a knife blade on the line and tapping with a hammer the shell will open and allow the nut to be removed whole a safer and quicker alternative is to use a ratchet style pvc pipe cutter place the cutter blade on the seam line and ratchet it closed the shell will split and allow the nut to be removed when nuts have dried for a period of time the kernel will fall out with green or fresh nuts the kernel may stick in the shell the nuts can also be smashed open with a hammer or heavy solid kitchen tool boiling the nuts for a few minutes in a pot until the nuts rise to the surface is also a good way as it causes the nuts to crack nuts of the arkin papershell variety cultivated by retired stockbroker morris arkin each have a blemish or small crack somewhere on the shell and the shell will crack open readily if left for a few days or if struck properly with a hammer Fast bowling Brewery Drill bit Coconut Coffee Knife Peanut Woodworking Welding Plastic Hamster Mach kernel Nut (fruit) Sword making Spark plug Screw Cocaine Poker jargon Wrench Glossary of climbing terms Gramophone record Table saw Climbing equipment Seismic retrofit Linux Pottery Veganism Illegal drug trade Metalworking Hydraulic machinery Black Walnut Collecting fossils The Legend of Zelda series enemies Cookware and bakeware Kitchen Naval mine Thermal power station Tlingit Wood carving Internal ballistics Transformer Vise (tool) Ocean thermal energy conversion Idli Chocolate Tofu Tea Steel Pebble bed reactor Nuclear power Chicken Chili con carne Tool Fancy rat Common bean Sewage treatment Comanche Oyster Walnut Maize Fruit Unix Dry cleaning Irrigation Blade Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Helium Peruvian cuisine Japanese tea ceremony Lawn mower Energy development Biodiesel Equine conformation OpenBSD In-N-Out Burger Wind turbine Nuclear weapon design Water purification Bass guitar Metallurgy Champagne (beverage) Coal Almond Chisel Trench warfare
