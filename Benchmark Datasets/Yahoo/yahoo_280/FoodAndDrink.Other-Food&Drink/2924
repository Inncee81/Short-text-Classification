chefs what do you think of this ramsey character on hell's kitchen or kitchen from hell as i call it would anyone worth a grain of salt actually work with this guy i know it is a show and everything that goes along with that but as a kitchen professional don't you find it ludicrous i do know chefs who behave in a somewhat similar manner but they often end up cooking with themselves without any support is it only non profs who find this entertaining i was a chef for over years in canada singapore and jamaica and while i had some tough bosses and fb managers if any had acted the way he does and mind you i never watch the show only seen the trailers he would have ended up with a knife in his back or his head in the deep fryer it is all an act just like his other show ramseys kitchen nightmares he goes around swearing and threatening the staffs of under run and non profitable uk restaurants and catering operations he is a good chef i know his work but it is like all the other programs it is done for shock value like all the other reality shows no one would survive in the trade with an attitude like that no matter how famous he is Chef Kitchen Iron Chef Hiroyuki Sakai Meat Loaf Knife Gordon Ramsay Julia Child Jamie Oliver Sushi Iron Chef America Celebrity chef Restaurant Hell's Kitchen (television) Monica Geller Cajun cuisine Friends Auguste Escoffier RuneScape quests The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Diablo II: Lord of Destruction French cuisine Bobby Flay Cuisine of the Southern United States Japanese cuisine Kyle Broflovski I Love Lucy Emeril Lagasse James Beard Fugu Hell's Kitchen Alone in the Dark (series) The Shining (film) Sin City Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Koumei Nakamura Great house Miss Saigon The Mary Tyler Moore Show Shaggy dog story Swedish Chef Stove Marie-Antoine Car__me Boss (video games) Futurama (TV series - season 4) Max Payne Master of the Household Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
