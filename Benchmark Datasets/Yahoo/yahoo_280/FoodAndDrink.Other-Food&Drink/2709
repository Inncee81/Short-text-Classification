what is your opinion about french fries a they are a misnomer they were actually invented in belgium b they are fattening but not because of the potatoes its the oil they are fried in which contributes most to the fat content c they dont seem to deliver much besides calories d i like well fried ones i normally test them by bending them and i like the ones that break rather than bend the best way to do that is to dip the frozen fries into oil that is already very hot rather than put them in cold oil and start heating e they really go well with ketchup that adds color and flavour to the fries sometimes a touch of hot sauce also helps Hot dog Tofu Domesticated turkey Fish and chips Cuisine of Denmark Sandwich McDonald's Deep frying Sauce Potato chips Recipe French cuisine Mayonnaise Bacon Roux Irish breakfast Pizza Barbecue Cuisine of the Philippines Hamburger Ice cream Breakfast Japanese cuisine Walkers Bread Ketchup Peruvian cuisine Food preservation Cajun cuisine Korean cuisine MRE Cuisine of Malaysia German cuisine Jewish cuisine Cantonese cuisine Fondue Soul food Fried dough foods Pringles Fried chicken Soy sauce Ramen Olive oil In-N-Out Burger Philip J.
