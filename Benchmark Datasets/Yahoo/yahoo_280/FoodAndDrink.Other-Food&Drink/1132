is a pickle a vegetable or a fruit please help i've been wondering this for a while i think it might be a vegetable because its made out of cucumbers and those are vegetables but it could be a fruit too it has seeds i think everything that has seeds is supposed to be a fruit i'm confused please help a pickle is not something u grow it's a cucumber only pickled it's a process that people put the cucumber through before they sell them as 'pickles' a cucumber answering ur question is actually a fruit so are other squashes like zucini and pumpkins the reason they r considered fruits just like tomatoes is because unlike vegetables they have seeds on the inside this makes them qualified to be a fruit not a vegetable answer pickle vegetable Cucumber Pickling Tomato Fruit Pumpkin Pollination Pickled cucumber Japanese cuisine Jewish cuisine Watermelon Russian cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Salad Roman eating and drinking Hamster Chayote Vegetarianism Squash (fruit) Organic food Sushi Cuisine of the Southern United States Agriculture Flowering plant Food Polish cuisine Food preservation Hamburger Seed Ketchup German cuisine Mango Larry the Cucumber Cauliflower Melon Cuisine of Denmark Antioxidant Cuisine of Singapore Sauerkraut Vegetable oil Herring Gherkin Cuisine of Africa VeggieTales Jam Capsicum Plant Hot dog Zucchini Paprika Shawarma Peruvian cuisine Kashrut Bento Hangover Fermentation New York Cantonese cuisine Sandwich Market gardening Okra Tofu Cannabis cultivation Foodborne illness Banana Agriculture in Hong Kong Fruitarianism Ice cream Ukrainian cuisine Fruit tree propagation Onion Black pepper Flax Vegeta Veganism Soup Gazpacho Serbian cuisine McDonald's Vegetative reproduction Olive Pollination management Korean cuisine Breakfast Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mayonnaise Cuisine of Vietnam Vitamin C Taiwanese cuisine Cereal Maize Prostate cancer Luther Burbank Yoghurt Phytochemical Date Palm Cuisine of Brazil Beet Green Revolution Refrigerator car Species
