is waitressing a hard job theres a new resturant opening near me and their offering jobs but their pretty busy so its gonna b hard work bt is it a good job many thanks to those that reply i dnt mind the hard work bt people ahve said its hard bt is it a case of ur either good at it or ur not haha here's some stories from me waitressing at a restaurant for years all true lol dropped a whole bus tub of dishes on the floor very loud messy and embarassing i once saw a guy throw up on his plate one time after this old man sneezed about times really loudly people were clapping for him a plate of buffalo wings was dropped in the bar and a guy picks them up after being dumped down the wall onto the bar floor and was actually going to eat them hell no that's definitely against health code i once walked up to a table and said hi guys and then i realized it was a woman with cancer with no hair and wearing a hat one time the whole restaurant started singing the star spangled banner because we had a table with like canadiens it was all in good humor though the canadiens thought it was funny and were singing along had to call at least three times because of customers either having a heart attack or a diabetic reaction drunk mexican fell asleep at his table i had the cops called on me by a customer who said i put a tip on his credit card i wouldn't put my reputation or job on the line for he was crazy i actually had to fill out police reports for that one i dropped a steak onto a lady's lap on her birthday no joke a filet mignon i had to go to court because a lady tripped on a rug fell over and hit her face on a booth i was a witness i probably have more but yeah that's a lot already waitressing can be a good job it's nice to have the cash all the time and you can make the same amount of money in hours as you could working any other job for hours it's great for people in college or high school it is a very physically demanding job though heavy trays and a lot of lifting some nights are good and some are bad some customers are awesome and some you can't stand but you still have to serve them and be nice there are a lot of ups and downs don't be afraid to try it though it can work out great for you and there are bad things about any type of job good luck oh and to answer your other question it's either you are really good at it or you are just okay or you just plain suck at it people who suck usually quit if you want any tips or have any questions e mail me through my profile i was damn good at waitressing Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Little Britain Customs and etiquette of Japan Humphrey Bogart Poker jargon Friends Shaggy dog story Russian joke Late Night with Conan O'Brien Babe Ruth Knots Landing Sin City Craps Teen Girl Squad The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Rain Man Conker's Bad Fur Day Restaurant Toilet humour Whose Line Is It Anyway?
