do you live on a budget if so how is it going like does it really work we live on a very tight budget have to with my husband the only one with income and three children i have been doing so for three years now and its very simple and it does work nothing fancy i've tried all the free programs on the web and those are all so confusing basically i get out the ole pen and paper and write down all the bills and how much we owe monthly on them i usually round up to the nearest dollar then i figure out when each is due then i make a calender thing i write down every friday of the month since thats pay day and what bills can be paid without be late and how much i try to spend the same amount every week so we know what to expect the remaining of it has to be spent for groceries entertainment gas etc everything gets paid on time and i have even made money by doing this i average a month for gas bill per say well some months gas bill is only so the extra that i averaged into the budget goes into savings over the past years we have saved just by doing this also i always put a week into our savings account in case of emergencies your budget doesn't get thrown out of wack seems pretty simple and it is and has worked for me and my family another thing that helps is if you can contact some companies like phone electric and ask to be put on average billing so you always know what to expect hope that helps Microeconomics FairTax Economy of Russia United Kingdom corporation tax Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Daylight saving time Social Security (United States) Charles Dickens Hyperinflation U.S. public debt Supply-side economics Credit card Social rule Wheel of Fortune Freeters Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Gross domestic product Howard Dean Tesco Euro Money Insurance Arthur Laffer Keynesian economics MMORPG United States dollar Canadian federal budget, 2005 Internet fraud Annuity Government debt National Kidney Foundation Singapore Unemployment benefit Economy of Romania Bond Tax Social Security debate (United States) Reaganomics Education in Romania Wal-Mart Economy of the United States Live 8 Temperature Personal finance 2003 California recall New Deal Warren Buffett School choice Home Box Office Child support Temasek Holdings Economy of Pakistan Voice over IP EastEnders America Online London Congestion Charge Economy of Nigeria GSM services Alex Ferguson Patrick Hillery Energy Policy Act of 2005 Professional wrestling slang Life insurance Cheque Hillary Rodham Clinton Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Enron Corporation Medicare (United States) Capitalism Marshall Plan Mortgage Gregorian calendar PE ratio Dot-com Pinball Blackjack Theory of conduct Video game developer Gold standard Space Shuttle program History of the United States (1918-1945) National Football League Economic inequality Flat tax Gold as an investment New York Giants Hydrogen economy James T.
