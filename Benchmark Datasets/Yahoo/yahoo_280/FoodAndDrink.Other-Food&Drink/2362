bbq how much meat per person we are throwing a bbq and i'm wondering how much meat to get for hamburgers is there a general rule of thumb of how much meat per person there will be about people there thanks clarification you are having a cook out not a bbq bbq is cooking low and slow generally over flavor wood and involves smoking your meat for long periods of time a cook out is basically grilling ove high heat that being said if the only protien is going to be hambugers meaning that your wanting to prepare or more hamburgers per person coming then i would suggest allowcating a half pound of fresh ground meat per burger you want to be able to offer everyone good measure is to figure that out of people those people may eat more than one burger so plan on having to prepare burgers having that figure i would also recommend pound of fresh ground beef for each burger after cooking on a grill you will end up with just over a pound cooked burger due to shrinkage so for this calculation you would need pounds of ground beef or chuck if you are offering hot dogs or other sandwhich type item then i would recommend doing burgers as some people won't eat a hamburger in exchange for the other sandwich but you will still have some people that will eat more than one hamburger so burgers will insure everyone will have the chance to get at least one but you will more than likely have plenty for anyone wanting burgers since you offer an alternative easiest way is to to determine of burgers you want to offer everyone multiply that number by then divide that by and that is how many pounds to buy x divided by so pounds of ground meat to produce pound cooked burgers cooked weight hope this helps have fun Hamburger Barbecue MRE In-N-Out Burger Sandwich Cuisine of Denmark McDonald's Burger Hot dog Japanese cuisine Cantonese cuisine German cuisine Fast-food restaurant Bacon Sausage D__ner kebab Korean cuisine Domesticated turkey Breakfast Cheeseburger Cajun cuisine Hot pot Cuisine of Malaysia French fries Chili con carne Vegetarianism Cuisine of Africa Burger King Tofu Cuisine of Laos Soul food Jewish cuisine Ham French cuisine Black pepper Foodborne illness Steak Happy Tree Friends Dieting A&W Restaurants Welding Grilling Veganism Cuisine of the Southern United States Kitchen Cookware and bakeware Microeconomics Food preservation Vegetarian cuisine Comanche Atkins Nutritional Approach Horse meat Pound Domestic rabbit Explosive material Coriander Salisbury steak Cooking on a campfire Anchor Bengali cuisine Sauerkraut Coffee RuneScape skills Knife Asado Grill Colorectal cancer Bread Pork Steak n Shake Cuisine of Argentina Mutual fund Russian cuisine Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Tank Life insurance Supply and demand Vitamin C Emergency preparedness Heat Delicatessen Pizza Corned beef Cha chaan teng Takeru Kobayashi Inflation Curry
