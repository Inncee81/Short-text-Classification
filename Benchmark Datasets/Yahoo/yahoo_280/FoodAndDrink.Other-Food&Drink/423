dose any one know if cooking bacon is physical or chemical just wanted to know both the physical is obvious as the meats myosin muscle fibers are heated they begin to pull together as the protein is denatured caused by heat the meat fibers lose water this process is like a wet spong being squeezed when the meat has lost enough water browning maillard reaction occurs also lost are water soluble proteins mostly enzymes during this time of course the fat has melted into a liquid form the chemical process is a much more interesting but much more technical process it includes the browning of meat fibers and their structural change to accommodate the oxidation altering of the cured meat pigments is another the first reaction occurs between nitric oxide and myoglobin to produce nitric oxide myoglobin mbno also known as nitrosylmyoblobin mbno is bright red and unstable upon heating the more stable nitric oxide myohemochromogen nitrosylhemochrome forms this product yields the desirable more desirable pink color of meats heating denatures globin but the pink color persists Protein Iron Sulfuric acid Hydrogen Nitric acid Explosive material Plastic Ammonia Denaturation (biochemistry) Titanium Enzyme Signal transduction Uranium Biochemistry Nitroglycerin Glucose Sulfur Bacon Food preservation Hemoglobin Plutonium Nitric oxide Polymerase chain reaction Silicon Chromium Magnesium Carbon Water (molecule) Soy protein Zinc Acetic acid Paint Polychlorinated biphenyl Chlorine Carbon dioxide Tungsten Sewage treatment Alcohol Hydrochloric acid Lithium Ammonium nitrate Aluminium Corrosion Ceramics Potassium Pottery Steel Maillard reaction Helium Fiberglass Internal ballistics Chemoluminescence Ultraviolet Copper Tofu Vanadium(V) oxide Nutrition Vitamin C Aldehyde Staining (biology) Optical fiber Vanadium Lead Shroud of Turin Phase (matter) Antimony Alkane Chemical reaction Hydrogen peroxide Sodium Tin Lanthanum Thulium Manganese Skeletal muscle Francis Crick Glass Food Strontium Food science Nuclear reactor Aniline Fire extinguisher Cubic zirconia Nitrogen oxide Nuclear fission Cadmium Barium
