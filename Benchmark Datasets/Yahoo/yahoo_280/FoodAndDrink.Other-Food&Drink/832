getting cheap produce in bulk any idea how to acquire cheap produce in bulk i have just purchased a chest freezer and want to freeze some vegetables and berries specifically i would like to freeze a few hundred pounds of blueberries and any other produce that is over lb at the store and freezes well adam if you have a local farmers market that is your best bet they will have the most fresh and they should have a pretty decent amount for you to stock up on since they are always privately owned they may even give you a deal if you buy enough hope this helps good luck Organic food Gold standard Refrigerator car Monopoly (game) Ice cream Poker jargon Food storage Wal-Mart Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Local food Neopets Temasek Holdings Arbitrage Cuisine of Denmark Illegal drug trade Refrigerator Corporation Dot-com Microeconomics Tesco Dairy Gross domestic product Law of value History of the United States (1918-1945) Hydrogen economy Plastic Supply and demand Ramen McCain Foods Limited Tofu American individualist anarchism Tlingit Boots Group Sears Holdings Corporation Mergers and acquisitions Economics Food Economy of Russia New Deal Derivative (finance) Nintendo Citigroup Surplus value ITV Community-supported agriculture Onion Convenience store ITunes Music Store Hamster Digital photography Gatorade Advertising Money MMORPG Great Depression American Broadcasting Company Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Freezing Cuisine of Malaysia Stock market Vestey Group Boston and Lowell Railroad Capitalism Blueberry Bagel Stock Capital accumulation Miller Brewing Free trade Philosophy of business Economy of Taiwan Fanta Betting (poker) Cotton Cigar New York Giants Political economy Commodity markets Computer Farmers' market Short selling Privatisation of British Rail Weed control Economy of the United States Coffee Wells Fargo Pretty Good Privacy Farmers' Alliance Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Bulk vending Agriculture in Australia Domesticated turkey Viacom Cooperative Deflation (economics) French cuisine Berkshire Hathaway Erling Dekke N__ss Gustavus Franklin Swift
