can i freeze sweetcorn and keep it till october yes blanch the ears of corn then plunge the ears in ice water to stop the cooking process the main purpose of blanching is to inactivate the enzymes resulting in better quality frozen food blanching also cleans off surface dirt and organisms brightens the color reduces enzyme activity that cause color and flavor changes removes air and softens the texture so vegetables are easier to pack into containers to blanch corn bring one gallon of water to a boil in a large pot with a basket insert and a lid put the corn in the blanching basket and lower into boiling water cover with a lid the water should return to boiling within minute you count blanching time as soon as the water returns to a boil blanch whole kernel corn for minutes cool promptly by placing ears of corn in ice water drain and cut kernels from cob at of their depth do not scrape cob for cream style corn blanch ears minutes cool promptly and drain cut kernel tips and scrape cobs with back of knife to remove the juice and heart of the kernel another option for cream style corn cut and scrape corn from cop without blanching place cut corn in double boiler and heat with constant stirring for about minutes or until it thickens cool by placing pan in ice water corn on the cob is also blanched usda recommends blanching small ears to inches long inch or less diameter for minutes medium ears to inches long to inches in diameter for minutes and large ears to inches long over inches in diameter for minutes when freezing corn freeze no more than to pounds per cubic foot of freezer capacity in a hour period this enables the freezer to freeze the food rapidly enough that food spoilage and or food borne illness microorganisms will not have time to grow freeze it in the best freezer you have and as cold as you can get it keep the level of corn as thin as possible in the freezer will freeze faster for better texture results after completely frozen degrees f place in those zip lock bags to as full as you like to pack for freezing pack the corn into rigid plastic freezer containers leaving inch of headspace or pack into flexible containers squeeze out air seal label and freeze corn should be packaged in amounts that can be used in one meal it will keep its quality for many months and even a year if you keep it in a freezer that the doors is not opened several times per day one of those dedicated cabinet freezers will work great especially if they do not have a self defrosting mode using your kitchen freezer it will not last as long because of the constant temperature fluctuations of the door opening and closing generally about months either way you can still have your corn in october hope this info helps Maize Bong Coffee Tea Milk Sweetcorn Severe weather terminology (United States) Carbon dioxide Drill bit Cuisine of Denmark Knife Freezing Fancy rat Cookware and bakeware Gramophone record Fossil fuel power plant Barbecue Floppy disk Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Fire fighting Sewage treatment Textile manufacturing Thermal power station Slow cooker Cheese Shotgun Plastic M16 (rifle) Wood Jewish cuisine Bread Comanche Sea ice Alcohol fuel Sauerkraut Food Desert Peanut Kitchen Vitamin C Potato Top-bar hive Water (molecule) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Antarctic krill Mattress Sushi Dialysis Microwave oven Domesticated turkey Glossary of firefighting equipment Vacuum Japanese cuisine Rice Lake Japanese tea ceremony Early IBM disk storage Chowder Solar power Dog Water purification Welding Renewable energy In-N-Out Burger Menstrual cup Sterilization (microbiology) Ice Ocean thermal energy conversion Pottery Phase (matter) Sento Items in the Metroid series Common bean Sugar Wine making Tobacco Glacier Cooking Dishwasher Cannabis cultivation Temperature Basement Fishing Cat Food storage Maple syrup Steaming Ketchup Gas metal arc welding
