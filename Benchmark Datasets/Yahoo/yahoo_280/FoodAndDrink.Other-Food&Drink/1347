salmon steak packets was wondering if anyone has tried these they come in assorted marinades and i thought of grilling one but unsure if thats a good idea anyone tried them or the tuna steaks i can't see why they wouldn't be good grilled though i have not tried them my view is that i can do that almost as easily and way cheaper just put your filets and whatever marinade you like into a package made of foil let sit in fridge at least minutes up to hours then cook as desired Steak Hamburger MRE Steak n Shake Grill T-bone steak Hot dog Japanese cuisine Kebab German cuisine Fighting Foodons Tofu Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Laos Hell's Kitchen (television) Seitan Sushi Wiener schnitzel Ramen Epcot Salisbury steak David Hume Dundas Square Onigiri Waffle House Douglas Adams Fish and chips Culinary mustard Swordfish Cooking on a campfire Worcestershire sauce Baldrick Ceviche Saki D__ner kebab Sea-Monkey Oyster Filet lace Sandwich Asado Peter Cook Anchovy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Super Chief Phonograph cylinder Time Out of Mind Rum Bacon Grilling Omega-3 fatty acid Galbi Microeconomics Fajita Ketchup British cuisine The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Theory of conduct Lisa the Vegetarian In-N-Out Burger Lateral thinking Married... with Children Edsel Bong Kitchen Nabemono Taliesin Kosher foods Aqua Teen Hunger Force John Peel Chili con carne Cuisine of Argentina Cuisine of the Southern United States Deep frying Dog training Miso Fishstick Pork chop Ford Thunderbird Grilled cheese sandwich Bobby Flay Ice cream Imperial (automobile) Yu-Gi-Oh!
