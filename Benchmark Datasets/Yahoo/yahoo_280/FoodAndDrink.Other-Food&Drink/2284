i need a example of a grocery list for food that is good for you husband and i are trying to get healthy but not starve ourselves obviously i need salad fruit ect but we are used to eating fried food and lots of carb food and want to change our diet around cannot diet because i am pregnant thanks you can still do carbs but switch to whole grain it seems like everything is whole grain these days bread pasta rice etc for breakfast go with fiber cereals or whole grain like cheerios drink tea instead of coffee for snacks try eating a handful of nuts i personally like to buy frozen pecans walnuts or fresh almonds you could even get the nut medley that they serve in the vegetable section avoid frozen dinner type things like rich pastas etc as these may be low in calories or not but they still tend to have trans fat very bad for you in them like you said lots of fresh foods fruits veggies carbs are totally ok as long as u don't overdo them and kinda the same with fried foods too carbs are my favorite type of food and i live in mobile al where fried food is practically unavoidable so i know how you feel drink at least glasses of water a day not vitamin water either avoid anything that has been processed a heads up that it likely contains trans fat cookies such as oreos etc for example if you were trying to choose between ritz or saltine crackers go with the saltines because they are more natural though i've never cared too much for them myself a lot of people like those calories packs i think these are fine for a snack and it's great that they still have the flavor you are going for but don't use that calories as an excuse to eat or packs of them basically just eat well rounded meals with everything in moderation try and exercise for minutes at least every day even if it is just a stroll around the block mowing the grass walking around the mall etc best of luck to you with not only your eating but the baby don't deprive yourself of the good stuff like fried food because that will just make you want it even more intead keep moderation as key Veganism Breakfast Cuisine of Denmark Dieting French cuisine South Beach diet Snack food Low-carbohydrate diet Cuisine of the Southern United States Healthy eating Bread Vegetarianism Japanese cuisine Hamster Food guide pyramid Ramen Tofu Cuisine of Malaysia German cuisine McDonald's MRE Cereal Cuisine of the Philippines Jewish cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Egg (food) Coffee Alcoholic beverage Hamburger Organic food Meal Pasta Peruvian cuisine Food preservation Domesticated turkey Cheerios Cha chaan teng Breastfeeding Flour Trans fat Folic acid In-N-Out Burger Oreo Cajun cuisine Chocolate Dietary fiber Street food Ice cream French fries Cuisine of Laos Omega-3 fatty acid Soul food Korean cuisine Pig (zodiac) Nut (fruit) Tomato Cuisine of Argentina Chinese cuisine Kosher foods Genericized trademark Roman eating and drinking Hypoglycemia Kit Kat Cuisine of Singapore Tea Fruit Chili con carne Swedish cuisine Soy milk Cuisine of Brazil Tooth Potato Recipe Dim sum Salad Cuisine of Africa Peanut butter Kraft Foods Anorexia nervosa Kellogg Company British cuisine Breakfast cereal Delicatessen Japanese tea ceremony Guinea pig Porridge Fasting Cold Stone Creamery Rice pudding Tlingit
