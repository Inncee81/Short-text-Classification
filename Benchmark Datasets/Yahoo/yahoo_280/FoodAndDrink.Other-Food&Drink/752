does anyone make egg salad when the eggs are still hot a friend of mine told me that i'm not supposed to add the mayonnaise when the eggs are still hot that it'd make me sick but i do it all the time any input would be greatly appreciated i always eat it right away and refrigerate the remaining egg salad you wouldn't want to leave it sitting around because salmonella can develop but if you make it and eat it or refrigerate it right away it's fine mayo can be hot or cooked but it can't sit at unsafe tempretures degrees because that's the tempreture at which bacteria can grow you can always chill down your eggs in a bowl of ice water before you crack them minutes usually does the trick then your egg salad will be nice and cool Mayonnaise Potato salad Hamburger Food preservation Foodborne illness Sandwich Ice cream Salad McDonald's Air conditioning Hot dog Ramen Cuisine of Malaysia Sauce Sauerkraut Refrigerator Jewish cuisine German cuisine Japanese cuisine Caesar salad Tea Refrigeration Breakfast Ocean's Twelve Cuisine of Singapore Brewery Puff pastry Chicken Cuisine of Laos Food Souffl__ Porridge Pizza Sea-Monkey Meal Roman eating and drinking Sushi Yoghurt Coffee Dairy Cuisine of the Philippines Pancake Chili con carne Plastic Veganism Coconut Teen Girl Squad Happy Tree Friends Debugging Spinach Soba Quarashi Stirling engine Rice pudding Sexual reproduction Carbon dioxide Botulism Algorithm Natt__ Cider Donburi Mario series enemies Dairy product Shaggy dog story Dosa Sake Antarctic krill Cooking Double the Fist Mango Ice Refrigerator car Common cold Sausage Autonomous building Fugu Salmon Welding Casting Agar plate Salad Fingers Escherichia coli O157:H7 Potato French cuisine Gumbo Bread Egg (biology) Coconut crab Slow cooker Frost Shit Kodocha Miso Emulsion Severe weather terminology (United States) Degree Fahrenheit
