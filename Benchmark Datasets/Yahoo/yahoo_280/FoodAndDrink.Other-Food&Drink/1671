is there any part of a potato thats poisonis i was messing around with my puppy and my mom was cooking potatoes and i picked up the root part or something and gave it to my dog and my mom took it away and it was poisonis is it the eyes and green skin do have a very small toxic content alkaloids which in large doses can be poisonous even to humans so don't go eating a whole heaping helping of green mashed potatoes but one eye or a tiny bit of green isn't fatal and won't really make you ill which is why you find an occasional potato chip with some green on though it does taste bitter and not very good just peel away all the green on a potato that's begun to turn and you'll be fine the green comes from the production of solinine which is the result of it staying in light for too long you see this happen often in grocery stores where they have lights focused on the shelf they have the potatoes on keep 'em in a dry and dark place a root cellar if you have one the eyes also store solinine as do the plants themselves so not fatal in small doses but probably still not a good thing to feed your pup Potato Solanine Pizza Cuisine of Denmark Cassava Mushroom hunting Banana Sweet potato Vitamin C French cuisine Trailer Park Boys Food preservation Deadly nightshade Hamster Guinea pig Solanaceae German cuisine Plutonium Organic food Potato chips Fugu Common bean Bengali cuisine Plantain Poison Tobacco Moonshine Food Nuclear fallout Mango Dog training Alkaloid Fancy rat Coffee Ant Cantonese cuisine Kava Tomato Insulin Hot dog Ragwort Tag Livestock Caffeine Foodborne illness Cuisine of Africa Kodocha Black pepper Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Brewery Cyanide Quinoa Green Revolution Hay fever Shark Fish and chips Basic taste Dumpling Nicotine Vitamin D Peruvian cuisine Aconitum My Little Pony Sugar beet Bock Cheese Chili con carne Russian cuisine Pasta Cuisine of the Southern United States Columbo Yam Nutmeg Mashed potato Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Social rule Korean cuisine RuneScape quests Beetle Cannabis cultivation Cocoa Haggis Ricin Genetically modified food Omega-3 fatty acid Aloe Barbecue Fast food In-N-Out Burger Battle of the Network Reality Stars Absinthe Futurama (TV series - season 2) Japanese tea ceremony Beer The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy
