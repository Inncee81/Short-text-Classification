camembert cheese in a round box seems to have a skin or rind on it is it something you do not eat also you cant easily peel it off camembert is my favorite you can eat the rind some people do i personally hate it same with brie no you can't peel it off it has to be cut off if i plan on eating the whole thing i stick it in the fridge to get a little firm then cut the rind off then i let it sit at room temperature to soften this way i don't waste as much when i cut the rind off Cheese Camembert cheese Tofu Pork rind Brie cheese Potato Roquefort cheese Pizza Bacon Kumquat Spidey Super Stories Dairy Watermelon Fecal incontinence Cantonese cuisine Skin Goodness and value theory Snack food Lind (Oh My Goddess!)
