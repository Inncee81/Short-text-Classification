why do we cry if we are exposed to onions when an onion is cut certain lachrymator compounds are released causing the nerves around the eyes lacrimal glands to become irritated these compounds consist of methionine and cystine that are part of the amino acid family protein is made up of several of these amino acids grouped together when an onion is sliced or diced the onion's cells release these compounds into the air when this occurs enzyme works to alter the amino acids into lachrymator compounds this form of sulfuric acid irritates the nerves around the eyes making them tear if you put it in the freezer for a little while before cutting you wont tear Onion Tears Amino acid Enzyme Sulfur Protein Biomolecule Cell (biology) Hydrogen sulfide Insulin Genetic code Translation (genetics) Tay-Sachs disease Chemotherapy Gastric acid Adrenal gland Nutrition Nutrient Disulfide bond Hypoglycemia Sulfhydryl group Ammonia RNA Glutamic acid Glucocorticoid Kidney Protein sequencing Cysteine Protein kinase Eye Staining (biology) Transaminase Prion Pancreas Mutation Autonomic nervous system Polymer Whole proteome analysis Aspartame Nitrogen Citric acid cycle Essential amino acid Hydrochloric acid Antibody DNA Photosynthesis Selenium Smoke-screen Sulfuric acid Herbicide Maxilla Tooth Peptide Virus Nerve agent Serine Folic acid Methylation Herpes simplex virus Iron Growth hormone Optical isomerism Ubiquitin Psoriasis Phosphorus Amine Lac operon Hemoglobin Cancer Acetic acid Hydrogen chloride Mitochondrial genetics Thyroid Gamma-aminobutyric acid Helicobacter pylori Flatulence Miller-Urey experiment Poison Human skin color Fatty acid metabolism Parietal cell Hormone Angiotensin Serine protease Metabolism Cyanocobalamin Frontal bone Gland Protein biosynthesis Vegetarian nutrition Linus Pauling Salt Signal transduction Air pollution Transfer RNA Dog
