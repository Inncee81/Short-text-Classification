how do you keep parmesan from balling up in containers we have tried to add kosher salt but it didn't help we use lots of cheese but can't keep it smooth it always seems to clog all the openings in the containers we use for our deli the parmesan cheese comes to us in sealed pouches so we do not do any grating whatsoever we really could use help with this problem what is the best way to store it once it is in a shaker we make lots of bread sticks with this cheese and just have so much balling up in the shakers is it better to keep in a cool place when not using or can we keep it at room temperature what makes the cheese ball up anyway buy it solid and grate it as you use it with an extra fine grater it keeps longer tastes fresher and you can grate as little or as much as you want then keep solid whatever is left if you can't grate it you could put unpopped popcorn in the shaker if the holes are not so large they would fall thru and break someone's tooth they would act as little ball bearings and keep breaking it apart as you shake rice is likely to fit thru the holes and it doesn't absorb moisture but neither will the popcorn if it did you could just sit it in a bowl of water and it would get soft if you use the popcorn put it in the empty shaker and do your best to shake it out so you are certain it won't come out on the food Cheese Tofu Bread Hamster McDonald's Bong Brewery Coffee Ice cream Dairy Hot dog MRE Sushi Cuisine of Brazil Plastic Schlock Mercenary Cuisine of the Philippines French fries Drill bit Pizza Popcorn Jewish cuisine Fecal incontinence Bulk vending Glass Asiago cheese Textile manufacturing Pottery Electrophysiology Poker jargon Carbon dioxide Recipe The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Kashrut Edible salt Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Thermal power station Breakfast Casting Carburetor Chocolate Bagel Happy Tree Friends Hamburger Tea Water Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Risotto Pasta Kosher foods Milk Golf Butter Woodworking Chili con carne Dumpling Microwave oven German cuisine Ketchup Pebble bed reactor Kitchen Meat Loaf Japanese tea ceremony Diving suit Standard enthalpy change of fusion Poutine Potato Ramen Bengali cuisine Shakers Idli Skittles (sport) Snooker Mouse (computing) Piccolo Junior Saga 1957 World Series Shaggy dog story Parmigiano Reggiano Houseplant Billiards Fire extinguisher Sandwich Processed cheese Customs and etiquette of Japan Glycerin Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Combine harvester Basic English Delicatessen Joke Ammonia Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Rugby union positions Tire Nuclear power Christmas tree
