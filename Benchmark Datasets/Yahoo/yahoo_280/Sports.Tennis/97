i always hit my forehands back too high and my backhands haven't been working for me lately it's so frustrating ugh lol anyways how can i change that thanks alot ah i often have the same problem there are two reasons as to why backhands seem to float let me offer a a few tips to keep it in shape lack of topspin one of the usages for topspin is to make sure that a hard struck ball falls onto the court since you seem like you have been hitting for a while i would suggest that you take the ball in front of your body a bit more than from the side if you take the ball late on the bounce when it is at your side less of the force on the ball is directed forward and will cause you to overshoot hitting the ball slightly in front of you not only allows for accuracy but also helps to generate the topspin you need for the ball to land within the boundaries of the court lengthen your stroke and follow through this applies more to your backhand in order to make a controlled and accurate shot you need a strong base of support for your arms on a backhand you do this in two ways bend low for stability and plant your foot on the ground if you're a rightie it should be the right foot if you're a leftie use the left foot the stroke should follow after getting into the ready position be sure to take a healthy backswing using one arm as a brace for support make contact at the side or slightly in front and throw your full weight behind the stroke you should never try to stop midway through your stroke at waist height instead make sure that the racket face finishes near shoulder length it should be if you bend low brush up on the ball if you need more topspin i hope this will add consistency and power to your game ace 'em Pete Sampras Tennis Andre Agassi Roger Federer Steffi Graf Table tennis Badminton Monica Seles Real tennis Social rule Squash (sport) Cincinnati Bengals Bj__rn Borg Violence in sports Grandview, U.S.A.
