how is the scoring done for tennis i'm new at this i need real answers please basically there are two sets in a tennis match each set is made up of a certain amount of games each game is made up of certain amounts of points the first point is called love all the second is the point is the fourth point is and if you win a fifth point then you win a game so for example say you win two points and your opponent wins one point then the score would be if both you and your opponent have four points it's called deuce not at deuce you have to win two consecutive points to win the game now you keep doing that for each game and to win a set you need to win six games but you have to win by two so if you have six games and your opponent has five games then you have to play another game to win seven five if the score is six games to six games then you play a tiebreaker which is first to seven points win by two points so just like before if the score in the tiebreaker was then you would have to win another point to win that tiebreaker usually you have to win two out of the three sets to win Table tennis Andre Agassi Card Sharks Sudden death Tournament Bj__rn Borg Volleyball Pete Sampras Match Game Bundesliga (football) Maria Sharapova Badminton $ale of the Century Poker jargon Dominoes Canasta The Football League Contract bridge Piquet UEFA Champions League 2005-06 Martina Navratilova Mahjong Snooker Spades ELO rating system SmartAsk NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Family Feud Real tennis Cleveland Browns Pyramid (game show) Backgammon Monica Seles Quizbowl 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup Mary Pierce Ra (board game) Cribbage Australian rules football World Chess Championship Gustavo Kuerten Pete Sampras Tennis Jeopardy!
