anyone know of any examples of disability discrimination more info to follow need examples to back up a question the question involved a mentally disabled child being refused to participate in a yoga exercise class at a voluntary community centre i was once ordered out of an empty shop with my daughter who is a wheelchair user why their excuse was on the door was a sign no pushchairs allowed in so my argument was this is not a pushchair etc anyway eventually manager come out and said his assistant was right no pushchairs so i said why do you not put on door along side pushchair wheelchair his reply oh that would cause offence so being told to leave shop is not as for your question bit woolly there most fitness classes have guidelines to fill in and questionnaire for all and the yoga teacher may have not understood disability enough to be confident or trained in teaching someone with a disability as they have to be able to understand instructions so they do not get hurt so refusal may have been on those grounds yoga is an exercises you have to be careful in my daughter was once refused to go swimming with day centre they said it was because no one was qualified enough to know what they were doing with her in water and it was for her own safety nothing more nothing less disability discrimination now has a lot of power for instance local authorities have to make all places wheelchair friendly and so do many businesses now when i ran a small playgroup i also had to adear to all the guidlines provide multicultural toys books cooking utensils clothes ect and also to ensure disabled children were accomidated so if a disabled child went to playgroup nursary school the proper equipment has to be provided by law if they have not got it they have to buy it if the do not then that is discrimination not adering to their needs forgot to add this it is only discrimination if the yoga teacher refuses to do anything to assist the disabled child by getting someone in who can or reccommending another place Yoga Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Japanese tea ceremony Appeal Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Mental Health Act 1983 Education in the United States Wal-Mart No Child Left Behind Act Learning disability Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Civil rights Swimming pool Hate speech Separation of church and state Sento American and British English differences Acting President of the United States Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Nurse Martial art Tai Chi Chuan Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Wheelchair Involuntary commitment Disability Social work Little Britain Franklin D.
