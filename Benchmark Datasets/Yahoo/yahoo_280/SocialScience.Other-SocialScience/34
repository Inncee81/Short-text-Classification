why is my luck so rotten and how can i make it change ok i am trying to reword my question from before to make it more clear i have had bad things happen over and over again some are things that one could attempt to argue that i had some hand in but most are things that i had no hand in whatsoever being in the wrong place at the wrong time etc i want to add that this has affected me in that i have lower self esteem and am afraid of bad things happening so i avoid many circumstances that i really shouldn't so my question is can luck be changed if so how i am going to give an example so that i do not get answers about me changing the way i think one of the many bad things was that someone ran through a red light thereby t boning my car i am since disabled it was one of about car accidents i have been in where i have either not been driving or been hit by someone else not my fault other person ticketed things that are out of my hands out of my control things that i want to stop happening i do not want to think about them differently or learn something from them i want them to stop happening thank you for allowing the clarification you need to unwind at first it seems you are taking things too hard success and failure are parts of life moreover a good patch of time will be followed by a bad one things are never static you must banish negative thoughts gradually replace pessimism by optimism by meditation and by doing things systematically piece by piece can you write a memoir that will help unwind Extreme Programming Theory of conduct Microeconomics Yoga Sutras of Patanjali 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule Whose Line Is It Anyway?
