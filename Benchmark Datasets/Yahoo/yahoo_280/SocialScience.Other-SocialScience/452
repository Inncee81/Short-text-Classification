when single mothers take over america what kind of social system do you think we will have right now out of babies are born to single mothers and rising still most are employed about many of the children in america growing up now are seeing women as being responsible for the family do you think we are headed towards a big shift in power over the next years maybe we will be more matriarchal even though women seem to be bearing the burden at the moment do you think maybe something good could come of this in the long run yes a poor situation but i think people will adapt don't you think we always do i am just pondering the possible outcomes it seems that we are heading toward a world where marriage is no longer part of our society we are meandering toward a matriarchal family unit that will embrace roles and activities that are more reactive in nature and tend toward expediency collaboration and conciliation on the other hand we will also tend to proliferate a male dominated segment of society which will focus more on substituting family responsibilities and gratification achieved through the familial bonding mechanism for personal gratification and fulfillment since sex is now considered a commodity which is only a bodily function that results in a few minutes of pleasure rather than a need for any commitment of any kind there is little inducement to form a formal and binding male female family unit so we will tend more toward casual and non binding relationship which can be terminated at the drop of an angry word or a disgruntled look all life will then tend to be considered temporary in nature and focus more on short term pleasure rather than long term goals of course that is only my opinion Happiness Human sexual behavior Narcissism Sadism and masochism BDSM Goodness and value theory Infantilism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate Gender role Bondage (BDSM) Supply and demand Microeconomics Nicomachean Ethics State Feminism Coercion Family Pedophilia Sexual orientation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Marriage Human Same-sex marriage Polyamory Puberty Strategic management Abortion in the United States Breastfeeding Milton H.
