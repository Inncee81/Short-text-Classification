will you give me your opinion do any of you believe if there is more life out there in our universe whether it's plants organisms or even more humans out there i want to know if you believe there is more life out there or not give me your opinion why or why not thanks first i would like to say that anything is possible there is still so much that we don't know about other worlds stars galaxies and universes etc one theory that i heard really made sense to me if there were other living beings the odds of our species and theirs meeting are slim the reason is it would be like a needle in a haystack assuming there are others species on other worlds we most likely have not developed at the same rate nor have the same intelligence consider how long it took humans to discover the world was round i do not ascribe to the theory of evolution or that we were an alien seed community planted here evolution is that a species changes what it is a monkey becomes human a bird becomes a dinosaur i believe species adapt to their environmental needs however they do not change species as a result Species Evolution Extinction Creationism Biodiversity Fermi paradox Intelligent design Macroevolution The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Invasive species Dinosaur Natural selection Human evolution Person Ecology Extraterrestrial life Bird Evolutionism Creation science Human extinction Reproduction Biology Human Creation-evolution controversy History of creationism Borg Evolutionary creationism Teleological argument Frank Herbert Artificial selection Alien races in the Stargate universe SETI Publication of Darwin's theory Culture Franz Boas Sociocultural evolution Botany End of civilization Animal cognition Gaia philosophy Astrosociobiology Kardashev scale Animal Rare Earth hypothesis Irreducible complexity Anthropology Plant Neolithic Revolution Marvel Universe Transhumanism Gaia theory (science) Panspermia Xenomorph Vitamin C Animal communication Peter Singer Andalite Tetrapod Meaning of life Emergence Invasive plants Impact event Barbara McClintock Largest organism The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Bah__'__ Faith and Science Introduced species Archaeopteryx Sociobiology Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire Insect Cloning Speciesism Ape Thermoregulation Origin of language DC Universe Mammal Whale Organism Animism Origin belief Senescence Overpopulation Punctuated equilibrium Hair Stone Age Human (Star Wars) Penguin Eye Kitzmiller v.
