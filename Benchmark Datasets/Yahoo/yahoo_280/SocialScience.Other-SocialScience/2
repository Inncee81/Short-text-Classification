are we living in pre revolutionary times if not should we be here in uk there is always the background rumble of a distant revolution it has been the case since c when about percent of us supported the american revolution support for the french revolution was also about including open support from such as lord byron etc back in the s there was plenty of revolutionary activity both here in uk and on the streets of paris the left thought they were coming to power it did not happen and here in uk by the late s the people had had enough of the constant strikes and so forth we voted enmass for a complete change and got years of thatcherism the people got tired of thatcherism as they saw it's attack upon their most sacret cow the nhs i saw the effect of this myself when a friend of mine then in his th year lay dying in our local hospital during a visit to see him one doctor told me he would not see 'the patient' without being paid a fee i took this doctor by the scruff of the neck and held him low over the bed of my dying comrade and told him here is a war veteran a holder of the military medal you will call him sir and obey i got no more trouble from the privatisation quacks after that especially when i threatened them with a visit by my friend's colonel in chief of the grenadier guards they i told them would have something very big loud and rude to say about the treatment of one of their heros things are a bit too quiet at the moment here in uk most of us are classified by the political elite as 'content' that is we're not out on the streets yet demanding and end to this or that or and introduction of this or that last time out the london mob rang the death knell for margaret thatcher's dream of a poll tax oh yes it got introduced alright but you know from the outset that it would not last the duke of westminster general in charge of the terrororial army along with the dukes of norfolk and devonshire went into the house of lords to slag off the poll tax indeed the duke of westminster even told us that he was paying the tax on behalf of his thousands of working class tennants living on his estates in westminster say no more your grace following morning wham you know the rest even her own party turned against her in the end and the celts tarzan and howe stabbed her in the back not in some dark alley but right there in the house of commons for all the world to see good effin' riddance will anyone turn up at her funeral only if the dead stinking corpse is burned on a bonfire labour lead by gordon brown have a lead over the tories things look really bad for the cameroonians they've brought john spok redwood out of his coffin this is one sure way of not ever forming a government redwood that lick spittle creep is among the most hated of all the tory politicos of the creepy thatcherite kingdom of doom no we do not need a revolution right now and i think the next election in spite of what the papers are saying will probably come in may to coincide with the london assembley election this will divide boris johnson from a choice of his constituency in henley or taking his chances on winning the mayor of london race against the artful dodger red ken livingstone a shot has already been fired at johnson from the ken ship ken read an autobiography by johnson and was asked and what did you think of it it was the most scary book since 'silence of the lambs' that's not a shot over the bows that's a big hole below the waterline johnson your'e already sinking mate soon to drown i hope Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Politics of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher Conservative Party (UK) Labour Party (UK) Elections in the United Kingdom John Major Parliament of the United Kingdom William Pitt the Younger Greater London Council Robert Walpole United Kingdom general election, 1992 American Revolutionary War Neil Kinnock Radicalism Liberal Party (UK) James Callaghan Battles of Lexington and Concord Sin City Unreformed House of Commons Ken Livingstone Tony Blair Progressive Conservative Party of Canada Liberal Democrats (UK) One Piece minor characters Joe Clark The Invisibles Speaker of the British House of Commons Winter of Discontent Poll tax United Kingdom general election, 2005 French Revolution History of the United Kingdom London First English Civil War Tory John F.
