nice or evil this is little tricky question i'm planning on having a costume party sometime in oct i'm trying to incorporate some friends with families and some single friends most of people whom i'm trying to invite are from my husband's office he's not a boss the invitations will go out by mail anyway i organized a similar party in march and we had little problems invitees started fighting over little thing it was settled very quickly but i was really upset and expressed them how upset i was this sounds insane but we invited them to other party some weeks ago and pretty much same thing happened anyway we are not inviting these particular people for upcoming party but if you were one of the invitees would you still come to the party after all these incidents has happened people have seen me being upset others has been very nice to us but i'm not really sure if they are nice to us still since they like us or just being nice because they feel sorry for us i'd rather come again as i'm not mindful of little incidents The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Forty-seven Ronin Social rule Oasis (band) Fiddler on the Roof Ron Weasley Kim Possible Pok__mon Live!
