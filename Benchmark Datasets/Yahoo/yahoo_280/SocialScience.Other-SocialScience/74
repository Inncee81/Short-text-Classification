how do you know who you are inside i can't seem to figure out what i like who i am or anything like that i think i try to please my mom and dad to much they seem so proud and i worry if i change that they won't be as proud of me i just want to know who i am because of the above reasons and because i'm in high school and isn't this supposed to be a time of self discovery self and mental growth i personally believe you don't really know exactly who you are until you reach your late twenties to early thirties there will be constant changes in values and priorities and they will come in stampedes during the years leading up to that i am addressing your comment of pleasing your parents you can certainly start setting your compass in the direction of things that you think you might want to do in life but when you get down to brass tacks in your head you will find at your age that you are farrrr away from the person you will end up being in your late twenties early thirties normal though i think pleasing your parents is important during your hs years you will find whatever it is that pleases your parents probably is a positive thing anyway that you will be glad you stayed focused on while you are living with them you have plenty of time to do your own thing later in life i say all this not knowing what your parents have you doing though lol assuming they are healthy normal things hang in there and soon you will be running your own life and figuring out what pleases you and at times wishing you were back where you are now lol it's something to look forward too Infantilism Social rule Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RISC EastEnders Theory of conduct Carl Friedrich Gauss Late Night with Conan O'Brien Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Intelligence quotient Objectivist philosophy Fathers' rights Humphrey Bogart Human height The Cure Sailing Friends Normal distribution Milton H.
