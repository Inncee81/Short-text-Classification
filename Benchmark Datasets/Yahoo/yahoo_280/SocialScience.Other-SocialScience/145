how can a young child know the difference from male and female without any concept of what each means you ask a kid at any age and they know the difference between male and female without any one teaching it to them my niece for instance at age three knew how many boys and girls were in the room without any trouble no matter what age we were serious answers only please my son our youngest is two and had a really hard time with this concept which i found interesting he has an older brother and two sisters in between them we would ask him as he was learning this concept if he was a boy or a girl many time he would answer girl much to the dismay of my husband and older son haha we all kind of quiz him and he seems to be getting it now but for a while it was really confusing to him i disagree with asking a kid at any age and they know this is something they learn after age before that they really have no concept of gender i'm not sure what caused his confusion about it maybe because at that age they just see people they love no gender no faults no difference wouldn't it be nice if we could all be like that Gender John Money Family Gender role Age of consent Transactional analysis Philosophy of language Friends Boy Meets World Pedophilia One Tree Hill (TV series) Gender identity Wolfrider Sex Humphrey Bogart Child Girl About a Boy Salic law Ken Chu Male prostitute Game show Infant baptism Milton H.
