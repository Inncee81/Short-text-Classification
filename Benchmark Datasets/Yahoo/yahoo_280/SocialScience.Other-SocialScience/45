does the concept of dragons prove that dinosaurs and humans lived together i know little about the subject but i believe the concept of dragons is an old one doesn't this basicly show that they knew about dinosaurs i heard a theory that makes alot of sense to me here goes in the past history of primates from which humans evolved large birds talons wings snakes long body venom scales large lizards legs scales again big mouth large teeth were our main predators not dinosaurs per say but a large eagle a large reptile or even a small snake could take out a small monkey put these things together and we get a dragon comprised of the various signals that something was dangerous all in one package why do we have dragons and why do they symbolize danger in one form or another instinct which is genetically encoded memory passed from parent to child regardless if a given person grows up attracted to women or to men everyone as an infant is a 'tit person' that is instinct in action nobody had to teach that to the baby they just know at birth same thing here eating is a survival behavior just like avoiding danger is a survival behavior to me it makes sense that dreams and stories would be a mechanism to help that instinct along there is all sorts of symbolism and ritual connected to boobs and to danger in all sorts of cultures around the world i don't think dragons in history literature or any other realm proves man and dinosaurs walked together at the same time to me it means that the human mind is more complicated that we suppose or want to suppose when the whole creationist we dream of dragons thus we walked with them thus the world is years old thus the bible is literally true want to suppose its just to traumatic to personally established belief systems to be shaken without a fight no matter how irrational or futile the fight happens to be Human Dinosaur Snake Culture Meaning of life Immortality Free will Animal communication Reincarnation Fictional character Creationism Empathy Human nature Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Brain Apocalypse Meme Supernatural Altruism Nihilism Soul Epistemology Minor Harry Potter Beasts Animism Anorexia nervosa Chinese dragon Sigmund Freud Origin of language Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Biology Infantilism European dragon Cognitive science God Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion debate David Hume Young Earth creationism Biped Determinism American Alligator Summa Theologiae Dragon Tyrannosaurus rex Shen Gong Wu Evolutionary creationism Religion Evolutionism Spider Elephant Thermoregulation Creatures in Bionicle Socrates Anthropology Artificial consciousness Emergence Reptile Origin belief Sexual orientation Dog training Karen Horney Philosophical skepticism Scientology beliefs and practices Plesiosaur Philosophy of mathematics Evolution Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist History of creationism Flood geology Science Property (ownership right) Ecology Bird Deluge (mythology) Aquatic ape hypothesis Tetrapod Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Metaphysics Phaedo Breast Music Causality Psychoanalysis Lizard Fauna of Australia Animal Cat Gnosticism Shaggy dog story Intelligent design Toilet humour Buddhism Reptilian humanoid
