atheists am i wrong everyone believes in something no one can endure the stress and cares of life without faith in something that cannot ultimately be proven atheists cannot prove there is no god pantheists cannot prove that everything is god pragmatists cannot prove that what will count for them in the future is what works for them now nor can agnostics prove that it is impossible to know one way or the other faith is unavoidable even if we choose to believe only in ourselves faith or belief is only as good as the object in which we place our trust what or who you place your faith in matters jesus said if you do not believe that i am he savior you will die in your sins john furthermore we are told he that believes on the son has eternal life but whoever rejects the son will not see life for god's wrath remains on him john therefore the bible focuses not as much on the act of belief as on the object of belief god requires man to put his faith in christ alone for salvation nothing else will satisfy him everything has a cause every effect has a cause we do not exist in a vacuum or a bubble where do we come from at some point we all recognize that life had a beginning logic and design eliminate the idea that we just happened to exist by chance the god of the bible is the ultimate answer to the question of our origins for it is understood that as an infinite being and eternally self existent he does not require a cause psalm colossians ii peter evidence of a designer the universe displays a staggering amount of evidence for revealing an intelligent designer this intelligence is observed both in the things one observes and the way these things relate to others outside themselves the intricate order of the universe and it's regularity can fill even the most casual observer with awe it is the norm within nature to observe many different components that work together to produce something valuable it is amazing that there would even be a question whether this intelligible order is the product of chance or of intelligent design this design can only come from the mind of a designer what's even more amazing is that this designer cares about us some people reason that a god great enough to create the universe would be too big to be concerned about us jesus however confirmed what the design and detail of the natural world suggest he showed that god is great enough to care about the smallest details of our lives he spoke of one who not only knows every move we make but also the motives and thoughts of our heart jesus taught that god knows the number of hairs on our head the concerns of our heart and even the condition of a fallen sparrow psalm matthew so what do you think you're not alone if you are open to the existence of god but aren't sure you can accept jesus' claim to be god in the flesh the teacher from nazareth promised help to those who are concerned about doing the will of god he said if anyone chooses to do god's will he will find out whether my teaching comes from god or whether i speak on my own john niv to the first answerer no i can't prove it but i hope everyone will find it i know god exists i know that as a fact but to prove my fact i am unable there is no way i can prove god to you although i have seen in face to face it is amazing that there would even be a question whether this intelligible order is the product of chance or of intelligent design this design can only come from the mind of a designer what makes you think that there is only chance or god randomness is often not random but it does not automatically follow that there is a being behind the universe pressing buttons and pushing events a certain way there are patterns in chaos and man is addicted to finding order in what seems like disorder thus it is inevitable that man would superimpose a humanlike deity onto the order he sees in the universe because it links him with this vast other the idea of god gives man an extension into the heavens instead of groping in the dark raging against order that he cannot understand if man simply assigns what he cannot understand to the hand of god then man does not feel so insecure the idea of god the designer and an interventionist god feels like a security blanket concept man's way of creating a daddy to tuck us in under the frightening canopy of inexplicable stars the scientific atheist connects by seeking the basic physical concepts of the working of the universe by rational experimental inquiry there is no need to anthropomorphize such a search so god does not come into it it is basically mathematical and systematic logical but i am not saying that this way leads to ultimate truth either only that it does not require an intelligent designer to explain basic concepts so i don't see your point about evidence for intelligent design especially since you being by pointing out that no one can prove anything id would be yet another aspect of living by faith would it not no evidence given none required i choose not to believe in that idea but i wouldn't deny you the right to believe it if you choose Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Creation science Atomism
