did i open pandora's box until about or years ago i always wore pantyhose with my skirt suits for work each day at the office needless to say with me dressing that way for work each day my hubby developed a pretty intense curiousity for my pantyhose right around the time that my wardrobe transitioning to skirt suits and going bare legged with skirts i was wearing pantyhose for work only on occasion one one of those occasions that i was wearing them i just asked him if he was so curious about the hose why doesnt he just try them i then hiked up my skirt eased out of my sheers handed them to him and told him to slip them on well long story short he went absolutely ga ga over the way they felt which i thought was kind of neat hes asked a few more times recently for me to let him wear them again but i dont want things to get out of hand at the same time i don't want to deny it to him because of how much he liked it that one time what should i do he's just having fun guys don't know what it's like to wear sheers and he's getting a kick out of it probably likes the feel of it i used to have a bf that wanted me to wear thigh highs while we did it unless he wants to start wearing them in public i wouldn't worry you kinky kids Pantyhose Skirt and dress Undergarment Stocking Social aspects of clothing Trousers Ranma __ characters Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Suit (clothes) Shaggy dog story Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost The Ashlee Simpson Show Marilyn Monroe Fruits Basket Leggings FoxTrot Swimsuit Milton H.
