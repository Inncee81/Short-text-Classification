is the u s media honest with the public c i think you already know the answer to this question most people are truly unaware of the power of the media it has the power to control people's attitudes to a degree that is frightening most folks don't have a clue how much their beliefs about life in general are shaped by television radio and newspapers the secret to their power is subtlety they ever so carefully make innuendos about what attitudes are good and which ones are bad to think that this power is not being directed by monied interests is absurd never in the history of the human race have we been exposed to this kind of mind control sometime set up a large mirror at an angle to your television and sit back some distance so that you are not looking directly at it look just to the side of the mirror so that you can see what the tv is doing in your peripheral vision you will notice that the vast majority of images and messages are flashed at you faster than you have time to think about it these images and thoughts reach your subconscious mind before you have time to critically analyze them this is exactly how hypnosis works every day people sit in front of their tvs and have their attitudes and beliefs shaped by forces that do not have their best interests in mind i tell everyone i know to turn off the tube for good you might think i was asking them to cut off a hand when you see the responses i get this just tells me that i am probably right about all this they have been programmed with the need to continue watching and don't know what to do without their electronic drug just my two cents will Television Eye Milton H.
