what if someone went to sleep in i wondered about this earlier today i thought about how advanced things are now compared to what my parents and grandparents were used to and i can't imagine life being that much different years from now because we are so advanced then i thought yeah it probably will be way different just look at how much things have changed in the last years suppose you pulled a back to the future and you got the delorean back in time and brought someone back to the present with you or what if someone woke up from a deep sleep or coma right now and the last thing they remembered was the late 's or early 's picture the happy days era what would the reaction be can you picture all the things that would be so different than you remember that it would shock you you should have lived half a century as i have the changes have been amazing i see in movies sometimes an office without computers and i remember those days before computers wow it was truly different then in many ways i remember when my father sent me a strange new device everyone came from miles around off the prairie in an agricultural place to see the device we were all well educated but that device made us giggle like little children people dropped by for a week after it arrived and i let them play with it they would stand outside by their pickup trucks in their coveralls and hold the shiny device in their weathered rough hands and go very quiet they would hand it back to me and stare off across the prairie much as the native americans must have when they saw their first locomotives steaming across that same prairie there was always a strange look in their eyes a little wonder a little worry a little sadness for the changes that the device heralded then they'd smile and shake their heads in acceptance and drive away with their shaken up paradigms i still have that extraordinary device it's one of the first electronic hand calculators Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Back to the Future Jennifer Parker Milton H.
