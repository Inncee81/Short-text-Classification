what's good this is such a great question it is essentally the root of all bias in the world good is something that is based upon an individual's beliefs it is as obi wan would say from a certain point of view where good can be found continuing on the star wars theme for a second anakin skywalker became darth vader out of what he believed was a good cause to learn how to help his wife padme avoid a death he was afraid she would suffer do you think any of the generals and commanders and such on the death star thought they were the bad guys no way but this is true in real life while we universally believe hilter was wrong and crazy he truely felt he was right and doing a good thing similarly osama bin laden feels he is doing the right thing by attacking what he sees as the evil power the united states and who is more good the israelis or the palestinians well that depends on a certain point of view doesn't it bias is based on what we percieve to be good if you say are a born again christian than its possible that everyone who isn't just isn't seeing the light that their path isn't good especially those who don't believe in jesus if you grew up with only one race of people around you and move to the big city where there are hundreds of races you might tend to allow those stereotypes take hold and denounce all races but yours to be bad or whatever word you use if you were born blind does that make you bad no you don't know the difference and your sense of touch or smell is probably incredible here's the bottom line we all have our own senses to whatever degree we percieve our world through our eyes and whatever that perception is becomes our reality but yours is different than mine even if we are brothers or bro sis or twins and grew up at the same time with all the same things you're still not me you're different you see things differently it's vital for us all to understand that and don't assume your good is the best good or is good for someone else so do the best you can to make good in the world without stepping all over everyone else's good and you're going to find a world of friends at your doorstep Obi-Wan Kenobi Darth Vader Force (Star Wars) Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Jedi Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism Anakin Solo Princess Leia Nute Gunray Evil Theodicy Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Alignment (role-playing games) Soul Force powers The nature of God in Western theology Epistemology Notable lines in the Star Wars series Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scientology beliefs and practices Padm__ Amidala Dates in Star Wars Goodness and value theory Sith Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity John Howard Yoder Reality Yoda Galactic Civil War Michel Henry Neuro-linguistic programming God Palpatine Confederacy of Independent Systems Media bias Christian eschatology Count Dooku Lightsaber Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Nicomachean Ethics Fundamentalism Determinism Piccolo Junior Saga Boba Fett Biblical inerrancy New Age Creationism Supernatural Lightsaber combat Qui-Gon Jinn Friends Angel Neofascism and religion Osama bin Laden Deconstruction Sin Jon Secada Alcoholics Anonymous Kyle Broflovski Mace Windu Ontological argument Ranma __ characters Karma Aesthetic Realism Monomyth Jiddu Krishnamurti Friedrich Schleiermacher Bernard Williams Propaganda Philosophy of language Objectivist philosophy Predestination Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) The Clone Wars Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Transactional analysis Moral Politics Meaning of life Scientific method Kender Socrates Eric Cartman Gnosticism Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace Free will
