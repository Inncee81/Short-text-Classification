why are goths goths do they have problems that make them that way or think they have tough problems or just like black i love gothic things love black hav problems but im not goth im just wondering im goth because i want to be a lot of what you just listed about goths is actually just a stereotype goth is more than just black clothes its a state of mind its about apreciateing the good while dealing with the bad its about realizing other people have it worse and wanting to do something about it yeah the black clothes are part of it but its definatly not all of it look at it this way anyone can be goth ive seen goths of every race color creed whatever you name it ive probably seen a goth that fits that discription the main thing is the frame of mind the sense of humor the taking the bad with the good the realizing that your problems arent the biggest thing in this world all that goth is acutally a damn good thing if people got past the stereotypes and looked at what goth really is i think we'd see a lot more people going goth to be honest goth is good goth is smart the goths who do cut and are depressed and just wear the black clothes because they like them thats not what goth is about those people buy into the stereotypes Goth Gothic rock Gothic metal Joke Recurring South Park characters Death rock Clothing Gothic fashion The Fairly OddParents Dragon Booster Theory of conduct Valens The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Ashlee Simpson Show Heavy metal fashion Dead Like Me Black Johnny the Homicidal Maniac SpongeBob SquarePants History of subcultures in the 20th century 2000 Australian Grand Prix Numerology Ostrogoth Time Out of Mind Invader Zim High school subcultures About a Boy Visual Kei Charles Ives Pitaten Boston and Lowell Railroad Swami Vivekananda 21st Century Emo Gothic Lolita Humphrey Bogart The nature of God in Western theology Christian Death Grunge music Richard Allen (reverend) Bat Lash Secondary education in the United States Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Roman Empire Fruits Basket Something Positive W.
