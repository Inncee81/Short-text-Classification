what do you think ok i have a friend who is a boy and ever since i've had his number and he had mine we would text each other he would sit next to me in almost every class so i got to know him better he was nice during the school year and i started to like him i sinced that he liked me too but by the end of the year there was like this change in him he would try to ignore me and when i ever i asked him why he was suddenly mad at me he wouldnt answer so i asked one of my best friends to ask him because that was his girl friend but i think he was only her boyfriend because i told him that he was uuseing her i think he may have gotten mad he broke up with her the next couple of weeks and still countined to ignore me but later on he answerd some of my text we would wake up texting each other and go to sleep texting each other but when i sent him even one picture of me or his ex gf he would get mad and tell me to never do it agian untill one day he told he was to good me what do you think and he told me stop sending him pictures because he only likes looking at hot girls he thinks the world revovles around him it revolves around u too so take heed of his actions wh is rather childish and immature so u hv to weigh it whether its worth keeping this friendship there r so many others out there widen your circle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Ocean's Twelve The Amber Spyglass The Time Machine Great Teacher Onizuka The Shining (film) Avenue Q About a Boy Little Britain One Tree Hill (TV series) Full Metal Panic?
