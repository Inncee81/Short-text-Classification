can an animal be gay honestly i don't think so but then again i'm not a vet or a scientist theoretically is it possible how and why oh it totally happens for instance there's the penguins in the central park zoo this penguin couple has been together for years zookeepers didn't even realize they were both males until the usually submissive penguin took the top position once they're not interested in the female penguins and the girls don't want them they also desperately wanted a baby to the point of bringing a rock into their nest and trying to incubate it eventually the zookeepers gave them an extra egg it was either a twin or an orphan to raise and they've been quite happy also bonobo chimps engage in sexual play with pretty much anyone in order to maintain group bonds and to settle conflicts male female male male female female they'll do it all animal homosexuality has been established in some species neat Non-human animal sexuality Monogamy Penguin Group sex Homosexuality Mountain Gorilla Platypus Chimpanzee Ostrich Gender role Kakapo Sex Age of consent Theory of conduct Bird Infantilism Biology and sexual orientation Life in the Freezer Elephant Bonobo Knots Landing Gay slang Human Anal sex Kodocha Pedophilia Sexual intercourse Hentai Biped Chicken Jane Goodall Effeminacy Oz (TV series) Madagascar (film) Kiwi Heterosexuality Prostitution Transgender Jam (TV series) Animal communication Friends Stranger in a Strange Land Timon and Pumbaa Polyamory The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Leatherback Sea Turtle Sexual attraction Liger Human sexual behavior EastEnders Don't ask, don't tell Sexual identity Incubate (bird) Lawrence v.
