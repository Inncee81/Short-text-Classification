has anyone else noticed the serious decline in home runs this year a rod is murdering the ball i admit but look at these other guys who just aren't putting up the long ball as frequently this year david ortiz hr manny ramirez hr albert pujols hr travis hafner hr vernon wells not sure but not many jim thome in the teens paul konerko about or so jason bay in the teens andrew jones lower than normal chipper jones lower than normal nomar garciaparra hr bobby abreu hr some guys like fielder and howard are clobbering the ball but it seems like so many guys are just way down this year guys that routinely hit are going to end up in the 's steroids looser woven ball it's totally apparent thanks for listing the numbers on some of the guys i actually heard the stat last week the league is some home runs behind the pace they were at this time last year amazing i'm not sure what the deal is but do you think any of those guys were steroid guys in the past garciaparra is the only that makes me wonder and he was just a great all around hitter so i doubt it at the same time a lot of these guys ortiz manny pujols thome chipper they're having solid seasons just not replicating the power they've hit for in the past kind of strange no quite honestly i think it's a coincidence more than anything at this rate only guys will reach homers a rod fielder howard and maybe morneau ortiz and pujols will go on a run pujols should end up in the high 's like he was his first couple seasons but i wonder if manny's power may have slipped and the same for thome abreu nomar and chipper wells konerko and bay all signed long term contracts within the last years so that might explain their off seasons so that leaves andruw jones who's inexplicably having a very down season in a contract year has anyone ever really been that blown away by him as a hitter though i kind of thought the last couple seasons were more of an aberration i'm not shocked at all to see him stumble on his feet this year especially when considering his rumored lackadaisical work ethic interesting point though we'll just have to see how the rest of the season plays out Boston Red Sox Manny Ram__rez Home run Babe Ruth Albert Pujols Chicago White Sox Top 500 home run hitters of all time St. Louis Cardinals July 2004 in sports 1957 World Series Nomar Garciaparra Red Sox Nation David Ortiz 2005 World Series Barry Bonds Hank Aaron Jim Thome Miguel Tejada 2004 American League Championship Series Bobby Abreu Tris Speaker Baseball statistics Oakland Athletics Toronto Blue Jays English cricket team October 2004 in sports Chipper Jones Cleveland Browns New York Yankees Baseball World Series Baseball scorekeeping Andr__s Galarraga Curse of the Bambino Fast bowling Chicago Cubs Left fielder Star Trek: Enterprise October 16 in baseball Mark McGwire Gary Sheffield Knots Landing Jos__ Canseco Miami Dolphins Alex Rodriguez Jason Giambi Fielding (cricket) St. Louis Rams Pittsburgh Pirates New York Giants Paul Konerko Major League Baseball television contracts San Francisco Giants Sammy Sosa History of baseball in the United States The Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award Cricket Pawtucket Red Sox Batting average Reggie Jackson Volleyball Satchel Paige 2005 National League Championship Series Detroit Tigers National Football League The Jim Rome Show Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Pete Rose November 3 in baseball Shortstop Robin Ventura New England Patriots Willie Mays Major League Baseball The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases 2004 National League Championship Series Troy Glaus Major League Baseball All-Star Game Frank Howard (baseball player) October 23 in baseball Cincinnati Reds October 15 in baseball Durham Bulls Detroit Red Wings Wrigley Field Indianapolis 500 Jason Varitek Carl Yastrzemski
