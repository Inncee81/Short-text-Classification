why don't pitchers just intentionally walk barry bonds yea but its not just all what the fans want i pay money to watch the pirates try to win but they are lucky if they win once every weeks at a certain point in the game they will ibb him because first base is open and he does not have a lot of protection in that lineup soemtimes the don't need the extra baserunner and the last time i checked bonds can't hit the ball all that well b c all he trys to do is hit homeruns and do it for himself and that is one of the prime reasons why the giants are so bad this season besides the fact they have not pitching they have the most pointless lineup in the league with durham roberts in your lineup in front of bonds is not going to work and i forgot to mention randy winn can't forget him so basically they dont do it all the time because they want to pitch to him and some liek the challenge or their manager wants to go after him and get an out to get out of the inning quicker its all about winning the game everyone except barry bonds team is worried about winning the game its like bonds and the rest of the guys dont even make an effort bonds just needs to hit the hr and then move on to arod for the next years Barry Bonds Home run Grover Cleveland Alexander Baseball San Francisco Giants 1957 World Series Sandy Koufax Baseball statistics Babe Adams Ty Cobb Satchel Paige Pittsburgh Pirates October 4 in baseball Intentional base on balls Hank Aaron Toronto Blue Jays Oakland Athletics Troy Glaus Perfect game Alex Rodriguez Boston Red Sox No-hitter Cincinnati Reds Baseball Stars Joaqu__n And__jar Doyle Alexander 1986 World Series 2004 American League Championship Series International League Softball St. Louis Cardinals 2003 World Series Willie Mays Los Angeles Dodgers Sammy Sosa Johnny Allen Detroit Tigers New York Mets Major League Baseball television contracts 2004 World Series Andr__s Galarraga Tris Speaker Pitcher Atlanta Braves Johnny Antonelli October 27 in baseball 1919 World Series Houston Astros 2005 World Series Don Hoak October 15 in baseball Mois__s Alou Derek Jeter Pete Rose Chicago White Sox Stolen base San Diego Padres Nolan Ryan 2001 World Series October 12 in baseball Chicago Cubs Red Ames Randy Winn October 17 in baseball Ted Williams Greg Maddux Volleyball October 16 in baseball October 20 in baseball History of baseball in the United States October 19 in baseball Interference (baseball) Vin Scully September 20 in baseball November 3 in baseball Lou Gehrig Nick Altrock Batting average Ichiro Suzuki Wrigley Field Reggie Jackson Hit by pitch October 7 in baseball 1991 World Series Florida Marlins Felipe Alou New York Giants October 1 in baseball
