what do you think of bud selig's reaction to barry bonds' record home run bud apparently made a telephone call to barry after the game but again he was not in attendance so let me ask should bud have attended and should he have more readily embraced this historic moment everyone clearly can tell that bud thinks barry cheated by his lukewarm reaction to the tying home run but still i agree that bud is a pretty bad commissioner but no one will ever be worse than the nhl's gary bettman i am in no way a public defender for bonds quite the opposite actually but this record meant a lot to him and it would not have been classless for him to play on and attempt to break it we are not saying bud had to act a certain way but we are saying that he needed to take one stand or the other instead he tried to please everyone by being emotionless and congratulating barry with congrats on the record even though i think you cheated again i don't like bonds either and i do think he did steroids but still have some respect for this accomplishment i like how bud selig could not go without mentioning the scandal while he congratulated barry it was smooth it was like congratulations you are the new home run king even though there are questions surrounding you acccomplishments also i praise hank for not being there and i believe the only reason he congratulated barry was to be the better man Barry Bonds Major League Baseball Bud Selig National Hockey League Home run 2004-05 NHL lockout World Series History of baseball in the United States 2005 World Series Pete Rose Hank Aaron Married... with Children Baseball Montr__al Expos Ben Johnson (athlete) Moonraker 1994 baseball strike Commissioner Babe Ruth Stanley Cup Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) 1957 World Series The Joker's Wild Theory of conduct Plame affair One Tree Hill (TV series) Gary Bettman Brian Close Babe Ruth's Called Shot St. Louis Cardinals Cliff Richard Major League Baseball television contracts Bud Adams Fay Vincent ESPN25 Poker jargon Pittsburgh Steelers September 2004 in sports Reggie Jackson MLB on FOX 2004 World Series Los Angeles Clippers Ice hockey Los Angeles Kings Oasis (band) 1987 World Series Contract bridge Nolan Ryan Boston Bruins Dream Job (Season 2) 1919 World Series Royal Assent Rock, Paper, Scissors Chicago White Sox Bud Collyer EastEnders Knots Landing San Francisco Giants Cheating in poker Rafael Palmeiro Palace of Westminster Volleyball September 20 in baseball Minnesota Vikings New York Giants Mario Lemieux Jean Chr__tien 1986 World Series Don Drysdale Barry Goldwater Baseball (object) Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Unreleased Madonna songs Kareem Said Billboard Hot 100 Washington Nationals Sydney Riot of 1879 Kansas City Chiefs Playoff New York Yankees October 7 in baseball Gary Sheffield John Kerr Craps Anti-communism Inspector Gadget Sammy Sosa Weapon X 2005 Philippine electoral crisis Darwin from Orchids to Variation Microeconomics Linus Pauling Goldfinger October 22 in baseball Norway national football team Ultimate (sport) 1992-93 NHL season Modernism James Bond
