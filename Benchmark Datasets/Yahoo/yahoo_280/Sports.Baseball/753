should dh's be held to a different standard among hof voters first i will admit my bias i can't stand the dh but i will be open minded in reviewing answers to my question should guys who are dh for most of their career e martinez baines f thomas ortiz have their offensive numbers be held to a higher standard when considered for the hof remember these guys do not play or contribute to half of the game also out of the five tools they are minus in two categories defense and arm and are usually poor in a third base running i am not saying a long time dh should not make the hall but i do think they must be held to a higher standard even at the expense of traditional benchmarks like hits and home runs and i am not talking about a mike piazza who finishes his career as a dh interested in your feedback most cogent answer gets points h charles your point is well taken about the defensive liabilities of some pre dh hall of famers and some other guys may have been able to prolong their career a k a mike piazza and add to the their offensive numbers certainly but not to a huge extent dhs contribute much less to the game and don't have to have all the requisite skills to play in the field that certainly removes a significant portion of the voting criteria since fielding is eliminated however there are several mitigating factors that lessen the negative impact of a career dh first the hall values offense more than defense particularly in the more recent era the barometers used to determine qualification are primarily offensive career homers batting average hits rbis etc while defense isn't discounted today it is much harder to quantify and therefore by its nature factored in to a lesser extent to appreciate d one has to spend a signifiant amount of time watching the player play second there are many hofplayers who did play in the field but had no business being there these guys would have been dhs had they been around but the position didn't exist guys like mccovey and killebrew were defensive liabilities much of their careers whose offense won the day dhs shouldn't be penalized any more than they were third there is a weaker argument that the dh is a specific postition and players should be judged soley by their merit at a particular position just as you would require less offensive production from a catcher than a right fielder for hall purposes you can require less defensive production from dhs after all we don't discount al pitchers because they never have to hit Baseball Softball Baseball statistics Robin Ventura Hank Aaron 1957 World Series Toronto Blue Jays Batting average Willie Mays New York Yankees Seattle Mariners Chicago White Sox Boston Red Sox Ty Cobb David Ortiz Tris Speaker Barry Bonds Los Angeles Dodgers Home run Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 Babe Ruth World Series New York Mets Andr__s Galarraga Sandy Koufax San Francisco Giants Fielding (cricket) Baseball Hall of Fame Taxation in the United States Carl Yastrzemski International League Paintball 2004 American League Championship Series Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 October 16 in baseball Nolan Ryan Volleyball Baseball Stars Baseball scorekeeping Oakland Athletics Insurance Gary Sheffield October 26 in baseball Cincinnati Bengals Microeconomics Ted Williams Extreme Programming New York Giants Batting (cricket) October 22 in baseball Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Designated hitter Poker jargon Pedro Mart__nez Blackjack Dave Kingman ELO rating system Cleveland Indians Lou Gehrig Reggie Jackson Sammy Sosa Alex Rodriguez October 4 in baseball Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Wealth Babe Ruth's Called Shot Batting order (baseball) Rickey Henderson American football Cricket Atlanta Braves Laws of cricket Derek Jeter Single Transferable Vote Mike Schmidt Florida Marlins Tommy Lasorda Frank Howard (baseball player) St. Louis Rams Billiards Troy Glaus Nuclear power English cricket team Sabermetrics Major League Baseball 1919 World Series National Football League
