there was a question on espn com today and i totally disagreed with what most people chose quest was what is the hardest record to break it was barry bonds hr record joe dimaggio game consecutive hits carl ripken consecutive games played pete rose career hits said it's carl ripken's record but i beg to differ infact i think that's the easiest record all one has to do is be in the lineup even when you're hurt one thing i hated about this record i thought barry bonds' record is still the hardest to break i mean bb himself did it with steroids people say a rod will break it but i still have doubts about that to me it's either the hr record or joe dimaggio's hitting streak whatcha think please don't add your own records i am talking about these alone please if we keep seeing sick amounts of homers like we have recently i would think someone catching bonds is quite possible the biggest question for me would be if players like arod decide to retire early since they already have more than enough money to last them and to avoid beating up their bodies further not everyone sticks around through their s i think dimaggio's record is the toughest to break when you factor in the skill and luck needed to hit in straight games same with rose's career hits ty cobb is my favorite old school player to read about and i gotta respect rose's hitting skill when he broke a record of the great ty cobb all cal ripken did was show up though it was a hell of a lot of times in a row lol and it will be extremely difficult to beat but at the end of the day it's just showing up for your job he got the perfect attendance award Lou Gehrig World Series Babe Ruth Ty Cobb History of baseball in the United States Troy Glaus New York Yankees Baseball Home run Cal Ripken, Jr. Joe DiMaggio Alex Rodriguez Hank Aaron ESPN25 October 22 in baseball Game show September 20 in baseball 1957 World Series Satchel Paige Pete Sampras Miguel Tejada Tris Speaker September 6 in baseball Sports timeline June 12 in baseball October 4 in baseball Detroit Tigers Roger Federer Bj__rn Borg International League $ale of the Century Andre Agassi Willie Mays Jim Rice The Joker's Wild New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals The Adventures of Pete & Pete October 5 in baseball 2004 World Series Ted Williams Andr__s Galarraga The Isley Brothers Volleyball Poker jargon November 1 in baseball October 20 in baseball Final Fantasy XI Norway national football team Wayne Gretzky San Francisco Giants Major League Baseball titles streaks Sandy Koufax Baltimore Orioles Mickey Mantle Fast bowling Rickey Henderson Ken Jennings Stolen base June 8 in baseball Wheel of Fortune Snooker Major League Baseball television contracts Indianapolis 500 Batting average Cincinnati Reds November 3 in baseball Chicago White Sox Billboard Hot 100 St. Louis Cardinals Rafael Palmeiro The Sporting News Player of the Year Award NBA Finals Hip hop rivalries Joe Morgan Boston Red Sox Pump It Up Toronto Raptors New England Patriots 24 Hours of Le Mans Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles San Francisco 49ers Jennifer Lopez Super Bowl XXVII Marilyn Monroe Cleveland Browns Nolan Ryan St. Louis Rams English cricket team Brett Favre George Sisler
