if the orioles were to get one great lefty hitter in the off season who would fit them the best the orioles have been looking around for that one thing that they need to get back into the swing of things which they have been out of for the past years teixeira dunn ichiro anyone dunn is a good power hitter but he strikes out way too much jermaine dye i dont know if he's lefty or not but hes a great hitter nonetheless and has an expiring contract ichiro and teixeira are out of reach just signing new contracts there arent that many big bats out in the open market this season however here are a few players i think that could help the orioles club for the record im not an orioles fan im a diamondbacks fan bj upton from tampa bay he has great hitting power contact ability and is quick plus he may be a good compliment for nick markakis in the outfield hanley ramirez from florida again flashes the speed leather and power that the orioles need to help out tejada even though ramirez playes ss making the switch to b should be no problem where does brian roberts go you ask put him at b and use melvin mora as trade bait for ramirez miguel cabrera from florida big power hitter trade mora for cabrera and maybe throw in a couple minor league prospects for him too would be a nice compliment to tejada in the power department mike piazza fa pick him up off the waiver wire and use him as a dh instead of aubrey huff put huff as permanent b to not lose his bat and use millar as trade bait to also pickup a lf or a great hitting catcher which brings me to my next player brian mccann from atl jarrod saltalamacchia from tex great defensive catcher as well as a power hitter mccanns having a down year after showing promise last season but he should be up next year it'll be mccanns rd year in the league and he'll definitely bloom but saltalamacchia shows a lot of promise as a heralded prospect from atlanta now playing for the rangers he's a rookie this year but there is plenty of room for him to grow too all of these players i think would add a spark theyre all young except for piazza who adds experience as a veteran and show great potential for the future i think that the answer for the orioles isnt to find an immediate fix but plan for the future yes they have been down but theyre having a mediocre year this year and if they bring in any of these talented young players and sign them for a long term deal they will have a pretty good team for a few years Oakland Athletics Chicago White Sox World Series New York Yankees Babe Ruth Florida Marlins Boston Red Sox Manny Ram__rez Baseball November 1 in baseball New York Mets Sammy Sosa Detroit Tigers Alex Rodriguez Ichiro Suzuki Miguel Tejada Minor league baseball Reggie Jackson Pittsburgh Pirates International League Ty Cobb History of baseball in the United States New York Giants Gary Sheffield Cleveland Indians Robin Ventura Randy Johnson 2004 World Series Cincinnati Reds Houston Astros Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Washington Nationals Melvin Mora 1957 World Series Baseball statistics Pete Rose Tris Speaker 2004 American League Championship Series October 4 in baseball Batting average St. Louis Cardinals Milwaukee Brewers Andr__s Galarraga Los Angeles Dodgers October 22 in baseball Barry Bonds November 3 in baseball Atlanta Braves 1919 World Series October 5 in baseball Hideo Nomo Volleyball Sandy Koufax Softball November 4 in baseball Hank Aaron Moe Berg Toronto Raptors October 2005 in sports National Football League Stolen base San Diego Padres Roberto Alomar Boston Bruins New England Patriots October 31 in baseball October 12 in baseball Philadelphia Phillies Carolina Panthers Pittsburgh Steelers Detroit Red Wings Lefty Grove Mois__s Alou October 16 in baseball 2005 World Series October 14 in baseball Los Angeles Kings 1981 baseball strike Kansas City Royals Roger Clemens Carlos Beltr__n Dick Williams San Francisco Giants Dixie Walker Montr__al Expos Tampa Bay Buccaneers October 26 in baseball Scott Podsednik
