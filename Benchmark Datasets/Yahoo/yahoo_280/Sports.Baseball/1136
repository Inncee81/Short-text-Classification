can you tell your experience going to your first baseball im just wondering oh my bad i mean first baseball game sorry june my father took me to my first cubs game days before my th birthday bill hands pitched a complete game and the cubs won over the expos to be honest although i loved the game as a kid and still do i don't remember a lot of the details about the game itself i do however remember the atmosphere at wrigley field the grass looked much greener then it did on tv the sky was as blue as any sky i've ever seen and the outfield walls seemed so far away to a kid of my age somehow the sun seemed to shine brighter and the hot dogs tasted better there then anywhere else in the world i especially remember walking up from the tunnel and seeing the park for the first time and feeling that this had to be the most beautiful place on earth to this day although i don't consider myself to be the most sentimental person in the world i still get a little choked up coming out of that tunnel and seeing a place that holds so many fond memories for me Chicago Cubs Wrigley Field World Series Chicago White Sox Ty Cobb White Sox-Cubs rivalry Boston Red Sox Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Babe Ruth's Called Shot San Francisco Giants Philadelphia Phillies Time Out of Mind Lou Gehrig Major League Baseball television contracts St. Louis Cardinals Detroit Tigers Sammy Sosa October 4 in baseball 2004 World Series 1957 World Series New York Yankees Sandy Koufax Comiskey Park Andre Dawson 1918 World Series Curse of the Billy Goat October 14 in baseball October 5 in baseball Los Angeles Dodgers June 2 in baseball Grover Cleveland Alexander San Diego Padres October 1 in baseball October 23 in baseball Montr__al Expos Tony Kubek Pete Rose Softball Extraterrestrial skies No-hitter AFI 100 Years series October 9 in baseball Pittsburgh Pirates 1906 World Series October 27 in baseball September 20 in baseball Care Bears Mois__s Alou Perfect game Seattle Mariners October 20 in baseball Houston Astros Citizens Bank Park October 12 in baseball Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 1984 World Series Greg Maddux November 2 in baseball History of baseball in the United States Lou Boudreau Ted Williams New York Mets Yankee Stadium October 22 in baseball Vin Scully Atlanta Braves Dave Kingman October 10 in baseball Shaggy dog story Steve Bartman June 8 in baseball Empire Burlesque 2003 National League Championship Series Dallas Green October 13 in baseball Frankie Laine Robin Roberts (baseball player) Milt Pappas October 11 in baseball Hank Aaron Weather lore Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Moon The Contender (television series) October 3 in baseball Baseball statistics 2003 World Series Bill Buckner October 7 in baseball Toronto Blue Jays Busch Stadium Mercury Atlas 6 Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball) Randy Johnson Kitsch Bill Veeck
