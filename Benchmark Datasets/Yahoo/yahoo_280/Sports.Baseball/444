need some help with a baseball situation i have been offered a scholarship to go play college baseball i have played since i was i love baseball but i'm also trying to get a job i have been wanting for a while it's a great job i need some advice it really all depends on what you see for yourself ten years down the road if you do not take the scholarship you might always ask yourself what if and that would be a sad thing to live with the rest of your life none of us know how good a player you are your economic situation or what you see yourself doing in the future the only recommendation that i could make is not to make a decision you will regret in the future good luck Baseball Ty Cobb Major League Baseball Satchel Paige Graduate school Baseball Stars Pitaten Baseball Hall of Fame Reggie Jackson Alex Rodriguez Decision making Culture of the United States President (game) Ethics Education in Germany Minor league baseball Softball Mickey Mantle Willie Mays Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Topps Bobby Dodd Karma Georgia Institute of Technology Education in the People's Republic of China Baseball statistics Trinity College, Dublin Student loan Pittsburgh Steelers University of Central Florida Academia Sam Barry All-Star Baseball Mike Piazza University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Supply and demand Bernard Williams 1994 baseball strike Duties of the Heart Middle Tennessee State University Cheating in poker Todd Helton Babe Ruth Fay Vincent Happiness Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Politics of Canada Birdie Tebbetts Michael Jordan Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Game theory Scholarship Branch Rickey Luck Expert system John Forsythe Moses Fleetwood Walker Jackie Robinson Hal Trosky Yusuf al-Qaradawi American and British English differences Lou Gehrig PGA European Tour Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
