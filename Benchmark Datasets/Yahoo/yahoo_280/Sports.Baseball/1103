when did the all star game become a joke do people really care about it anymore who watches it i don't i did as a kid in the 's not anymore it's a joke especially since like or years ago when bud selig called the game to stop and ended in a tie in extra innings imagine how pissed off the bookies were on that one or the betters who got a push instead of a win i mean i guess there's some meaning behind it in that the winning league gets home field advantage in the world series but i feel that rule is beyond stupid it really doesn't showcase the best players it showcases the most popular players voted in by the fans and it is even more of a joke because a fan can vote for the same player times it's like american idol it's not a singing competition it's a popularity contest by the way do the players get paid for being in the all star game nobody cares except the players in it and the people dumb enough to bet on it my best guess as to when the all star game became a joke was around everyone's th birthday after that it is the teenage years and they know everything so surely they'd know it is a joke as far as how much the players get paid i am sure they don't get squat except for bonuses in individual contracts which of players this year had Major League Baseball Pete Rose Major League Baseball television contracts Baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Bud Selig World Series American Idol Oakland Athletics 2005 World Series Softball Satchel Paige Montr__al Expos National Football League Football (soccer) Hank Aaron Playoff International League Betting (poker) You Don't Know Jack Scrabble (game show) Boston Red Sox Milwaukee Brewers Chicago White Sox Philadelphia Phillies 1919 World Series 1994 baseball strike Blackjack Vin Scully Yao Ming Pittsburgh Pirates St. Louis Cardinals Table tennis Survivor (TV series) Ice hockey Reggie Jackson Salary cap Derek Jeter FA Cup Game show Fame Academy American football New York Yankees Poker jargon Barry Bonds Winning Streak Hollywood Squares National Hockey League Playoff format Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Topps Extra innings Shaggy dog story October 16 in baseball Contract bridge Fay Vincent Monkey Island Slot machine Texas Rangers (baseball) Craps Toronto Blue Jays Mois__s Alou Jack Buck Washington Nationals Red Sox Nation Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry The Ashes American Football League Takeshi's Castle Cleveland Indians 1957 World Series Password (game) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
