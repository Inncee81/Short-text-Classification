did you know that more pitchers have been busted under mlb's steroid's substance abuse policy than hitters also it is the same with the minor league policy i really think that hitters get all the attention for no reason people seem to overlook and brush this fact under the rug i find it very comical well it's a fact and many sports outlets talk about this fact there are tests to prove this fact however there are few tests to prove some hitters that are under suspicion like i said it's laughable it's fine though that people want to continue to be ignorant i am aware that hitters juice but people want to be ignorant to facts the fact is that pitchers cheat at a higher rate than hitters and you only hear about the big name guys for the most part if you aren't a big follower of baseball you wouldn't know that the pitcher who gave up bonds' th hr failed a test in the minor leagues and was suspended under the minor league drug policy according to the link below of the major leaguers suspended for steroids from present have been pitchers in the minors more than half of those suspended have been pitchers of makes you wonder why nobody is questioning guys like roger clemens randy johnson david wells etc Roger Clemens New York Yankees Barry Bonds Toronto Blue Jays Randy Johnson Boston Red Sox World Series Baseball Batting average History of baseball in the United States Chicago White Sox Minor league baseball Houston Astros Sammy Sosa No-hitter Babe Ruth Home run Bud Selig Designated hitter Pittsburgh Pirates St. Louis Cardinals Satchel Paige June 2004 in sports Mark McGwire Major League Baseball All-Star Game Pete Rose Negro league baseball Hank Aaron Sandy Koufax Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Ben Johnson (athlete) Major League Baseball television contracts November 1 in baseball New York Mets Pitcher David Wells 1919 World Series October 20 in baseball Oakland Athletics Detroit Tigers San Diego Padres Strikeout Jos__ Canseco Baltimore Orioles Strike zone Ty Cobb Starting pitcher International League Red Sox Nation Cincinnati Reds Lou Gehrig Salary cap Hideo Nomo American League Darryl Strawberry November 4 in baseball Mike Schmidt Baseball Stars Perfect game Pedro Mart__nez 2004 World Series Matt Lawton Mexican League Andr__s Galarraga Baseball statistics Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) September 20 in baseball Milwaukee Brewers Curt Schilling Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Reggie Jackson Bobby Abreu Jason Giambi 2003 World Series Volleyball November 3 in baseball Nolan Ryan Miguel Tejada Carlos Beltr__n July 2004 in sports October 27 in baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) Alex Rodriguez 1986 World Series October 22 in baseball Plame affair Wes Ferrell Los Angeles Dodgers October 16 in baseball Switch hitter October 2005 in sports October 19 in baseball David Ortiz
