would a relegation system create more interest in baseball soccer generally has a first division and second division every season the worst two teams are dropped from the first division and the best two are called up from the second division wouldn't this create a greater talent pool and more interest in baseball if the worst team in the nl and al were relegated to the minors every year and the best minor league teams became ml teams it would create a greater minor league fan base greater talent pool and force teams to remain competitive shouldn't mlb consider this i know the owners would hate it but it would be good for the game actually what you are suggesting might hurt the talent pool the way teams are set up the best players in each franchise are in the majors and the ones who are not as good or still need experience stay in the minors excluding specific circumstances in which the player must clear waivers to go to the minors this system ensures that a franchise's major leagures are among the best available if a player does well he's promoted if a player struggles he's demoted in your system an entire team is demoted that's not fair let's say that a bad team has a couple of good players on it don't those couple of players deserve to stay in the majors leave the league the way it is and players move based on their performance regardless of whether or not the rest of the team is playing well besides if teams were moved up and down it would always be the same teams year in and year out the royals and devil rays for instance have small budgets whereas the yankees and red sox can afford much better teams as a result the same teams the ones in need of the most assistance would be penalized most severely Minor league baseball Major League Baseball Boston Red Sox New York Yankees Texas Rangers (baseball) New York Mets Oakland Athletics Cleveland Indians International League Baltimore Orioles San Francisco Giants Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Salary cap Chicago White Sox Major League Baseball All-Star Game Baseball World Series Montr__al Expos Houston Astros Minnesota Twins Toronto Blue Jays Playoff Seattle Mariners San Diego Padres National Hockey League Sammy Sosa Tampa Bay Devil Rays Detroit Tigers Lou Gehrig Atlanta Braves Washington Nationals Milwaukee Brewers West Bromwich Albion F.C.
