why is it that the red sox despite being the best team in baseball by win percentage seem to get no respect it seems like everyone is saying they can't make it in the end though it seems like they've been doing a fairly good job with most of the teams they play yea i know what u mean its not that the redsox are not getting any respect its just that its not the yankees that r doing what the redsox are if it was the yankees in first place and doing what the redsox are doing now people wouldn't stop bragging and espn wont shut up about them if its not about the yankees they always find a way to make it about the yankees anyways yankees go on a game winning streak its all over espn networks if its the redsox winning or even straight games they don't even make it a big deal and now that the yankees r playing well and are games behind the redsox thats when espn wants to talk about how the redsox have been playing poorly why cant the sports world just focus on the positive instead of the negative sometimes the redsox have led their division for the entire season so far and no one has given them any credit for that but when they lose or in a row thats when the focus is on them besides have u seen the redsox s nd half of the season schedule compared to the yankees the yankees have been playing the under teams i never thought i d ever be complaining about the redsox not getting any credit becuz they are one of the most popular teams in baseball but well its true their not getting any credit go sox World Series Boston Red Sox Chicago White Sox 2005 World Series Major League Baseball television contracts 1957 World Series New York Yankees October 4 in baseball Luis Aparicio St. Louis Cardinals Red Sox Nation Babe Ruth Reggie Jackson Curse of the Bambino Seattle Mariners International League Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim October 2004 in sports 2004 World Series Home run Alex Rodriguez New York Mets Sandy Koufax Manny Ram__rez Chicago Cubs Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Baltimore Orioles Detroit Tigers Pete Rose Ty Cobb MLB on FOX Philadelphia Phillies Robin Ventura David Ortiz Cleveland Indians October 21 in baseball Dick Williams Satchel Paige Atlanta Braves Pedro Mart__nez Interleague play Curt Schilling Houston Astros Milwaukee Brewers October 5 in baseball Minnesota Twins November 3 in baseball San Francisco Giants Gary Sheffield 2004 American League Championship Series David Wells New York Giants Major League Baseball October 19 in baseball October 16 in baseball Tim McCarver Los Angeles Dodgers October 3 in baseball Rickey Henderson Troy Glaus 1986 World Series Roger Clemens Edgar Renter__a October 1 in baseball Cleveland Browns Tris Speaker Texas Rangers (baseball) October 17 in baseball October 27 in baseball September 2004 in sports Moe Berg October 7 in baseball September 2005 in sports San Diego Padres Lou Gehrig Damn Yankees Indianapolis Colts Joe Torre October 2005 in sports June 2 in baseball Hal Trosky Harry Agganis October 10 in baseball Bowl Championship Series October 15 in baseball Baseball Derek Jeter Tony La Russa Pennant playoff Ralph Houk Tom Seaver
