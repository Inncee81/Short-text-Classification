the bonds hatefest is really really tired now all i've seen is hate being spewed about the man and not one lick of congratulations people does it really burn you up that bad that barry has the hr record do you folks not have anything or anyone better to hate besides a pro athlete you don't even know would you even know or care who barry bonds was if not for the steroid scandal all you heard was 'steroids' and suddenly bonds is the anti christ if you are to villify baseball legends then do it all the way talk about how babe ruth was an alchoholic wife beater talk about how ty cobb was a proud racist you can go up and down the line and find dirt on a number of baseball heroes but all you hear is 'bonds cheated' and 'the record shouldn't count' blah blah blah people come on you make some valid points i do have a couple questions the first one would obviously be 'do you think bonds used steroids and why the second would be how do you know for sure do you know him i would also ask you the same questions about ruth and cobb i have read enough about them both to realize that you are probably right about both of them but if we take the 'innocent unless proven guilty argument that so many people have should we not say that ruth was never once convicted of battery and that cobb was never once found guilty of a hate crime while i certainly am not defending either one of them or their personalities having your integrity is part of being in the public eye would anyone have written about babe ruth being an alcoholic wife beater if he were a carpenter would anyone have cared that ty cobb was a racist if he had been a farmer would anyone care if bonds used steroids or hgh if he was a ups driver the answer would be no to all of these questions the only reason it eeven gets discussed is because they are or were very public figures i do agree with you however that it is time for people to move on whether or not they like bonds or not whether they think he juiced or not he now has hit more home runs then anyone in the history of the major leagues true hatred should be saved for things that really matter and not for something as insignificant and note i do love baseball as a game Babe Ruth Barry Bonds Ty Cobb Lou Gehrig Hank Aaron Home run History of baseball in the United States Mark McGwire World Series Tris Speaker Ted Williams St. Louis Cardinals New York Yankees Sports timeline Babe Ruth's Called Shot Theory of conduct Major League Baseball Plame affair Shoeless Joe Jackson 2005 trial of Michael Jackson San Francisco Giants All-Star Baseball Rogers Hornsby Ben Johnson (athlete) October 4 in baseball EastEnders Wrigley Field Rickey Henderson September 20 in baseball Knots Landing Major League Baseball titles streaks Polygamy Reggie Jackson Rafael Palmeiro Batting average October 5 in baseball Episodes of Lost (Season 1) O.
