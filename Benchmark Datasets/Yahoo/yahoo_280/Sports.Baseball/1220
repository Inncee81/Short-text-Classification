what exactly do you think got ryne sandberg into the hall of fame we all have heard of the exploits of ryne sandberg during his plus year career but what got him into the hof the main argument about it is that he never was on a world series winning team but there have been dozens od players that have gotten in without ever going to a ws was it his defensive accomplishments straight games without an error of any kind or his awards gold gloves at nd base and straight all star appearences or do you think that the writers had a heart and just let him in for no good reason or was it a combination of things that brought ryno into the hof several factors the ones you mentioned ofr sure his defense was outstanding he has an annual all star and a very good hitter what really got him in though are two factors first it is playing second base historically second basemen are weak offensively save a few exceptions morgan hornsby lopes etc there haven't been that many great power and average hitters at that position ryno was one while he was never a homer guy like davey johnson he did have very good pop and he annually hit secondly it was ryno's performance during the era he played ryno played in the s when offensive numbers were a shadow of where they are today ryno was the best at his position for the majority of his career there really aren't any secondbasemen from the s that can come close to putting up the numbers he did tim raines would have but he moved to of ryno like ripken was ahead of his time he altered the template of the middle infielder from small statured slick fielders with speed but no bat into larger five tool players that could genuinely slug while his numbers as a b may look more pedestrian compared to some of today's studs when ryno played he was one of a kind that factor is crucial for hof voters and why guys like biggio and santo will have trouble getting in best in the game when you played is one of the most siginficant factors voters weigh Baseball Robin Ventura Chicago Cubs Baseball statistics Batting average Hank Aaron 1957 World Series Davey Lopes 2004 World Series Volleyball Pete Rose Seattle Mariners Baltimore Orioles Roberto Alomar Tris Speaker October 4 in baseball Boston Red Sox Babe Ruth Lou Gehrig Jim Rice Andr__s Galarraga 2005 World Series Cal Ripken, Jr. Softball Craig Biggio Toronto Blue Jays St. Louis Cardinals Dave Concepci__n Third baseman Joe Morgan Second baseman Baseball scorekeeping San Diego Padres Alex Rodriguez Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 San Francisco Giants Pittsburgh Pirates Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Home run New York Yankees Oakland Athletics International League Manny Ram__rez Satchel Paige October 16 in baseball Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 Alan Trammell Willie Mays Troy Glaus Ted Williams World Series New York Mets Cincinnati Reds November 1 in baseball Poker jargon 1919 World Series Ichiro Suzuki Bill Mazeroski Rogers Hornsby Fast bowling Jeff Bagwell Chicago White Sox Bobby Grich Barry Bonds Fielding (cricket) Jackie Robinson Vin Scully Los Angeles Dodgers Gary Sheffield October 31 in baseball Rickey Henderson Reggie Jackson Omar Vizquel Cincinnati Bengals David Ortiz Davey Johnson Interference (baseball) Box score (baseball) Miguel Tejada Steve Nash Jay Bell History of baseball in the United States Lance Berkman Baseball Stars Todd Helton Bob Johnson (baseball) Pittsburgh Steelers Sammy Sosa Mike Schmidt Sabermetrics National Football League
