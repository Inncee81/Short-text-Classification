so who is with me ok so barry bonds broke the record big deal how many of you are with me and by the way i am a red sox fan saying this in wishing alex rodriguez the best of luck for the next ten years i may be a bosox fan and on a personal level despise a rod but there is no denying his ability to hit the baseball and hit it hard how many hrs do you think he can finish with if he stays healthy god forbid actually may not be so far fetched he's got already in what years if he stays heatlhy he can play more either way join me in ignoring bonds' record i know i still consider hammerin' hank to be the king of kings cripes people do a little research here a rod was when he first played in a major league game he has hit all but of his home runs since the age of so essentially he has hit of his home runs over the last seasons not there are a lot of assumptions to be made for him to even make a serious run at home runs for one we have to assume that he maintains a pace of homers a season for the next years keeping in mind that he has only homers times over the last season we also have to assume that he misses little to no time due to injury he has been lucky in the sense he has only had one season where he has played in fewer than games since he established himself as an every day player most players tend to start slowing down once they reach their mid to late s he has a legit shot at catching bonds but homers seems a bit of a reach to me Alex Rodriguez Babe Ruth Hank Aaron Seattle Mariners Chicago White Sox Ty Cobb New York Yankees Oakland Athletics Boston Red Sox San Francisco Giants Troy Glaus Andr__s Galarraga Baseball Ken Griffey, Jr. St. Louis Cardinals World Series Rickey Henderson Sammy Sosa 2004 World Series Reggie Jackson Top 500 home run hitters of all time Major League Baseball Gary Sheffield David Ortiz Detroit Tigers Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Toronto Blue Jays Willie Mays Pedro Mart__nez September 20 in baseball Robin Ventura Manny Ram__rez 1957 World Series Pete Rose Tris Speaker Hank Greenberg September 6 in baseball Cincinnati Reds Nomar Garciaparra International League October 4 in baseball 2005 World Series Pittsburgh Steelers 2004 American League Championship Series October 3 in baseball Minor league baseball Mark McGwire Baseball statistics Nolan Ryan History of baseball in the United States New York Mets Dave Kingman Stolen base October 7 in baseball October 22 in baseball Miguel Tejada Jimmie Foxx Hal Trosky October 5 in baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Interference (baseball) Jim Rice Chicago Cubs Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry October 20 in baseball Atlanta Braves New York Giants Detroit Red Wings Texas Rangers (baseball) Scott Podsednik Jeff Kent October 1 in baseball CPU cache Ted Radcliffe Cincinnati Bengals Cecil Fielder June 12 in baseball June 8 in baseball Mario Lemieux Ted Williams Dave Henderson September 28 in baseball Lou Gehrig Toronto Raptors Roger Maris 1994 baseball strike Carlton Fisk New York Knicks Philadelphia Phillies Ted Kluszewski Chicago Bulls Cleveland Indians Baseball Stars 1919 World Series
