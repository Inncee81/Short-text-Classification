why are baseball teams allowed to trade cash for players i was just curious how this is possible what is to stop a team owner from pocketing millions of dollars personally in exchange for running a major pro sports team into the ground when a player is traded for cash are there rules for if that money has to be reinvested into the team or can it be used for non team purposes by the owner there are no rules about what can be done with the money within the team if the team isn't solely owned by one person and i don't think any are they would not be able to just take the money out of the team however that's business law not mlb rules the commissioner must approve any trade where the money exchanged is over a certain amount i don't recall what the number is but i think it's around m that rule is in effect so that owners won't do exactly what you suggest i e gut the teams for their own personal enrichment the most notable use of the rule was in when then commissioner bowie kuhn stopped a's owner charlie finley from selling several of his players joe rudi vida blue and rollie fingers Oakland Athletics November 1 in baseball World Series Bowie Kuhn Boston Red Sox New York Yankees Salary cap Minor league baseball Dick Williams National Football League Washington Nationals Major League Baseball San Francisco Giants Detroit Tigers October 20 in baseball Los Angeles Clippers Baseball Toronto Blue Jays Poker jargon Satchel Paige Chicago White Sox American Football League St. Louis Rams Milwaukee Brewers Capital accumulation Montr__al Expos Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Dividend San Diego Padres Los Angeles Dodgers November 3 in baseball Major League Baseball television contracts 1994 baseball strike Cleveland Indians Babe Ruth Rollie Fingers History of baseball in the United States The Amazing Race 1919 World Series Baseball Stars New York Mets George Steinbrenner Baltimore Orioles Baseball Hall of Fame MLB on NBC 2004-05 NHL lockout Rickey Henderson University of Notre Dame Texas Rangers (baseball) Softball Paintball Atlanta Braves Hank Aaron The Joker's Wild Houston Astros Dolphins Stadium Monopoly (game) Japanese baseball Kansas City Royals Florida Marlins New York Giants Warren Buffett Los Angeles Kings Reserve clause Tris Speaker October 26 in baseball Major League Baseball All-Star Game Negro league baseball Baseball statistics Ty Cobb New England Patriots Pittsburgh Pirates Ice hockey October 18 in baseball $ale of the Century Sammy Sosa Tax Football (soccer) Surplus value Buffalo Bills Insurance Slot machine October 22 in baseball Bud Selig Chicago Cubs Willie Mays Barry Bonds Oakland Raiders United States dollar Deion Sanders September 28 in baseball Grandfather clause Chelsea F.C.
