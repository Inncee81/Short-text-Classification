who gets the most blame for the steroid fiasco that has overshadowed the great game of baseball this past decade who deserves the biggest slice of blame pie the players and trainers for doing it as long as they could get away with it major league baseball for being asleep or awake and blind at the controls until the poo hit the fan the fans and media for perpetuating the controversy what do you say i think the owners should get a lot of blame for turning their backs on the issue and filling their pockets with money which in turn leads to selig because he was the owner of the brewers so he had to have known about it i don't blame the trainers as much as i blame the player's association and union because they are the most powerful union in sports and could have taken preventative measures to stop all of this but didn't i think mlb has taken such a reactionary response that it's too late to do anything about the people who have already used they're trying to fix a past that has been tainted and not concentrating on the future stopping of drug use as a result the technology in labs like balco are always going to be one step ahead of testing because they're going to be working the next undetectable drug like the cream and the clear everything has snowballed and mlb has been slow in their approach to this epidemic the only solution which the player's union would never go for is to do blood testing the media covered it up also back the in the steroid heydays of the early to mid 's now they're reporting it like it's such a shock the wool was pulled over the eyes of the fans and now we're skeptical of any performance by a baseball player that is considered all star worthy because we don't know if it's been artificially enhanced or not Barry Bonds History of baseball in the United States Bud Selig Major League Baseball All-Star Game Salary cap Baseball World Series Negro league baseball Jason Giambi 1994 baseball strike Chicago White Sox Montr__al Expos Major League Baseball television contracts Washington Nationals Detroit Tigers Minor league baseball Los Angeles Dodgers Baseball Hall of Fame New York Yankees Cleveland Indians Baltimore Orioles San Francisco Giants New York Mets 2004-05 NHL lockout Los Angeles Clippers Andr__s Galarraga Milwaukee Brewers Babe Ruth Major League Baseball Players Association Houston Astros Atlanta Braves Toronto Blue Jays MLB on FOX St. Louis Cardinals Oakland Athletics Jos__ Canseco Cincinnati Reds Reggie Jackson Norway national football team National Football League Texas Rangers (baseball) Gary Sheffield Batting average The Jim Rome Show San Diego Padres Rafael Palmeiro International League Indianapolis 500 Olympic Games Psoriasis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Limp Bizkit Topps Ty Cobb Chicago Cubs 1919 World Series First-person shooter Poker jargon Doping (sport) Satchel Paige Japanese baseball MLB on NBC Mark McGwire Peter Gabriel Sandy Koufax New anti-Semitism Tris Speaker Wayne Gretzky Sports betting Tour de France Newcastle United F.C.
