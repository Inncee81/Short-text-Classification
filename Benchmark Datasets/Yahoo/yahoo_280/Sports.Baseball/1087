how long do you think bonds will keep his record hank arron kept his for years personally i don't recognize any roider's records a rod who is probably clean of the taint of steroids barring injury will pass bonds in to years possibly as early as but unlikely unless a rod starts taking steroids a rod has one maybe hr seasons left in him griffy if he got healthy and got full seasons in could pass or be in striking distance of bond's mark pujos is on pace to shatter the mark but is at least a decade away a young b just came up who is hitting hrs at the same pace as pujus but likely to surpass pujos his name is ryan braun and in years he will if healthy almost certainly pass bond's mark pretty much anybody else playing today would either need to play into their mid to late s or to take the steroid route like bonds did to catch the current mark though aaron wasn't really a power hitter so a guy like bernie williams but one that can play until he's ish might just be the one who winds up setting the new mark much like aaron did by playing into his mid s the real power hitters of aaron's day were guys like mccovey and schmidt Hank Aaron Home run Sandy Koufax 1957 World Series Nolan Ryan Alex Rodriguez Gary Sheffield Jim Rice Babe Ruth Robin Ventura World Series History of baseball in the United States San Francisco Giants Roger Clemens St. Louis Cardinals Cleveland Browns Rod Stewart Major League Baseball New York Mets Baseball Volleyball Randy Johnson Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Top 500 home run hitters of all time Pittsburgh Steelers Toronto Blue Jays Ken Griffey, Jr. Ravi Shastri Reggie Jackson Andr__s Galarraga Ty Cobb Leeds United F.C.
