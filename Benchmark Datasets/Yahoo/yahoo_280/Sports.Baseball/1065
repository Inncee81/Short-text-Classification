chipper jones is definitely a lock for the hall of fame don't you agree in seasons so far and at age he has hit hr's hits doubles rbi's and ba plus he's a switch hitter and it always looks good playing your entire career for one team i don't care what people say to disagree with that the writers like that the only knock against him is he has played in the steroid era and thus that might stigmatize him did chipper juice who knows yes i am intrigued by hof questions and i think i can make some good arguments for players who aren't in who should be in i e rice gossage blyleven mattingly etc hey we finally agree i think besides the numbers it again comes down to the fact he was one of the best third baseman in the game for a long period of time and that he played on a consistent winner now let me clarify i think chipper should be a hofer assuming he has another solid year or two but don't know if he is quite a lock yet voters are hard on third baseman and it is too soon to know what type of power numbers players from this era will need for example i no longer think is a magic number and am not convinced jim thome will be a hofer the switch hitter thing is an interesting point and i agree with you that playing your entire career with one team can only help except jim rice i think chipper will be the b from this era to go matt williams didn't do enough and scott rolen of my cardinals great defensive player is already slowing down at age Jim Rice Don Mattingly Chipper Jones St. Louis Cardinals Robin Ventura 1957 World Series Andr__s Galarraga Ty Cobb Pete Rose Hank Aaron Boston Red Sox Detroit Tigers November 4 in baseball Lou Gehrig Reggie Jackson Batting average World Series Sandy Koufax November 3 in baseball Switch hitter Alex Rodriguez Houston Astros Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 San Diego Padres Chicago White Sox Tris Speaker Satchel Paige Baseball statistics Third baseman Nolan Ryan Lance Berkman September 20 in baseball 1919 World Series Toronto Blue Jays Troy Glaus International League October 4 in baseball David Ortiz Cincinnati Bengals Jim Thome October 21 in baseball Designated hitter Edgar Renter__a Roberto Alomar Edgar Martinez Volleyball Mike Schmidt History of baseball in the United States Craig Biggio 1981 baseball strike George Brett (baseball) Manny Ram__rez Al Oliver New York Yankees Seattle Mariners Barry Bonds 1981 World Series Frankie Frisch Major League Baseball Carl Yastrzemski Baseball scorekeeping Ron Gant Cincinnati Reds First baseman November 1 in baseball Jason Giambi Shoeless Joe Jackson Willie Mays October 20 in baseball San Francisco 49ers Ozzie Smith San Francisco Giants Sammy Sosa Pittsburgh Pirates Cap Anson Chicago Cubs Luke Appling Bob Johnson (baseball) Albert Pujols Hal Trosky Oakland Athletics Dave Kingman New York Mets Theory of conduct Los Angeles Dodgers National Football League Mike Piazza October 16 in baseball Rickey Henderson Tennis Rogers Hornsby Eddie Murray Baltimore Orioles
