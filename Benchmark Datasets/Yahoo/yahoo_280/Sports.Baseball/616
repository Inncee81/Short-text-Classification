why aren't steroids good for the game anymore i remember when people were happy like back in then comes along and people get angry even though i could smell the fish in why didn't anybody else and i'm not saying roger maris did anything wrong because he didn't but people always say look at averages well maris never hit that many homers on average before he hit bonds has been pretty consistent in homerun production i don't understand why people use that as a case against bonds when he had one big jump in hrs just like maris sammy hit over three times mcgwire did it twice barry only once like maris i think barry did something but it doesn't matter to me because baseball purists know all records in baseball are tainted to a certain extent if you dig deep enough there is dirt on all of these records i think you are being a little over defensive of bonds however people didn't care that there were steroids being used in the 's because they didn't know if they knew i'm sure some type of anger would have come out Home run Mark McGwire Barry Bonds St. Louis Cardinals Andr__s Galarraga Roger Maris History of baseball in the United States Jos__ Canseco New York Yankees ESPN25 Troy Glaus Satchel Paige Jason Giambi Babe Ruth Baseball Dave Kingman Major League Baseball Rafael Palmeiro EastEnders Major League Baseball television contracts Ted Williams Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind World Series Oakland Athletics Homer Simpson Wes Ferrell Pedro Mart__nez San Francisco Giants Rickey Henderson 1957 World Series Hank Aaron Jim Rice September 6 in baseball Dave Henderson Alex Rodriguez Kodocha Baseball statistics Cliff Richard Tris Speaker Hal Trosky Ty Cobb Willie Mays Gary Sheffield Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story Top 500 home run hitters of all time Baltimore Orioles Boston Red Sox October 22 in baseball Dave Concepci__n Batting average The Amber Spyglass October 4 in baseball Up the Down Steroid October 3 in baseball "Weird Al" Yankovic October 2005 in sports James Bond AFI 100 Years series Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist September 20 in baseball The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Piccolo Junior Saga Yogiisms Miguel Tejada Torii Hunter Brady Anderson Philosophical skepticism Rich Mullins Robin Ventura Stan Musial Bob Horner October 7 in baseball Wrigley Field Joe Adcock The Man with the Golden Gun Cincinnati Reds July 2004 in sports Bubble Bobble Baseball Stars Toronto Blue Jays Albert Pujols Pittsburgh Pirates Jeff Kent Jimmie Foxx Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Characters in the Smurfs Ron Gant Baseball scorekeeping Roger Clemens The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Mois__s Alou Bart Simpson Baseball (object) Ben Johnson (athlete) 1919 World Series
