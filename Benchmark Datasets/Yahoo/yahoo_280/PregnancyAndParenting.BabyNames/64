what are some universal names for a baby girl with an indian dad and japanese mom i'm asking for my friend who is months pregnant they want something universal so that the baby won't get made fun of preferably something that can fit into both cultures and still be american my friend and i like sophia but the father's not too fond strictly an opinion and if it helps i am a huge fan of ethnic names indian names are more foreign sounding to americans than most japanese names i'm not sure why maybe it's because we're more familiar with japanese names saying we're more familiar with japanese culture would be a stretch pop culture perhaps they're also typically easier to pronounce were it me i'd give the girl a japanese first name and an indian middle name she'll have heritage from both parents and americans are pretty forgiving with east asian names Japanese name Kodocha Joke Asian Languages of Hong Kong Asian American Magical DoReMi Kurt Cobain Gwen Stefani Doug Given name Spice Girls My Name Is Earl Kyle Broflovski FLCL Kimi Finster Angelina Jolie Britney Spears Indian English Bro'Town Family name Azumanga Daioh EastEnders Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin Lorelai Gilmore Japanese language The Adventures of Pete & Pete T.A.T.u.
