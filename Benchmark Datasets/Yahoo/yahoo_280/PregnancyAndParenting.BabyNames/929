name help i want to honor my grandmother mom julie anne peggie ann my best friend kayla ashley if my baby's a girl what are some name suggestions keep in mind my name is also kayla me my best friend share the same first name have you ever considered the meanings of these names peggie peggy peg greek means pearl julie latin means down bearded youth whatever that means anne hebrew means grace kayla hebrew means who is like god i would suggest not using the name ashley though as it is an extremely common name and doesn't sound anywhere near as nice as kayla although it is not up to me but merely a suggestion instead of using the very same names my suggestion is to come up with a new name with the same meaning or same sounds for example kayla is a shorter name that is another form of michaela mikayla what you can also do is look up the meanings of some of these names from other origins another name with the meaning pearl is margriet mahr greet which is basically another form of margaret these two new names all came from peggie i like the way michaela margriet flow together although the last name will greatly decide whether this name will work however i hope these suggestions will help you come up with a great name that will honor your mother grandmother and friend as well as be a nice name for your daughter Days of our Lives Neighbours Friends Married... with Children Hebrew name Love Little Britain Barney & Friends Anne Boleyn Juliana of the Netherlands Charmed EastEnders Princess Margriet of the Netherlands Jewish languages Sami Brady Effeminacy Rocko's Modern Life Pearl Jam Meter (poetry) Infant baptism Maureen O'Sullivan W.I.T.C.H.
