do you like the name maro for a boy we recently had a baby boy and we were looking for a unique name we were travelling overseas in europe and on one of the beaches we met a handsome surfer named maro and the name seemed very exotic to us and we now named our little boy the same name however we are getting a lot of negative opinions about it and its hurt my feelings so you think it was unfair of us to name our little boy such an unusual name we recently had a baby boy and we were looking for a unique name we were travelling overseas in europe and on one of the beaches we met a handsome surfer named maro and the name seemed very exotic to us and we now named our little boy the same name however we are getting a lot of negative opinions about it and its hurt my feelings so you think it was unfair of us to name our little boy such an unusual name maybe this will help its not pronounce marrow but mauro its not prounounced marrow but its prounoounce mauro maro is actually of japanese origin and means myself i think it is unique yet not absurd he is your child and you were entitled to name him as you saw fit while taking into consideration that he would be his own person one day if you are unhappy with your choice of names then call your son by his middle name if he has one but don't pay attention to the negativity from others Fra Mauro map Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Beach Boys Kodocha Japanese name Given name Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Friends The Beach Boys in Concert Family name Hiberno-English Abortion debate Social rule Maison Ikkoku Sampling (music) Doug Anime Kitesurfing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Crazy in Love Generation Y Shut Down Volume 2 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jon Secada Pitaten Hikikomori Evil Plurality electoral system Surfer Girl Florida Keys Brian Wilson Fathers' rights Singapore gay history Sydney Riot of 1879 Fantastic Four Sun Yat-sen Graduate school Max Martin MapleStory Yoko Ono Harem anime Garfield Best of The Beach Boys Pea Nationalism Singlish Surf's Up Empire Burlesque Conscription Indian nationality law The Beatles discography R.E.M.
