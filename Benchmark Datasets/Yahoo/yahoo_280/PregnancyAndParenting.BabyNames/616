where has the sudden desire to call girls amelia and grace come from my brother and his wife are expecting their first child in october and were wanting to call her amelia grace if it was a girl they don't know what they are expecting since that first descision mel has gone off the idea as so many people she knows and hears about are calling their girls amelia or grace my boyfriend's cousin just had a baby girl and called her amelia grace a quick look on here confirms that both names are on most people's lists are these names in any tv programes or have there been any celebs having children that they have named either of these i am not aware of any but then i don't really keep up with the celeb world or watch much tv there are the staples of the baby name world that have been popular for a while but i'm surprised to see such an explosion of two particular names which i would think would be considered more old fashioned agreed cindy that made up names are usually awful it is totally inconsiderateof parents to call their children stupid names that they will get teased for later in life i lose count of the amount of people who say to me how lovely my name is jessica but i find it rather ormal and prefer it shortened to jess can't please everyone i do also like amelia and grace particularly together i think the trend at the moment is classical names making a comeback and also people are using made up names which is worse i like classic names and 'old fashioned' ones theres a reason why they keep coming back they're nice and everyone knows them kids don't get picked on and i can't imagine how parents don't get sick of saying sunbird raindance get here now names like markasince yes someone on here thought that they'd madeup the best name ever are never nice my children are eliza jasmine and isaac matthew cute sweet normal not common among children their age and not something that rhymes with something or that they can be teased because of well in my opinion anyway EastEnders One Life to Live Passions Shaggy dog story Friends About a Boy Humphrey Bogart Spice Girls Autism rights movement Justification (theology) Neighbours Sugo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kyle Broflovski Joke Theory of conduct Kodocha Sharon Tate Hip hop collaborations Given name Characters of Lost Infantilism Earth Girl Arjuna Transactional analysis Little Britain Codename: Kids Next Door Laura Schlessinger Miss Saigon History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Characters in the Smurfs Care Bears The Amber Spyglass Milton H.
