do you think it's just a trend that parents that are misspelling their children's names like changing emily to emulea or emmaleigh or jessica to jezzikah for example i understand everyone wants to be different but i think it's just a phase people are going through right now i know some names are the same if you give or take a letter like sara sarah but why misspell the name out of context just wondering i think when people change spellings in simple ways like say putting a y where an i usually would be is fine it makes the name stand out some i think people take that too far a lot of times though and change the spelling so radically that you can no longer tell what the name is actually supposed to be it kind of makes you look dumb when you do that Spelling reform Hangul Family name Given name Serbo-Croatian language Sarah Jessica Parker English spelling Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bene Gesserit Arabic name A Saintly Switch Mispronunciation Writing system of Spanish Meaning Leet Sigmund Freud Fancy Crane Michelangelo (TMNT) Saint Sarah English plural Emily Dickinson Literacy Faster-than-light Spell checker Karen Horney Grimke Sisters Social rule Hocus Pocus (film) The Jazz Singer Chinese character Magic (paranormal) Roxette Greek language Microeconomics Time Out of Mind History of British nationality law Franz Boas 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Crossword Sunset Beach (soap opera) Names of God in Judaism Scientific revolution The nature of God in Western theology Social psychology Trademark Annuity Writing system Fiddler on the Roof Chinglish Sarah Michelle Gellar Jessica Alba Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Theory of conduct Wicked (musical) Final Fantasy New Zealand at the 2004 Summer Olympics Paul Is Dead Chuck Palahniuk Social progress German spelling reform of 1996 W.
