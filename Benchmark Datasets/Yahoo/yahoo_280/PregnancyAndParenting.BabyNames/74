how common is this is it common to have more than one middle name i only have one but i never noticed some people had a third and even fourth name until i started looking at names for my upcoming daughter i think it's really neat and it sure does take the pressure off me considering how indecisive i am about her middle name thanks in advance most catholic people have two middle names the first middle name is given to them when they are born and the second when they are confirmed and given a godparent the second middle name is their godmother father's first name for instance my father's name is joseph francis richard Family name Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu Malcolm in the Middle House of Bourbon Middle name Denzel Q.
