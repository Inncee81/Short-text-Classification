i need a pretty baby name out of bible i would like to have one that is not used so offen no matter what the middle name will be mae both of my granma's names reading your question the first thing that came to mind was that you could combine mae and eve to get the name maeve it is beautiful and uncommon eve mary ruth sarah rebecca hannah and delilah are some biblical names that i can immediately think of how about gabrielle a feminine version of gabriel eve does not go well with your middle name but again you could consider combining eve and mae if you like the name maeve mary mae does not sound good together ruth mae does not sound good together sarah mae does not sound bad but sarah is quite common rebecca is not as common and rebecca mae flows quite well together hannah mae sounds good as well but hannah is also quite common and you said you want one that is not used often delilah is definitely not used that often and it sounds okay with mae i hope you find the perfect name and i think it is so sweet for your daughter to be named after both of her great grandmothers Given name Tina Turner Adam and Eve Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mae West AFI 100 Years series Ryan's Hope Bible Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism EastEnders The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Original sin Everwood Prisoner (TV series) Academy Award for Original Music Score God and gender Tenchi Muyo!
