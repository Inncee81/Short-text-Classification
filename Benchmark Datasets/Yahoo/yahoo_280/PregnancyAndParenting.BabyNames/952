why can't we just agree ok my husband says that if we have a boy he wants him named seth micheal which i can't stand that name but if we have a boy that's what i will name him because i want my husband happy and we agreed to the name picking him if its a boy and me if its a girl ok so now the real problem i want the name riley mckayle for a girl and he said absolutely not so i said what about alexandera nichole and again he said no why is it he gets to pick the name for a boy and i have to go along with it but every name i pick for a girl he wont let me name her that how do i get him to agree with me i just don't think it fair i mean he knows i can't stand that name for a boy but yet i told him that's what he wants we are naming our boy that but he won't say that with my names for girls this is my first and i just want some part in naming it sorry i'm just doing a little venting i believe you have to both like the name you choose you are going to be calling the child by that name for a long time when you are signing that birth certificate you want to be sure that you are picking a name that is not going to make you cringe tell him that the deal is off and start fresh each of you should make a list of names you like for a boy and names for a girl start with the first name hopefully there will be one name that is on both of your lists if there isn't a common name on each of your lists then do it the lng way and go through a baby name book together another good sit is the social security website with the top names for each year good luck Friends The Inside Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Birthday The O.C.
