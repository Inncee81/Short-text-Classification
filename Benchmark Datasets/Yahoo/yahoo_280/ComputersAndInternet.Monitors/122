i am trying to convince my boss to switch our crt monitors to lcd because it will save energy and from what i hear they aren't great for your eyes when they get old and the colors start to distort anyways i would like some information on why lcds are better than crt monitors i know that they save energy but what are some other key points that i can use to convince my boss that they are better for our company we have about computers in our company right now thanks for the help there are lots of considerations here first of all what is the age of the existing crt monitors if they are relatively new it might not makes sense to replace them right away if you were going to make a purchase decision today clearly the lcd monitor would be the right choice the total cost of ownership toco for an lcd is much less both purchase price and utility cost over an assumed life cycle are less overall the power required to run an lcd is about one third of that required for a crt with the same screen area in addition the amount of heat generated by an lcd monitor is considerably less than a crt monitor resulting in a lower load on air conditioning building cooling needs could be decreased by up to without taking into account the building cooling needs the energy cost of a typical lcd monitor over years of usage of hours per week will be about less a typical lcd is rated at w while a crt consumes w this of course depends on specific monitor specs and utility rates etc but it means assuming a life cycle of years you can deduct at least off the purchase price the increased utility costs for cooling depending on your situation could make the cost differential over years become in all likelylihood regardless of your specifics more than of the purchase price of a new lcd monitor will be recouped by the energy savings you should also remember that a lcd is larger than a crt actual viewable area is vs for the crt savings can be realized through gains in productivity with larger monitors some research suggests that an employee may reclaim more than hours per month working on a larger screen versus a monitor but even a savings of hour per month in labor cost yield savings of per year of course the time saved has to either result in fewer hours worked fewer people working or the same people dedicated to other productive activity in order to actually reap those savings for either a large or small business a monitor can easily pay for itself in productivity alone furthermore the perfect focus and geometry straight lines are never warped and the completely flicker free screen of an lcd are easy on the eyes this means that lcds can be used comfortably for typically longer periods of time than crts lcds like crts have a refresh rate only they have a longer residual phospor effect in other words at a hz refresh rate the lcd is flicker free better quality crts can also be easier on the eyes if they are driven at faster refresh rates hz and up all depends on the video card and monitor capability replacing computer monitors all at once might not make sense in terms of cash flow that would require if they were each you may want to begin a targeted phase out of some of the oldest least efficient ones while considering which employees would benefit the most in terms of productivity also disposal cost if any may be a negative cost to consider in terms of getting rid of the old crt monitors good luck Digital photography Cathode ray tube Welding Laptop Supply and demand Inflation Progressive tax Gamut Windows XP Monetary policy Capitalism Television Tax Apple II family CPU cache Transformer Deflation (economics) Solar power Oscilloscope FairTax Gross domestic product Spacecraft propulsion Wind power RISC CPU design Energy development Labour economics Gas metal arc welding Refresh rate Alcohol fuel Principal-agent problem Stereoscopy Liquid crystal display television Light-emitting diode Nuclear power TFT LCD Unemployment Plasma display IBM PC compatible Hydrogen economy Explosive material Biodiesel Credit card Taxation in the United States E85 PowerBook Pebble bed reactor Commodore 64 Sewage treatment Free trade Central processing unit Natural monopoly Future energy development Redundant array of independent disks Productive and unproductive labour Insurance Capital accumulation Economics Economic growth Mortgage Efficiency wages Labor theory of value Computer display Ocean thermal energy conversion Price discrimination Life insurance Surplus value Blackjack Hyperinflation Solar cell Modem Keynesian economics Wal-Mart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Russia High-definition television Jet engine Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting NTSC Fluorescent lamp Corporate finance Fusion power Apple Macintosh Compiler optimization Overclocking Management information system Manitoba Hydro Outsourcing Color Externality Economic inequality Annuity
