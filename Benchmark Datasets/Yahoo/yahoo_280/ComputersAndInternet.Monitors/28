does an lcd or plasma computer monitor generate less heat than a crt monitor i have a crt monitor and it it seems to generate an insane amount of heat i can feel a lot of heat radiating when i hold my hand over the rear end of it the pc tower puts out less heat than the monitor does i have also tested this by keeping a thermometer in the room for every one hour the monitor runs the room temp goes up one degree fahrenheit if the room is degrees when i turn it on in the morning by the end of the day the room is about note using stand by mode and energy star settings apparently make no difference in the heat output will an lcd put out a lot less heat than a crt monitor it pretty much goes like this projector crt plasma lcd oled in development its gonna be sweet google search it lcd is not as quick as a crt in some you can see mouse blur at times but this is becoming rarer also when you arent using the lcd in its natural resolution you should be told this when you buy the image will always tend to be blurry eg when using an lcd with a natural resolution of x and then playing a video game in x the game will look blurrier rather than pixelated same if you played the game in a higher resolution than natural however those points are moot when you consider the lcd is so much more compact and requires less electricity and generates condsiderably less heat plasma is out of the question for a pc monitor its application is in large tvs because its pixels are actually made of small fluroescent phosphor bulbs which are times bigger than an lcd or crt pixel and thus easilly seen by the naked eye not to mention the phoshor decay really cuts into the displays lifespan Pixel Plasma display Temperature Light-emitting diode Computer display Television Laptop Digital Visual Interface Oscilloscope Digital photography Stereoscopy Light gun Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Atari 8-bit family Color Graphics Adapter TFT LCD Interlace Organic light-emitting diode Plasma (physics) Amstrad CPC Fluorescent lamp Mouse (computing) Digital projector Original Amiga chipset Loudspeaker Solar power High-definition television Movie projector Transformer PlayStation Portable Lighting DLP Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Welding Computer display standard Incandescent light bulb Spacecraft propulsion In The Groove (game) RGB color model Konica Minolta Game Boy Advance Laser Apple II family PLATO Sun Nintendo GameCube Glass TurboGrafx 16 Refresh rate Fusion power Handheld game console Nuclear reactor Carbon nanotube Nintendo Entertainment System LCD projector Nuclear power 1080p Aliasing History of computer and video games Nintendo DS Overclocking Personal computer Digital camera Commodore 64 Display resolution Digital cinematography Dialysis Tier One Renewable energy Galileo spacecraft Persistence of vision Video Rendering (computer graphics) Wearable computer Computer Super Nintendo Entertainment System Apple IIGS Eye Windows XP Typeface Console game Magnet Computed tomography Anti-aliasing PlayStation 3
