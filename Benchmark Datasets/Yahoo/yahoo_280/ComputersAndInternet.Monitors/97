like tft monitor screen auto adjustment is there any tool available to adjust crt monitor screen display i have not yet seen a crt that auto adjusts like an lcd display crts usually have a lot of extra controls including things like pincushion and trapezoid adjustments i think the reason is there is a lot more variability in how a given signal will display on different crts that's also why there are a lot more adjustments for a crt display some crt monitors come with software from the manufacturer that will make the screen adjustments through a utility i don't think this is very common depending on the video card and drivers you may be able to make some of the adjustments from display properties you may prefer to just make the adjustments from the buttons on the monitor good question Computer display Liquid crystal display Oscilloscope Cathode ray tube IMac Pixel Television Windows XP Gamut PowerBook Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Liquid crystal display television Apple II family Screensaver Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Interlace Atari 8-bit family PlayStation Portable Sega Saturn Nintendo GameCube Commodore 64 Gamma correction Atari ST Refresh rate Digital Visual Interface Color Graphics Adapter Sega Dreamcast Stereoscopy Light-emitting diode Nintendo DS Screenshot Arcade cabinet Embedded system Apple typography Laptop Color Laserdisc AmigaOS TurboGrafx 16 Organic light-emitting diode IPod Transformer Computer terminal Cheating in Counter-Strike Konica Minolta Aperture grille Tungsten Handheld Computer and video games Bluetooth History of computer and video games Game Boy Waveform monitor Windows 2000 EMac Vectrex Microeconomics Apple IIGS PlayStation 3 ZX Spectrum Floppy disk Canon T90 Sharp Zaurus Light gun Digital photography Palm OS Windows Vista IBM PC compatible Digital audio workstation Web design Game Boy Advance PC Engine Computer surveillance Acorn Electron Amstrad CPC Teletext Macromedia Flash Hello world program Touchscreen Graphics card Console game Computer animation Video Graphics Array Windows registry NTSC Computer-aided design Slot machine Enterprise content management Movie projector Tesla coil Beatmania IIDX Nintendo Knight Rider Commodore 128 Gameking Mouse (computing) MicroBee Video Shadow mask
