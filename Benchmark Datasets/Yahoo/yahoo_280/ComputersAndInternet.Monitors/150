hooking up a mac monitor to a pc i have read in other questions that it is okay to hook up different monitors to different pcs i have a pc and want to hook up a mac monitor to it the monitor has the cable cord and a usb cord which is not how my current pc monitor is set up should i plug the usb cord in too only the regular cord or get an specific adapter for a pc it depends on the type of monitor monitors aren't generally associated with any particular system so i'm not sure what you mean by a mac monitor in general if the cable coming out of the monitor will fit in the connector on the computer it'll work and if it doesn't it's just a monitor so no harm in trying Universal Serial Bus FireWire IPod USB flash drive Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Extension Cord Floppy disk RS-232 D-subminiature Xbox 360 Digital Visual Interface Atari ST Laptop Embedded system Mouse (computing) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IMac Mac OS X Secure Digital card Gender of connectors and fasteners Windows XP Desktop computer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Computer forensics BS 1363 Atari 8-bit family Computer hardware Screenshot Computer bus Power cord Serial ATA Power Macintosh G3 USB mass storage device class IBM PC Lighting Common Unix Printing System Apple Macintosh Power Mac G4 Cube Booting Apple Desktop Bus SCSI Power line communication Amiga IBook Hard disk Nintendo Revolution Sound card Xbox PlayStation Portable Bluetooth ACCESS.bus Commodore 64 Closed-circuit television PDP-11 High-definition television Timeline of computing 1990-forward DIN connector PlayStation 2 AlphaSmart Portable Document Format Telephone exchange SCART KVM switch Acorn Electron AmigaOS Mandriva Linux Commodore International DVD Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Gender Token ring Plug-and-play Jack plug S-Video Nintendo GameCube Apple Computer Cheating in Counter-Strike History of Microsoft Windows Game port File Allocation Table Spark plug CompactFlash Architecture of Windows 2000 TRS-80 PC card Flash memory Digital photography Commodore SX-64 Dongle Anchor Computer Digital rights management Digital Subscriber Line Coaxial cable Category 5 cable
