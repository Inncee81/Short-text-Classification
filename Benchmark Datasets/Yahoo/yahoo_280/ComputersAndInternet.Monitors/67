i have a pc monitor at mode how can i turn my monitor settings to its original settings turning mode monitor to its original settings hiya tuesdayg when you say original settings it could mean things it could mean that the display was showing full color and somehow was changed to colors this would be a windows display setting the other would be to reset the monitor itself to the original factory settings here is how to change these things to change the number of colors that windows is using open the control panel and double click the display icon this will open the display settings window it can also be opened by right clicking on an empty area of the desktop and then select properties on the drop down menu once you have the display settings window open you will see tabs along the top edge click the last one toward the right side labeled settings once the settings window is open you can make some changes the first change will be to pull down the color quality menu and you should have more choices then the that is currently selected select bit or bit depending on what is available the higher the number the better the quality click apply to save the settings or ok to save and exit the screen may flicker and the new color quality setting will be applied you may get a pop up telling you that the display settings have been reconfigured i will ask if you want to keep the new settings if the color not the sizes looks better then click yes if your screen does not seem to be the correct size and everything is too big then you will want to increase the screen resolution setting the correct setting will depend on your monitor typically a crt non flat panel will do well at x pixels and an lcd flat panel will need to be higher since the monitor model is unknown i recommend that you experiment to find the right setting for you to change this move the slider bar under screen resolution to the right until you get something you like resetting the monitor to the factory settings to do this use the buttons on the front of the monitor to access the internal settings menu use the buttons again to move around the menu system until you find a setting named restore factory settings or factory default settings then highlight it and press the select button some monitors have different labels for the buttons and the menu items so the wording may be a bit different this will affect the monitor only not your windows settings on the computer good luck Liquid crystal display Screenshot Windows XP Oscilloscope Pixel Palm OS Danger Hiptop Macintosh Finder IMac IPod Taskbar Embedded system Television Atari 8-bit family PlayStation Portable Apple typography Cathode ray tube Screensaver AmigaOS Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Plasma display Beatmania IIDX System 7 (Macintosh) Opera (web browser) Hello world program Color Graphics Adapter Pump It Up System 6 Video Graphics Array Windows 2000 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Floppy disk Computer display DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Microsoft Windows X Window System Gamut Double-click (computing) Resident Evil (video game) Blue screen of death Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital photography Dance Dance Revolution DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Object Desktop DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX HTML element History of the graphical user interface Gradius Advance Wars: Dual Strike Nintendo Entertainment System Mozilla Firefox Nintendo GameCube Original Amiga chipset Commodore 128 Computer display standard Macromedia Flash Liquid crystal display television Windows Vista AppleScript Bubble Bobble Arcade cabinet Amstrad CPC QuickDraw Unicode DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Solar cell Super Nintendo Entertainment System Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Laptop Minesweeper (computer game) Emacs EIA-708 Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 TRS-80 Nintendo DS Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tungsten Handheld Control Panel (Windows) X86 assembly language IBM PC compatible Refresh rate Loudspeaker NTSC Sega Saturn RGB color model Light-emitting diode Natural Selection (computer game) PowerBook IBM PC keyboard TFT LCD Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Laserdisc
