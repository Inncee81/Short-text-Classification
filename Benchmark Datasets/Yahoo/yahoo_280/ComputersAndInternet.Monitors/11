what size square monitor has the same height as a wide i have a widescreen i'm buying another one tonight to acheive an unneccesarily extensive span of monitor on my desk i'm wondering if the seam in the middle where the edges of the monitors meet will suck so i was thinking about puting a rd non widescreen monitor inbetween the two ers i'd like it to line up well so the middle one fits the height of the two wides on either side which size would accomplish this also any thoughts comments concerns regarding this setup any information would be appreciated i have vista enterprise premium business edition so it should be able to handle it also my main concern is having the seam directly in front of my line of sight i think i'd rather have two offcenter seams than one right in the middle i would not mix a widescreen and standard aspect ratio monitors i have tried it and it did not work well normally a widescreen has a resolution of x this vertical resolution does not exist in the standard aspect ratio monitors the closest is x as a result of this difference i had some weird behavior on my secondary monitor standard monitor while i was playing full screen games on the primary widescreen at my previous job i had extended desktop spanning across monitors of the same resolution and the transition from one monitor to the other was very easy and although they were not placed closely together the seam was not a problem for me the closer you place the monitors next to each other the easier it will be for you get get used to the dual monitor setup another thing to consider is that monitors will require video cards and it will make this type of setup more expensive and may complicate things if you do not have the ability to install two identical video cards regarding physical height a standard ratio is about the same as a widescreen Widescreen Anamorphic widescreen Fast bowling Aspect ratio (image) Television Digital photography Windows Vista IMac IBM PC compatible Pixel Computer display standard Surveillance Floppy disk Pan and scan Stereoscopy Color Graphics Adapter Oscilloscope Movie projector Cinerama Computer Dance Dance Revolution Original Amiga chipset Laserdisc Windows XP Commodore 64 Windows Server 2003 Star Trek Customizable Card Game Babylon 5 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Cognitive science Volleyball Enterprise content management Information Technology Infrastructure Library Welding Atari 8-bit family PC Engine Video Graphics Array Bass guitar Geodesy A Course In Miracles Display resolution Education in the People's Republic of China Pretty Good Privacy Computer display Microsoft S__CAM PostScript High-definition television Laptop Loudspeaker Bicycle frame System 7 (Macintosh) QuickDraw PowerBook Mac OS X Stairway Mattress Color Explosive material Java programming language Liquid crystal display History of Microsoft Windows System/36 Extended display identification data Tank Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Amiga Universal Serial Bus Hard disk Internet Apple II family Teletext EIA-708 OpenGL 64-bit Sega Saturn Mainframe computer Magic: The Gathering M16 (rifle) Infantilism Francis Crick AmigaOS Atari ST Minesweeper (computer game) Final Fantasy
