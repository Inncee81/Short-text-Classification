does tapping the top of a soda can three times really prevent it from exploding when you open it when a carbonated beverage is shaken and then opened it usually explodes but somehow i was told to tap poke the top three times fairly hard adn it wont explode why is this or is it just coincidence it helps by bringing the bubbles to the surface to pop before the can is opened otherwise the bubbles come from the bottom shooting up really fast causing it to 'explode' addt details here's a more scientific expanation tapping on the top of a carbonated beverage can or bottle before opening it may help prevent the drink from exploding out of the can upon opening although it might not be sufficient sparkling or carbonated beverages contain carbon dioxide gas that is dissolved in the liquid by pressurizing the contents of the can when the can is opened the mixture depressurizes and the carbon dioxide comes out of solution escaping as carbon dioxide gas if there is liquid between the gas bubble and the outside of the can then some of the liquid may be pushed out of the can with the bubble the pressure gradient when the can is opened is greatest near the opening and the carbon dioxide at the top of the can escapes first in addition to tapping on the can the risk of getting soaked is reduced if the can or bottle is opened slowly rather than quickly because then the initial pressure change is less significant so the gas can escape less forcefully the wider the top of the container the better the chance to avoid an accident since there is more volume for gas without intervening liquid Carbon dioxide Bong Rebreather Explosive material Welding Carbonated water Plastic Decompression sickness Champagne (beverage) Nuclear power Fire extinguisher Volcano Drink Gas metal arc welding Polyethylene terephthalate Water (molecule) Brewery Nitrogen Liquid breathing Water purification Breathing gas Cider Guinness Drowning Internal ballistics Lake Carbon dioxide sink Wine Pebble bed reactor Alcoholic beverage Carburetor Nitroglycerin Acetic acid Coffee Ammonia Soft drink Alcohol fuel Petroleum Siphon Fire fighting Gasoline Kyoto Protocol Tap (valve) Bubble Bobble Ice core Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Origin of life Natural gas Bottled water Ocean thermal energy conversion Nuclear reactor Hydrogen economy Sewage treatment Scuba set Alternative biochemistry Pulmonary alveolus Waste management Sulfur Portable stove Global warming Permian-Triassic extinction event Food preservation Geology of the Moon Coal Iron Coca-Cola Alkane Sun Phase (matter) Tooth Hydrochloric acid Haloalkane Charles Momsen Alcoholic proof E85 Partial pressure Lake Nyos Stoma Blast furnace Plutonium Oxygen sensor Methanol Earth's atmosphere Sugar beet Gum arabic Aluminium Carbon Keg Lake Kivu Methane Flue gas desulfurization
