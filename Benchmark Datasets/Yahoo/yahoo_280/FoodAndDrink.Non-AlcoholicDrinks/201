where can i buy sugar free syrups for coffee in the uk i run a popular coffee shop and use loads of syrups all the time i have to be honest the sugar free ones are horrible and there is a debate over the health risks posed by what the companies add to them my argument would be that everything is fine in moderation if your only gonna have one nice cup a day then a bit of syrup isn't gonna kill you also i've found that over time you can aquire the taste for less sugar and enjoy the taste of the coffee more good milk naturaly sweetens when you heat it if you have a good barista that uses good ingredients then you can have a of coffee that tastes sweet without adding anything try making your own vanilla sugar just by leaving some pods in your sugar it's an old chefs trick and it works a treat i know this doesn't strictly answer your question but i really think you should leave sugar free syrups alone good luck Coffee Chocolate Sugar Espresso Breakfast Milk Ice cream Maple syrup Aspartame Turkish coffee Sugar beet Coca-Cola Rice pudding Milkshake Cuisine of Singapore Cheese Sugar substitute Diet soda Yoghurt Singlish Soy milk Hong Kong-style milk tea Pancake Kit Kat Cha chaan teng Cappuccino Tofu Dr Pepper Bubble tea Starbucks Bengali cuisine Rum German cuisine Japanese cuisine Pecan pie Honey Vinegar Atkins Nutritional Approach Healthy eating Cake Polish cuisine Cajun cuisine Pepsi-Cola Pomegranate Sucrose Dairy Questionable Content Saccharin French toast Wine Golden syrup Sake New Coke Candy Lemonade The Coca-Cola Company The Sims 2: University Sucralose Cigar Theory of conduct Jaggery Tequila Glycerin Breastfeeding Organic food In-N-Out Burger Chili con carne Mooncake Polyols Baklava Barbecue Hamster Food preservation Gatorade Soul food Hypoglycemia Horehound Moonshine Queen (band) Microeconomics Ketchup Brewery Cheesecake Date Palm Recurring South Park characters Marshmallow Mountain Dew Halva Heath bar American Chinese cuisine Liqueur Qualia Starch Cough medicine Vegetarianism
