external hard drive a or server question which is better here is the deal i have been downloading lots of torrents lately i have a laptop and use a usb gb external hard drive after that porn o tronic was full i got a gb firewire hd now that is full of music and anime and other crap now i am out of room i want to get more hard drives i know that i can daisy chain them to each other but won't that make them slower my tech i friend suggested i buy a server but that seems a bit over the top i really just want a metal case that houses anywhere from hard drives and i can connect to my laptop via firewire and accecss the information that easily i would like to drop my hd my hd into it and possibly get some extra hd anywhere from tb anyone else done this can you picture what i am asking does this housing project exist are there any better suggestions i am leaving the country soon so i would like the ability to access everything should i get a server and do it remotely or just stack hd what to do i appreciate all of the fast answers from the community i am not interested in burning to dvd i just don't wanna i dont like cd and i hate flimsy ass dvd rom drives they may hold some info but it is poop they are cheap crap and i hate them sorry to go off i guess i really just want a huge housing for hd anyone know of a good one of these thanks i would not recommend a server b c they're too slow noisy take up too much space and power hungry they do have their advantages but i find i can't stand copying files across the network but i don't have a gigbit network if you do then it might be worth the try don't even think about it on wifi for large files like the ones you're talking about you also might not have the performance overhead from when multiple people are accessing the server so performance might be improved for a single user by the way if you're going to build a server you might as well run everything on it since it'll essentially be a under utilized desktop by the way the definition of server i think in your mind is just a junk desktop there are some very effective storage solutions using servers but they really don't make sense for your application they also still don't beat a usb or firewire connection but allows you the ability to put on lots of data i can't imagine you having that much porn and anime or whatever to need that much here are my suggestions deal with multiple externals get stackable ones purchase a external case that houses multiple drives check newegg out purchase an enclosure that allows you to swap drives in and out check newegg out replace your current drives with tb gb or gb drives a gb can be had for around buy two with and put them in your old externals or buy new enclosures for each and you can have a terabyte of storage for definitely a cleaner solution and essentially triples your current capacity i've seen some gb externals selling for around total so it's possible to have the setup for around build a custom enclosure using an old case or whatever and just pile them on and using adapters and hubs to connect to your old computer be creative there are several ways to do this don't have to go to newegg but i'm not going to look at every retailer to find every product for you http www newegg com product product aspx item n e http www newegg com product product aspx item n e http www newegg com

something like this with a enclosure buy a few of these and you can swap them in out but i don't see how this is any more beneficial than having several externals it's good for desktops b c of
