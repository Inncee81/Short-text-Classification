what games will take advantage of quad core cpu's specific games is what i was looking for none to take advantage of a multi core cpu software has to be written to use more than one thread no current games are and neither is most software multithreading is difficult and requires different development methodologies and tools i wouldn't expect to see multithreaded games appear any time soon maybe in years time the only advantage you get from a multi core chip as a gamer is that if you are running other software at the same time like teamspeak or winamp or windows wants to do something in the background then it will run on another core and not interrupt your game CPU design Thread (computer science) IBM PC compatible Pentium 4 Xbox 360 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Central processing unit CPU cache Computer multitasking 3dfx MIPS architecture Dual-core RISC Simultaneous multithreading Opteron Microprocessor Windows XP Computer 64-bit X86 Hyper-threading AMD Computer and video games Mach kernel Embedded system MAME Athlon 64 X2 Mac OS X v10.4 ATI Technologies Commodore 64 Atari ST NX bit Game programmer Extreme Programming Cell (microprocessor) History of Microsoft Windows Mac OS X Management information system Symmetric multiprocessing Sega Dreamcast Symbian OS Software architecture PowerPC Zilog Z80 Apple IIGS Radeon Linux Field-programmable gate array RISC OS PlayStation Portable Distributed computing Windows Vista Quake III Arena IBM POWER Sega Saturn Pentium D Sinclair ZX81 Operating system PlayStation 3 Burroughs B5000 Nintendo Entertainment System AMD64 Mouse (computing) Mandriva Linux PlayStation 2 DragonFly BSD ZX Spectrum MP3 Cheating in online games Nintendo Revolution Windows 2000 Forth programming language Rational Unified Process Intel iAPX 432 INMOS Transputer WebObjects IA-64 Computer bus Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Original Amiga chipset Montecito Microsoft Apple Computer Software testing Perl Rapid application development Copland Wintel BIOS Computer program World of Warcraft Read-only memory Motorola 68000 Game programming Software engineering Neo-Geo Windows API Linux kernel
