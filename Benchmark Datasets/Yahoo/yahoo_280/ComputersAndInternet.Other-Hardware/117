when burning a cd it sometimes only reads on my pc i have a pretty average older dvd burner years old when i burn files any files either cd or dvd it sometimes only work on my reader instead of other newer computers i've tried and confirmed this on different pcs with different brands of cds if my burner sucks then why read perfectly on it and not other better ones these are good answers thanks everyone here's one scenario in particular the other pc is new with a lp dvd burner it has the same version of nero as mine i tried it twice first time it was a cdrw with pictures burnt as a data disk some folders froze on it second time it was a data dvd with multiple avis of which froze at the same place when playing my main concern is that i backup many files on dvd but what if my new system won't read them although you are burning on cd and dvd discs you are not burning dvd and cd formats you are burning what is called a data disc a data disc is a dvd or cd that has something other than audo or videofiles on it these can only be read on certain burners if imporperly formated because i am not affiliated with whatever burner you may have i do not know how to fix the problem but this is most likly the problem at least Floppy disk Disk image Windows XP Blu-ray Disc Compact disc CD-ROM Copy protection CD recorder Universal Disk Format Laserdisc Windows Vista PlayStation Portable File Allocation Table Video codec DVD-RAM Windows 2000 File system System 7 (Macintosh) PlayStation 2 Cache Hard disk MAME NTFS Video CD Gramophone record Enterprise content management USB flash drive Apple II family Flash memory Knoppix File format MiniDisc PlayStation 3 Virtual memory AmigaOS Ripping Library (computer science) Warez Movie projector Mac OS X Sega Dreamcast EMac Ebook Stardock CP/M Computer file Digital photography CPU cache High-definition television MP3 Mac OS Sound recording Apollo 8 Cue sheet Computer VHS Digital audio player Mach kernel Modchip Redundant array of independent disks Sony Web crawler Object Desktop Commodore DOS Karaoke Super Audio CD Disk storage Copy Control Bluetooth ITunes Federal Standard 1037C Personal computer WAV Xbox 360 Television DualDisc Apple Computer World of Warcraft Computer storage Binary prefix MDAC ZIP (file format) IPod System/34 Sega Saturn ISO image Partition (computing) CD-R Covermount XML LiveCD Directory DivX
