buying a psu for a pc after visiting pc world they have sold me a psu that has slightly less watts than the one which was installed already they say this should make no difference to the running of the computer is this correct to be frank if you don't mind me changing my name for a few seconds lol you probably won't notice any difference in performance having said that however it limits your expansion capability in that the more hardware you connect to your motherboard the more power wattage you'll need i e if you add more hard drives more powerful graphics card etc you'll need more wattage Personal computer Apple IIGS Redundant array of independent disks Overclocking IBM PC Hard disk Apple Macintosh Atari ST Amiga IMac Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis AmigaOS Computer hardware Acorn Electron ZX Spectrum PlayStation 2 Windows XP PC motherboard Universal Serial Bus Commodore 64 Laptop Commodore 128 TRS-80 Color Computer Desktop computer Graphics processing unit ATX Sound Blaster ATI Technologies IBM PC compatible Atari 8-bit family Bicycle lighting Nintendo Entertainment System Computer BIOS 3dfx Graphics card Commodore PET Texas Instruments TI-99/4A PlayStation Portable Nintendo GameCube PC Engine IPod Ethernet PlayStation 3 Computer bus Windows 2000 Knoppix Computer and video games MicroATX Mac OS X Apple II family Xbox Modchip BBC Micro NVIDIA Amstrad CPC Xbox 360 Sound card Copy protection Transistor SETI@home Computer forensics NeXT Musical Instrument Digital Interface File system Scalable Link Interface TRS-80 GeForce 6 Series Expansion card Power Mac G4 Digital photography Video Graphics Array Radeon Timeline of computing 1990-forward Cisco PIX Switched-mode power supply Disk cloning PowerPC Nintendo 64 Microprocessor Motherboard History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Commodore International Celeron Power Macintosh G3 Sprite (computer graphics) Wi-Fi IBM Personal System/2 Super Nintendo Entertainment System S3 Graphics Computer virus Patch (computing) Embedded system Desknote A600 Advanced Technology Attachment Portland State University Linux Computer case Microsoft Windows
