why is mac better than windows i just want to know what features it has that windows doesn't and no windows sucks mac rocks or anything like that btw i love windows and have no experience with mac i just want to know why people say it is better and thanks for the answers so far esp ans very informative comparing a mac to windows is like comparing a car to a steering wheel microsoft makes an operating system windows apple makes a computer the macintosh line a lot of the benefits that apple claims to have justifiably such as reliability ease of use etc come from the fact that apple sells specific models of computers with their operating system on it if you want something portable get the macbook if you want a small computer get a macmini if you want a more powerful computer get the workstation they have different products but for the most part your selection is limited windows on the other hand is just an operating system it may come pre installed on a lot of computers but microsoft doesn't sell computers therefore you can put windows on computers with an infinite number of configurations older computers newer computers computers with hardware that you specifically pick out for a computer you can build yourself this flexibility makes an os like windows a lot more flexible in the eyes of some people and therefore a lot more desirable especially in the business world where cto's don't feel like being locked in to a hardware vendor while this locks them into an os choice the fact is that the os overall cost is far cheaper than the hardware costs so it's the lesser of evils so the question of whether a mac is better has to do with the needs of the customer it's better for some worse for others some people like cars others like trucks Apple Macintosh Mac OS X Microsoft Windows History of Microsoft Windows Apple Computer Mouse (computing) Windows Vista IBM PC compatible Mach kernel Windows XP PowerPC Microsoft Windows 2000 X Window System RISC Computer Linux Amiga Apple II family Personal computer Mac OS Floppy disk NeXT Operating system Laptop OpenGL Atari ST Game programming Unicode Sun Microsystems Computer workstation Visual Basic Digital rights management Mac OS history PowerBook IMac Vorbis Embedded system History of the graphical user interface AmigaOS System 7 (Macintosh) MIPS architecture Windows Server 2003 Microsoft Office Radeon Universal Serial Bus Atari 8-bit family Digital Equipment Corporation Unix Steve Jobs Library (computer science) Copy protection Hard disk Mac OS X v10.4 Linux distribution File Allocation Table Blue screen of death History of operating systems Macromedia Flash Modem Ashton-Tate Wintel HyperCard Timeline of computing 1990-forward Apple typography History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Screenshot WebObjects LiveCD Dot matrix printer Common criticisms of Microsoft Xerox Star Windows 3.x Wi-Fi Novell NetWare Lisp programming language Mac OS 9 Supercomputer H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Microprocessor VMware BASIC programming language 64-bit Bulk vending Open Database Connectivity OS/2 Linux kernel Mac OS X v10.2
