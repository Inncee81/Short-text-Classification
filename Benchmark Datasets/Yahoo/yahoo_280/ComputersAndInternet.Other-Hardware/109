why is my jumpdrive acting like i have a lexar jumpdrive with mb everytime i plug it in my laptop with xp it says unkown and something error it will not read then when i can go into the drive i try to save all my data onto my laptop the drive stops and produces an unkown error i can get in it sometimes but only for a second is there anyway i can get any data off of it will it gets currupt like when you try to recover a hard drive sometimes my entire computer freezes i can even use task manager and it doesn't work well with other computers with xp or other os's if it was working before but you can not access it anymore you may be out of luck see if it will work on another pc if it never worked correctly with this laptop make sure you have all the windows updates and the proper drivers for the jump drive also make sure the jump drive and the laptop usb speeds are compatible if the jump drive is and the laptop isn't you will have troubles you can try to run a scan on the drive but if windows is telling you there is a problem when you plug it in it may not work good luck USB flash drive Universal Serial Bus Hard disk Floppy disk Windows 2000 IBM PC compatible Computer forensics Laptop IPod Computer bus Bluetooth Booting FreeDOS Personal computer Apple Macintosh Redundant array of independent disks Computer virus System/36 Desktop computer Computer hardware Architecture of Windows 2000 Common Unix Printing System Debugging Flash memory Commodore 64 Backup History of Microsoft Windows System/34 AmigaOS Wi-Fi BIOS DVD Btrieve Motorola 68000 Copy protection PlayStation 3 TRS-80 Embedded system Windows Me Computer Master Control Program USB mass storage device class IBook Burroughs B5000 Knoppix Linux Timeline of computing 1990-forward IBM PC Power Macintosh G3 Mac OS X PowerBook G4 PCI Express Advanced Technology Attachment RS-232 Atari ST Windows Vista Apple II family Virtual memory SmartMedia Digital rights management Microprocessor Digital circuit Cheating in Counter-Strike Modem ATI Technologies Software bug CompactFlash File Allocation Table Dynamic random access memory CD recorder Blue screen of death Acorn Electron Serial port NTFS Digital photography Xbox 360 CPU design DOS Knight Rider Early IBM disk storage PowerPC IMac PDP-11 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Microsoft Windows Rootkit Supercomputer Xbox Forth programming language Memory Stick Apple IIGS Mach kernel Visual Basic Commodore International Commodore 128 Pretty Good Privacy
