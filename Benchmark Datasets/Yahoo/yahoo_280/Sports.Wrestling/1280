should edge's finishing move be known as the triple r i mean his spear should be known as the rated r ram do you agree i really dont like his move as great a technical wrestler as he is something as common as a spear is kind of beneath him calling it something other than a spear would mean bobby lashley would have to name his something and so would everyone else that uses that move thats why common finishers like chokeslames dont really get their own designation but powerbombs do so that kind of blows my theory out of the water i hope he uses his time off to come up with a new finish because seeing someone as small as him take down someone huge with a tackle spear seems kinda silly just my opinion though triple r seems too much like a triple h referance Professional wrestling throws Powerbomb Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling aerial techniques Mark Calaway John Layfield David Bautista Professional wrestling match types Paul Wight Adam Copeland Kurt Angle Chris Jericho Shawn Michaels Leon White Professional wrestling slang WWE No Mercy Glen Jacobs WWE Vengeance Taboo Tuesday Paul Levesque Mike Bucci WWE Unforgiven WrestleMania X8 Franklin Lashley Suplex Professional wrestling Rugby union positions Charles Ashenoff Brock Lesnar Chris Benoit ECW One Night Stand Taikyoku shogi Glossary of American football Professional wrestling holds Alien vs. Predator (film) Cincinnati Bengals Scott Hall Super Bowl XXXIV Accie C.
