it up with a spinebuster and a powerbomb with batista in the ring khali appears on the tron and utters some jibberish before runjin singh says that batista better enjoy his victory and savor it

only is chavo a better wrestler than him rey but that he is also a better human being he says that he doesn t think he can beat chavo because he is in the prime of his career chavo inflicted so much pain on his leg and made him say i quit chavo as rey goes on to say i quit a few more times until eugene s music hits chavo guerrero d eugene chavo actually went for the during this match but comically flopped out of the ring he then took off the mask to reveal what we already knew eugene mounted something resembling a comeback hitting chavo with the amigos but missed a frog splash and then fell victim to chavo s frog splash for the victory mark henry d sterling keenan who routinely works for iwc in pittsburgh area after an elbow drop and a bear hug henry grabs the mic and says that this is getting redundant he says that all the fans are feeling sorry for his opponents he says that he is the silverback and that this is just what he does and of course shows a video to prove it at first it looks like it will show undertaker s decimation at the hands of henry on may but all of the sudden the video talks about how ut has risen from the dead plenty of times before as the arena goes dark when the video ends and the lights come back on we hear the druid music and see a druid walk back from the ring dropping what looked like sand all the way to the entrance mark henry looks confused which isn t that much of a surprise but so are we looks like ut vs henry at unforgiven may be on the horizon kenny dykstra is shown backstage kissing victoria michelle mccool walks by and tells them to get a room victoria says at least i have a man michelle says that he doesn t look like much of a man and that she thinks of all men as hers victoria d torrie wilson jimmy wang yang decks

is mvp this guy gets more and more money every week matt hardy d finlay via countout long slow match that saw a disappointing finish hornswaggle appeared from under the ring and finlay threw him beneath the bottom rope noble ran out and pulled hornswaggle out distracting finlay hornswaggle ran to the back and was followed by noble who was followed by finlay he is counted out to give hardy the win which was followed by a chorus of boos for the lame ending backstage finlay confronts noble for picking on hornswaggle noble says that there are three of them he was with two other cruiserweights and only one finlay finlay inadvertently smacks kane who was standing behind him and kane chokeslams finlay into a wall and some other fine props kane d sylvan who came out to the old la resistance music different from what he used at a raw house show in wheeling over the weekend and he was without maryse as well kane wins with a chokeslam and as he lights the arena up from all four ringposts finlay sneaks in and attacks kane from behind with the shillelagh he beats on kane for a good bit even after the refs try to break it up masterlock challenge chris masters issues an open challenge to any fan in the audience he first picks a big dude and masters asks him what makes you think you can break my masterlock this monster says i was all state in football the captain of my high school wrestling team and i was convicted of manslaughter and just got out of prison oh great some death banter only a few months after benoit masters says he doesn t want to embarrass the guy in front of his family and then picks out john from youngstown who happens to be fabulous john mcchesney also from iwc big night for them masters wins easily ric flair meets batista backstage and tells him that his idol will cut khali down to his size slap on the figure four and make khali tap tonight khali d ric flair flair s only offense was a thumb to the eye a low blow and a few chops khali pins flair s shoulders to the mat for the count after squeezing his head in he keeps the hold on flair even after the bell rings and batista makes the save backing khali into the corner batista later sets him up for the batista bomb but khali shoves him away and squeezes his head until he stands tall over both batista and flair to close the show
