what can be done to stop the silly war between ufc adn wwe i sometimes write in both sections and others too i do not understand why one think it is better than the other they are both good in my eyes i enjoy watching both wwe and ufc so most of you know those martial artist that are coming in here and bashing your section do not represent the majority of us martial artits most of us have respect for wrestling also most of them or just kids and teenagers i ask you to ignore them as best you can just dont answer their questions and leave them with zero anwers in return please don't come to the ma section and bash us it makes you look as bad as they are it doesnt matter who starte it it matters who stops it first im here to try and start that if others will follow i made a similar post to the ma section as well enough is enough most of us are adults and do not wish to be involved in these childish antics thank you sensei a former wrestler ps i did not give any thumbs down i gave all thumbs up so far i think a truce is needed as well if the mature adults stay out of it then it will just be a few silly kids doing it and we can all ignore them both sports are entertaining to watch and participate in wrestling is not fake it is coreographed and it is a fact they do take their bumps and bruises and have to be very athletic to even do some of the things they do it does not take full contact to prove you have talent just remember an martial artists that come in here to spam or start stuff is not a real martial artist nor do they represent the majority of us in that category a real sensei would never speak poorly of wrestling or any sport or art they are kids just try to ignore them i agree completely the ppl that are doing this are childish and we need to ignore them i refuse to have a battle of wits with unarmed ppl they will never see our side of things and enjoy making us mad so don't give them the pleasure of arguing with them Professional wrestling Mixed martial arts Professional wrestling slang Vince McMahon Eddie Guerrero Ultimate Fighting Championship Bret Hart World Championship Wrestling World Wrestling Entertainment Chris Benoit Mark Calaway Page Falkenberg Hulk Hogan Professional wrestling holds Shawn Michaels Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling throws Ring of Honor NWo Sting (wrestler) Professional wrestling attacks Sport Warrior (wrestler) Roddy Piper Theory of conduct Nicomachean Ethics Shoot (professional wrestling) Chris Jericho Aikido Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Squidward Tentacles Ken Shamrock Eric Bischoff Royce Gracie Plame affair Sumo Tag team Nick Dinsmore WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
