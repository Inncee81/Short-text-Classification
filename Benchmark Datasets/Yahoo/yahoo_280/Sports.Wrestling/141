why do people diss ex wwe guys in tna from the days of wwf wcw and ecw all the way back to wwf nwa awa wrestlers always jumped around the major promotions kurt angle is as good as any main eventer in wwe christian cage is as a good as any major heel in wwe team d is better than ever tag team in wwe vkm would probably be the most popluar tag team in wwe if they were there especially if they were with dx again jerry lynn had great matches with rvd in ecw but was never used well in wwe the x division has many guys like a j styles dark angel and sensi that were in wwe for a short time but didn't get used think of how much better the cruiserweight division would be if vince actually used these guys to their full potential jackie and gail are as good if not better than any wrestling diva in wwe just saying these people don't suck just because they went to tna people act like they aren't as good as wwe talent just because they aren't there anymore i agree i agree but he really needs to cut back on the steroids i agree i disagree i think their glory days are behind them though i think they're still good they did everything they could do in the wwe so them being in tna where they can win new belts and feud with legendary teams or put over new teams makes perfect sense possibly the only reason i pay them any attention is because of b g james kip james billy gunn and lance hoyt had the worst match i've ever seen on impact and it wasn't lance's fault that woman they are hanging with is too goofy to be taken seriously i agree they were used but they weren't used well i have heard the days of the cruiserweight championship are numbered anyway so that aspect of your point might be moot still those are three tremendous talents i'll agree with you about gail kim but not jackie i've never been impressed with her offensive ability she can sell moves really well but there are better women in the independents than jackie SummerSlam Mark Calaway NWA World Heavyweight Championship Stone Cold Steve Austin Chris Candito TNA Bound For Glory Terry Gerin The Invasion WWE No Mercy Ric Flair Dudley Boyz Paul Levesque Jerry Lynn Virgil Runnels III NWo WWE No Way Out Team Canada (professional wrestling) WWE Armageddon King of the Ring Gregory Helms Elix Skipper Planet Jarrett Ron Killings Matt Hardy Richard Vigneault Survivor Series David Cash Jacqueline Moore Sean Waltman Scott Hall The Alliance Peter Senerca Darren Matthews Jeff Hardy Greg Valentine Pat Kenney Harley Race The Rock (entertainer) WrestleMania X-Seven The Great American Bash WWE Championship TNA Sacrifice WWE Tag Team Championship WWE Vengeance Roddy Piper Sting (wrestler) World Heavyweight Championship John Cena Trish Stratus Mike Alfonso Oscar Gutierrez Dean Simon Marty Jannetty Jason Reso Championship unification New Age Outlaws Royal Rumble Booker Huffman World Class Championship Wrestling Page Falkenberg Randy Savage Glen Jacobs WWE Judgment Day Rob Van Dam Scott Rechsteiner Yoshihiro Tajiri Tammy Lynn Sytch David Flair TNA Unbreakable
