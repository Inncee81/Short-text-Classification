wwe vs tna vs ufc the most pointless debate ever let's face it boys and girls wwe ain't going anywhere anytime soon ufc targets a different audience than wwe they aren't attempting to compete with wwe tna has a chance to get bigger and challenge wwe one day but right now it is nothing more than a b level alternative for people who'd rather not follow ring of honor or japanese wrestling and see some top name wrestlers why do people keep debating which is greater they're all good in their own ways your thoughts damn right wwe isnt going anywhere they wont fall apart like cough enron cough your right ufc does target different people from what i know they are the 'mtv' generation they are impressed by 'shock value' of someone being ko'd or having their arm almost being ripped off i dont have a problem with tna the company in fact i think they are quite good its just they are going down the wcw path its the tna fans that p ss me off all they do is bag the wwe and say 'it sucks' etc they never present their product and explain why anyone should watch it in my question i wasnt trying to say which one was better even though it probably appears i was everyone just tries to defend their product and explain why theirs is great question mr c Kurt Angle Professional wrestling Professional wrestling match types A.J.
