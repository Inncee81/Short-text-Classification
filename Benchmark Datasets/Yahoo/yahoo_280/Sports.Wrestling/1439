which wrestling finisher is the worst ok i want to know which wrestling finsher you think is the worse here are mines the great khali's claw it is just too stupid i liked the brain chop better than this claw his choke powerbomb was better mvp's playmaker it is one of the softest finishers in the wwe if he issues and open playmaker challenge i would love to participate i just doesnt look that real and star if you have watch wrestling once in your life i didnt mean choose one of them i meant give me yours i agree that the playmaker isn't a very good finisher it was known as the overdrive when randy orton used it as a finisher before he eventually replaced it with the rko but it's better than deuce and domino's crack 'em in the mouth all it takes is one miscue from deuce or domino to give the target a legitimate concussion in singles competition c m punk's gts runs the same risk and i liked punk a lot better when he was finishing off his opponents with the anaconda vice so i guess the gts is the answer you're looking for from me as for the great khali's iron claw that's my favorite current finisher in wwe in tna i like sting's scorpion death lock better but that's the only finisher i'm currently aware of that i like better than khali's claw Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Ric Flair David Bautista Professional wrestling Paul Levesque Eddie Guerrero Professional wrestling match types Mick Foley Phil Brooks Professional wrestling aerial techniques Randy Orton Professional wrestling attacks Leon White Kurt Angle World Wrestling Entertainment Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling slang Paul Wight Norway national football team World Championship Wrestling Chris Benoit Brock Lesnar Shawn Michaels Matt Hardy Sting (wrestler) WrestleMania XX Taboo Tuesday Virgil Runnels III The Rock (entertainer) Amy Dumas John Layfield Bret Hart Poker jargon Glen Jacobs A.J.
