ever created your own wrestling move i used to be in a man wrestling group called ukwa and came up with quite a few good moves my finisher is i anchor their left arm into a hammerlock by sliding my left arm under it near the elbow my right arm goes under their right arm in and i anchor my hands together by their neck i follow this up with a body scissors i also do a leg scissor take down so their head hits and comes to rest on an open chair then bounce off the ropes jump over my opponent and hit my full weight on the back of the chair slamming the seat into their skull i have others but it's suprisingly hard to describe a move my finisher is called the rude awakening btw funny seeing as its almost a sleeper last breath dying moment i pick up the person on my back we're back to back i wrap one arm around their throat and the other to hold their waist i link both hands strangling the opponent if he is near falling out just before submitting i swing their legs towards the arm im hold their neck in elbow drop to the sternum my forearm lands in their neck applying the thrust pressure but their is no pin just another submission and that's the kumura triangle hold opponent must tap because even tightening this hold to pds will snap or pop the person's bone out of place those are my two finishers how gruesome Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Powerbomb Piledriver (professional wrestling) Neckbreaker DDT (professional wrestling) Equine conformation Swingout Mixed martial arts Shawn Michaels Chair Professional wrestling match types Professional wrestling slang Backbreaker Volleyball Kurt Angle Breaststroke Chris Benoit Fast bowling Greg Valentine Sleeper hold Skateboarding trick Boxing Butterfly stroke Eddie Guerrero Mark Calaway Wing Chun WrestleMania X8 Strike (attack) Botch (professional wrestling) Glossary of American football Chokehold Elbow bondage Casualty lifting Gregory Helms Archery Rugby union Front crawl Horizontal bar Paul Wight Suicide methods Amateur wrestling Dropkick Amy Dumas Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Moonsault Contredanse Sin City Anchor Tennis Tetrapod Beer Pong Glossary of partner dance terms Violin Mattress Wrestling Doom enemies Side pass (dance move) WWE No Mercy Tourniquet Punch (strike) Water polo Aikido Lucha libre Tenshinhan Backstroke Terry Brunk Bondage (BDSM) WWE Unforgiven Double bass Trapping Elbow-joint Horse Gesture Diving Charleston (dance move) The Nasty Boys PRIDE High jump TNA Sacrifice Autopsy Anatomical terms of location Circle (dance move) Leon White
