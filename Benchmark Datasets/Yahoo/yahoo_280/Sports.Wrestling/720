what do you think makes wrestling addicting for those that watch is it the storylines the divas the action i have been watching for years so no explanation needed there all of the above the divas are great the ones that can wrestle there is so much action whether it be backstage in the ring in the crowd outside the arena etc the storylines are great i can say that there are some storylines that do bore me but when they start wrestling the fun just begins all over again even when the superstars talk on the mic i still find it entertaining especially when kennedy speaks he's a champ also i'm sure you saw on sd when cherry was caught by deuce and domino in batista's and flair's locker room i find that entertaining aswell because it's funny but above all because i wrestle the wrestling has to be the most entertaining thing and i'm sure alot of people can agree on that i love it when the divas the ones that can actually wrestle have a match i always think that one day i maybe doing that if i get into the wwe when the men wrestle it's the best since alot of the guys are really built i love when they do powerslams powerbombs etc the matches are unbelievable tlc hardcore ladder mitb first blood submission no holds barred steel cage hell in a cell and my personal favourite the elimination chamber etc divas wrestlers tables ladders chairs cruiserweights high flyers technical brawlers powerhouses wwentertainment i am a wwe addict and proud of it great question starred summerslam is randy orton's destiny p s for kenneth awww thanks for the compliment Shawn Michaels Paul Levesque Professional wrestling slang SummerSlam Adam Copeland Glen Jacobs Chris Jericho John Layfield The Rock (entertainer) Kurt Angle World Wrestling Entertainment Professional wrestling throws WWE No Mercy Randy Orton Extreme Championship Wrestling Amy Dumas Bret Hart Greg Valentine WrestleMania XX Hulk Hogan WWE Unforgiven Mick Foley Paul Wight WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 Leon White The Great American Bash Royal Rumble Ric Flair Tag team WWE Vengeance Jason Reso Chris Benoit Trish Stratus A.J.
