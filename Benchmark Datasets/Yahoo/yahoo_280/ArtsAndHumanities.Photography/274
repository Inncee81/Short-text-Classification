this probably should be posted else where but wedding photos might know i have a signed contract with a bride to photograph her wedding my contract charged her with her giving down and agreeing to pay the balance days before the wedding date we thought we had a rapport with the bride and groom having done the engagement session as well as the bridal session and tons of phone and email conversations then when the balance was due the bride called with a sob story about how things got out of hand and they weren't even going to be able to pay their utilities in that month yada yada i told her i could extend the payments for two months and asked her to give me a schedule to expect payment by she promised no less than on and the balance in two remaining payment over weeks we showed for the wedding and were the professionals we are until the end when they were leaving we walked outside and what to they have reserved to leave the reception in a stretch hummer that alone is that made us pretty mad but we got over it until the nd when we didn't not receive the i emailed the bride and nicely inquired if she had forgotten her payment along with our agreement now on the th she still has not responded to my letter since this has never happened in years of wedding photography my question is this if she just ignores us and does not pay but say in two years sends the balance am i beholden to give her the proof cd and wedding album i know i can take her to court and at this point i might but if i have to go that route i am just wondering what i am responsible for is she continues to ignore any other photogs ever in this position any ideas i am sending a letter return receipt requested demanding payment but i'm wondering how long i am to be held to the contract when she is in breach of our contract is it null and void when she did not uphold her end of signed contract mrsdouble you are so right about the emotions of our business my problem now is that i am mad i don't have a specific date in my contract if they do not meet it i just don't want to have to give her the proofs in a year or so if all of a sudden she decided to pay i haven't decided on court yet going to try a scary letter first thanks antoni but i'm thinking i might make people mad i don't really care if i upset the couple but weddings are about percent of my bread and butter word of mouth brings many brides to me and i would hate for word of mouth to keep them away i plan on getting my money or she will get no images i proof on cd and she won't even get that much less her album what i need to know is since she has voided her contract do i have to honor the huge wedding discount in the contract for lose pics and is there a time limit on how long i have to keep her images if she pays balance in years do i have to give her proofs or can i her for storage ok diva hope this helps a bit i always charge a deposit and dont hand anything over image wise till i have the money c o d but then i do only or a year debt collecting done this twice and it works real fast fax to one of them at their place of work in big letters there name how much is owed when you want it now this is the nasty bit print the page times tape them together feed the first page in dial the number when the first page comes out the otherside of fax tape the first page to the last page that is what i call a revolving fax it just keeps going till they stop at the other end or run out of paper and it will keep redialing them for you put your fax on redial so everytime they stop it it starts again so they turn the fax off of run out of paper thats great when they put more paper in it or turn it back on it just starts printing the fax again over and over and over and over annoying eh its like the fax of terror but it works you tell them the fax stops when the cash is in your hand they will rush to the bank then to you guys how far you take this is up to you i found hours and about yards of fax at the persons office in the morning and all work mates read it of course and they are ringing begging me to stop i say sure warm the palm of my hand with what you owe me and i shall stop the fax its extreme i know but its your money embarrass them fax their work and dont stop till you feel the cash two ways you can do this you can bomb the fax overnite so they arrive to a beeping empty fax and the longest fax they will ever get they reload the fax and the memory prints your demand again over and over again the other way is hourly fax their work with the demand final idea i havent done would be put their pic in your shop and detail they havent paid you you know do you know these people thet are bad debtors believe me you do the fax they will pay weither your angry enough we will see a
