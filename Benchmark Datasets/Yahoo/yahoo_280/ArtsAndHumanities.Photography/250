i heard there are important lights in studio lighting key light fill light and background light question i heard the fill light is less bright than key light pls teach me how many watts the for each to make a good photo result in studio i'm planning of using black color background thanks a lot folks depending on the type of results you are looking for you may vary the ratio of the key and fill lights however or power ratios would be a good place to start for basic studio photography will give you a one f stop difference is a stop difference the greater the difference between the two the more dramatic the shadows will be if you want a really black background then you will need to be careful to ensure that your lights don't spill onto the background a colored background can be black in the studio if you don't allow any light to hit it but a black background will look gray if you aren't careful with your key and fill snoots barn doors or grids are light modifiers used to control the spread and spill of your lighting i'd encourage you to play with just one light to start and learn how changing its position will alter the highlights and shadows on your model don't get too complicated in the lighting too quickly or you will find yourself flailing with the lights and not really seeing what each one is doing once you really get a handle on what the one key light does then consider adding fill background accent hair etc one at a time here's an example taken with one light carefully controlled to not hit the background http www evanbaines com gallery portrait php Drawing Photography Solar cell Color Stereoscopy Digital photography E85 Transformer Japanese tea ceremony Polarization Mach kernel Diamond cut Lighting Internal ballistics Dragon Booster Jumpstart 3rd Grade Bicycle lighting Milton H.
