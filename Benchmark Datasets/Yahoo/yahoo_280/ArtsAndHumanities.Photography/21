what would be the best camera to buy for someone who want to make photography their hobby cost is no problem also im going to invest a lot of time in this new hobby thank you you didn't specify whether you wanted to work in digital photography or film so i'll give you my preferences for both personally as a hobby i find film to be much much more enjoyable especially if you do your own developing and printing if this is what you're going for i would suggest buying a nikon or canon with a metal frame go to a good camera shop and see what they've got the older the better as technology advances so do technological problems never once have i had a problem with my older cameras plus they're easy to use and virtually indestructable my first camera was a nikon nikkormat i've bought new cameras for more money and the nikkormat is still my absolute favorite it'a reliable easy and extremely hard wearing i've dropped it on cement accidentally without even a scratch as for digital i admit that it's not my area of knowledge however my digital photo buddies are nuts for nikon's digital cameras particularly the d their pictures come out pretty amazing i must say since you have the money to spare i would reccomend buying a camera in person and not trying to save money by buying one off ebay or anything cameras are delicate one scratch on a lens can ruin all your pictures go in person and see what you're getting also small local camera shops often know more about their cameras than anywhere else and they're willing to work with you and give you reccomendations the extra cost is well worth it good luck Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon Corporation Konica Minolta View camera Camera Photography Stereoscopy Technicolor Advanced Photo System Anamorphic widescreen Nikon FE Gramophone record Leica Movie projector Digital cinema Nikon FM2 Single-lens reflex camera Nikon FE2 Nikon FA Photographic lens Macro photography Canon EOS Digital camera back Canon T90 Traditional animation Rangefinder camera Amateur astronomy Panavision Mouse (computing) Nikon D70 Cinematography Pornography Computer Surveillance Panoramic photography Eastman Kodak Binoculars Camcorder Copy protection Philatelic investment Photograph Photographic film IBM PC compatible Film Digital video 35 mm film Time Out of Mind Laserdisc Hyperinflation Photojournalism Money Bullet time Electronic commerce Point and shoot camera Closed-circuit television Energy development Charge-coupled device Shutter speed Disposable camera Bulk vending Pentax Advance fee fraud Cinerama Canon Inc.
