will photos on a disk start to fade after five years someone said that photos on a disk will start to fade after fiver years and that you should back them up to keep them i never heard this before is it true it it is how can i prevent this it isn't the photo on the disk that will fade the photos on disk are just a digital file i think what the person was talking about was medium used to make cd r can degrade from the cd r wiki at present stated cd r lifetimes are estimates based on accelerated aging tests as the technology has not been in existence long enough to verify the upper range with proper care it is thought that cd rs should be readable one thousand times or more and have a shelf life of several hundred years unfortunately some common practices can reduce shelf life to only one or two years therefore it is important to handle and store cd rs properly if it is necessary to read them more than a year or so later real life not accelerated aging tests have revealed that some cd rs degrade quickly even if stored optimally burned cd rs suffer from material degradation just like most writable media cd r media have an internal layer of dye used to store data in a cd rw disc the recording layer is made of an alloy of silver and other metals indium antimony and tellurium in cd r media the dye itself can degrade causing data to become unreadable as well as degradation of the dye failure of a cd r can be due to the reflective surface while silver is less expensive and more widely used it is more prone to oxidation resulting in a non reflecting surface gold on the other hand although more expensive and no longer widely used is an inactive material and so gold based cd rs do not suffer from this problem permanent markers are commonly used to mark the label side of cd rs and dvds this practice has been discouraged because it is believed xylene and toluene common substances in permanent marker ink can cause surface deterioration additionally volatile organic compounds may be released which will remain inside the enclosed atmosphere of a cd r's storage box causing harm one last factor that affects the quality of a cd r and influences its lifespan is the lacquer that is used to seal the cd r and protect the dye and the reflective material from the influence of external materials air water alcohol etc CD-R Compact disc Gramophone record Laserdisc Hard disk DVD Welding Explosive material Digital photography Aluminium Corrosion Digital rights management Enterprise content management MP3 Carbon dioxide Vacuum tube Solar cell Ultraviolet Mach kernel Backup Gas metal arc welding USB flash drive Password Ice core Paint Gasoline Commodore 64 Terminal ballistics Nuclear power Ozone depletion Disk storage Enzyme Geographic information system Drill bit Casting Ammonia Inflation Bong Japanese tea ceremony Sea level rise Audiophile Stereoscopy Mineral File Allocation Table Oscilloscope Blu-ray Disc Sewage treatment Silver Copy protection Glass Laser 8 mm video format Mattress Linked list PlayStation 3 Ecology Motorcycle DVD-R Windows XP Battery (electricity) Ozone hole Inkjet printer Movie projector Phonograph Sound recording Hydrogen economy Gold standard Atari 8-bit family CD recorder Carburetor Atari ST Hydrochloric acid Warez Hubble Space Telescope Digital circuit Geology of the Moon MiniDisc Hand grenade Alcohol fuel Loudspeaker Spark plug Data recovery Deforestation Pottery Nickel-cadmium battery
