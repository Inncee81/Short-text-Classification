how do i get started in light painting i have seen light painting in photographs and think it is a very interesting medium one that i would like to learn i have a digital rebel xt decent lenses mm mm image stabilized and mm macro lens and a speedlite ex flash i understand exposure aperture shutter speed iso and know pretty well how to use my camera any advice on how to get started in light painting will be appreciated hey thanks painting with light used to be really popular a decade ago although i still use it on occasion usually discretely to add a highlight to an area which is impossible to luminate with larger lights in terms of technique typically when you are painting with light you start by turning off or dimming all the lights in the studio next if you have a flash or a strobe pack you want to set it to a low setting realizing of course not all strobes are the same for mine i put it on power and i click the test button i would suggest you experiment with what flash setting works the best but the idea is not to capture every detail in the photo what you want is a very dim image what this will do of course is give you an overall but vary faint exposure from which you can work from of course when you fire the strobe the shutter on your camera has to be open although i usually use a large format or medium format camera a digital slr camera will work just the same in the case of your camera you will need to select a relatively small aperture around and then select a rather long shutter i usually find seconds sufficient but if i am painting in something rather difficult i will select a longer shutter speed perhaps around a minute or more your shutter speed is really dependant upon how strong your light source that you will be painting with for me i am using a hose master which is a fiber optic light painter you can use an led flashlight if you choose but the lightsource is usually rather strong and dispersed so i suggest you take some black tape to block some of the light and to try to make the beam more small and focused anyhow painting with light just requires a lot of experimentation even with a lot of experience doing this there really isn't any specific guide to painting with light Single-lens reflex camera Canon T90 Movie projector Leica Photographic lens Stereoscopy Bicycle lighting Aperture Panoramic photography Konica Minolta Canon EOS Stage lighting Contax Floppy disk Light-emitting diode Camera Street photography Digital camera Depth of field Macro photography F-number Film speed Gamma ray burst Cinematography Camcorder IMAX Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon Corporation Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Laser Exposure (photography) Anamorphic widescreen Shutter (photography) Film Enlarger Mouse (computing) Optical fiber Nikon FM2 DVD Aberration in optical systems Explosive material Traffic light Canon EF lens mount Eyepiece Telescope Nikon FA Canon T70 Photographic film Binoculars Lens (optics) Lighting Lightning Black hole Light Eye Nikon FE2 Sun Antenna (radio) Traditional animation Ultraviolet Oscilloscope MP3 Point and shoot camera Welding Synthetic aperture radar History of telescopes Secure Digital card Television Electrophysiology Galileo spacecraft Lightsaber PlayStation Portable Automatic number plate recognition Astronomical seeing Modelocking Nuclear explosion Red-eye effect M16 (rifle) Zoom lens NTSC USB flash drive Diffraction High-definition television Color Transmission electron microscopy Observational astronomy
