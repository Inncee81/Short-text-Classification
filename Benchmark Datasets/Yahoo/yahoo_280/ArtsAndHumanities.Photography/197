what is best lens for photographing sports have a canon rebel xt with mm lens i have a digital canon rebel xt efs mm lens mm lens mm and a mm lens i take pictures of my sons midget football team and also college football i have been looking at tube extensions and close up lenses to get some better shots any suggestions of what i could add to any of these thanks what you already have should be sufficient for the application you have a cheap solution if you need to get closer is to buy a teleconverter possible a x or a x that will increase your focal length and get you a lot closer if you're really serious about this kind of thing however you're also into big bucks the true sports photographers use dedicated telephotos mm to mm that are also fast lenses f usually the problem is that those are hellishly expensive costing several times what your camera cost which focal lengh you choose depends on how far away the action usually is from you the farther away the longer the telephoto you need you can save money by buying a slower lens f or so but that then gets you into exposure problems often forcing you to use very slow shutter speeds that result in a blurry image as to close up lenses and extension tubes those are not for sports they're for close up or macro photography they allow you to get nearer your subject so that you can get a larger image if you're interested in that too i'd prefer the extension tubes the problem with them is that you lose considerable light however in return you get crisp wonderful images close up lenses are cheaper but wil not get you a sharp image i hope that helps a little Digital photography View camera Depth of field Photographic lens Contax Cinematography Shutter speed Leica Single-lens reflex camera Eyepiece Zoom lens Canon T90 Aperture Canon EF lens mount Pinhole camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Reflecting telescope Konica Minolta Binoculars Canon FD Panoramic photography Film speed F-number Camera Schneider Kreuznach Lens (optics) Digital camera back Street photography Photographic film Aberration in optical systems Bokeh Canon EOS Computer Canon T70 Exposure (photography) Floppy disk Movie projector Charge-coupled device Fast bowling Apollo 8 History of telescopes Eye Time-lapse Film Nikon Corporation Panavision Twin-lens reflex camera Digital cinematography Stage lighting Solar power Technicolor Lighting Parallax Pornography IMAX Automatic number plate recognition Gas metal arc welding Joel and Ethan Coen Action potential Nikon FM2 Widescreen Anamorphic widescreen Car handling Black hole Confocal laser scanning microscopy Digital cinema Internal ballistics Paintball Zeiss Canon PowerShot G Diffraction CPU design Motion picture terminology Fresnel lens Advanced Photo System Dog agility Photograph Drag racing Light-emitting diode Autostereogram Microeconomics Canon EOS-300D Welding Image Amateur astronomy General relativity
