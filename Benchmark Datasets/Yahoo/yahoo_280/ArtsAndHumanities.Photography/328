come on you pros im using dr sams idea you know imitation is so we come here for something dont we there are pro forums we like also right why do i ask questions i already know the answer to or theres no really answer here to get some quality info out of the other people who know the answer also the how do i make one colour the rest black and white are ok for some but theres so many talented people here p ace karl kevin ryan diva ben evan if your not listed its just theres so many here i respect cant list you all they are wasted looking for quality questions so go on ask a question i know you know the answer but why not bounce some things around for the benefit of all go on spent five points please comments a often when i am in a professional lecture teeth not photography i will ask a question that i know the answer to just so the lecturer will not miss something that i think is important to bring out yeah i wait until he is wrapping up that particular topic but if he omitted some important information i like to ask so he can answer instead of raising my hand and saying didn't you forget to say of course if we are going to do this effectively we will have to remember to come back to certain questions a few times most likely to do this easily you can roll over the plus sign under the original question and then click on add to my personal watch list then when you log on go to your watch list under your profile and see what has been added to the discussion i think we will all find that doing this takes enough time that we will tend to not even look at those basic questions about whether someone is pretty or how to add color to a picture so we won't be annoyed by them any longer Photography Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Los Angeles Kings CPU cache Internet troll Whose Line Is It Anyway?
