what camera is used on lifetimes side order of life it's funny that i saw the show one time and she spent a lot of time in the darkroom but the promotional photo that i see on lifetimetv com shows a strap that reads just digital okay i watched the show until i saw her camera it is a nikon f with a photomic tn finder it is sometimes called the nikon f photomic the bulging finder includes the meter along with its batteries in my opinion this was the absolute worst design as far as ergonomics were concerned and i have no idea how they sold cameras oh wait they didn't sell them they gave them away seriously i borrowed one from a friend before i made my major purchase and i too kthe film out after only about shots and said thanks but no thanks the best part about the camera which is indeed an icon was that you could use nikon lenses which were indeed without equal the poor design of this camera is what drove me to pentax which is what the rest of the world was using anyway and formed a year bias against nikon Digital photography Nikon Corporation Nikon FA Camera Leica Konica Minolta Single-lens reflex camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon EOS Nikon FM2 View camera Rangefinder camera Nikon FE Canon T90 Photography Nikon FM Binoculars Pentax Nikon FE2 Advanced Photo System Photographic lens Canon Inc.
