i have two photos that have stuck to the glass of the frame and now the glass is broken how can i remove the glass without damaging the picture i've considered taking it to a professional but who a framer a photographer but thought i'd explore y a's community answer board first actually it was given to me to do by my stepdaughter who thinks i can do all things i hate to disappoint her this is a relatively common problem and there are a couple of ways that you can resolve this situation depending upon the type of print we are dealing with however if this is a unique photo for which you have no negative or file take the image to a professional who the best place to go is a preservationist at a local historical society or library larger libraries may have on their staff a archivalist preservationist who can evaluate your image and suggest the best method to fix the print i can tell you that one of the most common ways to fix the problem especially if the image is a fiber based black and white print is to immerse the photo in cold distilled water with some kodak photo flo which you can purchase at a darkroom supply store however this isn't going to be the best solution for all images especially if this is an ink jet print in fact that would be a horrible suggestion as it would destroy theprint the other method is to place the photo inside a sealed box and gradually increase the humidity inside the box until the image releases from the glass this is typically going to be the safest method but you do have to watch out about heat too much heat and the emulsion can sepparate from the paper or at the bare minimum cause some bubbling anyhow if you have no clue what kind of image this is then get an evaluation and then proceed from there also in the future i would suggest that you dont use the direct mount flush to the glass but instead use a buffer such as a archival paper matte http www lightimpressionsdirect com servlet onlineshopping Digital photography Photography Solar power Poker jargon Inkjet printer Photographic film CPU cache Software testing Printed circuit board Computer printer Stereoscopy Lighting Photographic paper View camera Konica Minolta Floppy disk Extreme Programming Microeconomics Light-emitting diode Circuit design Water Enlarger Enterprise content management Camera Philosophy of space and time Panoramic photography Inflation Movie projector Medical prescription Cross site scripting Intelligent design Prostate cancer PNG Computer virus Technicolor Tea C programming language Hubble Space Telescope JavaServer Pages World Wide Web Solar cell Cold fusion Roswell UFO incident AmigaOS Film preservation Alexander Technique Drawing Warez Windows Vista Trademark Action potential Macro photography Alcohol fuel Carbon dioxide Linked list Nuclear power Theodicy Gramophone record Drill bit C-41 process Opportunity rover Expert system Principal-agent problem Brewery Rendering (computer graphics) Objective-C Common Unix Printing System Ethics PaX Physical paradox Naval mine Energy development Renewable energy Printing press IMAX Electrophysiology Heinkel He 112 Baseball Crossword Hydroponics Collodion process Color Computer Theory of conduct Pretty Good Privacy Edward S.
