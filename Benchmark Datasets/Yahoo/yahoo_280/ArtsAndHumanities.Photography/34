any photgraphy hints i just started in a journalist class and i am the photographer for the school newspaper and i dont really feel like my teacher is expecting to much and doesnt really think that i can come up with some really good shots so i wanted to impress him and prove him wronge i love photography and want to persue it outside of school to so i was looking for some hints and tips so getting a really great shot hi ash if photography really gets ahold of you you'll probably find it won't let go for the rest of your life if you are using the schools camera make arrangements to use it outside of whatever they consider the normal times if you have your own cool you're good to go i'm going to assume digital here get a good basic book on photography to get the basics down exposure metering how to read the histogram and using the camera's controls shutter iso aperture the public library can be a good resource and the 'for dummies' series would be good here a very good book is essential skills 'location photography' by mark galer published by focal press you might have to order that one from amazon a school photographer generally shoots school events including sports and candids on or near campus for sports you'll want to use the 'motor' drive on the camera and shoot through the action by that i mean you'll press the shutter just before the peak action and release it just after you'll also be doing what is known as panning which is where you follow the subject with the camera while shooting the books should explain how this is done why this is done and how you can use it creatively it's a learned skill and will need to be practiced for candids well there are lots of ways to do those you will be looking for images that actually say something besides this person was here doing that or talking to that person here is where the internet can really help you look up the works of various photojournalists online and see what went into the impact of their images a suggested list is w eugene smith he heavily influenced my style margaret bourke white robert cappa henri cartier bresson and there are many others good resources are the associated press photo archives and the time magazine archives you can use google images and search for images coming from those and many other news organizations what's important is not the images themselves but how the photographer captured it so that it makes a statement you won't be able to copy their images but you can start putting together the elements they used to create impact into your own shooting lighting composition and the moment start taking pictures and give yourself assignments it doesn't matter what the assignments are they could be anything but they need a theme and it should be something that people can react to this will help you become sensitive to the 'moment' and recognize it take lots of pictures and i mean lots a to per assignment you give yourself is very reasonable you want to do two things with your pictures for the ones that work you want to study them to find out why they work the ones that don't work are even more valuable those are the ones you will really learn from you won't remember this none of us do but you learned to walk by falling on your butt and then figuring out what to try next and going for it it's exactly the same here keep a notebook of all your shots date time camera settings and what the goals of the shots were photojournalism involves a lot of luck what makes for good to great pictures is when luck presents you with an opportunity and you have prepared yourself to take advantage of it also there is something else you need to be aware of and that is the shooting ratio that is the number of images you take to the number of images that are really worth considering for an experienced photog that ratio maybe ten 'bad' images to each good one this is for shooting under all and very differing conditions a sports photographer who really knows the sport they are covering probably get get to three bad shots for every good one the point is that you can't get great or even good shots even most of the time in this type of photography beginners beat themselves up over this and they shouldn't the great photos you see are the successfull ones picked from all the less successfull ones taken and it may be thousands secret nobody cares about the bad pictures try an approach something like i have outlined here and you just may surprise your teacher and yourself repeat secret take lots of pictures best to you vance Street photography
