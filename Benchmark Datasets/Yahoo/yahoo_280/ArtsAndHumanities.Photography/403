regarding f stops shutter speeds i'm reading a book about photography questions are bugging me right now how do you say pronounce f stops e g for f is it ef slash two point eight ef over two point eight or ef two point eight one other book i read omits the slash how do you say pronounce shutter speeds e g for is it one over one hundred twenty five one slash one hundred twenty five or one over one hundred twenty fifth can a professional photographer serious amateur photographer knowledgable person answer me please thanks i'm quite surprised that none of my photography books i have several of them now describes the correct way of saying it or any of the answers below for that matter i used to say f in any manner that i feel like i guess real life does differ from textbook i wish i could pick all of you guys as best answers thanks god bless i'm in the usa and i say it like allan leave out the point as everyone knows what you mean ef two eight instead of ef two point eight ef eight instead of ef eight point zero leave out the hundred if there are already enough numbers to let others know what you mean one twenty fifth instead of one one hundred and twenty fifth haha is kind of problematic now that i think of it with digital cameras you can get almost any shutter speed so would be possible in traditional shutter speeds though it would be one twenty fifth as there is no longer a but one five hunredth instead of one five or one fifth since there is not enough information contained in the over abbreviated way of saying it leave of of a second hysterical historical note i have seen older cameras that do have and shutter speeds such as an exa so be careful when you talk about shutter speeds with them Photography Digital photography Shutter speed Exposure (photography) Leica Single-lens reflex camera F-number View camera Canon T90 Stereoscopy Camera Nikon FM2 Floppy disk Acronym and initialism Rangefinder camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital camera International Phonetic Alphabet Eastman Kodak Movie projector Science Time-lapse Charge-coupled device Konica Minolta Film speed Shutter (photography) Theory of conduct Surveillance Nikon FA Photographic film Aperture 0 (number) Napier's bones Automatic number plate recognition Password Morse Code Canon EOS Crossword English plural Photographic lens Year of the Spider Closed-circuit television Nikon FE Street photography Digital Canon PowerShot G American and British English differences A Course In Miracles Expert system Fast bowling Pinhole camera Road-rule enforcement camera Cinematographer Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Pipe organ Supernatural Infant baptism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Photograph Reciprocity (photography) Bluetooth Holography Copy protection Cinerama Paul Is Dead Exponentiation Tetragrammaton Aesthetic Realism Enlarger Contax Modem Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Nikon FE2 Shutter angle Mojave people Scientology beliefs and practices Lisp programming language Computer Reflecting telescope Speech synthesis Philosophy of space and time Wheel of Fortune John Titor Traditional animation Medium format Game show Philosophy of language Canon T70 Socrates Color temperature Macro photography Shroud of Turin Cinematography Now You See It Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Black hole Exchangeable image file format The Hobbit Young Earth creationism
