help i have a question about my dell latitude cpi ok here is the deal my friend gave me her old dell latitude cpi laptop she said the thing was too old and could get it too work well recently i have gotten it to work somewhat i defragmented it cleaned up the registry ran virus spyware worm and adware software the cpu usage was but after all of that i got it down to between and the thing only has gigs of harddrive space in it and of those gigs are used up i checked and there are virtually no other files on there so whats eating up all the memory besides the factory software thats on it i e the os and such im going to try and get on the internet with it today thanks guys is the drive gb capacity or that is just the partition you re in unless you have re partitioned and re formatted the drive likely there is a hidden partition where dell stores system tools installation and recovery files you may also want to set up explorer to display system and hidden files explorer tools option view this way you should be able to see folders and files that are normally hidden from view lastly you may want to check the size of your virtual memory control panel system advanced options performance configuration advanced options virtual memory change i would set it to about twice the physical memory in both the maximum and minimum hope this helps Windows XP Windows 2000 Virtual memory Spyware File Allocation Table Computer virus Hard disk Windows Vista File system Microsoft Windows Partition (computing) Windows registry CPU cache Mac OS X Malware USB flash drive Embedded system Computer Booting Floppy disk NTFS Domain Name System Central processing unit Kazaa Xbox 360 Knoppix System/36 Rootkit Blue screen of death Defragmentation Btrieve Trusted computing NX bit 64-bit PlayStation Portable Apple Macintosh Enterprise content management IBM PC compatible Mozilla Firefox Apple typography Internet Explorer Library (computer science) Windows Explorer Control Panel (Windows) Mach kernel Mouse (computing) Super Nintendo Entertainment System Intel iAPX 432 Operating system Bluetooth Laptop IBM PC Motorola 68000 PC Engine IPod Apollo Guidance Computer Digital audio player Xerox Star X86 Stopping e-mail abuse ITunes Emacs Digital circuit DragonFly BSD Computer forensics Macintosh Finder Creative Zen Sega Dreamcast PlayStation 3 Apple II family Computer bus Mod (computer gaming) Computer surveillance Oracle database Unicode Whois Page replacement algorithms Computer storage Digital Equipment Corporation Surveillance Mandriva Linux AOL Instant Messenger Fritz-chip Objective-C Java programming language Novell NetWare
