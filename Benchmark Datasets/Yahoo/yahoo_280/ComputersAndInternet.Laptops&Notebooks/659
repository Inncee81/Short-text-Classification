my laptop is running really slowly and i only just formatted it help i have formatted my laptop many times before but now my computer is just so slow its slow in the way that it played youtube videos perfectly didnt ever need to wait to load now when videos load it stops and starts about every second when i drag a window it is nowhere near smooth its very choppy please help i've installed all the drivers that came on the driver recovery cd these drivers have worked fine in the part on previous re installs i suspect that after you reformatted your computer you forgot to install the latest graphics drivers for your computer do you know what graphics card you have if you have a laptop or a low end pc with a graphics card built right into the mother board then typically the drivers are provided on the website of whomever manufactures your computer so if you have a dell laptop go to dell's website go to their support page specify your model and operating system and then download and install the latest graphics drivers if you have a desktop with a separate graphics card that you had installed onto your mother board then you'll need to get the latest drivers from the graphics card provider which will typically be either nvidia www nvidia com then select download drivers from the front page or ati www ati com then select drivers and software from the front page i hope that works for you gl ATI Technologies Radeon IBM PC compatible Windows Vista OpenGL Windows XP Apple Macintosh Linux Mac OS X History of Microsoft Windows GeForce 6 Series Graphics card IPod Windows 2000 AmigaOS USB flash drive 3dfx Graphics processing unit GeForce 4 DirectX Microsoft Windows Laptop Teletext Object Desktop PlayStation 2 Hard disk Universal Serial Bus Blue screen of death Floppy disk Windows 3.x X Window System Vertex and pixel shaders H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Apple IIGS OS/2 Atari ST Musical Instrument Digital Interface Bluetooth OpenBSD Nintendo Revolution GeForce 2 Knoppix Mouse (computing) QuickDraw 3D SUSE Linux MDAC Portable Document Format Common Unix Printing System PostScript Computer software PCI Express Video Graphics Array Counter-Strike Commodore 64 Windows Server 2003 Windows Me Computer virus GeForce FX BIOS Apple Computer Spyware Digital audio player Wi-Fi PlayStation 3 Macromedia Flash TRS-80 Color Computer Opera (web browser) TRS-80 Game programming DOS Apple II family Silicon Graphics Library (computer science) History of operating systems Sun Microsystems Autodesk Media and Entertainment Radeon X Series Shader Commodore International Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Windows Mobile ITunes System 7 (Macintosh) LiveCD Microprocessor Timeline of computing 1990-forward Screenshot 3D computer graphics
