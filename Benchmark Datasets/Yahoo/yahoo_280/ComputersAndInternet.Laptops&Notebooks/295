my toshiba laptop doesn't want to start up what's wrong with it when it's running my laptop works fine and doesn't seem particularly quirky but when i shut it down it doesn't want to wake up it will wake up from standby and hibernate but it often has trouble going into those modes and instead freezes up and then i have to shut it down anyway and whenever i shut it down i get a blank screen at start up the screen is clearly lit but it's just black if i plug in an external monitor it just shows me the toshiba start up screen but doesn't do anything so i just keep turning it off and turning it back on again until it finally works sometimes it takes hours to work but once it starts working it will stay working until i shut it down again and then it won't restart if it helps i believe i had over heating problems when my fan got blocked up with lint i cleared that out and the fan works better now but i think this may have fried something so what's wrong with my laptop you need to get the computer store let them take a look if tyhey say it wont start up then they will say i have to fix and you need to pay order to get it fixs Laptop Windows XP IBM PC compatible Universal Serial Bus Halting problem Thermal power station IPod Liquid crystal display Embedded system Escape from New York Bob and George Floppy disk Commodore 64 Commodore International Blue screen of death Screenshot Apollo Guidance Computer Color PowerBook Piccolo Junior Saga Atari ST Palm OS Mouse (computing) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Oscilloscope Toyota Prius Winning Streak Rose (Doctor Who) Toshiba Nuclear reactor Coming of Age (TNG episode) Thermostat Carburetor Personal computer Virtual memory Opera (web browser) System/36 System/34 Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Dance Dance Revolution Lithium ion battery Friends Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Atari 8-bit family Bluetooth The Price Is Right Computer forensics Indianapolis 500 New York Giants Surveillance Screensaver Ben Johnson (athlete) Sinclair ZX81 Cell (microprocessor) Timeline of computing 1990-forward 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Miss Saigon Hybrid vehicle Desktop computer The Arsenal of Freedom (TNG episode) Mega Man VII Secure Digital card Booting Computer animation AmigaOS Flash memory Reading spark plugs for racing CPU design ReBoot Shaggy dog story The Prisoner Smalltalk Public Eye Oplan Bojinka Sonic the Hedgehog Knight Rider Saved by the Bell C programming language Hewlett-Packard HAL 9000 InterCity Express Satchel Paige Game Boy Top League Game Boy Advance SP PowerBook G4 2003 North America blackout History of Microsoft Windows Bad Wolf Nuclear power Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Futurama (TV series - season 4) Vacuum tube Prostate cancer Apple Computer Futurama (TV series - season 5) Poker jargon Sega Dreamcast Apollo 13
