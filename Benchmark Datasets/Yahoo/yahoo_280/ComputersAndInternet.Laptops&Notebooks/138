arrgh should i buy a dell i was so set on getting an inspiron w gb ram gb hard drive and was getting used to the idea of vista not being a total piece of crap and would work for me but now i am having second thoughts because the more i research dell the more confusing it gets my desk top is a dell and i've never had a problem but everything seems to say dell is nothing but problems before i settled on dell i was looking at toshiba notebooks and they seemed decent would i be better off buying one of these can anyone offer any advice i really don't think that you should get a dell they are very unreliable they have the worst support and hardware i honestly think you should get a macbook or macbook pro they are a lot more reliable computers and i must say apple has quality hardware my old dell laptop was always giving me trouble and i always had to hide my frustration to my parents because they spend on my dell laptop and i couldn't let them see me get frustrated then i saw the macbook pro laptop and it was around also and i immediately wanted that computer i saw the difference in quality my old dell computer had to the new macbook pro from apple apple truly does make excellent hardware ms dell must be getting paid from dell to convince us to buy from dell and saying that dell is made of the highest quality i say go with a macbook IBM PC compatible Laptop Floppy disk Apple Macintosh Windows XP PowerBook Mouse (computing) Hewlett-Packard History of Microsoft Windows Commodore International IMac IBook Personal computer Copy protection Desktop computer Apple II family Timeline of computing 1990-forward Dell, Inc.
