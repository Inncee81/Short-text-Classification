if you have a laptop do you have to have wireless internet or can you just use your regular internet instead i am getting ready to purchase a laptop computer but i dont want to have to get wireless internet and all that stuff right now so can i still use my regular internet dsl instead i'm thinking yeah but i just wanted to ask before i bought a new computer you could use both depending on the configuration and set up you have and also depends on your preferance if you have previously had an internet connection then buying a new laptop would not change the existing set up you could use the new laptop with the existing internet connection just as long as you have the modem no hassle just plug it in the way you used to do of course having the option to go wireless is much more convenient you can connect practically anywhere even in the shower though i wouldn't recommend you to do so if one day you decided you want to get rid of all the cables just go buy yourself a wireless router and plug your dsl to it Digital Subscriber Line Wi-Fi Universal Serial Bus Wireless LAN Laptop Router Internet Cable television Bluetooth Mouse (computing) Television IEEE 802.11 Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Cisco Systems Windows XP Computer hardware Mobile ad-hoc network Internet service provider USB flash drive Personal computer Telephone exchange Differentiated services Asynchronous Transfer Mode Telegraphy IBM PC compatible HomePNA Power line communication Computer bus Ethernet IBook AirPort Netfilter/iptables Acorn Computers WiMAX Desktop computer EarthLink Internet cafe Wireless mesh network IMac PlayStation Portable Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Softmodem Multiplayer Local area network Texas Instruments Nintendo Revolution Wardriving Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Hotspot (wifi) Wireless access point Secure Digital card Surveillance Telephone Atari 8-bit family Wireless Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Advanced Technology Attachment ITU-T Xbox RS-232 Verizon Wireless Cable modem Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Video on demand Jack plug GSM services Computer keyboard Computer and video games BS 1363 Xbox 360 Nintendo DS Computer network Voice over IP Floppy disk Prodigy (ISP) Denial-of-service attack Internet fraud Copy protection Internet Group Management Protocol Alcatel Autonomous building Bell Labs Federal Standard 1037C Computer surveillance PlayStation 2 Wireless Application Protocol Embedded system Eircom MAC address LAN party Network address translation America Online Personal area network Integrated Services Digital Network AT&T Hewlett-Packard
