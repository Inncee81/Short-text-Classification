mixing pc and pc ram i need to upgrade the ram on my laptop a compaq evo from its current mb pc i had a couple of pc memory boards on an old broken thinkpad t laptop so i thought i'd try these i'm not really bothered about speed as i only use it for word and web but i expected to maybe get a few odd problems until i go out and buy some pc but the machine wouldn't even boot up not even a screen to tell me that i'm not allowed to do that nothing so naturally i'm worried that there may be some other factor at play maybe different types of ram any factors i should be aware of before i shell out for charles the motherboard of the t was damaged but the ram seemed to be ok the motherboard on the evo is fine the additional memory i borrowed from the t is double sided and only mb for each stick so i am well under the maximum limit for the evo the evo memory is also double sided i didn't realise that single double sided was an issue since catalogues don't list this aspect strangely the evo won't start if it has only the pc memory so the problem is not mixing it's just that the evo doesn't like pc i then tried a mb pc from an even older computer leaving the original mb inside and the evo won't start with that either it seems that the evo really doesn't like pc at all pc pc should be compatible just know that the memory will clock down to the slower speed the only things i can think of that may be causing you problems would be if the number of pins on the memory modules is different from one another probably shouldn't be with that type of memory the pc modules may be bad take out your pc and try booting with just the pc in if it won't boot the memory is likely your problem if it boots fine with the pc that will confirm it the combination of the two memories is more than your systems capacity i tried looking on crucial com but couldn't find the systems in question i would check the manufacturer website for more details IBM PC compatible Hard disk IBM PC Laptop Atari ST Floppy disk USB flash drive Universal Serial Bus Atari 8-bit family Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis AMD Random access memory ZX Spectrum IA-32 TRS-80 Computer virus Windows XP Windows 2000 CPU cache Super Nintendo Entertainment System PC Engine Overclocking Computer bus Windows Vista Nintendo Entertainment System Commodore 128 MSX DVD Apple II family Oscilloscope PowerBook Atari 2600 Redundant array of independent disks Advanced Technology Attachment Cray-1 Timeline of computing 1990-forward TRS-80 Color Computer PowerPC PlayStation 3 PlayStation 2 ATI Technologies RISC Upper Memory Area CPU design Amiga Apple IIGS Sinclair ZX81 Poker jargon Computer Mouse (computing) Slot machine Ethernet Apollo Guidance Computer INMOS Transputer History of Microsoft Windows Motorola 68000 Burroughs B5000 Data General Nova Cyrix Linux Perl Moore's law Video Graphics Array Cray-2 Digital circuit Booting System/36 Datatype File Allocation Table DR-DOS IBook Acorn Electron DDR2 SDRAM Pentium 4 Surveillance Wintel Spring operating system SAM Coup__ Digital photography Virtual memory Desktop computer Nintendo Revolution RS-232 IMac MOS Technology PC motherboard IBM Personal System/2 Sound Blaster Modchip 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines
