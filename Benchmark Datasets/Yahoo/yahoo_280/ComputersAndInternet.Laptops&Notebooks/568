opinions should i keep a laptop with no warranty my father has bought a new laptop it's pretty decent has long battery life was told it was hrs unsure about that though vista dvd recorder etc i'd like to use it for classes due to the battery life unfortunately my father got it at a bargain deal that's all he'll ever shop for and the warranty is estimated at about the cost of the laptop itself due to this my father said he won't take out a warranty on it i feel uncomfortable with saving important files on a laptop that i'll be carrying around knowing that if something happens to it then that'll be it my father who never uses computers doesn't understand my concern with saving files onto a computer that he says we can just throw away if it breaks your opinions should i refuse to use it or try it out i'm not accident prone or anything like that but i figure there's always bound to be a problem occur update i m not complaining i am merely being precautious there is a big difference between the two most warrantees arent that great anyway you can store your work on discs or memory sticks keep the lt and just use it senseably no games music pics Laptop IBM PC compatible Digital photography Warranty PlayStation Portable Best Buy MiniDisc IPod PlayStation 3 USB flash drive Theory of conduct Mouse (computing) IBook Digital rights management Computer virus Computer forensics Radeon Computer PowerBook Apple Macintosh Hard disk Windows Vista Floppy disk Battery (electricity) Gramophone record UK Singles Chart Flash memory Bluetooth Blu-ray Disc GunZ The Duel CPU cache Oplan Bojinka PlayStation 2 Digital audio player Universal Serial Bus Pretty Good Privacy Game Boy Advance SP Lithium ion battery Ty Cobb Mac OS X DVD Verizon Wireless Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Inside PowerBook G3 Grey market Loss leader 1957 World Series Copyleft Implied warranty Apple Computer C programming language Laserdisc F-16 Fighting Falcon TurboGrafx 16 Computer and video games Walkman Scenes from a Memory Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Nintendo Revolution Password (video games) Business process reengineering John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Knoppix Karaoke Internet Disk image Appeal Microeconomics Annuity Initial D Copy protection Virtual memory MP3 ITunes Newsgroup Surveillance Microsoft Windows PowerBook G4 Saturday Night Live InterCity Express Earth Girl Arjuna Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Deed Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina ITunes Music Store Eddie Guerrero ATI Technologies Friends Digital circuit Big Brother (USA TV series) CD recorder PNG Embedded system Gaia Online Toyota Prius Final Fantasy XI Tamper resistance
