mac vs pc for a high school student i am looking to buy a laptop for the beginning of th grade and was wondering should i go with a mac or a pc the computer that i would be getting would be around the same price so that isnt an issue but i was wondering what laptop would be the best in terms of running office programs surfing the web multimedia stability and ease to use bic gives sound advice but i have to give thumbs up to a mac it doesn't matter what your school uses your mac can access any windows or mac files if your school is wireless you can access it if it uses etherenet cables you can get on line what you won't be doing is hopefully passing any viruses along macs do not get viruses or malware etc but they can forward a virus on to someone in an email on a macbook you'll get everything you need except maybe a better word processor just buy an educational version of word or office or get a copy of open office Computer virus Mac OS X Apple Macintosh Windows XP Microsoft Windows IBM PC compatible Microsoft Office Malware Microsoft Mac OS X v10.4 History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Word Kazaa Spyware Laptop IPod Anti-virus software Mouse (computing) Operating system Filename extension Gmail HyperCard Windows 3.x Personal computer Mac OS Windows Vista Apple Computer Screenshot OS/2 Opera (web browser) IMac Linux Wi-Fi System 7 (Macintosh) Computer and video games Portable Document Format Peer-to-peer E-mail spam WordPerfect AmigaOS Apple II family Universal Serial Bus Computer forensics Internet Trojan horse (computing) Macromedia Flash Password NeXT Mydoom Windows 2000 Mach kernel Bluetooth Emacs Logo programming language Hard disk OpenBSD Perl PowerBook X Window System Sun Microsystems Trusted computing Windows 95 Windows Server 2003 QuickTime Mac OS 9 Digital rights management TRS-80 Macintosh Finder PowerPC ILOVEYOU Common criticisms of Microsoft Java programming language Pretty Good Privacy WebObjects Timeline of hacker history Rootkit Mac OS history IBook Skype Microsoft Excel PDP-11 Mozilla Firefox File format Stopping e-mail abuse Comparison of web browsers E-mail Amiga AppleWorks Tungsten Handheld FullWrite Professional MIPS architecture ITunes Secure Shell World Wide Web Windows registry Outlook Express WiMAX
