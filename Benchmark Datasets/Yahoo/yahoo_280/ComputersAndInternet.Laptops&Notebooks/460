what is the difference between these two processors amd turiontm x dual core mobile technology tl ghz k and amd turion x dual core mobile processor tl ghz k is the second really that much better than the first is there a difference between dual core mobile technology and dual core mobile processor would it be worth the to purchase the second over the first they are from the same dual core mobile cpu from amd the tl is a lower end cpu compare to the tl only mhz difference which you can overcome by overclock the tl to match the tl aside from that they're identical i don't think that the difference should worth though Pentium 4 AMD Athlon Celeron Athlon 64 Pentium M Opteron Overclocking Central processing unit Duron VIA C3 Xeon PowerPC Dual-core Radeon Apple Intel transition Laptop Pentium D Sempron PC motherboard Clock rate PR rating AMD64 Athlon 64 X2 CPU electrical consumption Front side bus CPU cache GeForce 6 Series VIA Technologies ATI Technologies 64-bit Cell (microprocessor) MIPS architecture Pentium PlayStation 3 Cyrix RISC ThinkPad IMac Nintendo Revolution X86 NX bit AMD K6-III Sun Microsystems AMD K6 Itanium 2 PowerPC G4 Power Mac G5 NVIDIA ARM architecture PlayStation 2 Hyper-threading AMD K6-2 HyperTransport IBM PC compatible MOS Technology 6502 Data General Nova Pentium II Northbridge (computing) ZX Spectrum X86 assembly language PowerBook G4 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PowerBook Amateur radio NForce2 Windows Vista Conroe ZigBee Transistor 3dfx CPU design Montecito NForce4 Am386 GeForce 7 Series Embedded system IBook Telephone Xbox 360 EMac IA-64 Benchmark (computing) IA-32 IBM POWER Computer Software-defined radio DDR2 SDRAM Risc PC Graphics processing unit Integrated circuit Field-programmable gate array CDC 6600 IBM PC
