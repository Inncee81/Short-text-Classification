can i do this ok i am about to buy a dell inspiron laptop b c its cheap so when i do that can i buy the new mac osx and put it on the dell the reason i want to do this is cuz the apple computers cost so much and i like them but i dont think i can afford it here are the tech specs prosessor amd sempron gb sata hard drive x cd burner dvd combo drive whr cell lithium ion battery video card ati radeon xpress mb hyper memory wireless card dell wireless g mini card lol no this is why macs are so good they can run windows they have no known viruses for g s they are quick and easy but they are very expensive it'll be a long time before companies like dell hp can run mac operating systems and one more thing it isn't the actual physical computer that makes apple computers expensive everything you need is already installed including software to make movies music download songs surf the net type documents make spreadsheets and mostly everything else did i mention malicious software developers haven't yet been able to make a virus that can infect a mac if you were somehow able to install x or x on a dell all you would have is a mac operating system with none of the cool programs it comes with by the time you spent money on programs that cost money and downloaded the programs that are free you would of spent as much if not more than buying a mac and you could have been able to save enough to buy a mac in that amount of time sorry but right now its impossible but cheers to you for wondering as i can see you are learning more and more about computers and their operating systems Apple Macintosh Mac OS X Windows XP ATI Technologies Laptop Floppy disk Apple II family Apple Computer Radeon IPod Computer Mac mini IMac Microsoft Windows Linux Personal computer IBook Windows Vista Computer and video games PowerBook Universal Serial Bus Operating system PlayStation 3 Malware NeXT Anti-virus software Hard disk EMac Computer forensics Amiga Microsoft Mac OS X v10.4 The Sims 2 AMD64 Embedded system Mach kernel USB flash drive HyperCard Digital audio player Atari ST Spyware Trusted computing Wi-Fi Computer workstation Verizon Wireless Commodore 64 Xbox QuickTime Microsoft Office 64-bit OpenGL Library (computer science) Digital rights management OpenOffice.org Screenshot Supercomputer Nintendo Mouse (computing) ITunes Music Store Skype Stardock Wintel Digital photography Forth programming language Apple Intel transition Berkeley Software Distribution Thread (computer science) Microsoft Excel Atari 8-bit family File system PowerBook G4 LiveCD IBM PC Common criticisms of Microsoft High-definition television BASIC programming language Mac OS 9 RISC Macintosh Finder Blue screen of death Outsourcing AmigaOS WordPerfect History of operating systems
