laptop problems hey so ive been having problems with a dell laptop where when it is plugged in if you jiggle the cord where it touches the charger the computer can turn on but the problem is whenever the computer turns on you hear it whirring loudly for a few seconds screen still black and then it gets really quiet screen still black and then it makes a quick beep and turns off i have tried repeatedly without success to make it work again but it keeps turning off it is all charged up too is there a way i can fix and preferably without buying anything also i cant get a new laptop and dont want my parents aware of it if thats possible also should i keep trying to get it to work because one day it did work but when i was using it it glitched and then i had to turn it off wtopped working again here's what i guess happened you went for coffee at school near work downtown wherever the day after everything stops working at that shop your laptop was plugged into the wall if they had an espresso machine or a coffee grinder and it was on the same circuit you just fried your motherboard if it was not on the same circuit but the lights dimmed in the restaurant you just drained your battery i saw this happen or times at the cafe where i worked for you to determine which one it may be start simple change places where you plug it in replace the battery then the bios once you get to the motherboard it's time to buy a new computer because if you fried your motherboard there is a good chance that you fried other parts on a laptop this is not always true of a desktop in this case since you can jiggle the cord and it works it is probably like every other piece of electronic equipment a short in the wire or a loose connector since i assume you are not comfortable breaking into your computer either call on the warranty service or call a local repair person if it's a bad wire then they can sell you a new battery pack if it's a connector then that needs to be fixed before you try it again bad connectors fire hazard before you do anything though check to see if you are under warranty IPod IBM PC compatible Universal Serial Bus Oscilloscope Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Windows XP Computer bus Embedded system Commodore 64 PowerBook Personal computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Battery electric vehicle Surveillance Ethernet Desktop computer Jack plug Battery (electricity) BS 1363 IBM PC Atari ST Nintendo Entertainment System USB flash drive Floppy disk Spark plug Capacitor plague Computer Microprocessor FireWire Peripheral Component Interconnect D-subminiature Hard disk Hearing aid Advanced Technology Attachment STS-61 Warranty Telephone exchange Digital circuit Television Sinclair ZX81 Debugging X10 (industry standard) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Enigma machine Liquid crystal display Switch RS-232 Circuit design Toyota Prius IBook Thermal power station Wheel of Fortune Cathode ray tube Kaypro Atari 8-bit family Mouse (computing) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Lighting Wi-Fi Residual-current device Overclocking Nintendo DS Commodore 128 Canon T90 Hewlett-Packard ATX Windows 2000 Amiga Vacuum tube AT form factor Coffeehouse Whose Line Is It Anyway?
