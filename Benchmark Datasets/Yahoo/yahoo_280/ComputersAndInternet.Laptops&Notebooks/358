where should i buy my laptop tommorrow bestbuy or circuit city the laptop and price are identical at bth places i've had favorable experiences with both of them but ive bought a lot more stuff from best buy then again ive never bought anything worth before at either store any recommendations why first of all the laptop has gb of ram gb harddrive ghz intel core duo t six usb ports which i need a lot of and and an embedded webcam and fingerprint reader not that i care much about the last two but i think its cool and i do think its worth it nd i wish i knew someone i could trust to build a laptop and not get ripped off third i am an intensive gamer im into gametap games and my current laptop cant handle the load because its too cheap plus im tired of my laptop running so slow because of how cheap it is im also going to start learning computer programming and graphics design so yes i do think its relative to my needs in my experience it's a lot easier to buy and return things at circuit city that's where i've bought most of my electronics for the past year on the flip side however best buy has a lot more cute friendly girls working there that always like to talk to you so i'd have to say bb because of the chicks IBM PC compatible Hard disk IMac Computer Apple Macintosh PowerPC Laptop Floppy disk Universal Serial Bus Xbox 360 USB flash drive ATI Technologies CPU design Bluetooth PlayStation 3 Embedded system Timeline of computing 1990-forward Microprocessor RISC Pentium M Windows Vista Windows XP IPod Mac OS X IBook Commodore International PlayStation 2 PlayStation Portable Athlon Surveillance Mouse (computing) Personal computer PC Engine Microcontroller Atari 2600 Random access memory Apple Intel transition Celeron Pentium 4 PC motherboard AMD ZX Spectrum Central processing unit Cell (microprocessor) ThinkPad Secure Digital card Printed circuit board Best Buy Flash memory Radeon Linux Apple Computer Nintendo Revolution CPU cache Nintendo Entertainment System GeForce 4 Integrated circuit RFID Atari 8-bit family Desktop computer Computer bus Xbox Burroughs B5000 Computer and video games Lisp programming language Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Digital photography Lithium ion battery Oscilloscope Commodore 64 IBM Hydrogen economy Sound Blaster DVD NeXT MIPS architecture Sega Saturn Computer hardware MAME CDC 6600 Atari ST RS-232 Digital circuit History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital rights management Overclocking Acorn Electron MOS Technology Sinclair ZX81 Hewlett-Packard Intel Nintendo GameCube Internet TurboGrafx 16
