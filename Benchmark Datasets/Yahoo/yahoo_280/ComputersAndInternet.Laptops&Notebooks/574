how can i find out the clock speed of my video ram on my laptop i have a laptop with a nvidia geforce m gt with video ram please do not get this confused with system ram i want to know if this is ddr memory or gddr memory and the best way for me to do that is to figure out either the clock speed on it should either be mhz or mhz or the bandwidth on it should be gb s or gb s this is for a laptop so i know a lot of programs will not tell me the correct information because they are designed for a desktop thanks no its not i've actually read through those forums before and have heard about all the dell problems combatid nvidia does a very strange thing for this video card they let the manufacture decide on what kind of video ram to use so there are mb versions mb versions and even mb versions this also lets the manufacture decide on the type of ram to use so any of these could be ddr or gddr each of which have different performances if i am not mistaken ddr cannot handle being clocked higher than mhz and gddr higher than mhz i am trying to figure out if i have ddr gddr or a underclocked version of one of those ok i did a search for you but the results are a little odd i could not find a nvidia geforce m gt with m video ram but i did find a mb version the links are below you could also try downloading a free program called pc wizard at http www cpuid org i am sure that under the video summary it will give you all the correct specs on the card installed good luck ATI Technologies NVIDIA PlayStation 3 PowerPC GeForce 4 DDR2 SDRAM GeForce 2 DDR SDRAM GeForce FX GeForce 6 Series Xbox Overclocking Laptop Commodore 64 Windows Vista Bluetooth GeForce 256 Atari ST PlayStation 2 IMac Pentium 4 IBM PC compatible PCI Express Dynamic random access memory OpenGL PowerBook GeForce 3 MOS Technology 6502 Commodore 128 IBM PC Super Nintendo Entertainment System Timeline of computing 1990-forward CPU cache Random access memory Windows XP Xbox 360 GeForce 7 Series Graphics card Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME CPU design Computer Universal Serial Bus Atari 8-bit family Celeron Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis TRS-80 Dance Dance Revolution HyperTransport Cyrix USB flash drive RDRAM Cell (microprocessor) VIA Technologies Northbridge (computing) World of Warcraft Pentium M Apple II family Computer bus IBook Nintendo GameCube NForce EMac Supercomputer NForce2 Mac OS X Windows 2000 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Wi-Fi Athlon 64 Graphics processing unit Floppy disk OpenBSD Nintendo Entertainment System Motorola 68000 Hard disk AMD DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX PC Engine The Sims 2 Radio Power Macintosh G3 Windows Mobile Central processing unit Front side bus Opteron Rambus TI-83 series Read-only memory Xeon Oscilloscope StepMania IPod
