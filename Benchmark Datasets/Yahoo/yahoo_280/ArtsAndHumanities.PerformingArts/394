flute help when i play a g on my flute it comes out sharp or doesnt come out at all is a spring loose or something if anyone knows whats wrong with my flute please tell me thanks the previous three answers are clearly from people who have no idea how a flute works even the band director if the g is not working then clearly you have a leak above the g you would not have to write in to this list if it was the g key with the spring unattached it would be flopping the spring is so buried in the mechanism it would have had to rust thru and break off not be unhooked the foot joint is miles away from this problem rolling the headjoint in and out is just plain stupid the number one adjustments problem on student flutes in the b flat your b flat hole or a key is probably not closing well enough sure you can get an a but anything lower forget it it's most obvious on the g since that is a note that is close by any possible airiness in tone and lower notes will still speak well enough sometimes depending on the severity of the leak try the b flat with rh on the f key and your thumb not on the b flat key on the back is it still not good do you have to squeeze if your complaint was of notes higher on the left hand stack then i would guess an unhooked trill key but your complaint is with g so i maintain that it is the key that you never touch between c and a or the a key i am a professional flutist and teacher since and woodwind judge for competitions statewide in ny i have not read any posts about flute in months from an authority better than me except trouchpet who i know professionally betcha if she writes in she has the same take on this Flute Western concert flute Harp Drill bit Embouchure Tin whistle Bassoon Recorder Menstrual cup Poker jargon Marching band Professional wrestling holds Timpani Transposing instrument Bagpipes Harmonica Floppy disk Native American music Saxophone The Emancipation of Mimi 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Violin Double bass Trombone Fast bowling March (music) Woodwind instrument Major scale Ney Education in the People's Republic of China Social rule Horizontal bar Carburetor Tire M16 (rifle) Tonality Equine conformation U.S. presidential election, 2000 Atomic Kitten Spark plug King Crimson Golf Glossary of American football Mario Davidovsky Blues Glossary of climbing terms Goldberg Variations Opportunity rover Originalism Karl Rove Scientology beliefs and practices Alexander Technique Walter Piston Big band Pretty Good Privacy Harmonic series (music) Windows XP C.G.
