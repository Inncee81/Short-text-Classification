i want to become a musical director composer apprentice help i just recently gave her a note explaining that i really admire her and everything she does i really want to become her apprentice but i am not sure how to approach this i understand that i may be too young i am still considered a adolescent i hold the highest respect for her i actually fear her maybe that explains how much respect i hold for her if this makes any difference at all this is a christain theater company please tell me thet best thing i should do i see that the first person to repsond just crushed my dreams oh adults the are so incompetent i do have signififcant musical talent but i think i will just give up no use trying if your no good does this person have a degree or more in music you'll eventually need one or more of them also meanwhile perhaps you can assist with small things but unless you have a specific proven skill at a professional level that she can depend on i doubt she would use you in any capacity that would reflect upon her work you said christian theater so i am assuming this is church based non professional there is sometimes more latitude there but if it were an important job they would get and adult professional then an adult amateur so just make yourself available and you already gave her a note showing your interest couldn't hurt unless you get creepy about it Apprenticeship Autism Second language acquisition Software engineering Pitaten Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Tonality Intelligence quotient Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Economic inequality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Asperger syndrome Contract Psychology Motion picture rating system Creationism Lawyer Human Scientology beliefs and practices Extreme Programming Human height Theory of conduct Go ranks and ratings Transactional analysis Mediation Professor Mental retardation Librarian Labour economics Paranoia Agent Scientific method Pedophilia Abortion debate Coming of age Lincoln-Douglas Debate Adolescence Avenue Q A Course In Miracles Prophets of the Dark Side Theodicy Psychoanalysis Amateurism Hearing impairment Infantilism Unemployment Boy Scouts of America Age of consent Guild Free trade Entropy Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Apprentice 2 Rick Santorum Social psychology Trinity Electrical engineering Juris Doctor Storytelling One Tree Hill (TV series) Paralegal Law of value Child sexual abuse Androgen insensitivity syndrome Labor theory of value Stuttering Predestination Self-concept Ontological argument Sexual orientation Hikikomori Artificial consciousness Paul Morphy Value system Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Baptist Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sonata (music) Civil rights Supernatural Commodity markets Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Charles Grandison Finney Education in Portugal Working memory Broadway theatre Species Social rule Trade union Singing school A Day in the Life Jacob Pavlovitch Adler Current teachings of Prem Rawat Jon Secada Human capital Merit Leadership Philosophical skepticism Church of Christ High school subcultures Strong atheism
