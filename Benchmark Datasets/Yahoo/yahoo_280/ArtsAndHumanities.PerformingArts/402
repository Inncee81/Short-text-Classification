do you think i'll get my voice back anytime soon i'm i used to practice my singing an hour every day i take lessons and i could sing for hours without my vocie feeling tired i was finally making real progress around the end of june my allergies started to kick in my throat was sore for two weeks it went away but for the past month my allergies weaken my voice most days i can only sing for minutes at a time before my voice feels strained my vocie was completley back for about days out of the past month my severe allergies are to dust and dust mites our house carpeting is over years old i have to vacuum use an air purifier take medicince and a nasal everyday spray just so my voice won't hurt while i talk we may get the carpet replaced with laminate flooring but i don't know if there was any permanent damage done to my voice anybody else experince something similar i often have stuffy nose and post nasal drip when thick mucus runs down the back of the throat and stills on the vocal cords most likely it could be one of two things many you're voice is still weak and will recover in a couple of weeks to its full strength don't try to do very much with it and certainly don't yell or scream or anything fun but damaging nothing that you described will really damage your voice permanently but it can slow the recovery the second thing may be a little more lasting since you are years old it's quite possible that your voice is changing of course boys go through this at and its very noticeable but girls also go through a stage where their voices change too what it normally means for the girl is that there will be some amount of time maybe a month or two maybe a year or two where your voice will feel weak and you'll loose a lot of your range normally you might be able to sing the high notes and the low notes but not the middle notes very well if this is the case don't worry every famous singer everybody has had to go through this so don't freak out if it takes a year or so to get it all back when it does it will be better than ever Hay fever Common cold Allergy Group A streptococcal infection Urinary incontinence The Chemical Brothers Chronic fatigue syndrome Social rule Shaggy dog story Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Jon Secada Stuttering Rod Stewart Wheel of Fortune Guilty Gear Liam Gallagher The Inside Human voice Equine conformation The Emancipation of Mimi Mattress Saturday Night Live The Ashlee Simpson Show Stomach cancer House dust mite Highway 61 Revisited Nasal congestion Blood on the Tracks Stop consonant Little Britain Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) A-ha Slow Train Coming Cocaine Breastfeeding Alveolar nasal Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Weight training Initiation (phonetics) Piccolo Junior Saga Tag Dialysis Mucus Ebola Brewery Radiation therapy Influenza Kodocha Please Please Me Coeliac disease Paget's disease of bone Mount Pinatubo Psoriasis The Marshall Mathers LP Puberty Carburetor Childbirth Jam (TV series) I Want to Hold Your Hand Jet engine Cliff Richard Vowel Avenue Q The Young Ones (TV series) Blood (computer game) Singer RuneScape Nasal consonant The Jazz Singer Severe weather terminology (United States) First aid Journey (band) Fantastic Four Asthma Hall & Oates Sesotho language English grammar Pittsburgh Steelers Poker jargon Overkill (band) Throat singing Traumatic brain injury TLC Authentic performance Hard disk Hangul Wing Chun Pitaten The Amazing Race Joan Sutherland The Basement Tapes Bon Jovi Carbon dioxide Billboard Hot 100
