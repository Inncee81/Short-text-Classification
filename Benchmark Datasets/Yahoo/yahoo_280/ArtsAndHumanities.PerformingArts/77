how can i record and produce a song my friend and i have a song that we wrote that we want to record and mix on the computer she would sing and i would play the piano what's the best way to record the piano and vocals aka what kind of microphone and what kind of programs would i need to accomplish this it wouldn't have to be anything fancy just something inexpensive that will produce decent results for mics i would recommend the mxl package you get a good vocal mic and an instrument mic for now instead of going into a computer i would get a tascam dp fx digital recorder for why because a computer interface and software package is going to cost almost as much and the learning curve is enormous with a little self contained tascam unit you can load your finished songs into the computer as a wave file and then burn cds from there it has all the effects you'll need built in and it's easy to use the results are cd quality if you are a real computer guru then there are digital interfaces that are cubase is a good program and some include it but the self contained unit is much easier for most people www musiciansfriend com or www americanmusical com have the best prices on this stuff good luck Multitrack recording Microphone Synthesizer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Commodore 64 Copy protection Computer Apple Macintosh IBM PC compatible Mac OS X Sound recording Linux Atari 8-bit family Cubase Video game music Computer software Recording studio Karaoke Sound card Mixing console Apple II family Digital Equipment Corporation Embedded system Disc jockey Sampling (music) ITunes Software testing Software engineering Floppy disk Digital Performer The Emancipation of Mimi Integrated circuit USB flash drive ZX Spectrum Warez Blood on the Tracks Sound Blaster System/36 Player piano Emacs 3D computer graphics FL Studio Digital circuit Hearing aid Record producer Vocoder Compact audio cassette Time Out of Mind Central processing unit CPU cache Microsoft Amiga Computer-aided design Kraftwerk Empire Burlesque America Online Knoppix Telephone Boards of Canada CPU design Domain Name System Chicago (band) Windows Vista Oscilloscope Cell (microprocessor) Digital audio workstation Hacker Blonde on Blonde Resident Evil (video game) TeX Digital photography History of operating systems Tracker Highway 61 Revisited Nintendo Entertainment System IPod Commodore International Pet Sounds Songwriter Geographic information system AmigaOS Xbox File system Windows XP Video CD Unreleased Madonna songs Perl Sgt.
