would you rather act or sing and why i would sing singing expresses so much of who you truly are acting you pretend to be someone you're not with music you can express the way your feeling with a series of oh's by hitting different notes or you can write words singing is so much better than acting because it's a way of expression and a way to get your feelings out there are also so many different styles of singing and each style is the person's style and no one can copy it or make it better it's a way to just be yourself without worrying about people judging you you can just sing what you feel and that's that no one can change it because it's who you are I Want to Hold Your Hand Whose Line Is It Anyway?
