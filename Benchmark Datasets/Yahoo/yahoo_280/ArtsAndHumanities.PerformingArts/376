i love to sing does anybody know were i can find a producer that can help me right songs and make an album if u can give me a real phone number of a producer that can actually help me with my singig carrier i will give u points i can do that because my dads friend mad yahoo a producer isn't what your looking for producers come in after all the biggest work is done and generally mess it up for you in the name of making it more commercial at your age i looked into some of your questions your voice isn't fully developed so what you do this month will be totally different six months from now your voice will not be the same and you have to worry about blowing your voice out what i'd suggest is taking vocal lessons to maximize your voice now is a good time for you to learn the tips and tricks they will be second nature too you by the time you have really gotten your voice set you did not mention what genre you hope to go into what it takes to make it in various genres is very different you can forget pop at your age because you gotta dance if you can sing that's a plus if not they'll fake it for you at your age it'd get folks arrested if they put you into a sexy video lol instead there is a thriving market along the disney scene for serious music for their movies and tv channel they want younger performers there lay your opportunity you have ambition but do you have the drive to be really good at something that means doing almost nothing but working on the songs pretty much every day for the next couple years that is alot of childhood you will regret losing out on do you want it that bad to give up the birthday parties the swim meets the sleepovers or whatever else folks you age do nowdays you will need dance lessons and singing lessons that's where you'll spend your days and your nights will be going over and practicing material next question even if your willing that doesn't mean your parents will be supportive of your efforts so you have to line your parents up behind you on this they are the ones who have to foot the bill for the lessons who have to buy the gear your going to need if your not ready to devote your life to this goal and you cannot get your parents behind the effort i suggest taking the slow route to fame and fortune work on this as a long term goal there is no instant success if you work at it every day for the next year or two then you might be ready if you work at it steadily but also have a life expect to be ready in to years there is volumes of stuff you have to learn just to go on stage in terms of pop music you have to look like a diva to have any chance of success in other music forms like rock metal country and such you can succeed on voice rather than looks in pop if you don't have the looks your voice can be the greatest anybody has ever heard but your not going anywhere right now you don't even know how your going to look so i'd suggest delving into a genre that isn't going to be so dependent upon your looks i am a composer show me you have dedication and the voice and i'll write up some tunes you can use to hit the disney scene several artists have launched their careers from disney it's the only real market for an artist your age the gear you need is a good quality vocal mic a vocal effects box a break out box and recording software along with access to a computer you'll need broad band internet to move files as well the gear will run you about until you have it you really don't know what you sound like distortions in recording can hide weak spots in your vocals or destroy good vocals karoke machines and boombox mics are worthless when it comes to studio quality vocals don't let age get in your way if you follow my profile there's a link to my betarecords tunes and the singer on the first two tunes was when he recorded those songs but also don't be in too big a hurry to grow up it's mean mean world out there it aint like tv it aint like movies you only get one chance to be a kid enjoy it
