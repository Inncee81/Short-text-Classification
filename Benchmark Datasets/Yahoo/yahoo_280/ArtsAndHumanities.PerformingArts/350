snare drum only i'm not rich but i have done music before with this in mind what is the best thing to do with about i would like to start off buying pearl chad smith snare to start and practice hand control i have a practice pad already i would have to save a few years to get a full kit i think it's incredible that you want to master hand control and snare technique before stepping up to a full kit a great drummer can do more amazing things with a three piece kit than a mediocre drummer can with a massive set kudos to you you should probably ask a professional drummer but i applaud you for wanting a quality snare instead of buying a huge amount of crap for the same price i can tell that you are going to turn into one incredible drummer do you have a teacher that will make you even better practice those rudiments i wish more aspiring drummers were like you good luck p s i disagree with tr learning good snare technique is useful and beneficial in any style and it will not harm you or hold you back when you are ready to step up to a full kit i asked my husband who has been a band director for yrs it is always harder to learn the more intricate muscle movements in anything you do oh and don't forget your metronome Bass drum Mike Portnoy Snare drum Red Hot Chili Peppers Drum Danny Carey Marching band Drum machine Marching percussion Trapping Craps Percussion instrument Ringo Starr Big band Lightsaber combat Pearl Jam Rush (band) Blonde on Blonde John Bonham GunZ The Duel Tenshinhan DrumMania Drummer Martial art Phil Collins Music Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Clash Theory of conduct Shaman King Duran Duran Piccolo Junior Saga Good Charlotte Bouncy techno Judas Priest Drum and bass Highway 61 Revisited Neil Peart YuYu Hakusho Nirvana (band) Shit Metallica KISS (band) House music Milton H.
