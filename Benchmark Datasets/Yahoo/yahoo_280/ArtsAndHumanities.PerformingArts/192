is it hard to learn to play sax is it hard to learn how to play the saxaphone i found that learning to play the saxophone pretty well in the beginning was not very hard compared to other instruments such as violin or guitar however after playing for four years i seemed quite difficult to go from being a mediocre player to being a very good player therefore if you want to learn the instrument well enough to play a few melodies or to add the sound to your band it would not take you very long but to become a very good player well versed in jazz studies etc would take a lot of time and practice like any other instrument also it helps a lot if you have played a woodwind instrument before Saxophone Vibrato Big band Baritone saxophone Violin King Crimson Bass guitar Double bass Jazz Musical ensemble Mandolin Orchestra Music genre Marching band Tenor saxophone Oboe Harmonica Bassoon The Waterboys Transposing instrument Timeline of trends in music (1950-1959) Music of Ireland Pet Sounds Brass instrument Woodwind instrument Authentic performance Brian Jones (musician) Sly & the Family Stone Percussion instrument Brass band Blood on the Tracks Songwriter Timpani Blues Phil Collins Western concert flute Bass saxophone Street-Legal Music Bitches Brew Bluegrass music Music of Brittany March (music) Rock band Miles Davis Anthony Braxton Adolphe Sax Embouchure Trombone Sarrusophone String instrument Electric guitar The Selmer Company Music of Puerto Rico Uilleann pipes Rock (music) Henry Cow Rahsaan Roland Kirk Instrumental rock Bagpipes Sitar Music of South Africa Norway national football team The Sims 2: University Music of Romania Old-time music Bebop Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band Vibraphone Keith Jarrett Video game music Brian May Musical instrument classification The Who Lester Young Tablature Piano Music of Kenya Heavy metal music Music of Nigeria Mario Davidovsky Folk music Reed (music) Pat Metheny Skeleton Crew (80s band) Mute (music) John Myung Adrian Rollini Opeth Klezmer Bass clarinet Red Hot Chili Peppers Caulfield Grammar School Micha__ Urbaniak Trey Anastasio Morphine (band) Concert band Jerry Garcia Jazz guitar
