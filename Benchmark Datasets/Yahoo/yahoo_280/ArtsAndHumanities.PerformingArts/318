how do i get famous i have a really great voice but i have no idea how to get discovered how do i get a record deal or on t v first of all you must get the glam out of the way and the stars out of your eyes i m not saying get rid of them because that is what is going to be your driving force just put them aside for a moment and focus on the bigger picture get your feet planted in reality before you reach for the stars the days of the artist development deal are past because of budget restraints recording companies no longer sign aspiring artist to develop them in hopes of making a profit in the future you have to go to them with some kind of experience gaining success in the entertainment business is no different than gaining success in any other job think about the job market today and what the experts recommend doing in gaining the position that you want you have to sell yourself to the employer make known the skills you bring and how they will benefit the employer in short what can you do for the company like any business the reason for a talent agency or record company being in business is to make a profit they want to be convinced that you your music is going to sell now the question becomes how do i show a record label or talent agency that i can make them money how can you prove your ability to produce a profit for them first make sure you truly have talent or at least the potential otherwise you are wasting your time and will be very disappointed when you discover the truth these are the things to do to prove to the major record companies that you have what it takes it is all in the vain of the indie movement self promotion what a record company is looking for is evidence of success have prior recording experience producing a product that has sold without a distribution deal or in store presence promoted yourself to radio stations enough to get air play of your material sell downloads of your material without the use of a service i e itunes have an official website not a myspace that draws thousands of visitors not hits each and every month consistently draw large crowds to your shows get great media coverage in advance of every major show have a fan base actively working to promote your shows draw a good percentage of your income from merchandise sales you may say well there are others who made it without having to work so hard yes occasionally you will find a band or a singer who has enormous talent and they will not have to work so hard they are the exception and not the rule but if you want what you say that you want you must be willing to work in that direction in today s market having your own evidence of success is the only guaranteed way to get yourself signed Therion (band) Unemployment Spice Girls Garth Brooks Advertising UK Singles Chart TLC Delta Goodrem Record label Insurance Wal-Mart Rock (music) Apple Computer Nintendo CBS Microeconomics Minor league baseball Illegal drug trade Otakon Productive and unproductive labour ABBA Grunge music Marketing Management Pop punk 50 Cent Prince (artist) Queen (band) Peter Gabriel ITV MTV Copyleft Privatization Surplus value Ford Motor Company Indie rock Internet fraud Capital accumulation Selling out Tesco Kylie Minogue Computer and video game industry Electronic commerce The Jackson 5 Prices of production Amway Publishing United Kingdom corporation tax Live 8 Citigroup Jimmy Eat World Baseball Copyright KISS (band) World Wrestling Entertainment David Bowie Roxette Tori Amos Technocratic movement Aerosmith Dorama Professional wrestling slang Plame affair Economics Short selling Keynesian economics We Belong Together Pink Floyd Life insurance ITunes Journey (band) Billboard Hot 100 Apple Macintosh Anarchism and capitalism Contract Strategic management Najwa Karam FairTax Nuclear power Blackjack United Artists World Championship Wrestling Political economy The Apprentice 2 Law of value Van Halen Online music store The Supremes Pharmaceutical company Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sears Holdings Corporation
