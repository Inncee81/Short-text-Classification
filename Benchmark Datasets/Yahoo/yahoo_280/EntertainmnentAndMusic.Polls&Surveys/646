stealing at the mall my cousin steals at the mall she lives in a really rich neighborhood and wants to wear different outfits everyday her family is not that rich anymore so i would always be suspicious when she had all those clothes with no tags or anything on them one time she took me to the mall and when i was looking away i saw her stuffing a belt in her bag i am too shy of a person to confront her with this issue and i do not want to embarrass her because we don t have that type of relationship where i can just tell her upfront dude don t do that cuz she is my older cousin she s five years older and goes to college it would be so humiliating for her and i don t want to be responsible for that but all i can say is that those clothes are in her closet some of them are from american eagle macy s and dillards etc what she does is she takes the tags off of the clothes that don t have the white censors on them and stuffs them in her bag i checked all her clothes and they don t have th don t have those censors that is why she is getting away with it i am thinking about telling her brother who is older than her and i am pretty close with him but i just don t want to make her cry or anything i am scared really scared should i tell she s been doing this for a year since she moved into those new houses w rich people and never got caught obviously she s destroying the mall i feel like she s a thief sometimes but we re family and we gotta stick together no matter what what do i do and why hasn t she gotten caught after year of stealing clothes at the mall dont worry about it if you dont want her to hate you for the rest of your life she will get busted sooner or later The Invisibles Jon Secada The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Great Teacher Onizuka Shaggy dog story Friends Beavis and Butt-head The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy One Piece minor characters The Inside Trailer Park Boys Avenue Q My Life as a Teenage Robot The Ashlee Simpson Show The Adventures of Pete & Pete Characters in the Smurfs Undergrads Spidey Super Stories Rich Mullins Dead Like Me Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ranma __ characters One Tree Hill (TV series) The Marshall Mathers LP Ocean's Twelve Fahrenheit 9/11 The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sin City Hey Arnold!
