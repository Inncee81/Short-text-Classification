do you know what makes a person into a user it seems so easy for people to say they are givers when it's just words coming out of their mouths it's sad when deceit becomes a way of life for so many people today isn't it here is my picture of a user a person with little respect a person who is greedy and selfish a person who will hurt others to get what is desired my picture of a giver a person with lots of respect a person who is selfless and helps others whenever possible if you know a serious person who says he or she is a giver not a taker i would believe that person Goatse.cx Objectivist philosophy Child abuse Oral sex Evil Alignment (role-playing games) The Giver Altruism Theory of conduct Bong Love Internet troll Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Baptism Anya Jenkins Sant Thakar Singh Massage Lie Confucius Prisoner's dilemma The Selfish Gene Alcoholics Anonymous Gay slang Hiberno-English Pitaten Machinima Condom John Howard Yoder In Nomine (role-playing game) BDSM Japji Sahib Japanese values Customs and etiquette of Japan Goodness and value theory Michel Henry E-mail Newbie Ishmael (novel) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Requirements analysis Daria Childfree Sant Mat Guru Viral marketing Current teachings of Prem Rawat Kalki Monster Rancher monsters IBM PC compatible InterFaith Bernard Williams Handloading Indian caste system Hospitality service Shaggy dog story Meaning of life Quake III Arena Social psychology Avatar (virtual reality) Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Copyleft Akatsuki (Naruto) Value system Happiness Bruce Wilkinson Enneagram SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Sexually-transmitted infection Fruits Basket Stephen Jay Gould Duties of the Heart Meat Loaf Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Jon Secada Vanir Caste Kula Gaia Online Saudade Transsexuality Trusted computing Jumpstart 3rd Grade Spanish pronouns Computer Time Out of Mind Autism rights movement Advertising Polyamory Extreme Programming AFI 100 Years series Book of Isaiah Benzino Microeconomics 2channel Tzedakah Prank flash Linear Pottery culture Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Late Night with Conan O'Brien
