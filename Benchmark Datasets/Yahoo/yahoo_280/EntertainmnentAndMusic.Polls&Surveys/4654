why are people in louisiana so stupid if any of you like minded people out there have every seem waterboy a movie made and based in louisiana then let me tell you that movie is a perfect example of how some of the people act down here in this state i know this one girl who talks just like bobby well make that several people the people in my hometown of atlanta are country too but we are smart country people aaron sorry i meant to say ever seen the waterboy movie seems like a pissed off a couple of you let me say that i apologize i didnt mean the question to be racist although some of you took it that way first off i would like to say that such a question that you posted here seems very irresponsible of you you probably didn't mean to be offensive but indeed your question contains a number of things that have already offended people may i point out some of them to base a nature of a people on a hollywood movie is not the wisest thing to do a movie is what it is a movie it's for the sake of entertainment and the fact that you're using a comedy film to justify your stance on the way a people act is not very academic of you if you claim that these people are stupid in your eyes perhaps you should check yourself in the mirror once in a while and rethink that the only thing i see something stupid that is relative to this question is the question itself by making a hasty conclusion on a nature of a people based on a few incidents is a very immature thing to do i may not be from louisiana but i am pretty damn sure that there are a lot of smart people there just like everywhere just because you met a few stupid people in one location does not mean all of the people there act as stupid as them sorry if i may seem harsh on you but i felt like it was neccessary for me to point them out Theory of conduct The nature of God in Western theology Stupidity Anne Rice Married... with Children Nigger Little Britain Sharon Tate Bertrand Russell Elizabeth Smart kidnapping A Course In Miracles Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism "Weird Al" Yankovic Capital punishment Our Gang Cindy Sheehan Religion Infantilism Hip hop rivalries Hilary Duff Something Awful Philosophical skepticism Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Goodness and value theory Have I Got News For You Michael Moore Humphrey Bogart Nicole Kidman Killian documents Marilyn Monroe Nine Inch Nails Theodicy Lucille Ball Dilbert Milton H.
