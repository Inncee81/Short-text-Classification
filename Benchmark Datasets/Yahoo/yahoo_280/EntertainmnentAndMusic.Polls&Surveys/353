did you understand the matrix yeah but why why the machines i mean wtf was up with that i mean yeah i know they lived in those egg thingies and something had taken over and they had those things in their head or whatever and it was fake but seriously wtf why what ever motivated this oh hell never mind reality is an illusion to keep the human race subdued and just alive enough to supply electricity to run the machine world ok the story goes in the past man created machines with artificial intelligence and more importantly the ability to learn through the passage of time the machines became more efficient than the humans and saw humans as a waste of space a big war ensued which the machines won enslaving the humans and using them as their power source so the rolls were reversed the matrix is a computer program created by the boss machine that makes the human mind think it is experiencing reality the movie picks up the story where the last of the humans are mounting a rebellion against the machines and it has been prophesied that there will be a 'chosen one ' born in the matrix morpheus believes this to be neo someone who can defeat the machines as neo starts to believe in the prophesy and his own abilities realises he can manipulate the matrix and perhaps even defeat the machines the story is based on many other messianic stories i e the bible or star wars and draws heavily on that iconography Neo (The Matrix) The Matrix The Matrix Revolutions Messiahs in fiction and fantasy Smith (The Matrix) Morpheus (The Matrix) Architect (The Matrix) The Matrix Reloaded Trinity (The Matrix) The Matrix Online The Matrix character names Beast Wars The Second Renaissance Monomyth Dark City The Invisibles Agent (The Matrix) Autobot Matrix of Leadership Human Merovingian (The Matrix) Artificial consciousness Book of Revelation Digimon Redpill Technological singularity Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Magic (illusion) Incarnations of Immortality Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix) Timeline of fictional future events Kain (Legacy of Kain) Zero One Cypher (The Matrix) Gnosticism A Course In Miracles Ghost in the Shell Transformers: Robots in Disguise Ecco the Dolphin Sin City W.
