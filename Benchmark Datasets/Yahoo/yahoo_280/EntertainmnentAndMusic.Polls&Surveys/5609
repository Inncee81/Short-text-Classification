how dissapointed would you be if your childs soccer team lost this happened to me today it's the rd last game of the season so they should be a little better than that i'm so upset how would you feel they have never won a game ever lol but this was their worst loss the score was like thats much better lol i would be disappointed too but don't feel so bad he can learn something from this and turn it into a learning experience rather than just a bad day maybe the team or the coach is doing something wrong or maybe they're not at that level yet when they can start winning it's all good they're just kids having fun after all don't take too hard just be there for him good luck on the next game New York Knicks New York Giants Cleveland Browns New England Patriots Norway national football team Pittsburgh Steelers Buffalo Bills New York Jets Los Angeles Clippers Miami Dolphins Canterbury Bulldogs Wayne Gretzky San Francisco 49ers Cincinnati Bengals World Series Troms__ I.L.
