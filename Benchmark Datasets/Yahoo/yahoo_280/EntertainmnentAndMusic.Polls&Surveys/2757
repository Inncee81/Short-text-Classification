what brands of shampoo have you seen in the grocery store or k mart that you would like all i have ever seen is row after row after row of suave also seen white rain vo prell pert plus head and shoulders and absolutely nothing else ever not one other brand unless maybe it was on the bottom shelf it's all pretty much crap the ingredients on all these bottles are horrendous plus they contain alcohol which will dry out hair out of all of them i sometimes like the neutrogena small square bottle because it's good to use every once in a while but the smell actually makes me sick i try to avoid buying shampoo whatnot from grocery stores like kroger etc and i can't believe k mart even still exists when target has completely knocked them out of the competition k mart imho looks so run down and behind the times no matter where it's located anyway i usually purchase my shampoo at places like whole foods wild oats actually there's a mosturizing body wash i used as a shampoo that i loved shikai white gardenia but i do steer clear of common grocery stores most products there are very unhealthy overloaded with sodium trans fat and almost everything either has preservatives or unnatural chemicals and k mart doesn't even enter into the picture at all the best place to buy shampoo and everything else is organic grocery stores like whole foods or wild oats Shampoo Dandruff Wal-Mart Supermarket Hamster Sento Alcoholic beverage Tesco Food Procter & Gamble Electronic commerce Tofu Oat Kroger Patent medicine Ramen Soft drink Barley Olive oil Beer Milk Sin City Chocolate Trans fat Ice cream Kitchen Guinea pig Harris Teeter Dairy Atkins Nutritional Approach Zellers Polyethylene terephthalate Psoriasis Kosher foods Watermelon Microeconomics Cheese Healthy eating Laundry detergent Bulk vending Craps Hydrogen peroxide Cigarette Fred Meyer Liquor store Organic certification Desert Sodium hydroxide Baldness treatments Single malt Scotch Soy protein Inventory Price discrimination Albertsons Porgy and Bess Multiple chemical sensitivity Coffee Fire extinguisher Japanese tea ceremony Gambling Hair coloring Marmite Sodium chloride Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory Ranma __ characters Decompression sickness Bikini Bottom Cannabis cultivation Fancy rat Phosphorus Glycerin Bodybuilding Dieting Lionel Corporation Toothpaste Aldi Textile manufacturing Safeway Inc.
