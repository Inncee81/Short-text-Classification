when someone says something that goes way over your head do you pretend you know what their talking about in fear of not looking stupid or do you ask for clarification i understand in certain situations you may have no choice but to ask unfortunately with my deafness it happens to me alot mainly because i don't hear everything that is said and yes rather than look a complete fool i'll try and nod and wait until i can figure out what's been said unfortunately that's backfired many a time and i've ended up looking stupid because i couldn't hear what was being said Stupidity Shaggy dog story Shit Coming of Age (TNG episode) Irony Hearing impairment Joke Thank God It's Doomsday Social rule Self Portrait American Idiot Milton H.
