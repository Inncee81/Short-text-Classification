what are your thoughts on the rob zombie remake of halloween halloween is my favorite scary movie and it's quite hard to mess with perfection from what i've seen so far he's kept the movie the same but he's added the rob zombie trademarked cinematography to it i am thinking it may actually make the movie even better august is the release date in the us i'm curious yet apprehensive movie remakes hardly have the best track record but with proper zombification it looks quite promising plus malcolm mcdowell as dr loomis i love that guy Halloween (film) Zombie The Zombies Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed Horror film Extraordinary Machine Resident Evil (video game) House of 1000 Corpses The Misfits Resident Evil: Apocalypse Prank flash Resident Evil Paul W.
