ok serious question about a job needs advise who will help i have worked atthis same job for years i know a lot of people and make quite a bit of money the problem is they are selling to some new owners and usually when this happenes they bring in family and friends and you lose your hours or postion it has been told to us already all of us can stay but we have to move to nights i worked to hard to have to go back to nights well anyway i got offered another waitress job but when u start at a new place you start at the bottem which means worst shifts and less tips and the i got offered a job to manage a local newspaper with a steady set salary and benifits you would think no problem right i have for years been in the restaurant business and have made dollars more a day if i take this office job which is awesome and gets me out of wait work will it be copable i mean moeny wise going from daily pay to weekly pay i have five months left of mortician school and this also needs consideration also i would liek to add this job has room for advancement and great possibilities im confused what to do sounds like the main problem is that none of these jobs shifts coordinate with your school schedule either keep looking or go for the newspaper job which would be excellent experience and a great opportunity you can pinch and stretch pennies until that first weekly paycheck comes in benefits are a huge plus but that wouldn't fit in with school either hmm and that's a career goal with far better rewards in the long run than the newspaper job so then you do what you have to do to stay in school even if it means going back to the night shifts for months whatever you decide wow you are a winner this is a dilemma a whole lot of people would kill to have congrats whatever you do i think if it was me i'd stay on the chosen career path stay in school do the damned night shift until i find another job with a suitable schedule huhhuh that took some working out my brain hurts Social rule The Apprentice 2 International League Meat Loaf EastEnders Freeters Minimum wage Pitaten Piccolo Junior Saga National Football League Babe Ruth Wal-Mart Warren Buffett 1957 World Series Microeconomics Friends $ale of the Century Baseball Knots Landing Grand Forks, North Dakota Enron Corporation Bulk vending Prisoner's dilemma Charles Ponzi Unemployment Battles of Lexington and Concord New York Giants Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mario Lemieux Satchel Paige Education in the People's Republic of China Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Progressive tax Poker jargon Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban George Brown, Baron George-Brown ITV Professor RuneScape quests Avenue Q Everwood Carl Barks Education in Germany Graduate school Jeopardy!
