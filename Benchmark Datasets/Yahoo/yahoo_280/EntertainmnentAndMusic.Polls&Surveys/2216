do you read the bible if you do or dont could you explain your reason for it have read most of it don't read it as often as i should right now when it comes down to it after you sift away most people's interpretation about what this detail means and what that implication is it mostly speaks to relationships and how to have better relationships whether it be between you and god or you and your fellow man if you read it and assuming you believe in god the bible says the greatest commandment is to love the lord your god with all your heart and the second is to love your neighbor as yourself a lot of people get hung up on the commandments and by human nature we don't like to be told what to and what not to do so they are put off by it if you have a genuine love for your fellow man though most of the commandments fall into place as the evidence of your love for your fellow man you probably are less likely to kill people for example and thus your relationships with others is improved that's kind of an extreme example but you get the point i'm sure don't know where you stand but whether a person believes in god or not anyone could stand to have improvement in their relationship with others think what that would do to our crime rate in some areas the relationships you then form with others are a great benefit Ten Commandments Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Predestination Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theology A Course In Miracles Prophet Sabbath God Sin Moses Theodicy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Supernatural Past teachings of Prem Rawat Book of Mormon Tetragrammaton Jewish principles of faith Devil Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Agap__ John Howard Yoder Bible Qur'an Creation according to Genesis Eastern Orthodox Church Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses God and gender Meaning of life Creationism Theory of conduct Trinity Book of Joshua Abraham Homosexuality and Christianity Philo Resurrection of Jesus Jacob Neusner Sola fide Miracle Book of Isaiah Opus Dei Eucharist Biblical canon Merit Homosexuality and Judaism Alan Campbell (pastor) The nature of God in Western theology Love Korban Biblical inerrancy John the Baptist Ethics in the Bible Idolatry Paul Is Dead Evil Summa Theologiae Christian views of Jesus Total depravity Urantia Moral objectivism Young Earth creationism Original sin Jews as a chosen people Salvation Joseph of Arimathea Noah Capital punishment Dispensationalism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Jewish views of religious pluralism Reincarnation John Wesley Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Day-Age Creationism Expository preaching Religion Confidence trick Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Plame affair Calvinism Soul Presuppositional apologetics Plagues of Egypt Genesis Angel Mahabharata Existence of God Mythology The Pilgrim's Progress Church of Christ, Scientist Sukkot Perseverance of the saints Patriotism Simone Weil Human Christianity God the Father
