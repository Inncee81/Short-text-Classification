if every avatar game for the last weeks has been deleted what makes you think another game wont just about every avatar game question i have seen over the past few weeks ends up getting deleted and at minimum the asker gets either a violation notice or deleted then all heck breaks loose on this board with this is so unfair they did this for no reason etc etc etc are people really that thick that they dont realize that all of those questions are being turned in by people on this board and that their question isnt going to be that one special game that gets through or is it that they have absolutely no respect for others or authority or is it that they just plain do not care and if they just plain do not care what does that say about us as a society think about it serious answers only let's open a debate here's what official yahoo has to say about it http messages answers yahoo com answers threadview m tm bn sea violationsnotice tid mid tof rt frt off cindy good question i'm not official yahoo but here would be my take on it the first part of your question would pass muster on that we both agree where i think yahoo might take exception would be that the nd part of the question which would tend to make any response to it seem chatty which is the reason they are yanking the ag questions to begin with i dunno from what i have seen on the violations appeals board when a question gets down to a point that it is asking a specific user their specific opinion that is the trigger point for the question answer becoming chatty and thus deleted good question cindy ok so for the sake of argument say i ask a question on p s what type of people do you like to date a legit question that would probably pass thru the yahoo gauntet censors then i ask a question would you date the avatar above you how is that so significantly different that it falls in the violating community standard section is not the line much too fine to make a clear distinction Theory of conduct Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Neopets Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Ethics Internet forum Expert system Canon (fiction) Freedom of speech GunBound Capital punishment Internet troll HTTP cookie Classified information Goodness and value theory Intelligent design movement Plame affair Objectivist philosophy Theodicy Philosophy of language Quizbowl Administrative law of the United States Originalism Extreme Programming Determinism Creation-evolution controversy Appeal Football (soccer) SAT Lincoln-Douglas Debate Representational State Transfer Abington School District v.
