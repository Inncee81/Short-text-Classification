if you won the million lottery what would you spend it on what a thought provoking question let me think on it a second thinking hard okay i got it i have about true blue friends the kind of people that i would gladly die for and i know they would do the same for me so the first thing i would do is make sure i owed no one any money for anything pay it all off then i would hire a lawyer to pay off all of the bills of all my friends put them at debt next i would give them each million dollars then i would start construction of my neighborhood a place where everyone i love could live in peace and harmony large acre lake with stuff for the kiddos and houses each big and spacious built to my friends spec except mine of course set them in a semi circle around the lake then build a huge stone fence around it all not close to the houses but close enough to add a little security and protection from the elements once construction was well underway i would leave for aruba for a nice extended vacation when i got back i would set up trust funds for my boys and ensure they could go to any year college that they could get the grades to get into maybe purchase some real estate start a few side projects and just relax and enjoy life Microeconomics Mortgage Construction Ocean's Twelve Kill Bill Avenue Q U.S. public debt Mutual fund Carl G.
