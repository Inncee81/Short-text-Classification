i run a children's psychiatric clinic i am building a playground for my patients should i include mood swings i thought of putting in a teeter totter but the children already have enough ups and downs the slide is a possibility but i am afraid of setting a downward trend any suggestions how about monkey bars or would you rather not teach them to monkey around and go in bars the slide would give them highs and lows alright could you do a pool or would they get in too deep good luck with your project i think you're on the right track and going forward Bipolar disorder Professional wrestling holds Playground Milton H.
