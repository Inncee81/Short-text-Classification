do you think aliens exist i don't know trillions of galaxies each containing trillions of sun and stars yes with as many billions of stars as there are in billions of galaxies that may each have a planet like ours there must be some other form of intelligent life out there the problem is that with the laws of physics it's inconceivable to us right now that we would ever be able to have meaningful contact with them or vice versa the closest solar system to our own is about one light year away which means that even if we could travel at light speed which is impossible as far as we know it would take us a whole year to get there even though there are so many other planets out there that some probably have life it is still an incredibly rare phenomenon as far as we know chances are that any planets with life are probably too far away for us to conceivably reach with modern physics if however we are able to discover ways to go faster than light speed then it is probable that we may encounter aliens someday or that they will encounter or have encountered us that's why warp speed which is going faster than light is a major premise in almost every science fiction show with aliens Fermi paradox SETI Solar system Time travel Warp drive Black hole Faster-than-light Interstellar travel Astronomy Sun Planetary habitability Vega Borg Creationist cosmologies Planetary nebula Extraterrestrial hypothesis Modified Newtonian dynamics Space opera in Scientology doctrine Modern geocentrism Extraterrestrial life Dark matter Kardashev scale Extrasolar planet Jean-Luc Picard Pluto Big Bang Timeline of the Universe Fine-tuned universe Stargate SG-1 Planet Dyson sphere Hyperspace (science fiction) Physics Orders of magnitude (numbers) Universe Unidentified flying object Alpha Centauri Extraterrestrial life in popular culture Teleportation Star Trek: The Motion Picture General relativity Wormhole The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Cassini-Huygens Astrophysics Gamma ray burst History of astronomy Bah__'__ Faith and Science Marvel Universe Where No One Has Gone Before (TNG episode) Pi Spacecraft propulsion Names of large numbers Gravity Gravitational lens Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Slipstream (science fiction) Tests of general relativity Alien races in the Stargate universe Johannes Kepler Tyranid Greys Comet Hale-Bopp History of physics Vacuum Human extinction Panspermia Mercury (planet) Luminiferous aether Kryptonite Plasma (physics) Brian Aldiss Farscape Xenu Vulcan (Star Trek) Voyager 2 Traveller (role-playing game) Jupiter End of civilization Water (molecule) Force (Star Wars) Neutrino Open cluster Cloaking device USS Voyager (NCC-74656) Stellar evolution Titan (moon) Logic Epsilon Eridani Solar eclipse Star Trek: First Contact
