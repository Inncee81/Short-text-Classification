give me one good reason to bother watching big brother the tv show because it's full of twists and turns people are constantly changing their opinions of others and thus have to change their course of action to ensure their safety in the house friendships formed in the house may be abandoned when a truth is revealed and as evidenced in the current season friendships with former enemies are formed i'm not really a fan of reality tv shows that go along the lines of people live in a house and act like assholes but in this show people actually use their brains sure some of them are assholes but others act in an assholish manner just because it's part of playing the game it requires skill in persuading others including foes to agree with you skill to persuade someone who has been playing against you to play in part for you skill in turning people's views around when it comes to being safe Big Brother (USA TV series) President (game) Poker jargon Betting (poker) Epistemology Big Brother (Australian TV series) RuneScape quests Electrophysiology Kimi Finster Contract BloodRayne Theory of conduct Evil Magic Knight Rayearth Survivor (TV series) Bullshit!
