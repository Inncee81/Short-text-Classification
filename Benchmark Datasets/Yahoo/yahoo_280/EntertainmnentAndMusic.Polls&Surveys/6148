rape and abortion i'm just curious lol i'm not pregnant nor did i get raped i was wondering if you got raped would you keep your baby i mean would you go through nine months to give birth to a baby that you don't really want if a woman is raped hopefully she would go to the hospital there they would do the proper investigation you are then given the option to take a medication that can prevent the occurrence of pregnancy it would not allow sperm and egg to make a zygote then a fetus as i said it is a choice it is not considered abortion because it is a preventative to pregnancy myself i would take the drug so i wouldn't have to make any other choices i am completely against abortion if a woman does not go to the doctor after being raped i feel she should give someone else the opportunity to love that child that she chose to carry it is a horrible thought but some women are too scared to admit they were raped someone would want that child that was created by such a heinous act Pregnancy Miscarriage Birth control Abortion In vitro fertilisation Abortion in the United States Infertility Pro-choice Emergency contraception Abortion in Canada Roe v.
