why did popeye have such big forearm muscles and what benefit did this give him in a fight since i would have thought tricep shoulder muscles would be more important for boxing although it is the forearm muscles helps with the contact from the punch the more muscle you have in the forearm the more resistance you can handle i have been building up my forearm muscles even before i started boxing that was when i was it helps the wrist from bending too much when trying to throw a hook or even a hard straight right many people wonder how come some boxers despite their size and small mass have so much power it's because they are allowed to release more energy through that punch and give heavier blows without the fear of breaking the wrist or forearm of course popeyes where just in a cartoonish perspective crap was i supposed to take this lightly Weight training Boxing Equine conformation Arm Strike (attack) Aikido Aerial (dance move) Tai Chi Chuan Punch (strike) Wing Chun Diving Carpal tunnel syndrome Humerus Mixed martial arts Terminal ballistics Hand Elbow-joint Volleyball Boxing training Popeye Craps Professional wrestling throws Scapula Kung Fu Hustle Knife Massage Stretching The Rumble in the Jungle Ulna Archery Bodybuilding Tetrapod Ice hockey Mattress Gesture Roy Jones Jr. Anatomical terms of location Fecal incontinence Bicycle Professional wrestling Swimming Repetitive strain injury Brown Bear Violin Tyrannosaurus rex Radius (bone) Fighting Spirit Suplex Tenshinhan Naruto jutsu Darken Rahl Hand grenade Chris Byrd Professional wrestling aerial techniques Chair Piccolo Junior Saga Harry Nilsson Professional wrestling match types Vegeta Horizontal bar Bob Fitzsimmons Jackass: The Movie Zords in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Backstroke Doom enemies Sling (weapon) Amputation Force powers Bruce Lee ZGMF-X2000 GOUF Ignited Osteoporosis Nietzschean Internal ballistics RX-93 Nu Gundam Peripheral nervous system Ultimate Muscle Angelina Jolie Butterfly stroke Canoe Club (weapon) Bench press Handloading Bene Gesserit Martial art Gravity Cloaking device Universal Serial Bus Swingout Amiga RX-78 mobile suit series Exercise Punch-Out!!
