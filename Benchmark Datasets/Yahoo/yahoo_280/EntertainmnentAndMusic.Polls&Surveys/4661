is it sad that i have to hide from an something year old client because he insists on talking to me and staring at me for minutes after his appointment and making some rather inappropriate comments i'm sure he's just senile but it makes me uncomfortable i don't like the fact that i have to play hide and seek at work i'm a horrible person aren't i no you're not a horrible person you have every right to avoid him if he's making inappropriate comments i wouldn't feel comfortable with him either you shouldn't have to play hide and seek is there any way you could say something to your boss about this situation i have an ish year old neighbor that made inappropriate remarks to me one day and so now i avoid being alone outside in my front yard for the time being because i don't want to have to deal with him Social rule Plame affair Theory of conduct Traumatic incident reduction Late Night with Conan O'Brien Gender-neutral language Internet troll Time Out of Mind Major League Baseball television contracts Shaggy dog story 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Friends Anonymity The Catcher in the Rye The Empty Child Milton H.
