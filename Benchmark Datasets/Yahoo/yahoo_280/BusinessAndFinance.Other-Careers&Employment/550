should i just call in and say i will be late i have an interview next friday it is in a city that is about hours away from me i decided recently that i am going to grad school in this same town in the spring but thought i would start looking for jobs now well my jerk of a boss will not let me off on this day the interview is at a m and i estimate to be back on the road by and get back to my city around should i just call that morning and say i'm going to be late or what the interviewer is only in town for that friday and the pay is way better than my current job there's no guarantee i will get the job but i should go for it right call me silly but i do worry about my boss retaliating on me and it would seem so coincidencial for me to call in sick on the same day i asked for off maybe i should just talk to her about it and ask her for just hours off and promise to be in i had to go through this a few months ago i had to sit down and tell my supervisor that i was having an interview in a different department and that i needed the time off he was quite receptive and once i got the job very supportive you need to be honest with your supervisor it takes a lot of courage to ask for time off but you should let him know that getting this job would open so many more opportunities for you you should tell your boss no matter what a jerk he is that this is important for you and that if he wants to keep you he will need to let you take these chances good luck on the interview Social rule Daylight saving time Graduate school Ocean's Twelve Plame affair Kodocha Shaggy dog story EastEnders Time Out of Mind Sydney Riot of 1879 Knots Landing Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Extreme Programming Friends Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Wheel of Fortune Unemployment Education in Romania George Costanza Boom Town (Doctor Who) Piccolo Junior Saga Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Chemical Brothers American and British English differences 24 (television) Wal-Mart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Operation Market Garden Maison Ikkoku Anderson Cooper The Inside Tekken characters Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Abigail Folger Vicente Fox Futurama (TV series - season 5) Affirmative action Jack Charlton Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina United Airlines Flight 93 Alex Ferguson Ra (board game) Good Friday Ben Johnson (athlete) Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Pittsburgh Steelers Hebrew calendar I Want to Hold Your Hand San Francisco 49ers MTV2 The Catcher in the Rye Anarchism and society Phoebe Halliwell Apollo 8 Education in the People's Republic of China Jayson Blair Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Moe Berg Interview Vanishing Point (film) Northern Ireland peace process Blonde on Blonde Avenue Q $ale of the Century The Late Late Show Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Dead Like Me Pitaten Luck Labour economics The Family from One End Street Walt Disney World College Program Scientology beliefs and practices Flamingo Road Rice University Battle of Hampton Roads ITV Political subdivisions of New York State Professional wrestling slang St. Elmo's Fire (film) George W.
