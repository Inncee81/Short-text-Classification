unqualified boss what would you do my husband is the finishing supervisor for a custom cabinet shop he's been with them for almost three years with no problems about three weeks ago they hired a new shop supervisor he happens to be the owners daughters she works there too boyfriend he has management experience but has never worked in woodworking the problem is that he's telling my husband to do some things differently which is fine except that if he does these things jobs won't be correct the pieces will come back and my husband will have to re do them these are jobs that take days to complete like a house full of cabinets bookshelves trim etc yesterday he passed a job to my husband and the majority of the pieces were marked for the wrong color my husband pointed it out to him and it took an arguement for the supervisor to look at what he marked he had done it wrong the shop sup has called a meeting with my husband the owners and himself today to discuss my husbands attitude help there have been other problems with the supervisor also when pieces are correct and my husband has to send it back to fabrication the supervisor gives him attitude so many other things my husband is not a whiner not a complainer he's just generally a good employee who cares about the quality of work he does he feels like he's being sabotaged i don't think i've ever seen him so frusterated he wants to quit but should he do these jobs wrong like the supervosor is telling him to and have to do it over honestly he should start looking for another job if he is already being called upon about his attitude they had clearly already decided that he is an inflexible troublemaker who responds poorly to change and no matter what he does he will always have that hanging over his head if he wants to stay with this company he simply needs to do whatever this boss tells him to do he will probably have to work extra hours and correct this morons mistakes too eventually if he keeps messing up they will move this new guy into another role with the organization probably a promotion either way i would tell your husband that his number one job is to try to make this new guy look good anything else is going to get him fired and ruin his shot at a good recommendation the plan is probably to move this guy up the ladder into and higher position and maybe leave the company to him and the daughter after they get married it is completely not fair but it is clearly the direction they have decided to go this is not about business this is about ensuring a secure future for the owner's daughter blood is thicker than water look at the bright side maybe the girl will break up with this doofus but i would suggest that he look for another job this new boss doesn't like him and i would bet that in ten years he will be the owner at this point you only choice is whether it would it be better to look for a job now or then as for the suggestions that he keep a paper trail that is only applicaible is he gets unjustly fired and he sues when you sue for worngful termination you are technically suing to get your job back if he chooses this path he will ruin his good name and waste a ton of time also the case will probably not be very strong as they are already creating a paper trail against him the talk about his attitude and the judge will be more likey to believe them i am sorry it sucks to feel like someone else has all the power in a situation but in this case i would say you would lose money face and time by trying to fight the system easier to shoose to leave now than throw it all away fighting to maintain a lost working situation Friends EastEnders Social rule Knots Landing The Apprentice 2 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Graduate school Pitaten Avenue Q Chess strategy and tactics Corporate governance Michael Garibaldi New York Giants Craps Sin City Scientology beliefs and practices Plame affair Extreme Programming Phoebe Halliwell 2000 Australian Grand Prix Boston Public Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Everwood Wal-Mart Chess terminology Principal-agent problem Alcoholics Anonymous Eric Bischoff Transactional analysis Time Out of Mind Gender-neutral language Jumpstart 3rd Grade Aerial (dance move) Kurt Angle Alex Ferguson U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Bulk vending The Critic Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Software engineering The Contender (television series) Textile manufacturing CPU cache 1957 World Series Hey Jude New England Patriots Upholstery Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim One Tree Hill (TV series) Shawn Michaels Michael D.
