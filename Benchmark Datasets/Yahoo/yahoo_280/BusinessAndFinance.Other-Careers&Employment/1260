i have a group interview at kohl's help please my interview is tomorrow and i'm so nervous what exactly is a group interview at kohl's some say it's numerous candidates being interviewed at the same time others say a group interview will be several key staff members just interviewing me anyone which one kohl's is i'm so nervous if several of us are being interviewed at the same time will the person single me out and ask me specific questions from my application and resume for example i have some gaps in employment will the the person say so james tell me about these gaps in employment you have okay i'm gonna try to calm down and take a breather now if someone could help me i'd greatly appreciate it though in retail a group interview that is not a management position is a few candidates being interviewed at once normally this is done when the store is looking for a large amount of people to fill positions ie christmas new store opening the positions they are looking to fill are usually on the floor customer service type of jobs nothing with any responsibility they will ask you general questions that the whole group will answer or just a few people and then the next few people will be asked a different question depending on the interviewer best thing to keep in mind is you want to stand out from the crowd don't give the same answer everyone else did relax normally group interviews are less painful the one on one interviews because they are looking to screen out the crazies before they move on the next group or round of interviews you will be fine good luck Social rule The Apprentice 2 Expert system Interview Sharon Tate Coming of Age (TNG episode) Job interview The Ashlee Simpson Show Retailer Probation officer Single Transferable Vote George W.
