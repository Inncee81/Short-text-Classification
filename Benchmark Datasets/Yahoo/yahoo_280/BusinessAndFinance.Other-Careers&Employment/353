husband being overworked what should he do it's a very long story but basically my husband is the only developer for a particular product on his team now the client keeps adding more and more code changes to be done for the following week's product he has two days to code and yet they keep giving him over hours of work to do in those two days the client is not concerned because and i agree with them it's not their fault that my husband's employer hasn't hired anyone to help him he's told his bosses repeatedly that he needs help explained that he only has two days to do the code changes and that they are assigning him hours of work to do in those two days but they keep not doing anything meanwhile his workload keeps steadily increasing each week short of quiting what can he do shelcom that's my point they are assigning him hours worth of code to do in hours i'm not making it up it's the truth it's really stupid this sounds very familiar to me my husband was in a similar situation again long story too and he was in an impossible situation because he couldn't do all the work himself but there simply wasn't the manpower to get the job done he was also in the unfortunate position of taking over the job which had been very badly managed before him so he was also trying to undo other peoples' mistakes whilst taking all the abuse from the client for things that were out of his control he stuck it out for months and eventually found another company it was a real shame because he'd had such high hopes for the job and the company but they repeatedly hung him out to dry i would say don't trust a company that doesn't support you like this if they are unwilling to provide the manpower to enable him to do his job they are penny pinching and bad organisers he would do better to cut his losses and look elsewhere i know he doesn't want to quit but ultimately you have to look at where this company is taking him he is overworked and stressed and his company is clearly taking him for a ride to them it's all about saving money your husband needs to consider his health and welfare above all there are better companies out there i am sure who are willing to manage their workforce more effectively than this perhaps eventually your husband can start his own business then he wont have to put up with rubbish like that Extreme Programming Plame affair Wal-Mart Unemployment EastEnders Friends Working time MMORPG The Apprentice 2 Theory of conduct Kodocha Blonde on Blonde Corporate governance Outsourcing Ultima Online Game programmer Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Domain Name System Dilbert Knots Landing Ashton-Tate Divorce Gross domestic product Workplace democracy Windows 2000 Final Fantasy XI Management Avenue Q Traumatic incident reduction Labour economics Software engineering Infantilism Customer relationship management Call centre Blackjack Poker jargon Pitaten Transactional analysis Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Microsoft Enterprise content management James T.
