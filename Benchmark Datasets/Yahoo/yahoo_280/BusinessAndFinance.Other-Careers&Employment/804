what is the solution my mum got me a trial job at the local pizza place i went for the trial on a sunday night and worked hours i continued to go on sunday nights for about weeks after this i became mates with a girl who knows my brother from school i quit the job i had the people from the pizza place told me to then i found out that i would only be working hours a week and earning exactly the same as my old job i had to learn something so they would give me more shifts i booked two weeks off for holiday well in advance and as soon as i came back i heard the wages had gone into the bank i went and mine had not gone in i went to the place and the boss didn't even remember my name i have had no work since and my friend won't tell me why i have not had any work since i came bk frm holiday there is a woman who works there who started nagging me from the beginning i am wondering whether she might have lied her daughter is a manager to the boss so i have lost my job what can i do put it down to experience and go and find yourself a better little job to keep you going they are obviously not good employers to work for anyway however i would get your mum to ring up and demand that they pay you for your that you are owed EastEnders Social rule Eddie Guerrero Labour economics Pizza (Australian television) About a Boy Friends Dilbert Knots Landing Wal-Mart Hulk Hogan Labor theory of value The Devil Wears Prada Rosa Parks Economic inequality Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban One Tree Hill (TV series) Minimum wage Education in the People's Republic of China Harry Nilsson Alex Ferguson James Hanratty Daylight saving time Little Britain The Apprentice 3 Jack Charlton Escape from New York The Critic Graduate school The Shining (film) Big Brother (USA TV series) The Catcher in the Rye The Champions National Football League Wheel of Fortune Stone Cold Steve Austin Ocean's Twelve Dead Like Me The Star Wars Holiday Special Leo Frank Eight hour day Trish Stratus Neighbours Nico Robin The Untouchables Sin City The Contender (television series) Montreal Screwjob World Championship Wrestling Trapped in the Closet Captain Thunderbolt Fancy Crane Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Romulus and Remus 2000 Australian Grand Prix 1919 World Series Lisa Marie Varon Working time The Apprentice 2 Eric Bischoff Married... with Children George Galloway Charles Peace Cliff Richard The Inside The Smoking Room Badly Drawn Kitties 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Blood on the Tracks George Costanza International League Scenes from a Memory Michael Garibaldi Efficiency wages Blonde on Blonde Avenue Q Sam Cooke Chess (musical) Days of our Lives Canonical hours New Deal St. Elmo's Fire (film) Elvis Presley Philip J.
