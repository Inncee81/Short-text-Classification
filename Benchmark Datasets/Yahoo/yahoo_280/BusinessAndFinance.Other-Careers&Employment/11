sis neaver pays us back she is dont really know my bro is we give he take and he barly gives back and he lives with us well he sleep here he really dont live here cause he gone all the time even with the description you gave me i still don't know you well enough what area you live in how's the living condition and type of jobs you can get as a diplomat but first thing comes in mind that you're approaching for your diploma is congratulations you're taking a step forward to be qualified for more jobs however have you thought of going to college maybe pursuing some subject that you'd might like and make a career out of it something you like so you don't have to work a low paying repetitive non challenging job that you might not even enjoy it's almost every child's dream to take care and shelter their parents or one of them with a good living making sure that they have enough to eat and proper housing and needs set for good so you should be proud that you're thinking about it i live nearby an urban city but the living condition is low average there's a lot of households that live by pay check to pay check and high in crime rate a lot of my friends in high school held low paying jobs like in fast food industry and convenient stores to help and there are some who are the backbone of the families it sounds impressive maybe and they still want to go to college and all hoping to pursue their dreams they have more challenge than others who don't have jobs while at school but their only income source is from their jobs so they have to work as well i'm not here as a banker to talk you into opening an account but if you're sure that you want to open an account then you should compare don't just pick your first bank because of their mascots or because they give you free stuff do your homework if you browse online you'll find articles that give tips for account starters or first timers to learn about it to find out which one you need checking or saving or you can go into banks talk to a rep and see what they've got to offer you you can do this to compare one bank to another too just don't sign anything that will bind you to them get brochures about the bank and interest and additional fees they charge for transactions the conveniences can you do your billing online do they have a toll free number for how reliable are they you can ask this from people you know or even other costumers you want to move out you want a car and you want a life that's your goals but what's your priorities you should have a priority and then find out how much you need to save to get that remember buying cars also mean buying insurance and gas so do your research about the car too used cars are not the best because some may cost equal to or more than new cars just to fix some of the compartments if they need to about stocks there are many considerations you should be catious about do you know how to do it do you just happen to know that you're dad is doing it and he's doing well and then you want to do it because doing stocks require some research too per se about which companies' stocks to buy and how well they do do you know the procedures besides the transactions there are legal works that you're involved in so get to know them how much of your total money do you want to invest i suggest not to invest all your money just in case the outcome won't occur as expected so set a budget are you good at it it requires some skills alright not just luck or probability in gambling overall your priority comes first may it be getting your diploma getting a job opening an account or buying stocks just focus on one and then do the next if you're focused and not distracted you'll do well in any of them don't think about everything at the same time this won't do anything for you but to stress you out Mutual fund Insurance Life insurance Bank Poker jargon Microeconomics Annuity Internet fraud Bond Gambling Freeters Credit card Citigroup Economy of
