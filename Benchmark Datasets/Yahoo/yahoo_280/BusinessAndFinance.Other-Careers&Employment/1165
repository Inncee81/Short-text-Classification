i really need help please ok i'm quitting my job because i got written up about something and i feel like i never want to go there again i really support the company i work for but i couldn't stand being a detriment to them i wouldn't do anything to intentionally hurt that company i'm young now i don't know what to do because i wanted to be able to use them as a ref on a resume but i can't now and i wasted two years of my life i have no experience except customer service but know one will even kow that i don't want to go to school i just bought a new car it's not paid off so end of story i unintentionally ruined my entire life and i don't know how to fix it wonderful first don't sweat that you got written up it feels bad but that feeling will go away soon the best thing you could do is try to not do what you did to get written up second if you don't think this job is for you then start to look for another job when you're interviewing for another job if they ask why you're leaving your current job instead of saying that you don't like this job or that you can't perform it turn it into a positive experience by identifying what exactly you like about the new position of course the new potential employer may ask for references not just facts about where and when you worked at this current company but some positive references about your job is there someone at your current job you could use as a reference maybe a co worker who could vouch for you most importantly don't quit this job before you find another one while you're looking for a new job show your current employer that you could do a great job who knows maybe you could turn a negative into a positive your life isn't ruined everyone goes through difficult situations this may sound ironic but we need to go through difficult times in order to gain wisdom and maturity work is important find a job you enjoy and try to be the best at it Unemployment Drug test Freeters Sweatshop One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Friends Shaggy dog story Bon Jovi Knots Landing Procrastination Game programmer Carl Barks Transactional analysis Theory of conduct G-Man (Half-Life) The Apprentice 2 James T.
