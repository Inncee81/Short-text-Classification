what to do if your supervisor is against you my supervisor is against me because i am in relationship with somebody who used to be his subordinate and they did not get along neither kind of dirty rumors circulate in the workplace either about me or about my partner do not know if i need to look for an other job that's one of the reasons it's not a good idea to date someone where you work everyone gets in your business and personal business should not mix with business it would have been better to be very discrete at work when a supervisor gets it in for you there isn't much you can do except move to a job so that you change supervisors and they will bad mouth you to the new one or just start looking sooner or later they can get the goods on you to make you look very bad and tarnish your work record middle management usually is comprised of people who have risen to the height of their incompetance and that is why i worked hard to start my own business it's just so much better to come in to an office do my thing not rely on that particular client for all my and leave it takes time to get other office personnel to cooperate with you but managers are usually so glad to get their bookkeeping under control they don't give you much of a hassle i had one job so long ago and management did a job on me and i was so inexperienced and didn't have any idea how to protect myself or what to do i ended up quitting it was a dead end job so they did me a favor but when you are capable and get picked on there isn't much you can do discretely start looking for another job it is easier to get one when you have one and office politics is a good reason to move on usually you end up making more because you have more experience i don't think there isn't anyone that gives interviews that hasn't had to deal with office politics and it is a valid reason for moving on just be sure that your present job is not contacted until you are sure you want the next one do not give them permission to call unless they offer you the job and you accept but do explain the situation and do give the old job a couple of weeks to replace you and be sure to get all benefits coming to you like vacation etc good luck and i hope you find a place that is pleasant to work Mach kernel Social rule Workplace democracy Unemployment Pitaten Nicomachean Ethics Theory of conduct Principal-agent problem Transactional analysis Contract Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Poker jargon Cheating in Counter-Strike Friends Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair timeline Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Volleyball Vivian Solon Time Out of Mind Leeds United F.C.
