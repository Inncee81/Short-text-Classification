are my work boundaries too strict i work with people in their homes and i really like my job in the past i was exposed to really unhealthy home environments where parents and single adults have revealed tmi to the point where it was very personal and completely inappropriate to involve me looking back i've learned what are good boundaries nowadays whenever a person i work with asks me personal information i tell them a generic answer i get asked what i'm doing for the weekend and i just say oh laundry going to a movie errands and then i go back to talking about them or the activity on hand my supervisors have all told me i'm very professional but a few people have complained to them about how i seem mean and distant because i won't divulge details of my personal life but that isn't any of their business and also i probably won't be there for another year and would never see them again or meet outside of work are my boundaries too strict i've just learned to be work focused and professional well to certain questions like why aren't you married i laughed and said you're funny and then changed the subject then there are times where someone i work with in their home will ask me what i'm doing for the weekend and i'll say oh just cleaning but i see you've got your plate full with what else are you planning i always try to remain polite and courteous to the people i work with and to my coworkers but that doesn't mean it's their business to know other personal information which i've learned from the past was a mistake to share such as having a boyfriend my family sensitive issues and what my opinion is on them etc i once answered the do you have a bf question only to have a mother constantly ask me why i wasn't engaged yet and when she was my age she was already married and then another time when i told a person who i worked with in their home i'd be at a certain theater to watch a movie they went there and said they wanted to watch it with me no they arent its up to you what you reveal about your private life just as it is for them they need to suck it up Friends Plame affair Humphrey Bogart Social rule EastEnders Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Motion picture rating system Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 About a Boy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Sexual orientation Extreme Programming Have I Got News For You The Ashlee Simpson Show George Costanza Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Milton H.
