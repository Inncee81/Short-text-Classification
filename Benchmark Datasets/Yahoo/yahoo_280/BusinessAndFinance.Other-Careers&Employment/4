should i present my boss with a weekly productivity log i usually help various co workers on assignments around the office should i submit a log to my boss every week listing my input around the office i just want him to know that i am being productive or should i just continue to keep quiet and do my work when my boss comes over to my desk it's obvious that i am working on something and i am being productive this is not high school why should i provide him with a weekly log my boss did not request a weekly log however my performance review mentioned a problem with prioritizing assignments and meeting deadlines and i don't think he realize how much work i have and why i can't meet deadlines i think if i presented a weekly productivity log will just give him another reason to be bossy annoying and nag the h ll out of me i already feel like i am being watched carefully something like a fish in a fish bowl one key skill that people who advance in jobs have is the ability to understand the bottom line if you have a major assignment that is important to your boss and organization that is a priority over helping co workers with their work when you say that you can't meet deadlines it sounds as if you're saying that your job responsibilites are impossible to fulfill the productivity log is probably not a good idea because it would only prove your boss's point and it would encourage your boss to micro manage you a better approach would be to discuss with your boss the main priorities of the job so that you can get those assignments done first Dynamic Systems Development Method Anarchism and society Education in the People's Republic of China Rational Unified Process Extreme Programming Information Technology Infrastructure Library Probation officer George W.
