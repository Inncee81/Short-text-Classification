how can i find more jobs to apply to i live in michigan and we have the highest unemployment rate and the least amount of jobs i log onto careerbuilder monster and hot jobs daily i also have pulled lists off of hoover's forbes etc to use as a guide i then apply via the company website i have received calls and a few interviews but the competition is stiff the feedback i am getting is that available positions with my expertise and qualifications the recruiters are receiving between resumes minimum how can i make myself stand out my resume and cover letter are good and i think my interview skills are pretty good too i just haven't had enough open positions to apply to and therefore close the deal it's so frustrating are there any other job boards out there or is there something else i should be doing i feel like it is really a numbers gain the more positions i apply for the better my chances any ideas i am getting so frustrated i have also tried craig's list but they don't seem to have too many professional careers on there right now i am lucky if i can find two positions to apply to per day and apparently so are others applying to the same job yes i have posted on monster careerbuilder and hot jobs i get a lot of recruiters and work from home opportunities i removed them from the board think about it logically if there aren't enough jobs and too many people unemployed employers here don't need to go looking for applicants applicants need to look for them one of the key points that i always taught during job training classes is networking and cold calling networking basically is using the relationships that you have and using them to learn of new and potential leads the vast majority of jobs are not obtained through resumes or applications but through word of mouth the best way to network is to advertise that you are job seeking and sell yourself for more tips http www quintcareers com networking guide html http www quintcareers com networking html also try cold calling companys and set up an informational interview this way you can get your foot in the door it may not lead you to a job but it can lead you in the direction of a potential job remember everyone knows everyone in certain industries http www handbag com careers careerchange coldcall http www careerlinkbc com interview html http www nzherald co nz section story cfm c id objectid World Wide Web Unemployment Minimum wage HyperText Transfer Protocol Apple Computer Strategic management Economic inequality Cross site scripting Baseball Website Uniform Resource Locator Gmail Common Unix Printing System Education in the People's Republic of China Software engineering Search engine optimization Network effect Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Domain Name System Plame affair LiveJournal Labour economics Poker jargon Education in the United States Computer Unemployment benefit Graduate school Advertising Spice Girls E-mail spam HTML Education in Portugal The Colbert Report UK Singles Chart Theory of conduct R__sum__ Electronic commerce Enterprise content management Expert system JavaServer Pages Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wget Economy of Colombia Representational State Transfer America Online Capitalism Google Ajax (programming) RuneScape Spam (electronic) Artificial neural network Barrister Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Walt Disney World College Program Inflation Diving Internet fraud Social rule HTTP cookie Dog agility The Apprentice 2 Neopets Operational amplifier Insurance Ra (board game) Wireless Application Protocol Backgammon Tariff Transmission Control Protocol Web traffic Call centre Psychology Wi-Fi HTML element Jeff Gannon Anarchism and society Database Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Quotation mark Computer virus Web server Warren Buffett Milton H.
