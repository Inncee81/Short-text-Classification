is it too early to ask for a raise i'm working at a car dealership as a receptionist in my hometown and i've been working here for about months i started out at hour and i haven't moved from that spot since i started back in late november since i've started working i've taken on more responsibility learning new skills and i've been doing more projects i've also been working days a week hours a week for the past month and a half i only take off one weekday and one saturday every month so i don't go totally crazy and to spend a night with my family and my boyfriend if i do get a raise how much should i ask for an extra ten cents extra cents yes you should ask for a raise but you should not ask for a specific amount unless a you've done your research on that amount and b you aim high so as to prevent the winner's curse of getting exactly what you ask for too low of a raise from the website cited below if you feel the need to ask for a raise the most positive way to approach this is to ask for extra work and responsibility and link this to a pay rise if not immediately then in the future this is a grown up approach that employers respond to better than simply asking for more pay for doing the same job another positive approach is to ask for a performance related bonus or pay increase subject to achieving more based on standards or output greater than current or expected levels this again should be received positively by the employer because you're offering something in return and not simply asking for more money which most people tend to do Inflation Unemployment Daylight saving time London Congestion Charge Graduate school Blackjack Social Security (United States) Gross domestic product Microeconomics National Football League Education in the People's Republic of China Economic inequality FairTax Hypoglycemia Life insurance Supply and demand Keynesian economics The Apprentice 2 Poker jargon Social Security debate (United States) Billboard Hot 100 Betting (poker) Working time Wal-Mart Volleyball Solar cell Progressive tax Labour economics Solar variation Principal-agent problem $ale of the Century Monetary policy Labor theory of value Minimum wage Jet engine Wheel of Fortune New Deal Education in Japan Speed limit Headlight Hollywood Squares Carburetor Slot machine Kyoto Protocol Social rule Evan Mecham Software engineering Road safety Final Fantasy XI ITV Publicly funded medicine Education in Australia Insurance Guild Wars Credit card Tax GED Family Feud Taxation in the United States Sumo MMORPG Milton H.
