if i already said i would accept a lower salary range can i negotiate up once i get an offer i am flying out on tuesday for a third interview in nashville after two phone interviews the second interview was with the cfo part owner and he asked about salary requirements i through out the high 's knowing that this position paid well and told him i didn't wish to throw a number on myself however after researching their job postings i have since seen the position posted on monster and hotjobs as paying k per year assuming the on site interview goes well and in the past i have done well on these occasions is there any room to negotiate a higher amount than i initially stated my wife said that if they make me an offer below k i should just ask surprised and tell them i saw the range as k and i am comfortable with the low end of that range knowing that i will be compensated as i take on new responsibilities what should i say if they bring this up again while i am on site which is a likely scenario i am not sure i agree with the first response it's not uncommon to negotiate a salary i am coming in from out of town so it is possible that my geographical region doesn't pay as well as theirs and i would be under paid for the responsibility i am taking on ok don't follow your wife's advice that is incredibly bad job interview acceptance etiquette part of why you are being considered is because you said the salary range you did it was your mistake not researching this information before that question came up or coming up with a more general response that doesn't set a cap on your worth as in i am looking to increase from where i am now and understandably be compensated for the fact i will have to relocate if i am considered for the position it is negotiable you take the position for what you are offered and negotiate after you are hired and are doing the job for months to a year after you prove you are worth more that or look for other opportunities and learn from your mistake Plame affair Salary cap Microeconomics Professor Satchel Paige Betting (poker) Graduate school Economic inequality Supply and demand Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Blackjack National Kidney Foundation Singapore Estoppel Contract Google The Apprentice 2 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Karl Rove John Kerr Craps Rick Santorum 1994 baseball strike Mutual fund Steve Jobs Investment bank Time Out of Mind Internet fraud The Shining (film) National Football League 2004-05 NHL lockout The End of the World (Doctor Who) Professional wrestling slang Tenshinhan Dream Job (Season 2) Avenue Q Sharon Tate Wal-Mart Speed limit Education in the People's Republic of China Theory of conduct Alan Keyes Affirmative action Unemployment Wang Mang Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Shaggy dog story Extreme Programming Turbocharger Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans GED Friends Publicly funded medicine Member of the European Parliament Dog agility Killian documents Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Knots Landing Oxford English Dictionary Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Piccolo Junior Saga Labor theory of value Social rule Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Life insurance Central processing unit Surveillance Datalore (TNG episode) Insurance Incarnations of Immortality Public transport Warrant Officer Slow Train Coming Academia Infantilism Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Student loan Jessica Lynch Ra (board game) Fox hunting Education in Germany Babe Ruth Search engine optimization
