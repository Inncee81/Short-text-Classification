what happens when your employer or recuiter for a job you want says this i will keep your information on file in the event we have an entry level opening thanks for contacting us depending on where you live there is a requirement as to how long an employer must keep an application most would say that this is a blow off response or canned response but there are times when it is really true it may not be all that often however when i did some recruiting i did say that to someone and they responded by saying nice blow off lady and hung up their qualifications were good however they were not exactly what my client at the time was seeking months later that same client had an entry level position and the candidate that hung up on me was the first one i called they were a perfect fit i set up the interview and after a few meetings with the client the candidate was offered the job i do not suggest that you are rude to a recruiter but know that even blow off lines are sometimes not blow offs they are simply not right nows i know as a candidate you cannot always wait however we cannot always hire or fill positions either the candidate thanked me for helping him but i kindly reminded him that he may want to watch what he says in the future as most people will not have as much desire to prove a smart a wrong never burn a bridge you never know when you may need to cross it i wish you well Plame affair Call centre Graduate school CPU cache Redundant array of independent disks The Apprentice 2 Enterprise content management Domain Name System Unemployment G-Man (Half-Life) Apple Computer Supply and demand UCAS Whois Professor Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Requirements analysis Master Control Program Expert system Cheating in Counter-Strike Internet fraud Eliot Spitzer Management Social rule Job interview Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Education in the People's Republic of China Lawyer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Affirmative action Clinical depression Microeconomics Portable Document Format Paralegal Simon Commission Immigration to the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton Agent handling Stopping e-mail abuse Therion (band) Information Services Procurement Library Jeff Gannon Hash table Avenue Q Efficiency wages McKinsey & Company Kasparov versus The World Evan Mecham Dot-com King Crimson Human sexual behavior Mac OS X Election Enlargement of the European Union BitTorrent Ajax (programming) Dog agility Ralph Nader Tattoo Vicente Fox Software engineering Mixed martial arts Social work Gmail Single Transferable Vote Wal-Mart British Civil Service Blog Patent application George W.
