if a mailed paycheck has not been received what should the employer do the employer said it takes days to put a trace on mailed items but isn't it their responsibility to make sure employees are paid timely how long should an employee have to wait and especially since the check may never come they have the correct address so that wasn't the problem yes i live very close by and can pick it up i only asked them to mail it because i was on vacation and couldn't get there they expect me to keep waiting i guess but no can do they probably don't want to pay the stop payment fee in my opinion the employer should issue another check and stop payment on the one that was mailed previously obviously something is amiss here are you sure they even mailed it United States Postal Service Internet fraud Social Security (United States) Domain Name System E-mail Unemployment benefit Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Advance fee fraud Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Opera (web browser) Mail fraud Credit card Wal-Mart 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Annuity The Amazing Race Spam (electronic) Health insurance CPU cache Shaggy dog story Plame affair Poker jargon GED Insurance Surveillance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Schabir Shaik Trial Publicly funded medicine National Kidney Foundation Singapore Drug test Royal Mail Probation officer FairTax E-mail spam Social rule Identity theft Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Call centre Rick Santorum Evan Mecham Keynesian economics Hotmail Mutual fund Direct marketing Milton H.
