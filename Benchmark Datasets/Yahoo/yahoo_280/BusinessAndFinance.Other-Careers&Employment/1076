should i start looking for another job so soon last week my boss called my department together and informed us that his supervisor told him that if we don't step up our work that she will let us go and outsource our jobs to another company i agree i can always improve and i try to do so everyday but the problem is that she isn't happy with the work my boss is doing for the most part i've only been here eight months and i planned on looking for another job after my year rolled around but the fact she has threatened to fire us if we don't step up has me worried i've never been fired before and i want to leave the company on my own terms so should i start looking for another job now yep start looking it's not worth it to have that kind of threat on your head if the boss isn't happy with your department's performance but you're doing superior work on your own then either look for another department or job but try to leave on your own terms try to find something else and then give notice that you're leaving Outsourcing Knots Landing Friends Michael Garibaldi EastEnders Eric Bischoff Ocean's Twelve Offshoring Goodness and value theory Unemployment Donald Rumsfeld Plame affair Principal-agent problem Call centre Pok__mon Live!
