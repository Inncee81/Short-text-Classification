for managers and company hirers please what should someone do let's say that someone has been a willing and conscientious worker for over years they've become the victim of a sustained two year campaign from specific members of staff but the normal grievance process has been sidelined by the senior management to protect those members of staff responsible for the victimisation as well as the good name of the company if the employee was to seek another job outside that company and they are not asked directly by the new company if they are on sick leave should the potential employee reveal this or just hope that the new employers don't find out until the potential employee has secured the new job and proven themselves is it harmful to a job application to admit to stress having been the victim of a sustained campaign of overwork unrealistic deadlines and plausible denial by the more senior staff who are grossly incompetent at their job and badly organised the victim can provide proof of incompetence your thoughts please thank you so far this is a uk employment based question so far no one has offered up any pointers as to who could confirm these statements i e hr manager company owner or website details i will continue to look forward to new answers as stated val the grievance route has been sidelined by the senior management there is no one higher and there is no union hence the reason for moving jobs the senior managers have been aware of this issue for months and they chose to ignore it all along the person concerned has dependants and commitments and is looking for another job at present but this issue of long term illness due to stress is the main factor that may hinder hiring this is not the first case of this kind at least two other members of staff have been treated this way within the last years and after leaving the 'constructive dismissal' claim did not work for them there is solid evidence that the most prominent victimiser has stolen from the company and the senior managers simply dismiss this as untrue they refuse to look at the evidence it would be harmful to admit to stress and a sustained campaign of overwork any interviewer won't know the people you would be talking about and might assume the worst i e that you can't handle the stress if you are on sick leave then the new employer does not need to know references tend to be very generic in the uk e g john smith worked for company x for years between and if you current company started mentioning sick leave or anything else in your reference and you didn't get a job as a result then you could take legal action therefore companies tend to stick to generic references one of the main things interviewers look for apart from ' can this person do the job' is can i work with this person if you start criticising your current colleagues that will scare interviewers off who might think you are not easy to get on with good luck Plame affair Coercion Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Karl Rove Insurance Unemployment Life insurance Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) SCO-Linux controversies Contract Labor theory of value Theodicy Brian Lenihan Involuntary commitment Killian documents First Amendment to the United States Constitution The Apprentice 2 Estoppel Vivian Solon Abortion debate Abortion Trade union Expert system Appeal Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Probation officer Torture Workplace democracy National Kidney Foundation Singapore Capital punishment Ex-gay Plame affair timeline Intelligent design Slander and libel Arguments for and against drug prohibition Roswell UFO incident Wealth Holocaust denial Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda Atheism Health insurance Deprogramming Management Democracy Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Corporate governance Decompression sickness Capitalism Free trade Cultural Revolution Domestic violence Reparative therapy Alcoholics Anonymous Mediation Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Project Blue Book British national identity card Theory of conduct David Kelly Strategic management Rick Santorum George Galloway 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Social rule British National Party Michael D.
