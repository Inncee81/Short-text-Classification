any tax associates in a big firm or anywhere else how do you like your job just wondering what you think about being a tax associate for those who apply to this question just wanna hear some opinions on the negatives and the positives about your workplace your job why you chose a career in tax etc i'm in the same line and i wanted some opinions about this career option thanks i answered this in another spot but will list it here again i'm not at a big but am speaking as someone at a large regional firm pros you will never stop learning or reach a point in your job where you feel you have bottomed out if you have the ambition you will learn more each month than you would a year in school you will find yourself rise at a faster rate than your peers who go into sales in just a few years not only will you be making a nice living starting pay isn't bad either but you will find yourself talking to the heads of large corporations as their equal in shorter time than you would think cfos etc will go to you for advice job security if you are good at what you do you will never find yourself out of work for long unless that is your choice the demand for good help is too great and that will never change to the point that you can't find a position to meet your needs cons the hours especially during tax season this hurts especially if you have young children but if you are not too much of a family person and the family friends you have are flexible this shouldn't be a reason to avoid the occupation you will probably know within a month of busy season whether you can handle the workload the specialization if you concentrate on personal tax for instance there isn't much use for that outside of the field except for maybe as a financial advisor if you specialize in smaller corps million in rev and do more than tax work you can find yourself becoming more suited for a controller position if you love tax though this isn't an issue though as there is always work for someone who is competant i chose my career in tax because that was the position available starting out but i do not regret it compared to audit i'm in the office more and have a more steady commute etc but by working with the size clients that i do i am able to get out of the office a lot and not be stuck in profx all day really depends upon what specific duties you will be able to do if you are stuck doing only trust returns i personally would grow to hate that but if you are dealing with all levels of the engagement and all types of clients then the job can be a lot more exciting at least for myself my best advice big firm experience is great but if you want more variety in your work you can consider switching to a smaller national or a large regional firm easily and pick what you want to do once you have a years worth of experience Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Inflation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economic inequality Social rule Mutual fund Tax Warren Buffett CPU cache Life insurance Flat tax Taxation in the United States Expert system Law firm Corporate governance Avenue Q Supply and demand Insurance Microsoft Extreme Programming Graduate school Education in Portugal Shaggy dog story Canadian Senate Computer Poker jargon Progressive tax W.
