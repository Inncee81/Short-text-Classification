how do i get my boss to realize i know what i'm doing i started a new job about three months ago i really like the new company but i'm having problems with my boss i have been working in this industry for over years and while some of the procedures are a little different at the new company the work is basically the same as i was doing before i feel very confident in my abilities and i've been told that i do my job well my boss is barely months older than i am and has just a little more experience he spends so much time checking up on what i'm doing and reminding me about the things that need to get done most of which i've already done that he often doesn't have time to do his own job i feel that since i've been here i've more than proven myself and shown everyone that i am competent i'm not used to having someone constantly follow up on every little thing that i'm doing does anyone have any suggestions for how i can get him to ease up a little bit and just let me do my job i feel like i'm being suffocated if you don't have formal reviews or one is not due soon then ask your boss for a chat about your work so far discuss how both you and he feels you are doing at your work how you've mastered the actual work followed procedures fitted in to the organization got on with other employees etc talk about anything you could do to improve your job and expand your role somewhere you can fit in about how you are used to being left to manage your job without constant supervision reassure him you will ask him for advice and guidance if you are unsure and won't go blundering on guessing how things are done also say you welcome feedback sooner rather than later if he feels you need help or direction don't let the age thing come into it God Emperor of Dune Strategic management Workplace democracy Extreme Programming Social rule The Critic Traumatic incident reduction ISO 9000 Leadership Sharon Tate The Apprentice 2 Blonde on Blonde Kim Possible Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Alex Ferguson Michael Garibaldi The Smoking Room George Costanza Kill Bill Friends Pok__mon Live!
