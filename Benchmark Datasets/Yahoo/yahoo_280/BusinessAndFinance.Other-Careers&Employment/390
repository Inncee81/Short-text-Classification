when do employers typically call to verify past employment just something i've wondered about do potential employers generally call previous employers prior to a pre employment interview or after the interview if they are considering hiring you i know every company has their own way of doing things just looking for a general idea it depends on the size of the company and the nature of the job i took at job with a mutual fund company once and they called me in the office after i had been there for months because they had a question on some information put on my application i explained the miscommunication and all was well but i was surprised that they were looking into information from my job application months after i had started the job when i've hired people i checked their references after the interview when i knew i was interested in hiring if there was no interest i wasn't interested in spending time checking references just make sure you don't use a reference that would not say nice things about you Plame affair Background check Expert system Milton H.
