i was not given an offer after my summer internship how do i recover as i attempt to recruit for another job i was denied an offer because i wasn't able to effectively work in a team environment i am currently looking for ways to improve demonstrate my teamwork skills i am now looking to get a job with a consulting company my internship was with an accounting company by the way what additional things should i do to prepare for recruiting also if during an interview i am asked why i didn't receive an offer how should i respond lastly if i am not sure whether anyone from my internship would have only good things to say about me they may mention both positive and negative things should i use them as references you should read everything you can get your hands on relating to working in a team setting this seems to be something that everyone is promoting now though i happen to think that it creates crappy employees that can't think for themselves i would say that one very important thing that people tend to miss is keeping a positive attitude throughout the entire process don't introduce anything personal about yourself tell them what you can do to help the company make sure you wear something very nice and conservative be very nice to the administrative assistant that schedules the interview i doubt someone would ask why you did not receive an offer but if they do i would simply tell them that it was extremely competitve and unfortunately you did not get an offer never use someone as a reference without first consulting them and asking if they would say positive things if you don't have their permission to use as a reference i would never use them Theory of conduct The Apprentice 2 CPU cache Intern Social rule Education in the People's Republic of China Hatake Kakashi Management RuneScape Sharon Tate Karl Rove Milton H.
