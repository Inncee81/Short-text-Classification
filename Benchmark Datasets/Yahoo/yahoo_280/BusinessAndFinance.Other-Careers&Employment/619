i find that my conscience is eroding as i get older partly it's due to my difficulty in finding employment i am able to work and am not lazy or stupid but have had trouble getting job offers it seems like interviews go downhill fast i don't know what to do and am thinking of turning to crime burglary perhaps it sounds exciting i'll admit that some of this comes from reading the novels of lawrence block in which a burglar is portrayed in a positive light also i have begun to resent the rich if i were to take up burglary i would concentrate on those who could best afford to lose some of their money or possessions i would prefer to steal from large corporations but don't know how to go about this anybody have any experience making a living doing high end burglary do it legally become a reposessor or a bounty hunter same thrill less consequences oh and stealing from rich people isn't stealing from rich people it's stealing from rich people's insurance companies The Hobbit W.
