my husband is taking a job in another state if i quit my job to go with him can i collect unemployment we live in pa and are moving to tx i'm not sure if i'll qualify for unemployment benefits until i find work any suggestions unfortunately no you can only receive benefits if you lost your job through no fault of your own and this applies in all states you will be leaving your place of employment voluntarily regardless of the reason therefore making you ineligible however if you are really liked at your place of work you can always ask if you can collect ui benefits it all depends on them they can say yes and therefore it means they will not contest you receiving the benefit or they can say no meaning they will tell the ui office you left on your own making you automatically ineligible Unemployment benefit Unemployment Food Stamp Program Efficiency wages Social Security (United States) Termination of employment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Divorce Labour economics Trade union Freeters Professor Minimum wage Inflation Naturalization Labor theory of value Capitalism Economic inequality Compensation of employees Employment Indian nationality law Assignment (law) Wal-Mart Welfare reform Centrelink National Insurance Full employment Life insurance Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution Taxation in the United States 401(k) Flat tax Conscription Anarchism and capitalism Unemployment types Trademark Offshoring Hartz concept Workers' compensation Heir Apparent Florida Central Voter File Redundant array of independent disks Reaganomics History of British nationality law Wage slavery Employment in Hong Kong Copyright law of the United Kingdom Immigration to Australia United States presidential line of succession Health insurance Rights and responsibilities of marriages in the United States Expert system Aneurin Bevan Say's law Plame affair Working time Current Population Survey Immigration to the United States Sweatshop Principal-agent problem Insurance United States Department of Labor Class struggle Alexander Technique National Labor Federation Graduate school Welfare trap Copyright Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution British nationality law Microeconomics Gross domestic product Privacy Edith Nourse Rogers Division of labour Technocratic movement Underemployment H-1B visa Bruce Johnson Contract Dog agility The Amazing Race Charitable trust Prostate cancer Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Illegal immigration Boys from the Blackstuff Value system Ghetto Opportunity cost Civil rights Kelo v.
