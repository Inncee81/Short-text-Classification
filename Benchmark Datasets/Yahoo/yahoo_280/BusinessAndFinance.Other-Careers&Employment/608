how can i increase my self confidence in job interviews i am insecure of my self because my body is think and slim compared to other average guys when i attend an interview i feel that my slim body makes me think that the other person when he sees me he get the idea that i will probably not fully fill my position as a grownup guy and i always felt that other people see me as a teenager because of my body am years old i am not muscular at all not even a little fat that make me so insecure when i stand to other avrage guys i am meters high feet and weight kilos pounds am not short but thin my question is how can i make my self feel better about my self psychologically i am working on my body now lifting some weights but in the mean wile i need to improve my self confidence from the inside thanks wear a nice suit that is tailored to fit your frame your clothing says a lot and if you feel good about your outfit you will feel better about yourself walk into the interview knowing that you got the job you're just there to simply make discussion with them relax during the interview don't sit rigidly just act very confident smile when you walk into the interview and shake everyone's hands remember their names and remember to say their name at the end of the interview bring in a notepad and don't be shy about taking notes if they start talking about details of the job that will look like you are truly interested and you are ready to learn the job etc remember be confident they don't care about your body they care about your brain and your communication skills good luck Social rule Milton H.
