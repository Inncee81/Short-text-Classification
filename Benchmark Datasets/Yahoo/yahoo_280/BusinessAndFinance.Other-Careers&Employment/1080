what are the general rules of casual shop work i'm currently working in a shop under casual terms meaning i'm not entitled to holiday leave i'm able to refuse hours but likewise the shop do not have to give me hours i want to leave as soon as i find a new job basically my manager treats me like a subhuman and it's not worth the hassle anymore my question is because i'm a casual worker do i have to give notice this wasn't outlined when i received the terms of my employment and i can't get a straight answer out of the hr department i'd love to just drop my notice off one evening and start a new job the next day but i'm worried that even though i'm casual i won't be able to do this anyone any wiser than i am on this i think you are wise either way but you should consider the following the manger should be listed as a reference on your next application to show that even though he is a jerk you were able to work as a subhuman for a decent amount of time its just professional to give a weeks notice to lousy companies when you recieve th offer from the next company state though you would like to give your company notice and that you are on a casual status and will most likely be able to start right away good luck and keep your head up Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wheel of Fortune Unemployment benefit Blackjack New York Giants Ken Jennings Drag racing Unemployment Labour economics Poker jargon Dorama The Apprentice 2 National Football League The Apprentice 3 Education in the People's Republic of China The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Outsourcing Appeal Jennifer Lopez The Joker's Wild Sweatshop United Kingdom corporation tax Jeopardy!
