new job big problem i have currently recieved a promotion as a manager at a fairly large retail store and noticed that two other managers are showing poor management skills one manager is extremley rude and disrespectful to the employees she screams at them in front of customers and expects them to finish impossible tasks the other is stealing merchandise and is having her family buy things for her while she is working which is strictley against store policey i am not the type to tattle but i think something should be said to the supervisor considering i just started the position should i wait till the supervisor catches them or pretty much be a big tattle if it is a fairly large store they must have a personnel department they are equipped to handle both problems there are legal ways to handle these problems and you shouldn't try to handle them yourself i would simply write a letter to the personnel department and tell them that it embarrasses you to see a manager being disrespectful the disrespectful manager may just need a little training theft is another matter and should only be handled by trained personnel don't get involved personally you may be wrong i would write the letter and give the department names but please don't sign it Electronic commerce Wal-Mart Call centre Theory of conduct Floppy disk Retailer Plame affair Trailer Park Boys Social rule Tag Bulk vending Incident Command System Construction The Apprentice 2 Grand Theft Auto (game) Management 2000 Australian Grand Prix Chess strategy and tactics Ocean's Twelve Poker jargon Outsourcing Sears Holdings Corporation Best Buy Inventory Computer Shaggy dog story Internet fraud MapleStory Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland Burial Division of labour Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina The Apprentice 3 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Eaton's Florida Central Voter File Extreme Programming Warez Department store Computer virus Pointer Management information system Negima Diseconomies of scale Target Corporation Union Pacific Railroad Beavis and Butt-head CPU cache 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Aerial (dance move) Classified information Bicycle lighting Dyslexia Education in the People's Republic of China Customer relationship management Cheating in Counter-Strike Hong Kong Police Force Norway national football team Theodicy Password Freeters Security guard Canadian Tire Computer numbering formats Spring operating system Secretar__a de Inteligencia CPU design Craps Risk management New York City Police Department Spice Girls Criticism of libertarianism Royal Air Force Animal Crossing Data mining United Parcel Service Debugging Japanese toilet Surveillance Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse M60 machine gun Ashton-Tate Contract Spidey Super Stories Copland My Little Pony Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005 Microsoft The Bill Scientology beliefs and practices Sega Saturn Shopping Fry's Electronics Utility cycling Time Out of Mind Digital rights management Sandy Koufax Microeconomics
