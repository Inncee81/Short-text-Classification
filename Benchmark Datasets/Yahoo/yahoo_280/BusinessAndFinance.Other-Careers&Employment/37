how often does this happen just moved into a new appartment in a big city i have one roomate who is female right from the start there has been a strong sexual undercurrent between us she is very attractive and extremley smart i figure sooner or later will eventually go at in the next months whats the best way to do it right if it does happen so it doesnt become awkard or wrong i have heard stories guys and girls moving into gether and of course the sexual undercurrent reares its head and relationships and even marriages have resulted from living together i guess its because you basically live together without the sexual benfit and become friends and now what each is like and then eventually if that spark exists you end up sleeping together am i wrong or crazy please help i would just say be careful if you're definitely excited about your new place and you couldn't be happier then don't screw it up don't take advantage of her when she comes home wasted one day and you're there for here to come on to unless you want it to feel more like hooking up but living together instead of dating its really up to you how it happens just show her what it could be like living with a well kept guy make sure you pick up after yourself and put the toilet seat down just make sure to do the small things that boyfriends forget after dating be cute and romantic and you shouldn't screw up Friends Humphrey Bogart One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story EastEnders Teen Girl Squad Dead Like Me The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Sex and the City Undergrads Kodocha Futurama (TV series - season 2) Brian Griffin Jon Secada Pitaten Human sexual behavior Laura Schlessinger Knots Landing Pok__mon Live!
