trouble scheduling second job interview dont want to lose current job while i search for a new one i am applying for a different job one that i probably will be happier with and i need to figure out when to schedule a second interview i already went on a first interview and i met with two people and i had to request half a day off at my current job which i've only had for a month my problem is that i cannot afford to request more time and i dont want to lose this job for an interview without knowing if i will get the job the lady that wants to interview me is available at a time that im not what should i do see how flexible she is to meet at lunch time or immediately after work if she is hardnosed about it the second interview can be at x or y time on this date and that is all i have available then you have to weigh your options if you know that if you request the time off from your current job even if you offered to make up the time the next day they will say no then call in leave early that day i don't want to encourage you to lie but if you are working for a company that is so inflexible that they will not let you off an hour early when it is prearranged then perhaps you don't want to work there anyways and should do what you can to get out Social rule Unemployment Life insurance Shaggy dog story Probation officer Education in the People's Republic of China Call centre Indian nationality law Computer Plame affair Ravi Shastri Wal-Mart George W.
