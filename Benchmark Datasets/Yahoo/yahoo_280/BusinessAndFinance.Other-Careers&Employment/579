changing careers not enough experience hi guys i have well over years working experience in investment firms and have worked in other roles mainly in a financial management capacity now i recently applied for a business manager position in an insurance firm the owner needs someone to help build the business to a new level and needs someone with computer marketing budgeting hr skills which i have i have a science degree with additonal specialization in accounting and investments one thing i don't have is an insurance backgound now the owner knows this and we have had a telephone interview he had me take an online aptitude test and is now calling me in for a personal interview what do you think the best focus will be for the interview to be ready with insurance jargon or to focus on how my previous skills can be applied effectively to a new venture in my opinion you should focus on how your knowledge skills and abilities are interchangeable and can be applied to other industries if you were to use insurance terminology without actually having experience in the field it may appear rehearsed and unnatural in which can be misconstrued as lying or not being truthful during the interview process this is only my opinion as i do not have as much experience in the workforce as you but it makes perfect sense to me Economic inequality Insurance Management information system Institutional fund management Outsourcing Venture capital Requirements analysis Model (economics) Life insurance Second language acquisition Financial services Ross School of Business Science Management Strategic management Mergers and acquisitions Microeconomics Capitalism Epistemology Risk management Graduate school Economy of Singapore Privatization Finance Lloyd's of London Warren Buffett Citigroup Workplace democracy Supply and demand Construction Economy of the Republic of Ireland Annuity Mathematics Unemployment benefit Education in the United States IBM Medical school United Kingdom corporation tax Personal finance Accountancy Mediation Internationalization and localization Economics NASDAQ Psychology Hacker Economy of Russia Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Economy of Belgium Contract W.
