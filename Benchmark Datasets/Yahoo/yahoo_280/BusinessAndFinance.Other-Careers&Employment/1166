job interview i have a job interview for the new kohl's that is hiring located in my town i was just wondering if anyone has any advice for job interviews being that this is my first one and i am a bit nervous since it is a group interview oh and if you have any experience working at kohl's can you tell me what it is like working there any tips would be greatly appreciated by the way the job interview is minutes long first of all do a bit of research just go the the kohl's website to see who founded it and such and get some questions to ask even if you don't really want to know write them down or put them to memory to ask whether about the job or business this way it shows you have an interest in the company wear something casual and dressy something that says 'i will put effort to look nice but not so that it's distracting' don't wear anything revealing or short and nothing too fashionable stick with the basics mid cut skirt with a tasteful print and a solid blouse wear sensible but attractive shoes no stilletos sit straight up hands in lap and ankles crossed when asked a question look them directly in the eyes and answer honestly but not obviously be kind and watch your grammar as in don't say 'ain't' don't interrupt over the others and look at them as they speak this gives them an impression of being a people person you might be asked a series of questions so have answers ready why did you quit you quit your last job you didn't have a previous job so instead state the reason you are looking to work there if it's just because you need money or your parents are making you don't say that say instead that you are looking to pay for college this shows them that you set yourself financial goals and have an aim in life what hours are you available don't be afraid to be honest in this one if you a hundred percent flexible that's great but if you can't work wednesdays for whatever reason tell them that they understand that you have a life outside work what are good qualities about yourself here you'll be worried that saying one thing might make you seem boastful but not saying that might not sell you v well here's what you do when stating what you are good at state that 'you've been told' that or 'you've gotten awards' or 'you feel you are proficient' for example say you are good with people state 'i've been told that i'm friendly and easy to get along with ' it's always smart to say when applying for any position that deals with customer service that you enjoy helping people be careful not to sound robotic when saying it though try telling a made up if needed story about how you went to some place and a cashier or worker person helped you in a surprisingly fantastic way and add that you'd like to do that for people works every time also if you were in any clubs in school state that because clubs socialisation what are your bad qualities you have bad qualities maybe you don't like getting up early but try telling the ones that are less bad such as 'i'm clumsy' good luck Social rule Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story The Apprentice 2 Milton H.
