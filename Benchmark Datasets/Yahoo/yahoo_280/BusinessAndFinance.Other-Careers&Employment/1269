a company grocery store wouldn't bother doing a background check if they didn't intend to hire right i had an interview at my local meijer grocery store for the stocker position i felt the interview went very well and at the end of the interview i filled out a paper so that they could do a background check this means i probably got the job right i mean as long as everything in the background check is good then i should be hired right i should also note that the guy who interviewed me said he would call me on monday or tuesday night which is what lead me to believe i will be hired if the background check is good and there is no reason for it to be bad not necessarily you'd still have to be better in their mind then everyone else that they had interviewed for the job the background check just means they want to make sure that there is nothing in your background that would prevent them from hiring you it doesn't mean that they will hire you Time Out of Mind Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Poker jargon Wal-Mart Target Corporation Meijer Wall Street Background check Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Pretty Good Privacy Ocean's Twelve Computer virus Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Eric Bischoff Homestar Runner Sample chess game Supermarket Jayson Blair John Peel Jeff Gannon The Drew Carey Show Elections in Malaysia Friends The Apprentice 2 Kasparov versus The World Avenue Q CPU cache The Apprentice 3 Draw poker Meat Loaf Marilyn Monroe The Ashlee Simpson Show Beetle in an Anthill Social rule Theory of conduct Dragnet (drama) Chess strategy and tactics United Food and Commercial Workers Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Outsourcing Indianapolis 500 Charmed Sheepshead World Championship Wrestling Good Times Drug test W.
