how do i find out what's in my job history without paying for a report i'd just like to know what people see when they check my background i have nothing to hide i just want to see what it says thanks to all who have called me dumb i just thought that if my credit report can have errors which it has had in the past why can't other reports i've decided to re enter the workforce after being a stay at home mom for a while and would like to know if there are any details i've forgotten and to verify that it's all accurate i guess some just aren't able to comprehend that fact there really is not a web site that gives a full job history you know what you have done if you really think about it and are honest with yourself you know whether you did excellent work good work or just passable work on every job you have ever had hr departments do not use these web sites they actually call email or fax former employers to get information and then only if you have given them permission to do so make sure you read everything on the application as that is generally where you agree that they can check the information on the application it is also where you agree that you will be working at will if you are offered a job Internet fraud Plame affair E-mail spam Search engine optimization Spam (electronic) Surveillance IP (complexity) Password Advance fee fraud Debugging Unemployment Computer virus Stopping e-mail abuse Whois Killian documents Graduate school Pretty Good Privacy Gmail Open access Probation officer Windows 2000 David Blunkett Windows XP Enterprise content management Customer relationship management Public-key cryptography Cross site scripting Apple Computer Background check Spyware CPU cache Windows Vista Patent Opera (web browser) Visual Basic Theory of conduct Poker jargon Credit card On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Contesting Business continuity planning XML Intelligence quotient Python programming language Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines British national identity card RFID Open Directory Project Infantilism Neopets Microsoft .NET Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Comparison of web browsers Mach kernel Karl Rove Jayson Blair Khalid al-Mihdhar Kurt Cobain Jeff Gannon Drudge Report Google Public domain The Standard RuneScape cheats Information Technology Infrastructure Library Common criticisms of Microsoft Outsourcing John Kerry military service controversy Buffer overflow Visa (document) Scientific method Minimum wage Mortgage Internet forum Web traffic Beetle in an Anthill BitTorrent Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism GSM services Spell checker 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Social Security (United States) Expert system Education in Germany Datalore (TNG episode) Mac OS X Intranet Google search Satchel Paige Sin City George W.
