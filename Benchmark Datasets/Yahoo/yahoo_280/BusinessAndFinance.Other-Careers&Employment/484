please answer is becoming a nurse really worth it i completely want to become an rn but recently i took sort of an 'internship' in the hospital where i would want to work at and found that it seems to be a dull and hard working job i thought it was maybe just the floor i was working on or the hospital i was at but i also volunteer at a hospital in another city and it just seems to be the same there too please don't get me wrong the thought of helping people and devoting my time to them is practically what i love to do but i am just afraid i will take four years of my life to become a nurse and when i finally get to be one i will regret it if their are any rn's out there please let me know if becoming a nurse is really worth it does it get better thank you there is a movement toward community based health care so in the future there may more opportunities in public health areas so there will be no problem for you to get a job unlike others who can't get one at all nursing requires a lot of physical activity there is a great deal of standing bending and lifting it can be emotionally demanding especially if you are working with severely ill or dying patients of course it can also be a tremendously rewarding profession occupational hazards for nurses are similar to those of other health workers they include contact with patients who have infectious diseases such as hepatitis and tuberculosis and injury from instruments chemicals and gases some nurses work very irregular hours those who work in hospitals or nursing homes may work hour shifts including nights or weekends others such as those in community centers may have more regular schedules most full time nurses work between and hours a week and have between and vacation days a year i am not a nurse but two of my cousins are we have a family blog to keep us in touch and this is a quote from one of them what i dislike about nursing as a profession is first off time you never have enough time to do everything that you want you find yourself running short of time and only able to give the most essential aspects of your care and health teaching and not do everything that you feel you should so that s the main drawback with nursing another drawback with nursing respect sometimes the profession is not accorded the respect that it should be it doesn t happen very often but when it does you really feel it what i like about nursing as a profession is that first you can help people that is you can help them by relieving their pain giving them medication you can help them with their anxiety about their health condition by talking to them about it giving them comfort and you can also help their families another thing about nursing is that you can always be learning and you never have a dull moment you can work in different areas you can specialize like emergency or cancer or surgical and you can work at whatever pace you want in the area that you choose i work in emergency at the moment and lastly it s very portable nursing is a profession that you can use across borders i've given that alot of thought so you guys might be making overseas phone calls to me she told me she likes it overall because the pros outweighs the cons and she couldn't see herself doing anything better i really hope this helps you i guess it's good for you that i came across your question haha Nurse Prostate cancer Palliative care Cancer Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Health insurance Breastfeeding Psychiatry Urinary incontinence Nursing Triage Emergency Medical Services Stroke Publicly funded medicine Traumatic brain injury Milton H.
