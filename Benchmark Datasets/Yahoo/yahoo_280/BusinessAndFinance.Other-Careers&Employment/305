any tips for college graduates trying to find jobs out of state i am graduating from college this month and have been applying for jobs for the past month or so my current location doesn't offer many job opportunities so the vast majority of jobs i have applied for are out of state how do i convince employers in my cover letter to hire an out of state and entry level candidate i'm not expecting my relocation expenses to be paid yes of course being a college graduate finding a job has it's own set of challenges those i know how to handle if you don't have a real answer then please don't respond does your college have placement assistance and do they have sister colleges in other states that would be a good start i've had to coordinate several out of state interviews which typically start with a phone screening interview with hr then a longer phone interview with the hiring manager if we feel we're really interested at that point we'll try to get the candidate in the office for an in person interview ideally you could get a few potential jobs lined up around the same time and schedule a vacation to interview with each one but that rarely works out as far as your cover letter you should modify it to be specific to each position company location you're applying to explain why you're looking for a job in that specific area and for that specific company and let them know up front that you'd be willing to pay your own moving expenses that way they know you're not just a graduate looking to use a company to pay your expenses to move to a new area but that you're a serious candidate then give them an idea of how you could make yourself available for an interview would you be willing to fly out for a final interview can you only do interviews by phone and if you're going to be in their area any time soon make sure you let them know that too the more questions you can answer in your cover letter the more comfortable they may be with interviewing you in the first place of course the more flexible you can be logistically the better your chances good luck Graduate school Plame affair Social rule Professor Mach kernel Unemployment GED Education in the United States Quizbowl Paralegal Education in Germany Game programmer Microeconomics Karl Rove Drug test Maryland General Assembly Election, 2006 Grade (education) Strategic management Life insurance Wal-Mart Avenue Q Walt Disney World College Program Academia Ra (board game) $ale of the Century Labor theory of value Expert system Air traffic controller Public Eye Winning Streak Species Wheel of Fortune FairTax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Friends Management Credit card Incident Command System Volleyball American football Probation officer Master's degree Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jeff Gannon Efficiency wages Dog agility Student loan MAME Public transport Windows 2000 Education in Romania Broadband Internet access Amiga Power Stan Lee The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Sudoku Evan Mecham Minimum wage Baseball Fielding (cricket) Surveillance Scientology beliefs and practices London Congestion Charge Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Neopets Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Milton H.
