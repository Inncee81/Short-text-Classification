what can i do if i submitted a resume and later found out that some of the dates i put in were wrong do i just give up on this job i really like it this would be only reason for me not to be offered the position i would tell them that you inadvertently sent them a resume that had some incorrect information on it and you would like to correct it i would only do this if you think that you might not get the job because of it otherwise i would let it go and correct it at the job interview i have had people give me corrected resumes at the job interview they usually say here is a copy of my updated current resume if you feel that there are errors on one that might not get you an interview i'd try the same line i am forwarding you a more recent copy of my resume Daylight saving time Killian documents Error correction and detection George W.
