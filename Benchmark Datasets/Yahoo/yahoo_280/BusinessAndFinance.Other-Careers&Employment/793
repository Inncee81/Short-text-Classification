since i have been unemployed i am so tired why is this i try to keep myself as structured as possible while looking for another job however by or in the afternoon i am beat somedays i can't keep my eyes open my physical health is suffering i used to exercise daily now i am so exhausted all the time i don't have the erergy i always feel like i am in a cloud i try to exercise but it isn't a matter of motivation i really do feel too tired why could this be it seems to be worse these last few weeks i don't have insurance and am not going to the doctor i just wanted to see if anyone else who is unemployed has ever felt this way and if it is normal that's exactly how i feel like driving with the brakes on i never seem to get un tired i never seem to completely wake up then when it comes to evening i don't want to go to bed even if i am tired it's so weird it's like i'd rather be doing other things and can't quite make myself go it isn't boredom i have a ton of stuff to do i am looking for a job hours per day which is almost a job in itself consider everything related diet and how well you're sleeping at night tie right in with exercise your exercise doesn't have to be vigorous to start going for a walk is easy and if you can get out in nature it wouldn't hurt don't do it based on if you feel like it or not just do it medically i simply don't know enough to say what could cause that i just suggest doing something that gives you a sense of purpose do what you enjoy and stay optimistic flow from one activity to the next act like you're not tired even if you feel like you are when you don't have an obligation your body might start taking advantage of that you don't have to be up so change that create obligations for yourself and make it strict not sending mixed signals to your body that you can cop out at any time set goals for yourself if you have to schedule your day the day before or do it weekly so that each day you have things to get done and don't have to think twice about what they may be i hope you start feeling energized soon if you are feeling depressed about your job situation i encourage you to find a solution you like not just one that will get you by there are other options besides selling your time for a wage and if those options give you that fiery feeling in your gut like they do for me it may be just what you need to get a little pep in your day Unemployment Social rule Prostate cancer Labour economics Theory of conduct EastEnders Poker jargon Avenue Q Procrastination Clinical depression Shaggy dog story Sin City Insomnia Urinary incontinence Milton H.
