verbal offer letter i received a verbal offer from a company but they have not send me an e mail nor a hard copy i sent hr an email and they said they will send me an email copy in a day or so when a few days passed and i have not heard from them i gave them a call and they said they will send a letter that afternoon still i didnt receive anything i followed up with another e mail but no response im soo confused is that legal to even do so say one thing but then not follow up i would call the hiring manager if s he's made the decision to hire you she probably doesn't want to wait to get you in and started i would play it casual though you're thrilled with the offer but of course don't want to give notice at your old job until you have something in writing and then wait if they want you they'll take care of the paperwork and if they changed their mind there's not much you can do when all is said and done do you want to work for a company that tells you one thing and does another i'd treat it like a misunderstanding but the ball is really in their court E-mail Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Social rule Make money fast E-mail spam Sydney Riot of 1879 Advance fee fraud Computer virus Surveillance Plame affair Public domain Internet fraud Call centre Karl Rove Time Out of Mind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Domain Name System Gmail Motion picture rating system Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Medical prescription Ten Commandments Identity theft Tenshinhan SCO-Linux controversies Spam (electronic) Downing Street memo Amiga Power Dragnet (drama) Spam Prevention Early Warning System Panay incident Direct marketing Little Britain Pretty Good Privacy Royal Assent MoveOn Sender Policy Framework Email authentication Volleyball American football strategy Something Awful Tag Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Appeal Past teachings of Prem Rawat Anonymous remailer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Good Morning, Vietnam Computer forensics Timeline of the Enron scandal Customs and etiquette of Japan American and British English differences Data retention Finnish language Offer and acceptance 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Intellivision Contract Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Walt Disney World College Program Charles Ponzi Wal-Mart Scientology beliefs and practices Copy protection Health insurance Milton H.
