my boss is awful to me if i'm out but doesn't even question my co workers with kids how do i address this i always get good reviews and hardly ever miss work but i had to call in today b c i'm sick my boss was really hostile she said that i better be there tomorrow she never says anything to the pregnant women in our office even when they call in because they just don't feel like coming in or they're late b c they're tired although they've missed far more days than me she also lets women w kids off w o question it's like she's punishing me for not having children i don't know how to address this with her i've recently started looking for another job but i still want to tell her how unfair this is any advice this is a tough one to address and it's always difficult to criticize a boss but i'm with you she is treating people differently and needs to be made aware of it schedule an appointment with her start by discussing your performance is everything ok are you meeting her expectations etc once she tells you as we hope she will that you're a strong performer on the job then you have some leverage to approach the time off situation something like boss i've noticed when shelly and susie need time off to attend to their kids or because they don't feel well that seems to be acceptable to you however when i ask for time off it feels like you're really upset with me since you've just told me that you think highly of my performance i'm at a loss to understand why you would be so concerned over an occasional sick day is it because i don't have children or is there another reason i should be aware of then sit quietly and let her backpedal her way out of this one of course if you've been missing a lot of time or if your performance is not as strong as that of the other gals in the office you need to fix that problem before you can accuse your boss of disparate treatment good luck Social rule Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles The Critic The Midnight Sun Sharon Tate Time Out of Mind The Inside Extreme Programming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alex Ferguson Milton H.
