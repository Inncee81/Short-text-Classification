should i continue working with this client i do direct in home care with people who have mental illnesses and for the most part i really like my job however there was one client who decided that she had enough and felt she was being bossed around partly due to her illness' symptoms but at the same time she made a lot of choices knowing fully aware the consequences such as kicking me out several times and refusing to follow her care plan i'm a little hesitant to tell my superior that i am apprehensive about working with her again esp during the school year not to mention i cannot afford to drive mns only to waste my time along with valuable county money funds are used to pay for these services on one hand i don't want to seem like i'm copping out but at the same time in the past i can remember not speaking up and dreading every work day i have more control of my work at this company what should i do should i continue but give this client one last chance and then i'm done or should i discontinue i also wanted to add this client is an adult and is fully aware that she can request changes to her care plan so it's more fulfilling for her to follow it and complete the goals however whenever such changes are made there are many times where she still refuses she has also used manipulation to get what she wants but i have been rather strict in holding my ground which angers her my superior talked to her and said the client wasn't angry with me i've just learned from the past not to waver from rules and policies and to also keep my boundaries this client really dislikes that a friend told me to continue working with this client but have a plan on how to make things easier for both of us and if she kicks me out again make that the last time i work with her i also don't want to wreck my good standing with the company my last review was excellent that's why i'm a little hesitant but i don't want to end up dreading work or feeling powerless like my other jobs i have spoken to my superior about this on a few occasions and have always been very thorough and honest about what happened and what i did each time a couple superiors know i have always been told that i handled the situation correctly these situations have involved the client getting mad at me because i refused to break policy there was one time i asked her to reschedule an activity at a time other than her direct care time which is expected of all clients and there have been times where i told her i will not just waste time getting lost in my car and we need to start planning ahead each time i have always been clear and polite i've only been working with her for nearly months she also has a history of being resistant and trying to break policy my superiors know that what i'm concerned about is how this will reflect about me i want to be consistent and fair but goodness knows i've been in situations where i hated each minute and i felt like i had no control to the last poster whoever said that the client wasn't being treated with respect i also work with a similar population as well and even though a lot of these people have mental health issues they are still adults and many of them are aware of what they are doing i would tread carefully on this decision weigh all the pros and cons it seems like you have really put a lot of time into this client sometimes no matter what you do some people will never change and this client's habit of always refusing to do what she needs to do is manipulative and no she isn't your only means of a paycheck there are other jobs out there talk to your supervisor about this and go from there Theory of conduct Social rule Knots Landing Pitaten Traumatic incident reduction EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Milton H.
