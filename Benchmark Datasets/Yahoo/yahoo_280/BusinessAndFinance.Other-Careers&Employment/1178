would you lie on a job application if you got fired from your last job i have cancer and got fired from my last place of employment due to missing work for surgeries i had given them a doctors note for every absence it just seems like when i was looking for employment before people were calling back but this time i have only received one call for an interview i don't like to lie but i feel this is hurting me i also don't want a prospective employer to think im lazy and haven't worked the past year is there anyway that they could find out where my last place of employment was if i dont tell them no i would not lie on my resume or application but would note that in an interview i would explain the situation in depth if required remember an application or resume is a legal document if you lie on it the company hiring you has the right to fire you when they find out without questions another note any time without a job will also be questioned by an employer so you will have to consider what looks worse the time without work or something you can explain in an interview be honest and do not give too much information on the application or in your resume Plame affair Unemployment Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of conduct Stomach cancer Software engineering Steve Jobs Probation officer Principal-agent problem Expert system Graduate school Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Prostate cancer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Employment Outsourcing Social rule Intern Freeters Medicine Legal aspects of transsexualism New York Knicks Mordechai Vanunu Psychology Time Out of Mind Civil rights Karl Rove George W.
