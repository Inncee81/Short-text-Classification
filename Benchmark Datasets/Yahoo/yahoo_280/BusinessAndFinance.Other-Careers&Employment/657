i'm hardworking honest and new and i think being set up to look bad or worse what should i do i'm having trouble getting a job in my field so i took a position for the summer i'm overqualified for my coworkers are of different demographic education level their behaviour is sometimes unreasonable and they behave as if i'm not trustworthy by the way i must share a drawer with some of these people i am not informed of it being in or out of balance i feel as if my education reputation and everything are being risked to make a few dollars which are handy and making ends meet but i could do with out dipping into savings retirement am i paranoid no supervisor has spoken to me of a problem i only mention different demographic not because i'm focusing on differences but because highschool early college is different from late thirties i don't do the drinking after work i don't stand in the gossip circle that forms occasionally it's not bad just different interests if you are a new hire your supervisor should have a x meeting with you to see how things are going you can ask for feedback and guidance at any time then or before hand if you suspect a set up if you share a drawer and must balance you are entitled to know the results how else does one account or improve i do hear you about the qualifications and icky feelings re other employees been there and it's not fun my solution take a job with a temp agency that will send you to many different assignments in your area you'll get the same money without benefits but there's less pressure from the existing staff because you're just a temp and not a threat to them in fact many look at temps as life savers because they come in during vacations and times of extra work to take the load off the regular staff good luck in your search for meaningful and comfortable work Principal-agent problem Social rule Scientology beliefs and practices Affirmative action Extreme Programming Academia Unemployment Plame affair Transactional analysis Outsourcing Education in the People's Republic of China Theory of conduct Graduate school Inflation Capitalism Corporate governance Maison Ikkoku Leadership Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social Security (United States) Education in Portugal Electrophysiology Strategic management W.
