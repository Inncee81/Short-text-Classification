this is a very bizarre situation and unsure of what to do my supervisor called me at home and accused me of stealing money from another employee's wallet which i know i didn't do she says because another employee did this without proof that i could lose my job for not doing my job since this one employee who decided to steal while the rest of my staff and i were running the business my concern is that i am being falsely accused along with another employee but there are no cameras in the restaurant i work in that would have exonerated everybody involved and also would have caught the thief if i end of being fired do i have any kind of legal argument for this my supervisor said she would call me back tonight and never did which makes me think there is something else going on they can't fire you without proof but i don't know if i'd want to work there under those conditions anyway if they do fire you you have a case for wrongful dismissal and can both get your job back and sue for damages Plame affair Poker jargon James Hanratty Termination of employment Slander and libel The Apprentice 2 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Apple Computer Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Spidey Super Stories SCO-Linux controversies Ocean's Twelve Scientology controversy Bank fraud Theft Pulp Fiction Miscarriage of justice Michael Moore Friends Contract Drug test Wal-Mart Lawsuit 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Sexual harassment Confidence trick 1957 World Series Ethics Employment Division of labour Mumia Abu-Jamal Vacuous truth Outsourcing Principal-agent problem Burden of proof Equal Protection Clause Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Dead Like Me Paula Jones Boston Public U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Unemployment Domestic violence Identity theft Kitsune (Usagi Yojimbo) Halting problem American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Rape Trailer Park Boys Negligence Enron Corporation Breath of Fire III Conspiracy Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Katelyn Faber Knots Landing Insurance Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Seinfeld Major League Baseball television contracts False memory Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Frontier in Space Precautionary principle Tip Ann Coulter MapleStory Fair Game (Scientology) Paradox Everwood Sponsorship scandal Fair use New York Giants Keynesian economics The Contender (television series) Contradiction Fancy Crane Cary Grant Vivian Solon Probation officer Reservoir Dogs One Piece minor characters Wage slavery Charles Graner The Daleks' Master Plan Non-aggression principle Ten Commandments Criticism of libertarianism The Drew Carey Show Ad hominem Theodicy Ontological argument Theory of conduct Jury trial
