i've been lying to employers about my shady past i'm years old and started stripping when i was fake i d now i'm pregnant and starting to show i want to get out of stripping but whenever i go apply for jobs they want to know my past work experience on the application and so i lie and put something like mcdonald's and then i give them one of my friend's cell phone 's my friends pretend like they're managers i'm scared i will be caught do i have any better options ps the jobs i'm applying for are receptionists office work do not lie you can get caught and when you do you will lose your job and do you really want to have issues finding a job next time trust me you will slip up and say something to someone even if it is an accident you will look very bad to everyone then also mcd's does not have a single line like you are having on your resume most large corps make you fax over a info request to hr again when you lie your lie will trip you up i don't know the name of the company you worked at but would they agree to say you were a server you did serve just not drinks this is a tough situation but i would recommend appling at small companies for now so that it can be explained easier you may be able to get in and then after giving it time have a resume Friends Social rule Ocean's Twelve Internet fraud Bluetooth Sin City Mach kernel Poker jargon Database management system Apple Computer EastEnders Days of our Lives Knots Landing Domain Name System Something Positive Microsoft Theory of conduct Plame affair Surveillance Customer relationship management Freeters McDonald's Sydney Riot of 1879 Whois Redundant array of independent disks Steam (content delivery) Apple Newton Modem Jam (TV series) Common Unix Printing System Electronic Arts Pretty Good Privacy Dilbert FoxTrot Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Whose Line Is It Anyway?
