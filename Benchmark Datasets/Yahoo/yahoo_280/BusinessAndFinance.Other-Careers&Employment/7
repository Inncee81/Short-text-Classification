can the interviewer ask you your age at the job interview i didnt think they could just wondering the reason i asked was bcoz i was interviewed by women both hot asst and manager both attrctive they asked me my age so i was wondering by the way im years old thats why i asked actually no they aren't supposed to ask you information such as age marital status sexual orientation parental status etc are questions that should not be asked due to job discrimination typically on the application if age is a factor such as burger king or retail it should be noted in the application seeing that they should have already received your application and resume or either one age is a very irrelevant question Sexual orientation Job interview Gender role Lawrence v.
