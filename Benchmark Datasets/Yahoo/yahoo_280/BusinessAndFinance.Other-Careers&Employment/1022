is it ethical to leave this job i was head hunted for another position less stress less hours more money etc the position is actually a step down as far as responsibilities go i will be an analyst instead of a manager but the pay is so much better and there are fewer responsibilities and more perks my boss has been there for me personally and also helped my husband get a good position at her husband's place of employment after he my husband sold his business and was looking in a scarce local job market i feel bad about leaving especially since it will create a lot of stress on her to train someone to run the department so she is able to focus on her duties as senior management i know that this is the better choice for me but can't help but feel torn by my loyalty and gratitude toward my current boss any suggestions or words of wisdom thank you another part of the reason that i feel desperate to leave and really want to accept this new offer is that my current place has become a toxic work environment full of favortism in other departments and a corrupt ceo i fully intend to give weeks notice which is as much as i can and to offer to train in the evenings if needed but leaving her to deal with so much stress really makes it hard for me to accept this new position with the pleasure and excitement that i should give plenty of notice ask her what you can do to ease the transition and thank her in your resignation letter for everything she's done Unemployment Economics Graduate school Ethics Management The Apprentice 2 Education in the People's Republic of China Wal-Mart Strategic management Microeconomics Corporate governance Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Investment bank Microsoft Professor EastEnders Plame affair Extreme Programming New Deal Clinical depression Babe Ruth Gift economy Outsourcing Poker jargon Economic inequality Tariff Free trade Social rule Capitalism Supply and demand Principal-agent problem British Civil Service Business ethics Warren Buffett 2004 Democratic National Convention Goodness and value theory Abortion G-Man (Half-Life) Morgan Stanley Salary Toronto Raptors Transactional analysis Boston Public Evil 2004 Republican National Convention Utilitarianism Non-native pronunciations of English Cork City F.C.
