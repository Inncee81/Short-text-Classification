any jobs out there that a person can be successful at without a degree i dont have a degree but i dont want to have to work and jobs just to make ends meet is it possible that i can have a prestigious career just like those with a degree can i have the same job they have does it really matter as long as i can do the job or work all a degree is is just saying that you know and can talk about the field you got a degree in not with that attitude a degree is a little more than a piece of paper or bragging rights in most cases those with degrees are held responsible in a court of law so there is some reason to look at it more than 'just a piece of sheepskin' trust me i have been in your position for the last seven years in the very degree oriented field of occupational safety also in my field you can't even get a certification unless you have a degree i have seen complete idiots making even double what i make because they have a degree for a corporate position you have to have a degree because of liability and i will write this and people will probably give the thumbs down but i was the same way until somebody said hey don't fight it turn that negative energy hate want for a degree into your studies and you will breeze through it and then you will be on a higher field because you are a double threat experience and degree the old gi joe said it best knowledge is half the battle so go for the degree find your path start at the bottom and before long you will be able to surpass those that have been promoted around you Graduate school Paralegal Lawyer Juris Doctor Plame affair Corporation Master's degree Economic inequality Academia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 1957 World Series Professor Tort reform Epistemology Software engineering Intelligence quotient Law firm Classified information Law school Apprenticeship Education in Portugal Slander and libel Social rule Attorney at Law Causality Kasparov versus The World United Kingdom corporation tax Education in Australia Mediation Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Trust (Law) USA Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Poker jargon Abortion Polynomial Hate speech Receptionist Contract Diving Bayesian inference Legal aspects of transsexualism Pittsburgh Steelers Endgame Chess strategy and tactics Homophobia Columbia University Ethics Magnet Corporate personhood Community college American Idiot Employment in Hong Kong Education in Germany Intellectual property Physician Freedom of speech Australian constitutional law Estoppel Single certification Hey Jude Shit Augustus De Morgan Punk ideology Current teachings of Prem Rawat Dirac equation Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Garth Brooks Education in the United States Taxation in the United States Same-sex marriage Theory of conduct John Edwards Gun politics Affirmative action 2005 World Series Sexual orientation Rabbi Concealed carry (USA) Education in the People's Republic of China Atom Parapsychology Human rights Doctorate Gender role Revolver City and Guilds of London Institute Electrical engineering Eyeglass prescription Doctor of Philosophy Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Outsourcing Gay Double bass Model minority Associate's degree Income trust Contredanse Wind turbine Ty Cobb Paintball
