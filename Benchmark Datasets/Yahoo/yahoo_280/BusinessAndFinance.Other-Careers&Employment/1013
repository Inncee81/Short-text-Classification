okay i've got three options i have no job and i'm going into junior year of high school i'm being moved up to college prep which is harder then where i was at before and i didn't do so great in college prep when i was in freshman year if i get a job it is just for pocket money i don't pay any bills or anything what should i do go to a supermarket days a week hours a night wait till i'm in december and work at blockbuster that's slightly better then the supermarket focus on my school work i heard junior year was important and i really need to bust my ass this year i worked at the supermarket for a year and a half was offered a job at a different place so i quit and got f'd over at the other place i gave them my weeks so they said i'm welcome back anytime i would definitely not choose you need to do homework after school and if there is no time you will not likely do it after work and i think it will make you tired is a better option but i would still just work weekends and you will not be so bogged down of course choice is the best option if you are planning to attend college which i recommend i would not work at all your last years of school i would wait till i got into college and work a few hours a week since you can controll your school schedule and your time i would however explain to your parents about the need for a set allowance if it is feasible and perhaps you could take on a couple of extra chores and i doubt this will interfere with your school work they will likely understand and be happy to help as long as you keep up the grades Education in the United States GED Education in Romania Poker jargon Freeters Lynbrook High School Wal-Mart Education in Australia The Amazing Race Education in Germany Pitaten Education in Taiwan Independent school (UK) 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Catcher in the Rye Community college Rosa Parks Education in England Unemployment Bristol Grammar School High school National Football League International League Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Hunter College High School The Apprentice 2 Redundant array of independent disks Phillips Exeter Academy Student loan College admissions Ocean's Twelve No Child Left Behind Act The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Economics The Citadel (Military College) Student Prostate cancer Time Out of Mind Winning Streak The Inside Mutual fund Wheel of Fortune Secondary education in France EastEnders Moe Berg Knots Landing Bellarmine College Preparatory Advanced Placement Program Marching band SAT Craps Law School Admissions Test IB Diploma Programme Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Blonde on Blonde Star Trek: Enterprise Pyramid (game show) Policy Debate Avenue Q Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Beatmania IIDX John Kerry Blackjack Luther Head Babe Ruth Royal Assent James T.
