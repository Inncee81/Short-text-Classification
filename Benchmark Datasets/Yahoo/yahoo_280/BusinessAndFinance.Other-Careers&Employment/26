what job i should be looking into what is a job in the it business that is fun easy hours and good pay i was just wondering if anyone new of any good jobs in the industry isn't that what all of us are looking for a job that is fun easy hours and good pay it can be fun if you are doing what you love to do if the job is easy and anybody can do it then why do you think those companies are willing to pay for an it personnel they can just ask one of their existing employees or managers to do it does it make sense to you anyway if you have never worked as an it professional you should look into working for a small business you won't get paid much but it is the experience that you are looking for then after you work there for at least years you can start looking for a better place of employment or if you have connections then you can ask them to hook you up with a job do you have a degree if you don't and you are just looking for an it job because people say it makes a lot of money then you are mistaken you need a degree to get a good job with good pay especially an it professional they require you to have a degree and some experiences if you are just out of college and you think you know everything then you are also mistaken knowledge from school is very good but the experience from implementing the knowledge at real working environments is even better good luck Game programmer Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Academia Outsourcing Unemployment Social rule Craps Sweatshop Minimum wage Pitaten Call centre Paralegal Wal-Mart The Apprentice 2 Electronic commerce Insurance Workplace democracy Blackjack Salary Firefighter Labor theory of value Epistemology Inflation Requirements analysis Capitalism Education in Portugal Education in Germany Guild Labour economics Employment Price discrimination Current teachings of Prem Rawat Profession Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution W.
