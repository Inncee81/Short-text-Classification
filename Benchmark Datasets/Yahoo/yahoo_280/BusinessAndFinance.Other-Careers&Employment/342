how to not feel badly that male coworker was a jerk to me he's always been rude and pompous and i always figured he hated me i figured he thought i was ugly and would think my being friendly would be misconstrued as me hitting on him so i avoided him i killed him with kindness and we were cool i even though he might have liked me from the way he acted and checked me out i am not a huge flirter just like to be social i went over just to say hi and he was totally rude and obnoxious so i left and have been ignoring him he sometimes looks at me but i just ignore i caught him staring at me sitting outside so now he completely avoids even glancng at me even if we are the only ones in a room i am sooo annoyed and dont know how to deal next time i will have to work with him i want to say i wasnt hitting on you and your are arrogant i thought we were cool and you treated me like some dumb ugly slut you made me cry and you suck how can i handle asking him for help working with him next time how to put this into persepctive you know it kinda sounds like he may like you and just have really really bad social skills anyhow just don't worry about it he seems to keep acting like a jerk whether on purpose or just because he doesn't know better and this probably won't cahnge so i'd just avoid him as best i could and be civil to him don't ignore him but don't pay him and special attention either just treat him like you treat everyone else and ignore his bad behavior as best you can i guess here is the perspective you need if this guy likes you or doesn't who cares not really going to affect you to much either way so just don't worry about it at all move on to other things and just forget it this guys opinion is not so important right now and again i don't think he has a bad opinion just lousy social graces Beavis and Butt-head Ranma __ characters Avenue Q Futurama (TV series - season 5) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Totally Spies!
