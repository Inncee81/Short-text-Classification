what are an employee's rights in the workplace a co worker resigned from an over demanding position which required her to do a two person job she asked for assistance did not get it so she resigned it was becoming too much for her and the company did not want to give her a raise or hire extra staff the company has a hiring freeze and expects other people in the department to pick up the slack for the next six months they do not intend to hire extra staff soon is this fair to the other employees do these employees have a right to demand compensation for taking on additional responsibilities if yes what demands are reasonable should these employees start sending out their resumes if no one seems to be listening it might or might not be fair but it's definitely legal interesting that you say they gave her too much for her to do and wouldn't hire extra staff or give her a raise so you are saying it would be possible for her to do the extra work but only if she got a raise no employees do not have the right to demand extra compensation for taking on additional responsibilities except if they are required to work overtime they must be paid for overtime but if they just goof off during their normal day so they have to get overtime hours to get the work done they still have to be paid the overtime but can get fired if someone is not satisfied with their working conditions then yes they should look for another job but many employers have or are cutting back and expecting more from their employees so don't be real surprised if the same thing happens again at a new place Overtime Education in the People's Republic of China Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment Employment in Hong Kong Labor theory of value Trade union Plame affair Salary Wal-Mart Working time Paralegal Compensation of employees Eight hour day Insurance Employment Electronic Arts New York Jets Social rule Labor-power Keynesian economics Rick Santorum Termination of employment Air traffic controller Workers' compensation Transport Workers Union of America Efficiency wages Workplace democracy Public domain Affirmative action Management National Kidney Foundation Singapore Michael D.
