work is stressing me out ni am a little confused so need some clarification i have a colleague who is related to the boss who is lying that i am intimidating her when people are not around we recently went for what i thought was a formal investigation i asked the investigating officer and hr if i was in a formal meeting and they replied that i was because someone had wrote a statement verifying that i had made everyone else a coffee and not her deliberately i have now been told that there will be a formal investigation so what i want to know is if more false statements are put in about me will they be considered as evidence proof and i therefore will end up being disciplined i have a union rep to go with me but i have my doubts about him as he said to me that i should not worry if i get a standard setting letter i am annoyed because i have done nothing wrong and i am fed up with all the lies and hr for letting this happen he also told me b ready for this to go on for another couple of months i've have been looking for jobs but nothing has come up stand up for what is right because in the end its how you feel about what actions you have taken that will matter you got this job if need be you will get another once you face off with your employer right or wrong its going to be stressful years from now at least you will look back on this as a learning experience that you passed because you did what you had to do for you i have been there and done that federal employment and human resource is just one pitiful excuse for misusing government money so i know how you feel and stay strong Plame affair Coming of Age (TNG episode) Tom DeLay Killian documents Goodness and value theory Ex-gay Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Downing Street memo Hearsay God Emperor of Dune Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Evan Mecham Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Shaggy dog story 2000 Australian Grand Prix Mumia Abu-Jamal David Kelly George Galloway Milton H.
