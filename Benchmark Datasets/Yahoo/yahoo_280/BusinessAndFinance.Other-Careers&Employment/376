during an interview if i am asked what are your weakness how should i appropriately answer thanks to those who give sensible answers well i can tell you that you certainly do need to have something you feel you need to improve on i interview hundreds of people a year and you'd be surprised how many people say they don't have anything that they need to improve we immediately recognize that either the person doesn't have the intelligence we're looking for or that they're just lying everybody has weaknesses and the higher the job you apply for the more the interviewer is looking to see if you're smart enough to recognize your weaknesses and are working on correcting them i wouldn't come up with a list of things that might become a real turn off lol but there were some really good examples given above my advice is that you take a long look at yourself and jot down two or three things that you see as a weakness in your performance then pick out the number one and phrase it as others have said in a positive way most people dislike confrontation having to deliver criticism to others i work closely with my team i'm quick to compliment wins when i recognize someone is having a problem i teach them how to correct the situation but if the person just doesn't develop into a solid contributor i dislike haveing that formal discussion about poor job performance getting out of the comfort zone is another weakness many people possess i really get nervous when asked to speak in front of a group of people and i'm working on organizing my thoughts in an outline to refer to so that i can be more effective at public speaking being a workaholic is one interviewers love to hear i have trouble establishing a work life balance because i get so envolved in my job that it's hard for me to leave at the end of the day you can see why we like to hear that one but even if it's true for goodness sakes don't say things like i really hate dealing with people or it's hard for me to count all that money without being tempted to take some of it those answers would certainly insure your application would end up in file lol good question good luck Social rule Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices The nature of God in Western theology Time Out of Mind Extreme Programming Plame affair Goodness and value theory Ethics Kasparov versus The World Pitaten The Apprentice 2 Logic A Course In Miracles Shit Numerology 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Death Gate Cycle Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Ashlee Simpson Show Alignment (role-playing games) Atheism Piccolo Junior Saga Chess strategy and tactics Richard Feynman Alcoholics Anonymous Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sola fide Philosophy of language Past teachings of Prem Rawat Microeconomics President (game) Humphrey Bogart Equine conformation EastEnders Avenue Q Ten Commandments Ken Jennings American and British English differences Yusuf al-Qaradawi About a Boy Gender-neutral language Poker jargon Predestination English grammar Rudolf Hermann Lotze Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Epistemology Expert system Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Computer numbering formats Consensus decision-making Appeal Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Novel Autism U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 The Catcher in the Rye Friends Sharon Tate Mao (game) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Jennifer Lopez Health insurance Shaggy dog story Incarnations of Immortality Blood on the Tracks Irony Aphasia Non-native pronunciations of English Capitalism Kodocha Dead Like Me Leviathan (book) Rick Santorum Teach the Controversy Anarchism and society Nicomachean Ethics Downing Street memo Dyslexia Hiberno-English Religious Society of Friends 2000 Australian Grand Prix Transactional analysis Little Britain American Psycho Ex-gay Justification (theology) Saint Whose Line Is It Anyway?
