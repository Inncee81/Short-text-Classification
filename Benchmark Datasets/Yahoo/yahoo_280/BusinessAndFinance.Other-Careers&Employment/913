victoria's secret preview i went to vs today and picked up an application i was informed they do pre views and i would need to come in for that next week after i left i started wondering what a pre view is and wished i had asked lol so can anyone tell me what it is what to expect how long it lasts and what to wear also can anyone tell me what the regular pay at victoria's secret is i hate at interviews when they ask how much you want to make and i never want to answer cause i don't want to be to far off either way i really need help choosing what to wear i'm young and tend to look silly in suits but maybe someone can lead me in the right direction pictures or links would be helpful i don't want to look like i'm trying to hard but i don't want to look like i don't care i'm sorry for so many questions but i will really appreciate any help you can give me a preview is like a trial during the interview or after it they ask you to sell to a customer it's hard because you really don't know much about the merchandise other than what they tell you in about minutes i would suggest that you wear black as that's what they wear there the whole interview and preview took maybe a half hour after my interview preview job offer i decided that it was not one i wanted to pursue due to highly aggressive sales and high credit goals but good luck Social rule The Apprentice 2 Spice Girls Jennifer Lopez Sharon Tate Wal-Mart New York Giants $ale of the Century Marilyn Monroe Hollywood Squares The Amazing Race Plame affair The Ashlee Simpson Show Surveillance David Beckham Oasis (band) Laserdisc Same-sex marriage in Canada I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue TLC Windows Vista The Cure The Star Wars Holiday Special Moe Berg Rosa Parks John Lennon Quarashi Plame affair timeline Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses You Don't Know Jack MapleStory Little Britain Galactic Civilizations Big Brother UK series 6 Game show Milton H.
