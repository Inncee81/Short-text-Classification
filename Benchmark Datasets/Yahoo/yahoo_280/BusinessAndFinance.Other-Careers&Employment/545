cia or fbi i'm kinda stressing over this i cant decide what to choose as a career and i have narrowed it down to things work for the cia or the fbi i want to work for fbi because i wanted to be a special agent and see some action rather than sitting in front of a computer all day trying to crack a foreign encryption i want to work for the cia because it seems more important i feel when someone says fbi agent its just a fancy way of saying cop and i also would like top security clearance depending on what job i took please help i would like advice from anyone but preferably from people with experience oh and dont come on here just to say i wont help you because your government has killed so many people well i wouldn't suggest joining the cia it is not like in the hollywood movies it's way over exagerrated most intelligence gathered is done from the media and not busting into some place or breaking some foreign encryption like you stated if you work for the cia you would probably end up gathering some kind of information from the media or you would probably end up recruiting people from other nations as agents i'd suggest trying to get the fbi job and good luck with that Plame affair Central Intelligence Agency Federal Bureau of Investigation Agent handling Classified information Sydney Bristow Espionage Plame affair timeline Project MKULTRA COINTELPRO John F.
