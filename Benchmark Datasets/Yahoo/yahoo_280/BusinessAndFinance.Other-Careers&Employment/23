how to obtain a part time job i live in illinois and i'm currently i look for places to apply for but most of the time i just fill out an application online about days afterwards i just call to see if the company or store has seen my application or not then usually i wait for them to call me for an interview i did have a time where i called up a pharmaceutical store and i mentioned my name and right away they asked me for an interview i did have two interviews with the same place but ended up not getting it i mean i'm not asking about what to do at an interview because for the most part you just need to be honest with your answers and show them that you want to work along with a few other things but i do want to know what exactly i should do in order for the companies stores to tell me what time we could set up an interview i know i have to fill out an application then call them to remind them about me but is the rest just luck or should i do things differently any advice would help thx in response to the answer above me many companies now don't have paper applications and if you ask someone they'll tell you how to apply electronically i hate it because once you apply you don't know where the application goes or when or if anyone is going to look at it grocery stores are probably a good place to find a first job and with applications you can submit in person Expert system CPU cache Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Social rule Plame affair Ethics Theory of conduct Graduate school Enterprise content management GED Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Electronic commerce College admissions Barrister Database Central processing unit Internet fraud Life insurance Call centre Wal-Mart Patent Domain Name System The Apprentice 2 Donald Rumsfeld Interview Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Management information system Oscilloscope Surveillance Towelie Inheritance (computer science) Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Homestar Runner Jennifer Lopez Cigarette Smoking Man Legal research Patent application Probation officer Avenue Q Medical prescription Loudspeaker Jeff Gannon Pharmaceutical company Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 Good Times Yusuf al-Qaradawi Civil unions in the United Kingdom The Ashlee Simpson Show Schengen treaty Ken Jennings Computer Mathematics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hash table GSM services Charles Goodyear Visitor pattern UK Singles Chart Appeal Tesco Sears Holdings Corporation Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix UCAS ITunes Music Store Steve Jobs Windows 2000 Database normalization Debugging The Inside George Costanza David Blunkett Genetic algorithm The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Lisp programming language Podcasting Time Out of Mind British nationality law Downing Street memo Cheating in poker Japanese tea ceremony Compiler optimization Anne Rice Physician 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Redundant array of independent disks Queue area Engineering ITV Circuit design Royal Assent Survivor (novel) Bishop In-N-Out Burger Phaedo U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement Jeopardy!
