interview at hollister on tuesday i was wondering if it would be inappropriate to wear a jean skirt it's not too short but i was planning to wear flats and a hollister polo as well i'm so nervous it's a group interview a jean skirt and polo are fine just remember hollister doesn't sell black so don't wear any of it they also want natural looking people so little if any make up and no flashy jewelry just be confident and you'll do fine make sure you stand out from the rest of the group though they're looking for outgoing people who are loud enough to talk over the music in the store to customers then again don't yell in your interview Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
