do people with online degrees get hired i am looking at online schools such as university of phoenix and kaplan as well as some others my questions and main concern is that if i spend all this time and money getting a degree from one of these places would i actually be able to get a job from it i would hate to spend all this time and money and just get laughed out of a job interview because they don't accept a degree from an online school online education is the trend now costs to educate a person are becoming very prohibitive so this is the approach being taken by many high profile schools and universities have you heard of 'open universities' state colleges and universities are offering this type of education now to answer your question i would say it depends on the course you are taking and the school you graduated from peace and blessings SAT Graduate school Education in Germany Education in the United States Lawyer Kaplan Juris Doctor Education in Australia Education in Portugal Chiropractic Medical school Education in the People's Republic of China Professor Education in Hong Kong Software engineering Community college College admissions Student loan Distance education Social rule GED Culture of the United States Architect College Quizbowl Outsourcing Avenue Q Education in France Statistical survey Civil rights Education in the Republic of Ireland Judaism High school No Child Left Behind Act Academia Economics Debate University of Pennsylvania Law School Affirmative action Education University of North Carolina at Charlotte Paralegal The Apprentice 2 Seneca College Elections in the United States Middle Tennessee State University Columbia University University of Maryland University College Associate's degree The Apprentice 2 candidates Florida State University University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point Advanced Placement Program Coeducation Education in Japan Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Master's degree Higher education Plame affair Georgetown University Sex education Teach the Controversy University of San Diego Students' union Education reform University of Pennsylvania Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief University of Phoenix North Carolina State University Textbook Education in Finland Welcome Back, Kotter Medicare (Canada) Pennsylvania State University Grade (education) Gambling You Don't Know Jack Secondary education in the United States Ruth Bader Ginsburg Education in Taiwan University of Texas at San Antonio California State University Economic inequality Interracial couple Tuition Education in New Zealand Pat Robertson University of Bradford 613 mitzvot Dublin City University Secondary education in Japan Online learning University of Glasgow Salt Lake Community College Article One of the United States Constitution Cornell University Tiger Woods
