isn't it better to start up a businees rather than working for others all this while since young i m always good in buying and selling of goods and services and i think i am good enough in business world so i never would try to think of getting started with any jobs i own a small boutique but i found it not reli profitable should i continue o should i need to find a job it depends on the business and what type of profit you can draw from it a job is obviously only paying you some fixed amount and no share of profits unless you have a job that has a profit share your own business may be wildly successful but it is much more risky the income may not be consistent you may fail here is the basic premise of risk and reward the riskier the undertaking or investment the more it should pay off but you also have much more downside you can lose it all the safer bet is to find a job which is less risky and less profitable but you reduce your downside Arbitrage Insurance Capital accumulation Capitalism Islamic banking Surplus value Corporation Poker jargon Labor theory of value Gambling Gross domestic product Dot-com Blackjack Privatization Bond Annuity Dividend Principal-agent problem MMORPG Investment bank Free trade Mutual fund Debt Sports betting Income statement Bank Venture capital Keynesian economics Rational pricing Public good Deflation (economics) Citigroup Finance Outsourcing FairTax Business Income trust Microcredit Corporate finance PE ratio Monetary policy Ra (board game) Cable television Electronic commerce Extreme Programming ITV Mergers and acquisitions Health insurance Economy of Russia Economics Craps Short selling Hedge fund United Kingdom corporation tax Great Depression Risk Law of value Supply and demand Economic inequality Credit card Final Fantasy XI Modern portfolio theory Inflation Anarchism and capitalism Life insurance Unemployment Day trading Sweatshop Value added tax Capital asset pricing model Microeconomics Bretton Woods system Protectionism Real estate developer Baccarat Arguments for and against drug prohibition Economy of the United States Prices of production Tesco Philosophy of business Entrepreneur Betting (poker) Economic rent Airline Grand Theft Auto (game) Deficit spending American football Efficiency wages Intellectual property Graduate school 401(k) Progressive tax Animal Crossing Profit Interest Freeters Publicly funded medicine Fast bowling CPU design
