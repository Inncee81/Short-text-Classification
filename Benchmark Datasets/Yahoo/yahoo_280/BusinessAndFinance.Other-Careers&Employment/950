first job i was thinking about getting a p t job at roots or guess doing stocking or sales i was wondering how i would ask for it do i go up to the counter and ask to talk to the manager or just talk to the cashier do i have to bring a resume with me which is a better job stocking or sales go there and ask if they are hiring find out how old you have to be and what positions are available usually in retail you are everything sales associate stock ect fill out an application even if they arent hiring im sure you dont need a resume for a job at guess but when you fill out the app they are going to see that you have no experience so good luck Wal-Mart Citigroup Argos (retailer) The Apprentice 2 Steve Jobs Great Depression Microsoft Electronic Arts Costco Pixar Investment bank Retailer Division of labour G-Man (Half-Life) UK Singles Chart Apple Macintosh Inventory Management $ale of the Century Software engineering Electronic commerce NASDAQ Ashton-Tate Datalore (TNG episode) United Kingdom corporation tax Same-sex marriage in the United States Google Gucci Point of sale Development of Darwin's theory Professor Workplace democracy Killer application Outsourcing Mac OS history Internet fraud Genesis (band) Job interview Stock broker St. Louis Cardinals The Shining (film) Vending machine Intern Target Corporation Atlanta Braves Eaton's Fry's Electronics The Price Is Right Amazon.com Toronto Raptors Halliburton NEC Corporation Filling station The Arsenal of Freedom (TNG episode) First-sale doctrine Air traffic controller Apple Computer Jeff Bezos Pittsburgh Steelers NeXT Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism IKEA Dot-com Intellivision Real estate broker Stock market Paralegal Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Unemployment International Computers Ltd Springfield Nuclear Power Plant Corporate governance Anti-psychiatry Ty Cobb IPod Francis Crick Affirmative action R__sum__ Good Morning, Vietnam Hudson's Bay Company Efficiency wages J Sainsbury Warren Buffett New Coke Therion (band) Economics SAP R/3 One-hit wonder Commodore International Louis Sullivan David Kelly Academia Karma C__line Dion Cincinnati Reds Trans Australia Airlines Board game Patent medicine Sales tax
