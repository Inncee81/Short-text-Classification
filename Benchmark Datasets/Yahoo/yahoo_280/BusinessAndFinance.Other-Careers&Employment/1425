do you have to have your ss card to get a job i know this might sound like a dumb question but i am just wondering i just got a new job and i can't find my ss card any where and believe me i have looked every where i know that i can request another but it takes business days to get it and my first day is tomorrow and they expect for me to bring it in so what is the worst that could happen if they have to wait for it i really need help with this one cuz im goin crazy here thanks everyone but i looked around and found my own answer i will give the points to the person who was most correct oh by the way here it is employees are required to show their social security cards if available more important than seeing the actual card is submitting a worker's form w with the employee's correct number and the exact name that appears on the worker's social security card the employee may not get the proper credit for his her earnings unless the correct information appears on the employee's form w if your employee applied for a social security number but does not yet have a card or number indicate the number has been applied for on the employee's form w when the employee does receive his card file form w c corrected wage and tax statement with the employee's social security number an employee who does not have a social security number may apply for one by completing form ss application for a social security card workers can get and this is where i found it http employer ssa custhelp com cgi bin employer ssa cfg php enduser std adp php p faqid p created p sid mso arii p accessibility p redirect p lva p sp cf zcmnoptemcf zb j x j pszwx dyawrzb j pszwx jvd jbnq mswxjnbfchjvzhm jnbfy f cz wjnbfchy jnbfy y jnbfc vhcmnox r cgu yw zd vycy zzwfyy hfzxgmcf wywdlptemcf zzwfyy hfdgv dd xagf ihnob vszcbjigrviglmigfuigvtcgxvewvlihnhexmgagugagfzigfuifnttibjyxjkigj dcbubybjyxjkignhbibizsbwcm kdwnlza p li p topview yes you do if you explain that you can't find it and have applied for a duplicate they'll probably wait the days legally they are supposed to see it when you start work though your first paycheck could get held up until after you produce the card do you by any chance have a passport that could substitute for the time being Social Security (United States) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair GED Identity theft Minimum wage Cross site scripting British national identity card Windows 2000 Social Security number (United States) Taxation in the United States H-1B visa Password Immigration to the United States Graduate school Labour economics Expert system National Insurance PHP Software engineering Database GameFAQs Civil rights Driver's license Identity document Social rule Social Security Administration Compiler optimization Bank fraud Electronic commerce United States Postal Service Labor theory of value Common Unix Printing System Contract bridge Coercion New Deal Mao (game) Ajax (programming) Object-SQL mapping Appeal Monty Hall problem Perl Economics Jeopardy!
