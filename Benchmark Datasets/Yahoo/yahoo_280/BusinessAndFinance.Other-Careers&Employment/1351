is this bad job etiquette let s say you apply for several jobs at several different organizations simultaneously one of them makes an offer and you accept then about weeks later another one of the organizations calls and makes an offer and this second offer is where you really wanted to work is it bad taste to leave the first job and take the second i would feel kind of funny about leaving having just started a couple of weeks earlier what do you think about this situation this situation happened to my friend but the difference is she hasnt started the job yet but she is already employed and completed the requirements she informed the company via landline and guess what the human resources manager did talk to her angrily that she has no professional ethics but the more important things are you really wanted that new job it will make you happy being employed there and if u would choose the job u really dont want then u wouldnt be that productive anymore because you have lots on your mind the what ifs the regrets and everything be true and at least you informed them goodluck Ethics Theory of conduct Social rule Management Utilitarianism Jennifer Lopez Economics Goodness and value theory Economic inequality Unemployment Pitaten Microeconomics Mojave people Employment W.
