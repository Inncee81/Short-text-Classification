second thoughts about career i'm studying an early childhood teaching degree and i think i made a mistake by choosing this career my parents put a lot of pressure on me to study for a career that has reasonably good pay and when i suggested either art or working with animals they both almost forced me against doing either of them because they are not such secure jobs my parents also payed for the fees which was a selfish mistake on my part which means whenever i have suggested changing they say that i will waste all that money they spent on me i feel quite unhappy that for the next year and a half and more since i will have to save up some money i will be wasting my life doing something that i just dont want to do i feel stuck in a rut and i am unhappy most of the time i can't even be bothered going to lectures half the time because i just have no passion for what i am doing do i stick to it for another year and a half or should i change now i suggest that you sit down lay down the facts first then on what you feel then you have a talk with your parents and tell them that you dont enjoy teh course you are taking anymore and then point out all the good things if you will follow the course you dictate of course you do know you have to support yourself since i do think that your parents will withdraw theirs Pitaten Education in Germany Avenue Q Graduate school About a Boy Freeters Characters in the Smurfs Friends George Costanza Mary Astor The Amber Spyglass Parasite singles Divorce Transactional analysis Ludwig Wittgenstein Anger management Capital accumulation Blood on the Tracks Hikikomori A Course In Miracles The Catcher in the Rye Inflation U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Rudolf Hermann Lotze Aesthetic Realism Happiness Education in the United States Ten Commandments Church of Christ, Scientist Carl Barks The Apprentice 2 Milton H.
