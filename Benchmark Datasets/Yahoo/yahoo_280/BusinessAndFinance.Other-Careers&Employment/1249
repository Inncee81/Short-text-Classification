employment verification i was hired by a company months ago however the position was misrepresented to me and i don't want to waste anymore time there so now i am looking for another job i've told potential employers that my current employer does not know i am looking so please do not contact them would most employers respect that and not contact them for employment verification considering that i am still there and don't want to get fired if they received a phone call i have excellent references from previous employers couldn't i just give those references most employers are upfront and ask if you give them permission to contact their current employer if you say no they will respect that but at the same time they may question why and that may lead to your integrity as a potential employee you're best bet is to be honest and let potential employers know that you are job hunting because you don't feel that the job you are in right now and if they would respect your decision and not contact your current employer since it will cause conflict on the job that should cover al your bases and make you look good but be aware that mistakes do happen Plame affair Social rule Poker jargon 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Sydney Riot of 1879 The Apprentice 2 Unemployment Electronic Arts Indian English Craps New York Jets Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Transactional analysis Short selling Time Out of Mind Florida Central Voter File Evan Mecham Theory of conduct Wal-Mart One Tree Hill (TV series) American football strategy Call centre Corporate governance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Ashlee Simpson Show Baseball Insurance Customer relationship management Mach kernel The Amazing Race Current teachings of Prem Rawat Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Consensus decision-making Employment Therion (band) Yoga Sutras of Patanjali United Airlines Flight 93 GSM services Surveillance Inflation Employment agency Anderson Cooper Steve Jobs Illegal immigration Job interview Shaggy dog story Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Karl Rove Volleyball Yusuf al-Qaradawi Emotions (album) Rain Man G-Man (Half-Life) Credit card Advance fee fraud Ethics New York Giants Killian documents Project Blue Book Ocean's Twelve Ross Perot Abortion debate Non-native pronunciations of English Plame affair timeline Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Trading Places Keynesian economics Parliament Act The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Betting (poker) Drug test Love and Theft Outsourcing Solar cell Michael D.
