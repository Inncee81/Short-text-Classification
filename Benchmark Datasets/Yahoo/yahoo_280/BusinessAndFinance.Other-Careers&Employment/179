should i take this job i am a special ed teacher and i was offered a new job by a different school district this year i resigned from my last position the end of the school year the reason being i didn't like the micromanagement lack of flexibility criticism or the severe needs of the students the position at this school is a little different but it is still special ed and the principal seems eager to hire me my dilema is that i have some hesitations with accepting this position because of the problems of this previous year the real pro for this position is the salary i'm looking at other job positions within the school system non teaching accepting a different position will mean less pay but less responsibility more flexibility and less stress please give me any constructive input or advice i just want to make sure that i am not over thinking this thing or jumping the gun the new position is not an administrative position it is another teaching job just in a different school district i will still be teaching i think you really like working with the children and that is your calling not a desk job Graduate school Professor Education in Japan Boston Public Education in the United States University of Pennsylvania Law School Education in Portugal Education in Germany Education in Singapore Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Secondary education in Japan Homeschooling Hogwarts subjects Librarian A Course In Miracles Satchel Paige Unemployment No Child Left Behind Act Past teachings of Prem Rawat Teaching English as a Foreign Language Affirmative action Economic inequality Tai Chi Chuan Academia Microeconomics Teach the Controversy Danish Folkeskole Education Education reform Education in Hong Kong Principal-agent problem Plame affair Springfield Elementary School Education Education in Romania Call centre Charter school Education in England United States House of Representatives Management Public education Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad Teacher British Civil Service Angela Davis GED Workplace democracy DBASE Jaime Escalante Aikido A-level Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Education in India Reiki Meditation Lawyer Lecturer SAT The Apprentice 2 Chinese martial arts Expert system Game programmer Robert McNamara Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Michael D.
