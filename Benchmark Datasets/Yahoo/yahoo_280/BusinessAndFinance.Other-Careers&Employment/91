interview problem i was asked in an interview about a job that i quit i worked at a catering center for half a year for or hours a week and i wasn't fired but i didn't officially quit either the job required that i frequently call in and request hours and i just stopped asking because i wanted make time for my social life because i was always working on weekends in an interview they asked me about why i quit the job and i couldn't think of a way to make it sound like i wasn't commited or didn't care what do you think would be the best answer when i said that i didn't have time for it with school and my life she asked me why i didn't have time for a or hours as to caitlyns reply don't you think it's possible that circumstances in my life have changed for example my schedule or my income i dont really care if you think i'm really young my question is still relevent and rather than giving me a disortation about how i'm irresponsible you should have just answered the question that i asked you dont need to give me your opinion on how i should be living my life in the future if you dont have a answer for the actual question maybe you should just mind your own business i would simply indicate that the position was temporary employment to increase your income and was no longer necessary most employers will understand that if they ask if you turned in a notice then i would explain that you let them know but since you only got hours if you requested them no notice was necessary Plame affair GED Extreme Programming The Ashlee Simpson Show The Price Is Right Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rick Santorum 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Unemployment Family Feud Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Slow Train Coming The Apprentice 2 Piccolo Junior Saga Labour economics Labor theory of value Sex Pistols Noam Chomsky George W.
