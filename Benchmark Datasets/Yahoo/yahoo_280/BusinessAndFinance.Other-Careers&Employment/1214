people say follow your heart in careers but what if your heart tells you to do about ten different things for those of us who don't have one all encompassing life passion choosing a satisfying career is near impossible one day it's one thing the next day it's something else the next day it's another field the next day it's another career then it usually gets back around to the beginning and it starts all over again talk about frustrating any advice for those of us who have a million different interests and who find choosing the right career almost impossible i don't want to be one of those people who is years old realizing they just spent the majority of their life doing something they hate thanks i would challenge you to think of even one truly successful person who isn't constantly juggling at least things maybe a hundred things all at the same time so its certainly not a bad thing to be multi talented and able to multi task of course there are also realities in life like keeping a roof over your head clothes on your back and food on your table most of us start with a job to supply the necessities of life but your job isn't your life do the job but then use the rest of your daily life pursuing other things that interest you the more interests you pursue the more experience and knowledge and contacts you will gain you never know when that cumulative knowledge experience and contacts will lead you to a more interesting career and a more interesting life to be sure the key perhaps is to tackle those various interests as you are realistically able and not bite off more than you can competently chew good luck Social rule Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Kender W.I.T.C.H.
