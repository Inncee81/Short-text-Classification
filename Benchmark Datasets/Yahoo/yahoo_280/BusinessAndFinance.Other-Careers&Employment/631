hate new job potential new er job has interesting 'requirement' i worked at bank a several years ago and left to give birth to my oldest child a couple of months ago i decided i wanted to try my hand at going back to work but bank a had no positions so i applied and got hired at bank b to put it bluntly i am hating working at bank b with a passion i've only been there for weeks and i'm having panic attacks in the mornings before going in i can't bear the thought of going back in but i feel too guilty to just leave a note saying i quit i found out yesterday bank a has an opening so i talked to the manager there and she mentioned that they get a little squeamish about re hiring people that have worked elsewhere since leaving them when she asked if i had i said no i figured that i hadn't been at bank b long enough that i'd put it on my resume anyway i have an interview tomorrow what should i do about bank b for bank a was it wrong to tell them what i did i should also mention that when she asked me if i'd worked anywhere else in the meantime i didn't understand the entire reason she was asking i thought it was the common question employers ask when there's an extended gap in your job history by the time she mentioned the squeamish thing i'd already answered and had no idea how to backpedal without looking foolish or like a liar no don't mention it and if you get the job all will be well you haven't been there long enuf for it to show up but you're getting close just go for the job you want b c why the heck do you want to stay at a job that's giving you panic attacks good luck and keep trying Social rule EastEnders The Apprentice 2 Knots Landing Blonde on Blonde Shaggy dog story Plame affair Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Ocean's Twelve Charles Ponzi Theory of conduct Kodocha Avenue Q Friends U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 God Emperor of Dune First Battle of the Atlantic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) George Costanza 2000 Australian Grand Prix Super Mario 128 Sharon Tate Abortion debate Operation Market Garden Slow Train Coming Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks The Shining (film) Jean Grey Married... with Children Sydney Riot of 1879 Good Times The Ashlee Simpson Show I Want to Hold Your Hand Boom Town (Doctor Who) The Catcher in the Rye Hey Jude David Hume Coming of Age (TNG episode) The Death Gate Cycle Captain Thunderbolt One Tree Hill (TV series) Peter Shilton Plame affair timeline Paul Is Dead Meat Loaf G-Man (Half-Life) Unemployment The Hitch-Hiker (The Twilight Zone) Zhao Yun Amiga Power Socrates The Star Wars Holiday Special Singapore gay equality movement Survivor (novel) Rais massacre Software engineering Infidels Free will The Subtle Knife Current teachings of Prem Rawat Good Morning, Vietnam Lauren Bacall Johnny 5 The nature of God in Western theology Sin City Jon Secada Haven (TNG episode) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Extreme Programming Humphrey Bogart Days of our Lives Goodness and value theory She Loves You W.
