how in the do stupid people get jobs when the person who has the real skills and talent doesnt can somebody please explain this there are many reasons an interview doesn't result in a job offer the interviewer may think that the applicant lacked the skills to perform the job was unable to answer questions clearly and concisely didn't project and successful profile and lacked poise or confidence was overly aggressive personality wouldn't fit with team was unprepared and asked few if any meaningful questions lack of research about the company was unable to explain unfavorable factors in a resume such as employment gaps or lack of degree had unrealistic expectations about salary was more interested in salary benefits than the job almost all interviewing problems could be avoided by taking the time to prepare and practice before the interview remember it is not necessarily the candidate who is the most qualified who gets the job it's the applicant who convinces the employer that she he can do the job and become a dynamic part of the company team the formula to success is part skills and part personality so make a good impression peace and every blessing Economic inequality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule GED The Apprentice 2 Civil rights Plame affair Unemployment Graduate school Game programmer Workplace democracy Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Social psychology Blackjack Professor Capitalism Inheritance (computer science) Scientology beliefs and practices Steve Jobs Offshoring Outsourcing Fight Club Inflation Expert system Affirmative action A Course In Miracles Gross domestic product Salary cap Freeters Science Intelligence quotient Altruism Alexander Technique Strategic management Publicly funded medicine Contract Peter Singer Principal-agent problem Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Karl Rove Taxation in the United States Collaboration Microeconomics Consensus decision-making Psychology Parapsychology Gender-neutral language Current teachings of Prem Rawat Criticism of libertarianism RISC The Apprentice 2 candidates David Beckham National Kidney Foundation Singapore Killian documents Life insurance Complexity classes P and NP Intelligent design God Emperor of Dune Insurance Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Labor theory of value Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Milton H.
