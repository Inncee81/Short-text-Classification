have you ever wanted to knock on the door of one of these big fancy houses and ask what they do for a living we live in georgia and there are all these big houses and they have the nice cars etc and what's scary is that ga is one of the more affordable states i feel like we are doing something drastically wrong his rate of pay seems decent to me but we live paycheck to paycheck we have no extra's no cell phones no cable tv no nice cars etc what's the secret where is all the money we see other guys in his industry doing just fine it's frusterating he's now looking to make a career move so we can be a little more comfortable what are you doing differently i feel like our money situation is that of someone living in but the rest of the world is in did you ever feel this way did you ever catch up and be comfortable i knew i would hear that i should get a job i work about hours a week in the evenings we chose to raise our kids without daycare and i realize we suffer financially for it but it just doesn't seem like it should be this bad it sounds like you are doing everything right and it is wonderful that you can work part time and keep your child out of daycare that time with them in invaluable i wonder the same thing myself i live in the northeast and you can't even buy a new bedroom bath house in our area in a safe neighborhood for less than to many of the really big houses are going for over they are popping up everywhere there are only so many doctors lawyers and ceo's even those people can't afford million dollar homes i finally figured it out when a few of my friends who make the same as my husband and i were buying homes twice as expensive they did it by borrowing as much as they are allowed even though they can barely make the payments and they receive help from parents grandparents etc i can't imagine my parents giving us big money to help us buy a home but turns out most of my friends have been getting or more from theres i was shocked it was so common i finally accepted that i can't catch up but at least i'm not house poor and can afford to go out to dinner buy a nice outfit or go away for the weekend a lot of people in those big houses can't even afford to furnish them Microeconomics EastEnders The Apprentice 2 Friends Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Social rule Ocean's Twelve The Amazing Race Gross domestic product Poker jargon Social Security (United States) Fancy Crane Insurance Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Good Times TLC Knots Landing Great Depression Blood on the Tracks Lou Gehrig The Ashlee Simpson Show Rent (musical) Married... with Children Rose (Doctor Who) St. Elmo's Fire (film) Make money fast George Costanza Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sin City New York Giants Theory of conduct Spice Girls The Emancipation of Mimi Ben Johnson (athlete) The Brady Bunch Freeters The Human Stain Supply and demand Warren Buffett Ron and Fez Big Brother UK series 6 Steve Jobs Series finale The Contender (television series) Meat Loaf Little Britain Public transport Spidey Super Stories Daredevil Hyperinflation Pitaten 2000 Australian Grand Prix Education in the People's Republic of China Internet fraud Bon Jovi Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Time Out of Mind Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Wal-Mart Sex and the City Wheel of Fortune Urban sprawl About a Boy The Fairly OddParents The Shining (film) Boston and Lowell Railroad Annuity Eric Bischoff Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Babe Ruth Arthur Laffer The Birds (film) Betting (poker) Hey Jude Estoppel Predatory lending Haven (TNG episode) Martin Scorsese U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Bretton Woods system Credit card Big Brother (USA TV series) Kill Bill War of the Worlds (2005 film) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Ranma __ characters Invader Zim Arbitrage
