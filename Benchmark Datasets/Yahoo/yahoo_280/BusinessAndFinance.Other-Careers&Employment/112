what to do with a patronizing team member at work hi i have just taken on a managing job and one person not directly under my management is sending me patronizing emails telling me how to do my job one example i have been in a discussion with someone and he sends me an email saying not good to see you upset best thing in a situation like that is to do this and that i have not been upset and i have sorted out the situation very well this guy has constant problems with other managers undermining them interrupting other colleagues and complaining all the time it is not that he is trying to be nice or is genuinly worried i am really annoyed with this guy as he is known to be a pain he is extremely big headed although he is doing constant mistakes at work and want him to stop emailing me would you directly adress this with him i am thinking of going up to him next time i see him and tell him straight what i think of course being diplomatic what is your take on this situation thank you in ad this person is known to play games at work in terms of creating trouble unfortunately he hasn't made a mistake worth enought to reprimand him seriously he has been showing bad work performance so he has been given another job of which he now complains is too easy for him but he is still not competent enough believe me or not but he actually suggested that he would be better in a managerial position lol i am actually suspicious of this guy now that he started writing emails to me which he shouldn't in the first place to suck up to me as i am one position under his line manager and could become his manager to provoke me to make a mistake he can use against me i just wonder why some people are like that he is wasting everyone's time let him know the score i appreciate you trying to help but would prefer you to concentrate on your own job 1957 World Series Theory of conduct Social rule Make money fast Plame affair Pretty Good Privacy The Smoking Room Shaggy dog story Debugging Internet troll Aerial (dance move) Transactional analysis Computer virus Friends Stopping e-mail abuse Milton H.
