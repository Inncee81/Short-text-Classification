what job can i get with this degree my degree is bachelors in business studies hons and i got into the final year on the basis of my short diploma in business studies and actually i had two years diploma in software engineering before that so i am totally confused in what sector will i apply for job what is my career thanks in advance your major and career can be completely unrelated many people major in something they feel forced into or seem to be a good idea at the time once they find out what is involved in a job in their major field they go yuck career should have to do with what you think you would enjoy doing does software engineering or business sound more interesting to you they are completely different fields for example i graduated with a computer science degree once i tried a job in programming i didn't like it then i kept trying other jobs until i found something i liked i tried web design tech writing tech support i t support i think i found my niche which is tech training it's been years since i graduated so don't feel too discouraged if you don't know now take baby steps find an entry level job based on company or your skill set get your foot in the door and you will have a better idea what jobs are available that might interest you that was the only way i could find out there are many jobs that you didn't even known existed until you meet a person that does it Master's degree Software engineering City and Guilds of London Institute Education in Australia Medical school Academic degree Graduate school Education in Portugal Game programmer Computer Outsourcing Florida Institute of Technology Electrical engineering Memorial University of Newfoundland Associate's degree Juris Doctor College Seneca College Georgia Institute of Technology Chinese University of Hong Kong Trinity College, Dublin Bachelor of Arts University of Central Florida Scientology beliefs and practices Nurse Lawyer GED Bachelor's degree Civil engineering Computer virus Australian Qualifications Framework Community college Education in Finland Education in the United States Paralegal Education in Germany Kingston University Doctorate Georgetown University Ethics Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Mach kernel Technology Indian Institutes of Management Requirements analysis Software testing Stevens Institute of Technology Education in the Republic of Ireland W.
