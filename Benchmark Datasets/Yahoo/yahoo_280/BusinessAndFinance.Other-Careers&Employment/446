do paramedics make good money im thinking about becoming one not just for the money but because im really into that kinda stuff but ive heard that its kinda hard to make a living with that job soo if its true what would u recommend me to study the base pay for medics is crap most of the time if your work a dangerous area you'll get paid better but you'll still be working long hours i'm an emt b i work hour shifts for little pay i think starting pay for medics out here in king county is around an hour but i haven't asked any starting pay for a basic is between and though and that's where you'll have to begin i heard on the east coast medics make k a year plus though so it's really varied if you want to be a medic you have to understand that it's a great job but it's long hours low pay ungrateful patients and a high burn out rate it takes a special breed of person to do that job well if you really want to be a medic you have to start as an emt basic or emt check out what colleges in your area offer this class i also suggest joining your local volunteer fire department and do some time on the band aid wagon after you've been a basic for about years you can apply to medic school which is a year class and is very very difficult Ambulance Emergency Medical Services Emergency medical technician Paramedic Graduate school First aid Unemployment Blackjack Education in the People's Republic of China Certified first responder Student loan Inflation Labour economics College admissions Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11, 2001 attacks Labor theory of value Unemployment benefit Education in the United States Kingdom Hospital Ariel (Firefly episode) Triage Myocardial infarction Insurance Scholarship Alcoholics Anonymous Physician Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Education in Germany Hypoglycemia Economics Education in Hong Kong Illegal drug trade Life insurance Team Fortress Classic Stroke Flat tax Progressive tax Education in Australia Antiretroviral drug Bipolar disorder Traumatic brain injury Community emergency response team Economic inequality National Kidney Foundation Singapore General practitioner The Sims 2: University Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Principal-agent problem Supply and demand Education in Portugal Time Out of Mind Milton H.
