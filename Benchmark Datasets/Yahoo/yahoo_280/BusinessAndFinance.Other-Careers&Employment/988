would this be appropriate or a nuisance to employeers i applied for a job on through my local workforce center then i found the same job on careerbuilder so i applied again on to make sure that they got my resume i added a comment that i had sent an e mail to them earlier applying for the same job i really want this job so i have been checking the web to see if they still have the job posted but i haven't bothered them anymore i feel like i'm a good fit but doubt a lot because i haven't heard anything from them yet would it be appropriate if i sent an e mail to them asking what the status is for the position that i applied for and when they plan on filling the position thanks for your answers ahead of time as a former employer i say go ahead and ask they should have said when a decision would be made Spam (electronic) Call centre Civil rights Sealand Social rule Plame affair Post office Sydney Riot of 1879 United States Postal Service Charles Ponzi The Apprentice 2 Karl Rove Economic inequality Externality Scholarship Downing Street memo Poker jargon Outsourcing Avenue Q 2000 Australian Grand Prix Friends Domain Name System George W.
