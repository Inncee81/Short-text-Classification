state job how long and also question about salary had an interview two weeks ago for a small division within the state government department has people total and was told to either call back or she might get with me first so that friday she sent me an email saying there were two possible candidates and i was one they would decide monday thats a week and a half ago now and send off the paperwork to the hr department she said she will call the candidate with the offer as soon as it is approved by hr so how long does it take a state hr department to approve paperwork on a chosen applicant also she said that the salary is determined by the hr department and that it is not her choice i have done some research and found that almost every new hire in our state is paid the midpoint salary of their classification so whenever she calls does that mean i should accept whatever salary or should i attempt negotiation i have been working for years at only an hour so i'd be ok with the low end even but more is good in most states there is no opportunity for negotiation be happy this is not a federal job which usually starts people at the low point if the salary is not what you want you can ask is the salary open to negotiation but be prepared for a no once you get in you may be able to make up the low salary once you are out of the probationary period and pass your first review good luck to you Canadian House of Commons The Apprentice 2 Economic inequality Professor Graduate school United States House of Representatives National Football League Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus British House of Commons Education in Germany Unemployment benefit Kyoto Protocol Publicly funded medicine Michael D.
