a question about job interviews does anyone know why this happens why don't companies send a letter or email to the people they have interviewed to let them know that the job has been filled it is very stressful to wait for two or three weeks and hear nothing back from the companies i send a letter of thanks after each interview but the companies don't seem to have the courtesy to inform me when the position is filled i email them one week later to let them know i am still interested yet they don't even respond to the email with a note saying if the job is filled or not i have heard this same thing from other people who go to interviews is it the new practice of hr to just ignore the people after the interview why would they think this is acceptable to job candidates is there anything i can do or say at the interview to encourage them to let me know don't take it personally yes it is the new practice somewhere along the line we as a culture decided people don't matter that much and therefore neither does politeness once you've decided someone isn't of use it takes a little time and energy so only exceptional people take that step these days i think you can ask the interviewer if it is their policy to let a candidate know when the position is filled and if it isn't their policy to do so then what would be a good time to check back with them it can be a good way to keep you in the mind of the interviewer i actually got a good job this way once my boss told me it was one of the reasons she hired me best of luck to you Social rule Plame affair E-mail Internet fraud Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act The Apprentice 2 Advance fee fraud Karl Rove Coming of Age (TNG episode) Infantilism Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.
