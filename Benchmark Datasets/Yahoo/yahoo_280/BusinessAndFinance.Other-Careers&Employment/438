should i employ him or not a somewhat trivial question perhaps but i would like to have your opinion i have a former employee that left to try another work as he did this he parted with telling everyone how good it should be to leave since he was tired of the work and that he was generally not pleased with how things had developed for him the last six months after being at his new work for only four weeks he phoned me and was very regretful he had gained insight according to himself that his old job was much better than he had believed i met him to judge his sincerity and i think he really menas it so i need someone like him and have a place for him but what would you do everyone makes mistakes if he is sincere in what he says i think you should consider accepting him back in any case i think you should also give him a little lecture about what he said to your employees before he left peace and blessings Social rule Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints John Kerr Sydney Riot of 1879 Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) George Edward Moore Past teachings of Prem Rawat Book of Mormon Plame affair Apology (Plato) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Secretar__a de Inteligencia Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones Cindy Sheehan 613 mitzvot Merit Karl Rove George Costanza American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Bertrand Russell Universal pragmatics Consensus decision-making Alexander I of Russia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Epistemology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religious pluralism Extreme Programming Joseph Louis Lagrange Customs and etiquette of Japan Yusuf al-Qaradawi The Human Stain Western betrayal The writing of Principia Mathematica New York Giants Katelyn Faber Killian documents EastEnders Patriarch Eutychius of Constantinople Ocean's Twelve Nicomachean Ethics Panay incident Graduate school Teresa Heinz Kerry Appeal Visitor pattern Creationism Species National Kidney Foundation Singapore George Oppen Current teachings of Prem Rawat Muslim ibn Aqeel Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pledge of Allegiance Amiga Power David Blunkett Vladimir Peter Tytla Ludwig Wittgenstein A Course In Miracles Sola fide Cyrus S.
