i just quit my new job and they keep calling me what to do i just quit a design job that i started about a month ago and decided that it wasn't the right job for me i started at a busy time they gave me so much work and so little training that i was doing it blindly the company is very disorganized and reminds me too much of my last job which i stayed at for years until i couldn't take the bs anymore the last thing i want to do is get myself into another position that makes me miserable also this job would have required me to relocate across the country now the people from the company keep calling me and telling me that i was the best person for the job and they don't understand why i quit and they keep asking if i'm sure about my decision i started at a bad time things won't always be this way and so on i am not reconsidering going back but i don't know what to tell them someone suggested going back this is not an option i played the same role in the last job that i had i was one of the only cheerful and helpful people in a company of miserable people who hated their jobs and hated the company i need to never do that again i cannot expect to make a company change their ways they made the statement that you were the best person they had you going back would be for their benefit not yours and i'd tell them that you don't need to sacrifice your well being just to make their life easier i would also tell them that you have no interest in relocating if they continue to call i wouldn't listen to them as soon as they started talking i would say i told you i'm not interested and hang up i personally wouldn't block thier calls although it's an option i would like them to hear it from me personally yes it rude but obviously they are being rude by continue to call they're as bad as telemarketers by the way congratulations are breaking out before it dragged you down good luck Social rule Craps Kodocha Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Friends Knots Landing Carl Barks Fight Club Charmed Piccolo Junior Saga Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Smoking Room Phoebe Halliwell Cliff Richard 2000 Australian Grand Prix Alcoholics Anonymous George Harrison David Hume Unemployment The Apprentice 2 Sandy Koufax Plame affair Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Spice Girls Methos Kender Time Out of Mind The Shining (film) Married... with Children Pitaten Current teachings of Prem Rawat Labour economics The Amber Spyglass Satchel Paige Blonde on Blonde Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Poker jargon Sydney Riot of 1879 Waking the Dragons The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.
