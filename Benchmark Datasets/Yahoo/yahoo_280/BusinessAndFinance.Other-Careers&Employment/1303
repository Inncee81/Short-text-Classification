what should i wear i have an second interview today at a gym for a front desk position and i was just wondering what i should wear because it isn't a place that people dress professionally even in my first interview the guy that was interviewing me is a personal trainer and he had on a gym shirt and a pair of cargo shorts i was thinking about wearing a pair of khaki pants with a cute babydoll shirt and a pair of roped flip flop wedges do you think that will be ok for the job interview for non office positions many people try to dress as though they are coming to the job so if that is similar to what the people at the front desk wear then yes with a couple suggestions no skin between top and bottom some baby doll tops cover some don't another options would be a nice t shirt preferably no printing or something innocuous with appropriate undergarments go with tennis shoes after all it is a gym many places have restrictions against flip flops for employees even though customers can wear them that way the person interviewing you doesn't have to tell you that what you have on would not be ok for work i Paul Is Dead Social aspects of clothing Canadian Armed Forces Black tie Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling slang Sea Scouts (BSA) Figure skating Cliff Richard Shoe Suit (clothes) Trousers Kilt White-collar worker Volleyball Bob Jones University Trailer Park Boys Kimono Poker jargon Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Sally Brown Babydoll Friends Cowboy Goatse.cx George Costanza Sento Beavis and Butt-head Andrew Dice Clay Professional wrestling holds Mario SpongeBob SquarePants FoxTrot Sharon Tate Gaia Online Physical attractiveness Mixed martial arts Strap-on dildo Clothing Avril Lavigne Military slang Gay slang Pok__mon Live!
