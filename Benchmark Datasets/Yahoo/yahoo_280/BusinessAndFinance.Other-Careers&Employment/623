advice on turning down a job i need constructive advice on how to turn down a job position i was offered a teaching job and i am unsure if it is a good fit for me i have talked to the principal about the job and she seems eager and accommodating to meet my needs however i still just have an uneasy feeling about the position my previous teaching job was stressful and aggravating i'm afraid that i might accept the job and don't like it and then i have to stay due to contract reasons please give me some serious advice on how and what i should say when i decline the offer serious advice only be gracious and offer no reasons excuses in some cases in life being vague is a good thing if you offer reasons that opens up the possibility that who ever has offered you the job will look at your reason as an obstacle and one they need to overcome that is where you'll get stuck as you don't want the obstacles overcome consider something like this i appreciate the offer interviewing allows us both to learn upon considering all that i have learned about this position i find this opportunity isn't the right fit for me thank you for your time and consideration it's quite the compliment that you are being pursued you must have a lot to offer an organization but one thing you say stands out i have an uneasy feeling about the position i'm a firm believer to trust your gut your subconscious mind has registered something that your conscious mind hasn't seen yet go with your instinct best of luck to you Social rule Milton H.
