how do you deal with a boss who is uptight about sick time my boss feels that you should only take a sick day if you're close to dying if you have a cold or something else you should either come to work anyway or you should have taken more vitamins to enhance your immune system so very rarely i do take sick days if i have a bad cold or the flu and i get snide comments from her when i return the firm i work for provides a guideline of no more than sick days a year this is only a guideline and by no means a concrete allotment so how do i deal with this boss how do i respond to her remarks i call in sick maybe three times in a good year maybe four times in a bad year and it's never for more than two days at a time she gets sick but she still comes in she prides herself on never taking sick time when i come back she will ask if i went to the doctor she will say oh so you decided to join us things like that unless you are abusing the policy just ignore her comments she prides herself on perfect attendance which indicates she has perfection and control issues nothing you can say or do will make any difference Vitamin C Common cold Weapons of mass destruction Tocopherol Rick Santorum Corporate governance Trainspotting (novel) Folic acid Anarchism and society Antiviral drug Radiation poisoning Boss (video games) Ranma __ characters Immune system Cenodoxus H5N1 Donald Rumsfeld Spanish flu Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Time Out of Mind Social rule Poker jargon Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Capitalism Akuma (Street Fighter) Ethics Beavis and Butt-head Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dubuque Gender-neutral language Evil StarCraft Episode VI Health insurance Utilitarianism Theory of conduct Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Phoebe Halliwell Goodness and value theory International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Swedish allotment system Anorexia nervosa Calvin and Hobbes Psoriasis Charles Darwin's views on religion Maison Ikkoku Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Scientology beliefs and practices Angel (vampire) Double Dragon Blog Nutrition Nicomachean Ethics Insurance Narcissism Force (Star Wars) Journalism ethics and standards Vernon Schillinger Sola fide Drug abuse Charles Goodyear Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Blood (computer game) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hip hop rivalries Babe Ruth Duesberg hypothesis Japan-United States relations Mahathir bin Mohamad Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus CPU cache Characters in the Smurfs Economics E-mail spam John R.
