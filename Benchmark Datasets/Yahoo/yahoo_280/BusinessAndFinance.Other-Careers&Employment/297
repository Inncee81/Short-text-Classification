good careers without college is it possible to have a good career without college my parents took my college money that i earned with my own job i wasn't going to attempt to earn it all back and i never saw the need of college i hate the fact we have to pay to learn when we can just learn from the job itself there are many jobs that say i need a college background although i could learn the material myself graphic designing web programming etc but i seem to be nothing without that stupid degree i had nothing but a's and b's throughout highschool and now i'm stupid server in a stupid restaurant and i want out and a better career without college any suggestions sorry to call serving stupid but in this town it is i am working at one of the top notch restaurants a fine dining with a full bar right on the river but they still treat us like we all came from mcdonalds there are virtually no good jobs without some education under your belt notice that i said some education most people do not realize that there are huge opportunities for people to go to schools that do not take a tremendous amount of time and last less than a traditional year degree look into a technical college in your area and do some research on careers that might interest you then look at the wages associated with those careers and the amount of time that it takes to learn the job or go to school truck driving is a good example of a career where people make good money and do not have to spend a lot of time in school some trucking companies will even pay for your school or teach you themselves other jobs that might interest you are in the healthcare field there are many technical jobs there that do not take a lot of time in school my advice to you is to take the o net interest profiler it's free and a good tool to learn your interests google it that same webpage has a ton of resources that are free to use that give you wage data on many jobs and the education you need to get there good luck to you oh and you can work and go to school at the same time millions of people do it and it keeps you earning the money while you are paying it out for school it will be worth it in the end go back to school degree is not necessary for a good job but it helps a two year degree is often better paying than a year degree Economic inequality Software engineering Microeconomics Computer Education in the United States MMORPG Minimum wage Mach kernel Capitalism Education in Germany Education in Romania Master's degree Pitaten Inflation Student loan Education Homeschooling Avenue Q Tax Capital accumulation Affirmative action Lawyer BASIC programming language Statistics Anarchism and capitalism Cornell University Final Fantasy XI Education in Japan Education in Portugal University of Central Florida Year 2000 problem James J.
