is there anything similar to young people's apprenticeships available for adults my friend has been working in construction all his life doing demolition a bit of benchwork site labouring etc as well as years tyre fitting but has never really got a skilled trade behind him i am aware there's plenty of crash courses out there to do plastering plumbing etc but employers clearly want time served i wondered how he could go about finding an employer that would train him in a skill as he's too old for a modern apprenticeship or any courses that would open the door to gaining employment with experience any help would be much appreciated if he goes to college he can get them to put him on a placement with an employer a lot of employers are happy to accept older candidates as they are more committed Apprenticeship Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Education in Portugal Employment in Hong Kong Nurse Cooperative education Education in Hong Kong Skilled worker Unemployment Reiki Education in the United States Division of labour Tire Eric Heffer Otterbein College Social rule Community college Seneca College City and Guilds of London Institute Advanced Placement Program Paralegal Conscription Advocate Carpenter Education in Australia Avenue Q School bus Economic inequality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Golf Scottish Qualifications Authority Unreal Craft unionism Michael Thonet Changeroom Vocational education Merrimack College Dog agility Australian Qualifications Framework Solomon's Temple UCAS Graduate school Plymouth Freeters Construction H.
