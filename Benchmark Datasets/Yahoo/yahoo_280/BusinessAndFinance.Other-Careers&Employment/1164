abusive boss hi i work for a mortgage company which at the beggining i really enjoyed until my boss will start calling me after work asking me and pushing me to work after hours and call me many time and send me several text messages pushing me to do it he wont pay me extra hours we don't have a written contract he doesn't pay sick days or holidays i have no benefits like insurance last week i was sick at the hospital and he called me asking me things about work i'm in the process of looking for another job but might time weeks meanwhile i really need this job but i'm stressing out and it is really messing with my mental health i don't know what to do i even have to go to his house and pay his personal bills because he can't even write a check to pay his own please advise thank you what a lot of this stuff sounds really fishy and not to mention it's crossing all sorts of ethical boundaries it's unethical for him to ask you to work extra hours without pay not to mention it's really crossing boundaries for you to go to his house to pay his personal bills without having record of it somehow on payroll or something i really recommend finding a new job within the next week or two search on careerbuilder monster craigslist org and backpage com look in the newspaper and find something because this is getting out of hand in the meantime what needs to happen is to set clear and professional boundaries first tell him you won't go to his house to pay his bills because that's not work related or he needs to bring those items into the office during work hours for you to complete with pay secondly you also need to tell him that if he is asking you to work after hours you need to be paid at least half time or you will not do it thirdly report his a to the better business bureau don't tell him of course and notify them that the manager is abusing his authority and demanding that his employees work outside of work hours with no pay that'll get him in gear either that or broke from paying lawyer's fees but really this needs to stop he can try to continue to manipulate you using fear over you but start setting these boundaries Wal-Mart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment Insurance Social rule Advance fee fraud Payroll United States Postal Service London Congestion Charge Blackjack Life insurance Plame affair E-mail spam Outsourcing Video game developer Air traffic controller Search engine optimization Open access FairTax Royal Assent Sin City New Deal Scientology beliefs and practices Evan Mecham Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Call centre Extreme Programming Alex Ferguson Health care in the United States Childbirth Internet fraud Sweatshop Mortgage Poker jargon Ethics 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Construction Roswell UFO incident Theory of conduct Friends Education in the People's Republic of China 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines National Health Service The Amazing Race Social Security (United States) She Loves You RuneScape quests Time Out of Mind Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Employment in Hong Kong Management Ocean's Twelve Microeconomics Notary public Karl Rove Make money fast USA PATRIOT Act Transactional analysis Graduate school Swimming Electronic Arts Labor theory of value Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Minimum wage Publicly funded medicine Shaggy dog story Infantilism Firefighter Hey Jude Sampling (music) Drug test Triage Mensal__o scandal George Costanza Fair Game (Scientology) Annuity Theodore Kaczynski Blood (computer game) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Street-Legal Procrastination The Apprentice 2 Spam (electronic) Mental Health Act 1983 Primerica Financial Services Leeds United F.C. 2005 trial of Michael Jackson US health reform under FDR Medical prescription Kasparov versus The World Vivian Solon Divorce
