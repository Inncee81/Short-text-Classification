credit checks for employment why do companies do credit checks for employment i was thinking if you are out of a job it is likely your credit score will drop because of lack of income so how can you pay your bills without an income you need a job companies generally want to do a credit check if the employee will be in a position to handle cash or credit cards because the temptation to take some would be greater i am a former human resource manager if someone told me they were going to do a credit check for a job that did not entail money or credit checks i would ask them why if they said something like to find out how responsible you are i would ask them if they could validate the results of the test to show that people with poor credit ratings were not as responsible as others there are many reasons for a poor credit rating and they do not all have to do with irresponsibility i would feel that the test could be discriminatory even though i have great credit i would not want to work for a company that required this report incidently credit reports do not indicate how much money you have they just tell whether you pay your bills in a timely manner and show how many credit cards you have and indicate if you have been declined for credit Credit card The Amazing Race Taxation in the United States Insurance Inflation Corporate finance Slot machine Labour economics Graduate school Bank United Kingdom corporation tax Internet fraud Drug test Flat tax Affirmative action Intelligence quotient Education in the People's Republic of China Unemployment benefit Poker jargon Credit score Debit card Minimum wage Primerica Financial Services Cheque Capitalism Electronic commerce Money supply Life insurance Credit union Social Security (United States) 401(k) Unemployment Economy of Russia Personal finance Dividend Fiat money Food Stamp Program Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Finance HIV test Economic inequality Ford Motor Company FairTax Octopus card Anarchist economics Money Monetary policy Yield curve U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Wal-Mart Termination of employment Deflation (economics) Bond Annuity Public Eye Bretton Woods system Call centre British national identity card Predatory lending Hyperinflation Tax Year 2000 problem Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Electricity meter National Kidney Foundation Singapore Background check Medicare (Canada) United States Postal Service Incident Command System Great Depression Credit history Publicly funded medicine John Lott Identity theft Debugging Betting (poker) Student loan Surveillance Gun politics Child support Israeli Arab Tom DeLay Freeters Citigroup Mike Harris GED Economy of Haiti Compensation of employees Charles Ponzi Monetarism Skype National Insurance Mortgage Outsourcing 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities AIDS in Africa Polytomous Rasch model Financial audit Electronic money Reaganomics
