will this ruin my chances i have an interview for a teaching assistant job next week my problem is that i included in my list of credentials that i have a certificate in tefl via a distance learning course i indicated that the cert would be issued in july because i was told by my distance learning instructor that it would take about months to process my cert from time of submission problem is it's august and my cert hasnt arrived yet i followed up with my school and was told that it actually takes about months i know i can explain this to the school i am applying to but i am worried the certificate isnt a requirement for the job but i am afraid it will reflect badly since i placed it in my resume and don't have the actual paper yet will this put my job application in jeopardy is there some other way that you can show them that you have completed all the work and are just waiting for the certificate to be mailed print out your grades or the list of classes you took or something or other info from the school if not i wouldn't sweat it especially if it's not a requirement if you get all stressed out over this or make a big deal about it it will hurt you more you know that you took the classes and earned the certificate so assume that it's ok and go in with a positive outlook good luck Junior Certificate Graduate school GED Teaching English as a Foreign Language Leaving Certificate High school Software engineering Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Legal aspects of transsexualism Community college Community emergency response team Teacher Tai Chi Chuan City and Guilds of London Institute Education in Germany A-level Martial art Pretty Good Privacy Social rule Electrical engineering Jeopardy!
