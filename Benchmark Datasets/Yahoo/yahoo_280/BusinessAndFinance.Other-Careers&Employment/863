big delimma with boss i have always felt distant with my manager and i thought in the beginning she didn't like me becaue i was late and she was telling me to do things when i thought there was nothing to do lately we have been talking to eachother making small talk and jokes but today we were putting things away knapsacks pencil cases lunch boxes at accessory store and she pushed a bag off the counter and it slide hitting my face i held my cheek and looked shocked as she laughed she than later threw a bag in my direction and a couple of pencils cases on the floor i felt like crap she than made a joke about me and co worker us both being late and the only difference is she works i work just as hard and made big contributions to this place i want to know what to do and how to approach her about today i don't want to pretend nothing happened i want to confront her btw our store is closing in days and i wanted to ask her for a reference s she sounds like my old boss i confronted her on certain things and guess what lol i ended up leaving the same day without a reference so think before you say something you'll regret if i were you i would ask her for that reference today and if you dont get the reference you want it would be wise to get the phone numbers of your collegues and have them listed on your cv as referees at my old job instead of getting references employees who were leaving were issued with work certificates which showed the date of employment and date of termination etc you could ask your boss to sign off on one of those and have a collegue be your referee instead of hoping to get a reference full of good words from her also im in australia and thats a classic case of workplace bullying unfortunately i didn't have the guts to take it any further good luck though and i hope everything works out for you EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Craps Friends Ocean's Twelve Dilbert The Catcher in the Rye Poker jargon The Ashlee Simpson Show Knots Landing George Costanza Columbine High School massacre Time Out of Mind Jennifer Lopez Reservoir Dogs Fancy Crane Ty Cobb Milton H.
