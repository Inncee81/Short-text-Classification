future career i have no idea what i want to be when i grow up and i am going into high school now i'm afraid i shall not be able to think of my future career and yeah i am quite good in history and literature my weak subjects are math and science i am quite good at memorizing things i was thinking about being a pilot but pilots need to be good at math and science and i don't think i can put up with that throughout my life i guess i just need some suggestions x first don't look back someday and have regrets if you want to be a pilot and don't do it i was an f pilot at nas miramar until best thing i have ever done or will ever do in my life second you mention a common mis conception about pilots need to be good at math i found to be wrong i was good at math and thought that would help but these days all math is done by computers leaving you with more time to fly the airplane or jet exactly where it needs to be for the job or mission we had zero math majors in my squadron and the pilot with the best carrier landing grades was a history major all naval aviators are taught this lesson to fly aviate navigate communicate this means good eye hand coordination are you good at video games can you memorize a few basics long enough to accept interruptions like listening to course altitude and who to watch out for and avoid can you talk on the radio while doing the above but keep in mind the true order of the three basic rules if you need to do one at a time it's more complicated when learning but these basics will keep you and your passengers safe in normal and emergency conditions don't worry about the math you don't need to calculate trig solutions in your head other skills needed are situational awareness look at the accidents lately the helicopters collided in phoenix because they lost track of each other visually no math the airliner that crashed in brazil was because the pilot was too fast on approach and should have waved off and set up again the only math he needed was displayed right in front of him airspeed altitude and runway distance markers he landed fast and long down the runway a runway that he knew was so short that you must be on speed and altitude perfectly that's kind of embarrassing to miss an approach but most pilots are said to rather die than look bad not me and i made it through some scary situations i'm not a career counselor but i wanted to make sure you were clear on what it takes to be a pilot and that you are informed enough to follow your dream if piloting is really a dream good luck tomcats rule Air traffic control Airport Gliding Air safety Fixed-wing aircraft B-47 Stratojet Aircraft carrier Airshow Accidents and incidents in aviation Air navigation Jet engine Paragliding Gimli Glider Theory of conduct General aviation Glider Mathematics Parachuting Air traffic controller Airport (film) Social rule Aircraft Spatial disorientation Flight simulator Instrument Landing System VHF omnidirectional range Heinkel He 112 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kai Tak Airport Pilot certification in the United States Milton H.
