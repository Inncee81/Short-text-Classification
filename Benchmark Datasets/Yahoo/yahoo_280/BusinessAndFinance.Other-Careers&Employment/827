continue pursuing this company i had an interview with a company a few months ago and recently i rent a resume for a different job i feel like this company wants nothing to do with me based on how the interview went and also the way they've responded to me the new job posting was only up for days when i received a curt email back saying that they would contact me and i should not contact them for any further job interests then just a couple days ago i find out that a girl i know from school got an interview for the same job the job posting's been up for a week during the interview i was asked strange questions why do you think in this field being objective is important along with what is your favorite supervisor like did you ever deal with a coworker who wasn't pulling their weight and what happened to them i thought they would ask me extensively about my experience but instead they asked me only and the rest of them had to do with personality questions and other things i'd consider gossip i answered all their questions concisely and asked them a lot of questions about their company what their expectations are etc but every time i asked them one positive question about the company they asked me questions that seemed gossipy also they took weeks to get back to me about whether or not i got the job after my interview i have friends who tell me that because that company's mainly women they must have thought i came across as too aggressive and objective however with my current job i was the same way during the interview and i was hired the next day afterwards what gives this is a really good company with stellar benefits hours pay i'm wondering if i did something wrong what i was asked were not behavioral interview questions those questions are based on how you handled situations and resolve conflicts asking me what my favorite supervisor is like is very different from asking me what i think is good in a supervisor whatever happened to getting the job done well and finding a person to do that i recently had a review with my current company and was told that i did extremely well all while maintaining the same attitude that i displayed during the interview i know what behavioral interview questions are and whatever those people were asking you weren't those sorts of questions what kind of idiot asks what is your favorite supervisor like why would you ever want to put someone in a position like that playing favorites in the workplace has never been a good thing i wouldn't bother with that company anymore it seems that they are more concerned about keeping different personalities away than they are about being focused on getting work done you also mentioned that there are women there as well no offense to anyone but women can be really catty and gossipy and you didn't give them that vibe would you really want to work for a place like that look elsewhere Social rule The Apprentice 2 Plame affair Theory of conduct Friends Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Mojave people Roswell UFO incident Avenue Q Ethics 2005 trial of Michael Jackson U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Kodocha Scientology beliefs and practices Plame affair timeline Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Super Mario 128 Blood on the Tracks The Ashlee Simpson Show One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Downing Street memo God Emperor of Dune Blonde on Blonde Killian documents Sexual orientation Social psychology Extreme Programming 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Good Times Dilbert W.
