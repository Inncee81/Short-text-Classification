breaking into a good old boy network i recently landed a very poorly paid position with the state prison department its headquarters are in a rather small town the whole thing is set up like a good old boy network where it is who you know not what you know that matters i am finding it very hard to find better paid work even though i have a degree because i am not originally from this town and thus do not know everyone a friend of mine from this town was not only hired faster than i was but was able to secure a better paid position because she personally knew the people in that department who were doing the hiring i actually have more experience and more qualifications than my friend but am stuck doing work a trained monkey could perform how do i break into this network to get a better position how do i make myself known in a positive way so that i have a better shot thanks sometimes it is just not possible to do so unless you play their games consider a move to another area if this bothers you because you may find the beneifts will be worth the move Graduate school Lawyer Professor MegaMan Battle Network 5 RuneScape economy Poker jargon Paralegal New York City Police Department Friends Socrates Humphrey Bogart Professional wrestling slang Faster-than-light Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Academia Outsourcing MMORPG Snooker Good Times Volleyball Economic inequality Parachuting Public education One Piece minor characters Game programmer Software engineering MP3 Piccolo Junior Saga IBM PC compatible Illegal drug trade Scouting Sydney Riot of 1879 Rugby union positions One Tree Hill (TV series) Blonde on Blonde Contract Sin City RuneScape locations United States Army Aerial (dance move) Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Pitaten Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 NeXT Hard disk Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal MegaMan Battle Network Conker's Bad Fur Day Yohoho!
