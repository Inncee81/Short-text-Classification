i'm having problems with work i work three days a week and get paid as though i'm working five in the financial end i make out well at this job but the stresses that come with it are endless blame is put on the staff for every little thing that goes wrong i've worked there for two years and the staff has changed completely several times through those two years so i wonder even though the pay is good weighing it against the extra stress is it worth it to stay in my opinion happiness is more important than money but let's face it we need money to survive if you are unhappy then it wouldn't hurt to look for other employment on your days off you may find something more suitable that will have the same financial rewards or after you see what else is available you may find that things aren't so bad at work afterall Unemployment Social rule Inflation Poker jargon Pitaten Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct 2000 Australian Grand Prix Economics Procrastination 1957 World Series Outsourcing Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Money EastEnders Combat stress reaction Utilitarianism Stoicism Contract Wal-Mart Electronic commerce Divorce Slot machine Labor theory of value National Kidney Foundation Singapore Marilyn Monroe 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Graduate school Capital accumulation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gross domestic product Microeconomics Friends Eric Bischoff Babe Ruth Humphrey Bogart Health insurance Say's law Montreal Screwjob Samuel Goldwyn Capitalism Boston Public Plame affair Extreme Programming Meat Loaf Avenue Q Piccolo Junior Saga James T.
