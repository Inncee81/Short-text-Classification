i need advice from court reporters in southern california i am reallly considering becoming a court reporter i am in the riverside moreno valley area of southern california if you are a court reporter or are in school to become one please help me out with the following do you like what you do enough to recommend it where did you go to school for how long and how much did it cost what can i expect as the pay rate if i become one i work full time now so i would have to do the training on nights or weekends sorry for the long questions but i really would like input from people who actually are court reporters not just the info im finding on websites thanks alot for helping me and i know my grammar was off and so was my punctuation i was typing fast just trying to get a few helpfull answers thanks for the heads up i do realize this is not a job interview if it was i really dont think i would be writing this way i guess there is always someone ready to attack i can't completely answer your questions because i don't live in southern california but i graduated from court reporting school three years ago so i can give you some insight first of all it can be difficult you must practice daily in order to pass your tests the tests are pass or fail and are based on how fast you type once you pass one test you are thrown into another class that is more challenging most reporting schools make you pass q a question and answer jury charge when the attorneys talk to the jury and lit just talking sort of like jury charge some reporting schools make you to go class during the day i had a friend who came from bryan college in ca i'm not exactly sure where it is in ca sorry before she moved to tn she went to school between hours a day monday through friday so if that doesn't work for you you may have to consider an online school try bryancollege edu for tuition questions court reporting is supposed to be a two year program but many students take more than that as far as pay rate it depends on what kind of work you do are you working for a firm doing depos or are you working as an official reporter most court reporters are charged an appearance fee and make money on copies to attorneys some are paid salary but it just depends it's also not a job because you have to factor in the time it takes to edit transcripts almost forgot california has a state certification test that you have to pass before you can work i think they give you a year to pass it but if you don't pass it then you can't work have you been to ncra org's website or looked on yahoo's groups for a court reporter group i am sure you can find more info with the yahoo group don't forget to factor in the cost of a steno machine and laptop and software if you factor all those in that will cost you roughly you don't have to have anything to start school with but the steno machine but you will eventually need the laptop and software okay about me i went to chattanooga state in chattanooga tn it took me two years and a semester but i graduated and do closed captioning work i work at home and i also go to local universities and other events and caption things i started with people in my class and so far about of us have graduated two of us graduated with two years and the rest soon followed the rest of the people either dropped out or are still in school Graduate school Juris Doctor Education in the People's Republic of China Lawyer Education in the United States GED Education in Germany Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Plame affair Student loan 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Attorney at Law Karl Rove SAT Extreme Programming Theory of conduct Education in Romania Software testing Education in Australia Sydney Riot of 1879 Password Driver's license Affirmative action Expert system Law school IBM PC compatible Turing machine Rosa Parks Social rule Friends 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Evan Mecham Education in Portugal Appeal College admissions Insurance Moreno Valley, California Taxation in the United States Timeline of the 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Software engineering SCO-Linux controversies Martial art CPU cache Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Complexity classes P and NP Mutual fund Battery electric vehicle James T.
