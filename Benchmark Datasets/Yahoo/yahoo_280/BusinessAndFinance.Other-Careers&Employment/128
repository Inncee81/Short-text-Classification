is the penn foster career physical therapy aide worth it is it like going to regular school what about handson i was wanting to do this but i don't know if it would be worth it would i be able to get a job anywhere and what about the hands on experience is there anyone out there that know about this schooling and is it worth it please i need advice thanks while i commend physical therapy aides for trying to make the job more professional the fact of the matter is that it is really a job which one can learn on the job the function of aides in most states and settings is so restricted anyway that often their jobs are primarily just to help the pts and ptas under direct instructions and complete clerical tasks such as clean the gym answer phones file etc they rarely have any one to one contact with a patient therefore i feel that this is not a job that requires any formal training or certification i think schools are designing these programs are trying to lure students into thinking that it's an easy way to transition to a pta or pt degree when it really isn't they also greatly inflate the expected income of an aide most students come out of the aide training program finding that there are very few aide jobs and that most pay about and hour i think these trade schools are out just to take your money we have a large facility with four different rehab departments med surg ip rehab op rehab and day rehab and we only employ full time and part time aides when the rest of our staff has reached over in pts ptas ots otas and slps we have one aide who really makes somewhat of a livable salary but he's been doing it for over years the rest of our aides learned everything they need to know with on the job training i would just apply without any formal training and only if you find they specifically are looking for it would i seek a formal educational program or better yet if i was going to invest the time to become an aide months to a year i would just stick it out another year for the pta degree and nearly double your opportunity and salary Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Nurse Paralegal Game programmer Education in Hong Kong Tai Chi Chuan Professor Ambulance Medicine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Student loan Inflation Community college Mach kernel Plame affair Education in Australia Apprenticeship Scientology beliefs and practices Quizbowl Alexander Technique Separation of church and state Psychology Reiki Lawyer Software engineering Education in Germany College GED Education in Japan XML Social rule Unemployment Unemployment benefit Minor league baseball Academia Teacher Columbia University Psychotherapy Economic inequality Education in Romania First aid Baseball Division of labour Education in Malaysia St. John Ambulance National Kidney Foundation Singapore Physician Conscription Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Computer Management information system Juris Doctor Outsourcing Clinical depression Education Poker jargon Stuttering Autism Alternative medicine Social Security (United States) Chinese University of Hong Kong Legal aspects of transsexualism Barrister City and Guilds of London Institute Chiropractic Education reform General practitioner Angioplasty Emergency Medical Services Canadian Senate Charles William Eliot Microeconomics Weight training Air traffic controller Great Teacher Onizuka Education in the Republic of Ireland Anti-intellectualism Taxation in the United States Economy of Africa Paramedic Warren Buffett Massage Boy Scouts of America Tuition Hyperinflation Dentistry University of Pretoria Trade union Teaching English as a Foreign Language
