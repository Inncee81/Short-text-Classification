just finished my interview well i just finished my nd interview at bestbuy with the gm last friday aug and i think it went smoothly he asked me same questions like the st interview and then ask if i want to apply for another position and said he will just call me back but until now they haven't called me back yet what should i do did they hire someone else should i have gotten hire on the spot if i did not get the job will they at least notify me how long do i have to wait if he wants me for the job the thank you letter email is good you may even say that you are the best candidate for the position my son in law did not get a quick response it took them about weeks but i am quite sure there are variances in this from region to region and maybe even store to store they do check references on individuals that they plan on hiring and often background checks this often takes time and they do not offer positions to individuals that have not passed the ok of human resources personnel you may consider asking if you failed to ask in the last interview if they have a tentative date on hiring someone for the position with this information you will know more about when to check back if you have not heard anything i don't quite understand the question he she asked about applying for another position it appears that the other position was not discussed make a strong effort to made sure they understand you want the position in question and that you may be interested in other open positions if you knew the details you have a thin line to move around at this point you need to show the strongest interest over other candidates but not be a nuisance it never hurts to ask if the position has been filled i wish you the best Plame affair The Apprentice 2 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule New York Giants Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina XML G-Man (Half-Life) CPU cache Alan Keyes Jeff Gannon Downing Street memo Expert system Theory of conduct Coming of Age (TNG episode) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Professor Ocean's Twelve Extreme Programming Cindy Sheehan Killian documents Advance fee fraud Karl Rove Internet fraud Keynesian economics Shaggy dog story Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Michael D.
