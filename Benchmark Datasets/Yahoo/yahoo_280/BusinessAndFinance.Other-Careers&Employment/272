need to make a resume does anyone know any good sites to help me out a resume is a concise summary of all the information about us education work experience achievements and other personal details that will interest an employer although our prospective employer will read our cover letter before our resume the letter will just highlight a few of the many facts that we include in a well organized resume anticipate the keywords an employer will attach to the position you seek by keeping a log of words taken from help wanted ads and other sources electronic resume software programs search for job titles departments degrees universities attended companies worked for and the organization you belong to try to use the keywords as often as possible without overburdening your resume with them there is a fairly standard form for detailing information about ourselves and employers expect us to submit it in a recognizable way the following sections discuss the possible content and manner of presentation for our resume heading resumes are usually headed with our name address and telephone number this information may either be centered at the top of the page or placed in the top left hand corner career goal our career goal which follows our personal identification is one entry that every employer is interested in we must be specific as we can listing our immediate goal and not some vague future dream job position being applied for we must specify the position we are applying for examples systems analyst account executive securities analyst etc this position must be related to our career goal education and training this major section should state the most important qualifications we can offer for the job we are applying for if it is work experience that section should come next if it is our educational background that is more important place it first in either case we must tailor our qualifications to fit the job requirements this does not mean however that we are to falsify the information we provide it simply means that we are to pick out those qualifications that have the most direct relationship to the job for which we are applying for example suppose we are applying for the position of market researcher the person who reads our resume will not be interested in finding out that we had taken courses in baking orchid raising or canteen operation they will not also be interested in learning that we have worked as a teller in a bank but this person will be interested in reading about our experience in research or if our educational background is in mathematics statistics etc and if we had taken a speed reading course the most common way to describe our education is to list any university college or vocational school we have attended with the dates of attendance and any diplomas or certificates we have obtained we always place our most recent educational experience at the top of the list and work back from there if we want to stress our education we may want to include our major field of study and the names of significant courses which we have completed we may also want to list any honors or awards we have received a prospective employer is looking for evidence of leadership potential social poise and interest in a broad enough range of activities to make us an interesting person therefore we could list our extra curricular activities in which we had taken part and list down the positions we held in campus or school organizations work experience there are two acceptable ways of presenting our work background the most common is to list our jobs in chronological order with the present or the most recent one heading the list with such an arrangement the prospective employer can readily detect our progress or promotions if we use this format we should show the following a position held b name and location of company c date the position was held d achievement in the position e reason for leaving in addition we can strengthen our presentation by including the following a duties emphasize responsibilities b name of immediate superior if the person is still there and might be a good reference c job title e g systems analyst field sales manager etc if on the other hand our experience is scattered or we have done a lot of volunteer activities or if our employment history is spotty a functional resume can turn unrelated activities into a coherent business background when we use this format our experience is listed under descriptive categories in this way a wide variety of activities paid or volunteer interspersed with inactive periods can be presented to our advantage personal details personal data include gender age date and place of birth race religion optional marital status including number of children health height weight interests and hobbies references applicants for a job are usually requested to give the names of at least three persons who can be asked or called to speak about us the most appropriate persons include present or former employers teachers and other professionals also acceptable is a character reference whose name or occupation is respected if we include references in our resume we must give each individual's name title organization if any address and telephone number if we choose to provide the prospective employer with references at the time of the interview we make the following notation on our resume references will be supplied upon request in either case we must ask permission from the person before including his her name as reference the completed resume finally our completed resume must be concise well organized and easy to read the length should be one page or two pages at most after all we are summarizing our most important qualifications for a particular job not telling the story of our life appearance too is a very important factor to the over all presentation of our resume we must be careful not to overcrowd or spread out the information on a page we should also have our resume carefully typed or printed single space on x good quality white bond paper one which is handwritten or full of poorly made corrections will probably not be read at all honesty is a very important factor in a resume phony degrees or schools will be discovered we should not also exaggerate our accomplishments our resume should show progress advancement and ambition a good resume must get us at least an interview for an in depth study on resume writing and to give you an idea how it looks please go to these links and type in the search words how to write
