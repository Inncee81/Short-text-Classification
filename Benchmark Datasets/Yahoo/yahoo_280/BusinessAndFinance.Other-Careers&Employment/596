should i contact interviewer again he's not answering e mail about scheduled meeting i went to an a job interview for a job and the man insinuated that i pretty much had the job since i have some recommendations from other people who work there his managers he didn't make an offer though he said we should meet with his boss to increase the chances of a higher salary for me than we he had budgeted during the next week i contacted him two times via e mail he answered after the second e mail apologized for not answering earlier he told me to tell him which day of this week worked for me to meet with his boss i answered but he has not replied it's almost the end of the week should i contact him via phone to increase chances of meeting tomorrow or should i just wait it out i don't want to look desperate i'm not but also don't want to show lack of initiative thats kind of a rough call see for him taking over weeks with little communication is unprofessional if he is interested in bringing you on with his company on the other hand interviewing can be a lengthy process if there are internal canidates to go through if you have an insde edge with managers as you stated he may want to make sure he has appeased all interested parties before hiring you thats just a cya move when i interview canidates for any position i can appriciate a call back to check up but more than that takes up my time and comes across as desperate i would wait try to get some feedback from those you know in the company then call next week dont email and ask when does it look good in his bosses schedule to see you so that you can be prepared as much as possible for the interview tell him you are excited about the opportunity to work with their company and want to put your best foot forward and you would like as much notice as he can possibly give regardless you have the info to make the best choice go with your judgement off of how the interviews went and the interviewers personality if you dont think he'll be annoyed call him Social rule The Apprentice 2 Advance fee fraud Killian documents Poker jargon Domain Name System Plame affair The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story Kasparov versus The World Babe Ruth Knots Landing Volleyball Microeconomics George Costanza Corporate governance Escape from New York Surveillance Milton H.
