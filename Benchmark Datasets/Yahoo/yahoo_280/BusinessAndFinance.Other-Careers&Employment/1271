what skills do you need to work in a print shop i am in graphic design and looking for part time work around my neighborhood there is a print shope nearby that i would love to work for but i really am not sure what the job would entail anyone know i need as much detail as possible in your answers since you mentioned graphic design i'm guessing that you would be interested in a prepress aka typesetting position with the print shop modern typesetting primarily uses computers either pc or mac and in ways resembles other design disciplines graphic web the tools of the trade are often quark and adobe products what tends to be very different about prepress work is the limited use of your artistic creativity there definitely will be a few jobs that you get to design and create for clients but the vast majority of work coming into a shop has already been laid out by the client it arrives on a disk and your job is to setup the pagination for the particular press it is slated to run on will it run up up up what size paper coated or uncoated color is another issue that falls on a prepress tech unlike computers which use rgb printing uses cmyk colors must be separated especially for use on offset presses from there you print the file to a piece of film using a special printer which is passed along to someone called a stripper the stripper uses the film to make plates out of your separate sheets of film cyan magenta yellow black in some shops they have direct to plate printing eliminating the film stripping stage most jobs run one or two color one or two plates usually setup for individual pantone colors or four color four plates there are plenty of variations you can start getting very involved with multi color presses that can run or more different colors these usually end up running process cmyk colors a series of pantone colors and a protective coating therefore you should expect working in prepress to be a challenging position however you will be required to use your noggin for problem solving more often than design hope that helps CMYK color model Color printing Color space Adobe Photoshop Gamut Graphic design Color Apple Macintosh Computer PostScript RGB color model Publishing Printing press Color theory Common Unix Printing System Ebook Markup language Adobe Systems Newspaper Traditional animation Mac OS X Digital photography 2D computer graphics Typesetting GIMP Photography Windows Vista Adobe Acrobat Pantone Atari 8-bit family Mach kernel Printed circuit board Apple typography Typewriter TeX Software engineering Linux PNG Computer virus Desktop publishing Stereoscopy Kernel (computer science) CPU cache System/36 Pixel System/34 AmigaOS Agfa-Gevaert Subtractive color Password Photographic film Compiler optimization Welding Computer printer Industrial engineering Screenshot Novell NetWare Dot matrix printer Technology Web design Primary color Casting Windows Server 2003 Stage lighting Printmaking Atari ST BASIC programming language Server Grid computing Konica Minolta Compact disc Trademark Mail art CPU design NeXT Yearbook Hard disk Enterprise content management Academic publishing ZX Spectrum Offset printing Enlarger Xerox Copyright Inheritance (computer science) Color management Commodore 64 Game programmer
