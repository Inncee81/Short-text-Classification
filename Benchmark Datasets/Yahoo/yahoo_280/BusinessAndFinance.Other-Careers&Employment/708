should i be a psychologist or a game designer ok so im between those two ive asked friends and family about it and as predicted friends said game designer and family said psychologist i like grame design because of the variety of jobs out there and because of my vast imagination and drawing abilities but i also like psichology because im a very good listener and i find the human mind interesting but heres the thing i like psichology but i dont like reading and i like game design but i hate math so yeah let me hear out your opinions well whichever career you choose you will have to force yourself to like those things that you don't like because they are part of the job your family may be right looking at both careers on the long term it would seem that psychology is it for you how sure are you that game design will still be around years from now entertainment preferences change overnight you can always design games as a sort of hobby peace and blessings Theory of conduct W.I.T.C.H.
