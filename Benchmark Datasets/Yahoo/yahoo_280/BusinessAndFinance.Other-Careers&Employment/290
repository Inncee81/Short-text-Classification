what is the best way to resign from a job i have worked the same dead end job for years after and a half years without a pay raise they finally gave me a cent raise a month ago which imo was a slap in the face after years of service and many broken promises and excuses i felt like they never really treated me that well even though we got along ok on a personal level i have already enroled in college and am going back to school in a few weeks i am really nervous about how to resign as i can see an altercation with the owner who is a bit of a hot head i want to quit the right way but i feel like i owe them nothing more than the bare minimum what is an acceptable way to put in my two weeks without starting a fight has anyone used a letter of resignation if so how do you deliver it in a way that is professional even the most difficult job situation should be left graciously and courteously this is not the time to tell your boss what you really think of him or to offend your ex co workers by assigning blame even weak bridges should not be burned a formal brief resignation letter should be given to your current boss do not discuss any negative reasons for your leaving simply say that the new offer provides you with new challenges and opportunities your letter and discussion should be positive in all respects tip if you are leaving in good terms take the time to continue your contacts with your former co workers and superiors they might be useful networking contacts for you in future job searches peace and blessings Unemployment Economic inequality Cyprus dispute EastEnders Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Dog training Plame affair Education in the People's Republic of China Wal-Mart Alex Ferguson Procrastination Ocean's Twelve Social rule FairTax Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Bah__'__ divisions John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Newcastle United F.C.
