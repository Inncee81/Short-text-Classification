i was laid off my employer is trying to back out of paying my accrued vacation time my separation agreement states that the company will pay you all accrued but unused vacation time earned by you through the separation date the employer is stating that because i was laid off weeks before i could use my vacation that they will not pay the accrued time also they say that this sep agreement is different from the company policy agreement and that they must use the company policy agreement please advise thanks yippeee i kept fighting it did some research thanks to you guys i am getting weeks severance and vacation days cheers sounds like you have a case against them they're wrong in that policy trumps a legal separation agreement i hope the separation agreement is in writing and is signed by someone in authority if there's substantial money involved i'd recommend contacting the labor department of the state in which you reside for assistance George W.
