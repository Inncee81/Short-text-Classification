why would they want to get rid of me job related question this is a mini continuation of a previous job related question at the end of this week i saw my schedule go from to under next week i spoke to someone at work and they said in a round about way that if we are not constantly after customers greeting them at the door and following up if they need help and this is not done we will not receive the many hours we want and deserve this individual did not say these things in exact terms but i can still infer the point they were trying to get across my problem is that i have been a great employee always coming to work on time when schedules have changed or hours have been altered i have never made a peep about it is what this person doing legal and also how can this idividual being a brand new employee be able to do this even though they are one of our upper managment people in our shop i think they just wants to get rid of me just because they do not like me for no reason i can think of as a side note i have stayed there in order to make some money while i am sending out resumes in an area more toward my preferred field i think what bothers me about this is new managment just waltzes in and wants to change everything that associates are used to i realize the biggest concern is making the company money but why vilify the associates that are willing to go above and beyond and never complain it is also frustrating that they tells me i know you have a very flexible schedule and are willing to work anytime i felt like saying to person listen you stupid idiotic but i have too many manners for that please do not take any of it seriously not only it is just a work place where people are not friends but also think about what you're doing doesn't sound like your end goal job if you know what i mean becasue you sound like a smart man bottom line find a better job or stay where you are just don't take all the stupid politics personally look what you're wasting your precious time on just read what you wrote from above as an outsider you're dealing with bullshit i'm just trying to tell you who cares what they think about you when the kind of work you're doing is open the door and greet in other words it's almost like if they don't want you they're doing you a favor you know what i mean good luck my friend Shit Poker jargon Expert system Phaedo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Apprentice 2 Friends Dilbert Legacy of Kain Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Scientology beliefs and practices Video game developer ITV Transsexuality Sin City Shaggy dog story Jumpstart 3rd Grade Rent (musical) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Garfield Philosophy of language Unemployment Education in the People's Republic of China Transactional analysis English grammar Gender-neutral language Sydney Riot of 1879 Euphemism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sabbath Customs and etiquette of Japan Singlish Evan Mecham Freeters Surveillance Blonde on Blonde Avenue Q Economic inequality Extreme Programming Timpani Lie Humphrey Bogart The Critic The Price Is Right Health insurance Newcastle United F.C.
