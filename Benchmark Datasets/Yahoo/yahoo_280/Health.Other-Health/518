lower calf leg pain i have been having lower leg pain since february at first it felt like it was going all around my cald muscle and then down the front bone of my leg at the time i had only been taking birth control for a month and the doctor had an doppler ultrasound performed on my leg to rule out a blood clot and it came back as negative plus i've had multiple doctors feel my leg since then and each has assured me repeatly there is no blood clot then i want to a new doctor who had an mri run to make sure the muscle was not torn and it just strained since i was still getting pain i had an emg done to make sure it wasn't my nerves and it was clear so i am at a complete loss i am still having a dull pain in my leg muscle today it felt like it was running down the front of my shin and coming out my arch i am not taking birth control i am a non smoker the area is not bruised swollen hot or red i am about and weigh i gained pounds this year due panic attacks without knowing further details about the characteristics of your pain what activities cause it relieve it etc one still has to consider if this pain may eminate from the spine even if the emg was negative and even if you have no back pain another consideration is your knee or stress fracture which is hard to detect on x ray and may require a bone scan sometimes you need to look at the surrounding joints to find the source of pain have you been to physical therapy they may have the ability to spend more time evaluating it than a physician to give you better ideas about the problem Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Weight training Equine conformation Traumatic brain injury Professional wrestling holds Paget's disease of bone Carpal tunnel syndrome Cancer Muscle Stroke Multiple sclerosis Urinary incontinence Hip fracture Stomach cancer Childbirth Syringomyelia Obstetrics Stress fracture Chiropractic Aortic dissection Fecal incontinence Post Polio syndrome Osteoarthritis Myocardial infarction Bruise Puberty Anterior cruciate ligament Breech birth Tocopherol Duchenne muscular dystrophy Deep vein thrombosis Scapula Folic acid Group A streptococcal infection Cardiac stress test Breast cancer Cephalic disorder Pain Orthopedic surgery Endometriosis Mandible Iliotibial band syndrome Osteoporosis Humerus Tyrannosaurus rex Atherosclerosis Professional wrestling throws Medicine Osteopathy Clinical depression Swimming Pulmonary embolism Anxiety Asthma Psoriasis Alexander Technique Prolactinoma Epidural Cocaine Magnetic resonance imaging First aid Cirrhosis Diabetic neuropathy Penis Leukemia Massage Elephant Fascial compartment Coeliac disease Myasthenia gravis Temporal bone Appendicitis Menstrual cup Sleep apnea Tobacco smoking Tendon Gout Balance disorder Computed tomography Hal Trosky Aikido Colorectal cancer Shin splints Anatomical terms of location Turner syndrome Stuttering Local anesthesia
