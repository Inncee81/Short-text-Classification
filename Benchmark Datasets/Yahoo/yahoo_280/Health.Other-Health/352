how do you get rid of a cold sore in less then to hours i got a cold sore yesterday on my lip and i need to get rid of it in about to hours because i have to do something really important and i cant have that sore on my mouth i dont know if it is possible but can you please tell me how to get rid of it or at least how to make it better thank you hi melissa unfortunately you can't heal a cold sore in that short of time once the area has swollen up the damage is done under the skin even before the sore opens up the herpes virus during the replication process destroys millions of cells that need to be replaced i have seen one web site that claims healing in hours that is pure hype don't believe it as it is not physical possible tell you what before the sore actually opens up try applying ice or some cold object this will greatly reduce the damage and help discourage the herpes virus from replicating kind of like that cold shower effect once the sore opens up ice will actually slow the healing cold drives blood away and blood is the basis for healing any wound the more blood to the wound the quicker the healing applied heat would increase blood flow but also swelling keep the sore clean and keep killing virus with hydrogen peroxide on a tissue or cotton ball now once you have sanitized the wound use the gel from a live aloe vera plant and no matter what anyone tells you bottled aloe vera does not work the same good luck melissa denny bodoh Herpes simplex virus Mouth ulcer Aloe Body piercing Virus Sterilization (microbiology) Common cold Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wound healing phases Carbon dioxide Stomach cancer Healing Computer virus Chronic fatigue syndrome Disinfection Ebola Psoriasis Cancer Silver Radiation therapy Gout Herpesviridae Massage Myocardial infarction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Wound Hydrogen peroxide Immune system Hydrochloric acid HIV Explosive material Scar Energy development Prostate cancer Senescence Weight training Water Ulcer Bodybuilding Water (molecule) Sewage treatment Decompression sickness Items in the Metroid series Breastfeeding Antiviral drug Skin Tattoo Poliomyelitis Cirrhosis Fusion power Severe weather terminology (United States) Herpes zoster Naruto jutsu Inflammation Cell (biology) Mosquito Pneumonia Chemotherapy Mesothelioma Wind power Blood Leukemia Ultraviolet Antiretroviral drug Corrosion Stirling engine Group A streptococcal infection Tuberculosis Renewable energy Penis Swimming Antiseptic Urinary incontinence Vitamin C Hip fracture Sacrifice (computer game) Natural disaster Hay fever Smallpox Computer Pharyngitis Duesberg hypothesis Influenza Multiple sclerosis Tribulation Drowning Snake Second Battle of the Atlantic Hyperthermia
