still possibly need gallbladder out a couple weeks ago i had a gallbladder attack horrible pain for almost days ultrasound showed my gallbladder wall was thickened but no gallstones last friday i had a hida scan done and it was normal while i have not been in nearly as much pain as i was those couple days i still have been having mild pains mainly below my ribs in middle and right side right upper back and middle of back plus i seem to always be nautious and get dizzy spells is it possible that my g b is still inflamed and the hida scan didnt see that does the hida scan even detect that or does it just show the function of your g b if hida scan came out normal is it still possible my gallbladder may need to come out tia for any help lisa frequent trips to the doctor with the same complaints has the potential to get you into a surgeon for an exploratory laparoscopy and when that happens they can take your gb out then if it looks inflamed or irritated or anything like that no stitches you go home the same day mine was adhered to my rib cage so while the us was normal i had two hida scans and one was abnormal and one was normal so they went in to investigate and that's what they found good luck to you also for temporary relief try no fatty foods no fried foods no heavy proteins red meat steak no spicy foods or heavy cream based sauces and very limited dairy products eat very slowly give your saliva time to do some of the work of breaking down the food so that your stomach and gb don't have so much work to do and enjoy simple basic foods that are easier to digest so your gb doesnt have to work that hard to help digest your food the gb only serves to store bile and release it upon food entering the stomach your liver takes over that function when you have your gb removed Stomach cancer Cholecystitis Cirrhosis Gallstone Liver Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gallbladder Gastroparesis Barbecue Cuisine of Denmark Fecal incontinence Gastrointestinal tract Atherosclerosis Hypoglycemia Cholesterol Prostate cancer Cholecystectomy Stroke Chicken Insulin Cheese Fancy rat Psoriasis Tofu Crohn's disease Diarrhea Irritable bowel syndrome Colorectal cancer Obstetrics Abdomen Japanese cuisine Dairy Soul food Acne Gastroesophageal reflux disease Equine conformation Vomiting Guinea pig Heartburn Esophageal cancer Obesity Cancer Hot dog Fugu Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Omega-3 fatty acid Chronic fatigue syndrome Adjustable gastric band Dieting Cuisine of the Philippines Mesothelioma Hamster Acupuncture Appendicitis Radiation therapy Nutrition German cuisine Stuttering Digestion Hepatitis Terran (StarCraft) Breastfeeding Stomach Tooth Cat Peruvian cuisine Glycogen storage disease type I Cocaine Mattress Milk Pancreas Korean cuisine Fish and chips Domestic rabbit French cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States Traumatic brain injury Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Food Fasting McDonald's Hamburger Kashrut Paracetamol Cuisine of Malaysia Chili con carne Aspartame Vitamin C Nutmeg Chiropractic Gout Cajun cuisine Spider
