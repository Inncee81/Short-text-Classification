how do we die in our sleep what occurs i live in la i know of one case which was a colleague from work she went home normally one day from her job and never came back to work the next day this was very unlike her and people with whom she worked knew that she lived all alone so they were worried that something may have happened she had no health problem or illness that anyone was aware of but they just thought it was strange that she did not come to work so after calling the house number multiple times this was before everybody had cells her boss and another coworker who was a good friend decided to drive to her house and see if something was wrong when they arrived they tried knocking on the door and so forth but no answer they walked around her house and into the yard but were afraid to try to break into the house they were able to peek in a window and get a partial view of something that gave them a clue that she was there it may have been her purse or something like that i cannot remember but they decidedd to call the police and when the officers responded they went into the home together and found her dead she had died the night before not just right then they were shocked of course as she was not that old and had no health problems or anything she was still dressed from the day before and had laid down on her bed and never got up it turned out that she had had a heart attack while alone and probably just thought she wasn't feeling very well and laid down she had not cooked anything or done anything in her house everything looked neat and tidy like she had just straightened up Shaggy dog story Social rule EastEnders Paul Is Dead Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) The Star Wars Holiday Special Episodes of Lost (Season 2) The Shining (film) Breath of Fire III Charles Peace Piccolo Junior Saga The Subtle Knife Grandview, U.S.A.
