still growing taller and i'm almost hey guys i just have a quick question to propose to you guys i was a late bloomer and had my growth spurt when i was in th grade and grew from to in years at i was maybe only grew inch for whole years around my th birthdy i started getting the same growth pains i had when i was younger and it's been almost a full year of that and i'm just under ft now but i still feel as if i'm getting taller of course i love this however i'm wondering if i'm having any serious health implications the taller the better for me but i am starting to get worried it may be a pituitary gland problem perhaps because my parents were done growing early and i started again after years of almost no growth i'm also getting some acne which i had none of during my initial growth spurt from do you think i should go to a doctors and be concerned about this did any of you guys suddenly grow when you were i didn't not have this problem sadly yet i hope i can help the acne is not directly associated with your growth acne is a sign of excess of androgens and growth in your age is due to estrogens it can be that your pituitary gland is coming to life but it doesn't look uncanny to me since the rise is not specific to one hormone according to growth statistics it's not unusual for a person to continue growing in his early s the most important thing is not to rely entirely on answers given to you here by people who have never seen you or known you go to the endocrinologist in order get the best answer Puberty Growth hormone treatment Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gigantism Human height Delayed puberty Prostate cancer Testosterone Growth hormone Sexual differentiation Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Prolactinoma Acne Androgen Growth hormone deficiency Polycystic ovary syndrome Menstrual cycle Cancer Transsexuality Anabolic steroid Adrenarche Human penis size Hypopituitarism Endocrine system Hypoglycemia Turner syndrome Virilization Amenorrhoea Acromegaly Baldness Cushing's syndrome Sexual dysfunction Brain tumor Breastfeeding Ovulation Hyperprolactinaemia Scar Intersexuality Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Autism Transactional analysis Luteinizing hormone Follicle-stimulating hormone Pediatric endocrinology Child sexuality DDT Hey Arnold!
