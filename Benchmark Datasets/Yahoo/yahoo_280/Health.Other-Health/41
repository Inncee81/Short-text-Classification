anyone have cures for chronic adult bed wetting i have been wetting the bed every night for my whole life only twice in my years has it stopped when i first left home and when i was pregnant with my rd bub both times i stopped for nearly a year my mother took me to every dr in sydney for an answer and we never got one jeez she used to get cranky too ive used the alarm system it just makes me dream of trains i've had my liquid intake cut nothing helps i have a wonderful partner who lets me pee on him every night sweet sweet man but you know years is enough my brother used to tell me when i was younger that i'd be on my honeymoon and roll over to my husband and say honey would you put my nappy on and it turns out he was practically right i hate it every morning i feel like such a dirty bitch it really affects your self esteem any ideas anyone i'd really appreciate your help thanks heaps one thing to look at is if it happens always at a certain time i only suggest this because it happens predictably for me so i know that its going to happen usually in the first hours of sleep and rarely after that point lets say it always happened close to morning you could wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom might not be that simple but it is worth a try in my case my kidneys don't slow down until well after i fall asleep and i sleep very deeply during that period of time so it always happens during that period after that almost never any problems the trains thing is funny i never had any success with alarms either there are some decent adult diapers but you have to take a big mental step to use them that was a big step for me in my mind because of the self esteem factor the good side is zero cleanup see another doctor too depending on how long it has been you may find that there is something that helps now that wasn't available before last check out how many threads there are just on yahoo answers about this very subject there are tons a few already have been asked today not an unommon problem but one a lot of people don't talk about Urinary incontinence Social rule Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Knots Landing Grandview, U.S.A.
