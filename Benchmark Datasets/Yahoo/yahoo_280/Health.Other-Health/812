panic attacks i have a huge problem with panic attacks i have about one to three per day even though there's nothing wrong when they happen it's not at a specific time i'm usually not upset or discouraged or anything my questions are is there a way to prevent panic attacks i'm sixteen years old and i've had panic attacks in school before how do i stop that because school hasn't started and i don't want panic attacks this year i can't get meds because my parents would probably make fun of me if they knew i was having panic attacks i don't go to a therapist or anything so if anyone tries to mention it that is out of the question when they do happen i try to control my breathing immediately and i put my head down to calm down and ignore everybody around me in school is there anything else to do that could work better please help me i've had problems with panic anxiety for almost years now great outline of your problem i'm a physician and i started having panic attacks a few years ago so i have an interest here let me first say that the fact that you are aware that you have them and know what they are is a huge huge step for you you won't appreciate this though because you likely only know one person who has them you my experience with people with panic has shown me that those who know what they have and recognize it will do better i'll try to answer your questions prevention avoid caffeine all caffeine til you settle down for a few months get plenty of sleep do some introspective work many people with panic have a post traumatic disorder did you ever have an experience where you felt you were going to die unfortunately for women many times this is a rape i believe that gaining insight into this is important and helps but maybe you didn't have a trigger talking openly about your panic helps as well this is a catharsis look word up if you don't know it tell your friends talk with others you will be surprised how many people have an issue laugh about it your freakin out over nothing it can be funny when your not having one if you think your parents will laugh at you they may as it is something others don't understand and is a normal response don't you think real crazy people act funny you should still let them know see catharsis above deep and slow breaths will help you when you are having an event laying down in a nice quiet environment helps but you can't do that at school let your school nurse know there are drugs but your better off lickin this yourself if you can i can not stress enough about the catharsis and at this is more embarrasing for you im sure the introspection is important too if you think you are more of a post traumatic then you need to talk about that event as well the non physical world stress feelings emotions fears definitly manifest themselves in the physical format diarrhea nausea heart racing short of breath lump in throat back pains headache chest pains flushing its an amazing process but will scare the you know what out of you when it hits btw most people seem to have a course of about years from what ive seen with a gradual improvement tho you may never completely get rid of them talk Anxiety Traumatic incident reduction Traumatic brain injury Post-traumatic stress disorder Migraine Multiple sclerosis Theory of conduct Urinary incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome God Emperor of Dune Breastfeeding Autism Stroke Meditation Hypoglycemia Asthma Human sexual behavior Milton H.
