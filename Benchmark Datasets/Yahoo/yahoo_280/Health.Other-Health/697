very bad back pain hello my husband has been living with severe backpain for over a year now and is in need of help with remedies or something weve had an mri and they said it looked like minor arthritis and a small ammount of deteriorating disks he is currently on darvocet and it isnt really cutting it here is what the doctors have tried gabopentin doesnt touch the pain at all or help in any way vicodin doesnt work for him tens unit barely works doesnt take pain away relafen doesnt work for him lidocain patches doesnt work for him phentynol patches makes him sick when he goes in any heat or sun ice he doesnt like it what can we do i know there has to be alot of people going through this that may be able to help chiropractor hasnt helped pain management hasnt helped he says physical therapy wont work and i dont know what to do i know you said that you have tried an chiropractor but perhaps you should try another i occasionally have lots of back pain and i find that going to a chiropractor who is also a kinestiologist works great a kinestiologist also focuses on the muscles and how they are working rather than just checking to see if your bones are aligned properly with my experience i was having back problems because of my muscles werent working properly so my back was always overcompensating for them thus resulting in pain in a few weeks i was able to get those muscles working again and i've been better ever since if you havent tried it its worth a shot the worst that can happen is that it doesnt work for you Chiropractic Osteoarthritis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Carpal tunnel syndrome Prostate cancer Osteopathy Chronic fatigue syndrome Psoriasis Equine conformation Back pain Rheumatoid arthritis Traditional Chinese medicine Multiple sclerosis Massage Weight training Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Atomic Kitten Myocardial infarction Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Urinary incontinence Fecal incontinence Bruise Paget's disease of bone Milton H.
