am i failure if i go back on anti anxiety meds i gave up anxiety meds months ago clonopin and xanax and i am so proud of myself for giving them up but lately i've been having health problems and it's causing me a lot of anxiety and stress and i feel like i need them again just to function i feel like i would be letting myself and others down if i went back on them medication is not the same as substance abuse smoking etc it is a genuine means of dealing with physical or mental problems if you get bronchitis multiple times you wouldn't consider yourself a failure for needing multiple rounds of anti biotics right it is a fact that anxiety and stress lead to health problems of their own and if they are getting to the point where you can't function anymore than it's definitely time to consider meds you aren't letting yourself down you're taking care of yourself you know you better than anyone else Urinary incontinence Tobacco smoking Alcoholism Panic attack Medicine Drug addiction Transsexuality Drug abuse Pneumonia Post-traumatic stress disorder Traumatic brain injury Hypoglycemia Bipolar disorder Borderline personality disorder Anorexia nervosa Hypertension Abortion Diabetes mellitus Migraine Psychiatry Alprazolam Psychotherapy Charles Darwin's illness Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Unemployment Substance abuse Meditation Psychoanalysis Multiple chemical sensitivity Procrastination Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Cancer Fathers' rights Stuttering DSM-IV Codes Diazepam Bronchitis Stroke Eating disorder Prayer Divorce Stress (medicine) Adult attention-deficit disorder Arguments for and against drug prohibition Child abuse Controlled Substances Act Hypnosis Narcissism Psoriasis Reparative therapy Sexual dysfunction Scientology beliefs and practices Schizophrenia Mental illness Infantilism Obsessive-compulsive disorder Asthma Caffeine Breastfeeding Refugee Endocrinology Baldness Health issues and the effects of cannabis Cannabis (drug) Postpartum depression Addiction Dog Convention on Psychotropic Substances Medical cannabis Mental retardation Dissociative identity disorder Theory of conduct Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Coeliac disease Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Alzheimer's disease Obesity Traumatic incident reduction Insomnia Philosophy of mind Tai Chi Chuan Methamphetamine General anxiety disorder Torture Folic acid Combat stress reaction Chemical imbalance theory Acute respiratory distress syndrome Hikikomori Dualism (philosophy of mind) Benzodiazepine Alternative medicine Social rule Autism Animal testing Chlorpromazine
