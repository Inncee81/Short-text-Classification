i have a drink problem usually i don't drink months then i drink like a pig for a week i'm alcoholic sounds more like you are a binge drinker which in some cases can be more dangerous i say this because if you drank every day you would build up an immunity to the effects until you needed a certain amount just to function normally but a gap of months breaks down any such ability to become tolerant to the effects thus making your one week a big drunken bash if you are really concerned about these issue you might check with some local groups that provide alcohol counseling for dui recipients in your area often they will allow you to sit in on a session free of charge providing it is not court ordered but i can tell you from experience a dui will cost you a bundle night in jail fine st offense dollar license renewals for the classes that you have to take before you can get your license back and all of this is dependent on the state you live in and the circumstances you could end up in prison on the first offense if you kill someone i m not preaching at you just saying if you have to drink make sure you are at home good luck to you Alcoholism Alcoholics Anonymous Driving under the influence Binge drinking Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Oasis (band) Hypoglycemia Probation officer Temperance movement Mothers Against Drunk Driving Alcoholic beverage Appeal Arguments for and against drug prohibition Scientology beliefs and practices Intellectual property Member of the European Parliament Divorce Prohibition Objective-C Brian Jones (musician) TLC Magistrate Microeconomics Saturday Night Live Public transport Education in the United States Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Linux Michael Garibaldi Windows XP Breastfeeding Federal Communications Commission Drinking culture Bank Pretty Good Privacy Drug test Web crawler Trademark Administrative law of the United States Public domain Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Bing Crosby Alcohol 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Drug addiction Legal research Stuttering Breaker Morant Taxation in the United States Baseball Rosa Parks Diablo II: Lord of Destruction American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Jury trial Murder Final Fantasy magic Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Sin City Lawyer President (game) Darryl Strawberry A.
