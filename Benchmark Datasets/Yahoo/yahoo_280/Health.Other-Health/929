how can quite smoking i hate it i hate the smell taste i have tried everything it seems but i just can't do it why first off congratulations for wanting to quit smoking as far as answering there are a lot of ways the best ways are slowly lowering your dose takes a long time sometimes or going cold turkey which is faster but harder either way the last thing is making the decision to quit so you'll eventually have to deal with the withdrawal for the most part when you deal with withdrawal you'll just have to tough it out but there are some things that can help cleanse out the toxins and may help to minimize some of the effects of withdrawal drinking water will help to detox and taking some supplements that work as cleansers may help as well specifically apple cider vinegar green tea decaffeinated chlorophyll fantastic cleanser and even good amounts of fiber and water helps some people although it's not very comfortable for the lower level of detoxification you get all that being said it's likely that the symptoms should stop relatively shortly after your last cigarette it's never as long as it feels like it is your neurotransmitters don't take too terribly long to scream for something they are addicted to after you stop another important thing to note is that no matter how bad it gets taking more of the drug and yes nicotine is a drug will only make the withdrawal last longer and will be harder on you in the long run good luck and congrats again Addiction Withdrawal Tobacco smoking Cannabis (drug) Caffeine Cocaine Alzheimer's disease Nicotine Drug addiction Vitamin C Buprenorphine Coffee Bong Prostate cancer Tea Vinegar Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Opioid Antidepressant Alcoholism Dietary fiber Illegal drug trade Tobacco Cider Fluoxetine Drug abuse Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Clinical depression Anorexia nervosa Social rule Bupropion Bipolar disorder Action potential Mattress Obsessive-compulsive disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paroxetine Cigar Diazepam Traumatic incident reduction Alcoholic beverage Spice Girls Shit Stomach cancer Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Cigarette Narcotic Babe Ruth Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Chronic fatigue syndrome Foodborne illness Microeconomics Theory of conduct Hypoglycemia Health issues and the effects of cannabis Psychosis Borderline personality disorder Anxiety Sin City Snus Atherosclerosis Drug test Fitz Hugh Ludlow Cuisine of Denmark Sauna Kurt Cobain Non-medical use of dextromethorphan The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy LSD Japanese tea ceremony Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Word of Wisdom 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tocopherol W.
