cut on back of foot so i was wearing new shoes the other day and it cut the lower back of my ankle from walking in them since they aren't worn in yet well anyways there's like a penny size amount of skin missing and it hurts even when the bandaid is pressed against it it also feels weird when i walk on that foot it's not really a hurting feeling but more like a sore feeling i only got the cut on friday afternoon i washed it and have a bandaid on it but i'm still worried about it it doesn't seem to be feeling better but it feels worse instead what's going on if there is skin missing it means raw nerves are exposed it's gonna hurt like a for quite a while no particular word there just a strain of foul language haha if it feels weird while walking your shoe may have nicked into your achilles tendon in the back of your foot all in all don't wear those shoes anymore if you're that worried about it i would reccomend seeing a doctor if it's bad enough it might need a couple quick stitches or special ointment to help it heal good luck Equine conformation High-heeled shoe Shaggy dog story Fecal incontinence Shoe Massage Achilles' tendon "Weird Al" Yankovic Professional wrestling holds Cliff Richard Diving Social rule Psoriasis 1957 World Series Avenue Q The Death Gate Cycle Skin Treehouse of Horror XV Horseshoe Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pointe shoes Eczema Ulcer Clothing Carpal tunnel syndrome Teen Girl Squad Midnight Run Black Urinary incontinence Tendon Babe Ruth AFI 100 Years series Clown Love and Theft True Crime: Streets of LA Kurt Angle The Electric Company Magical thinking Blood on the Tracks Hiking Wound Samuel Goldwyn Soleus muscle Dr. Martens Volleyball Doom enemies Kodocha Bondage (BDSM) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dualism (philosophy of mind) Stone Cold Steve Austin Spidey Super Stories Repetitive strain injury Goaltender Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sydney Riot of 1879 The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie RuneScape quests Theory of conduct Kilt Pain Yoko Ono Weight training Upholstery The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Stomach cancer The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Mattress Sock Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Piccolo Junior Saga Customs and etiquette of Japan Russian joke Kender Tattoo The Book of Five Rings Foot The Star Wars Holiday Special Radiation therapy Freddy Fender Characters of Naruto Aerial (dance move) Rod Stewart Singlish Milton H.
