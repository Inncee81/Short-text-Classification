why are people so addicted tickling for starters i would like to say that hotfries and giggledude both gave excellent answers there are a number of reasons that people become addicted to tickling the first thing i like to distinguish between is whether the tickling is consensual or non consensual if it is non consensual generally the tickler likes to tickle others or one victim because it is a form of a power trip and he she enjoys having the power to make the other person people laugh without being able to stop it sometime the tickler is just addicted to the laugher in my book non consensual tickling is of the time blatantly disrespectful to the ticklee in a few cases the ticklee does enjoy non consensual tickling but the vast majority of the time the tickler can cause emotional harm to the tickler if they tickle too much or too long many children especially girls were tickle tortured too much as children and they are unable to enjoy the wonderful benefits of consensual tickling now with consensual tickling the tickler and the ticklee usually trust and respect each other and want to keep the tickling fun for both parties for the tickler he she can feel pleasure from making the tickle laugh because they know that the ticklee is enjoying it too the ticklee can still have a feeling of power the tickler cannot stop them from tickling where ever they want to when ever they want to any way that they want to with their fingers or with toys while still respecting the limits concerns desires feelings and boundaries of their tickle partner for the ticklee and frequently the tickler they benefit in a few ways first when you laugh at a joke a comedy movie or even a playful tickling attack or encounter the laughter causes your brain to flood your body with endorphins endorphins reduce stress promote healing and in some cases improves sleeping for a limited time for me tickling is as much a form of affection as a back scratch a massage or a hug if my tickle partner is not having fun with it i can't enjoy the encounter either as other's have stated i really feel refreshed invigorated and happy when i have been given a long playful tickling even when i am tossing and turning in my restraints attempting to escape the wonderful tickling i hope that this answers your question all the best to you Tickling Sadism and masochism Spidey Super Stories Breastfeeding Infantilism Human sexual behavior Drug addiction BDSM Motivation Reflexology Joke Consensus decision-making Sexual orientation Stuttering Bondage (BDSM) Self-harm 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hypnosis Strap-on dildo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obsessive-compulsive disorder Serial killer Asperger syndrome The Merchant of Venice Goodness and value theory The Dunciad Care Bears Child sexuality Meditation Utilitarianism YuYu Hakusho Avenue Q Domestic violence Physical intimacy Clinical depression Civil rights Nicomachean Ethics Oral sex Abortion debate Masturbation Religion Negima Consensual crime Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Property (ownership right) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drug abuse Milton H.
