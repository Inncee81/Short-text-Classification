will my nail grow back and what do i do i got an infection in one of my nails called paronychia i went to the doc's and firstly they gave me antibiotic cream which did nothing so went back days later and got oral antibiotics i had to take them for a week and the infection cleared now however although the redness hasn't fully gone down my main concern is the nail seems to be dying all down the side where the infection was has gone yellowy colour and has started to lift and it is flaking away at the cuticle i'm in no pain but i've been told if my nail comes off in this way it won't grow back please can someone tell me if this is true and what if anything i can do to prevent it coming off many thanks if the nail bed has been damaged the nail will not grow back if not it will you will probably have to wait it out to see if the nail will grow again nails generally grow at the rate of about mm per month one thing to remember is that the spores of the fungal infection can get into your shoes and re infect your toenails you will need to get new shoes or at the least wear socks you can try spraying the insides of your shoes with lysol or another disinfectant Nail (anatomy) Nail disease Anthrax Psoriasis Group A streptococcal infection Antibiotic Pedicure Callus Fungus Diseases of the honeybee Tattoo Pneumonia Tuberculosis Acne Aspergillosis Lyme disease Common cold Myxobolus cerebralis Ringworm Shock Malaria Certified Nursing Assistant Agar plate Otitis externa Guinea pig Clostridium difficile AIDS First aid Hepatitis Fancy rat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pharyngitis Ocean's Twelve Joker (comics) Herpes simplex virus Candidiasis Athlete's foot Diarrhea Smallpox Cryptosporidium Traumatic brain injury Hair Bacteria Mycosis Endocarditis Gonorrhoea Dermatology Characters in the Smurfs Tungiasis Domestic rabbit Terbinafine hydrochloride Sickle-cell disease Cellulitis Spidey Super Stories Time Out of Mind Erysipelas Urinary tract infection Trish Stratus Infectious mononucleosis Genericized trademark Marburg virus Toxoplasmosis Kenny McCormick Disinfection Miscarriage Virus Eczema Intravenous therapy Prostate cancer Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Oral contraceptive Sock Cephalexin Intraocular lens Conjunctivitis Pelvic inflammatory disease Beta-lactam antibiotic Nine Inch Nails Urinary incontinence Cancer Vancomycin Stomach cancer Biological warfare Bone fracture Syphilis Bone marrow transplant Ulcer Shaggy dog story Dexamethasone Escherichia coli O157:H7 Ebola Dialysis Pharmacology Dog training Woodworking Chamaecyparis lawsoniana The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Irish dance
