hello dear i can not have sex with my wife bout i can have sex with any body else i am about and i have two chid one and another and at the moment i like my wife and if i can have sex with my wife i can have good life it is now about two years that i have this problem at the moment i like my wife and also she like my very mach i like to enjoy of sex with my wife it sounds like you are going through a real mid life crisis i don't know if you have actually had an affair or if you're seriously thinking about having one i'm sure your wife knows things just aren't right i think you should sit down with her and discuss this like two adults her libido might be way down low too so she might be happy you're not begging for sex this is so normal i really think you need marriage counseling i know you don't want to hear that maybe the two of you should abstain for a while you have to figure out what the best thing is to do right now i don't think the answer is to have sex with someone else unless you are in love with another woman i really think marriage counseling or just separate counseling is the way to go talk about it think about it and come up with a solution together i feel you to really like each other but may have you fallen out of love with each other i hope not but a counselor can help you figure this problem out good luck to both of you and enjoy watching each other playing with the kids having an affair could really end a good marriage but you have to do what you have to do best of luck lynn Laura Schlessinger Bernard Williams Humphrey Bogart Sex education Sharon Tate Social rule Marie Antoinette Avenue Q Human sexual behavior Shaggy dog story Marriage About a Boy Sexual orientation EastEnders The Marriage of Figaro Sexual abstinence Human Ex-gay Transactional analysis Sex and the City Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shit Ken Keyes, Jr. Abortion debate Current teachings of Prem Rawat Psychotherapy Rod Stewart Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Mojave people Narcissism Knots Landing Pitaten Androgen insensitivity syndrome Iago One Tree Hill (TV series) Procrastination Marilyn Monroe Sexual addiction Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Bertrand Russell Germaine Greer Religion and sexuality Infantilism Sauna Friends The Emancipation of Mimi The Inside Le Malade imaginaire Eastern Orthodox Church Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Catcher in the Rye The Death Gate Cycle The Pilgrim's Progress Real Love (song) Philosophy of space and time Haven (TNG episode) Divorce The Lovely Bones Christian view of marriage Homosexuality and Christianity Singapore gay equality movement 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Amber Spyglass Miss Saigon Neighbours Israel ben Eliezer Notable lines in the Star Wars series The Merchant of Venice Scientology beliefs and practices Jennifer Lopez Identity and change Little Britain AVN Awards Episodes of Lost (Season 1) AFI 100 Years series Gender-neutral language Sexual intercourse E.
