helping others going to far i like helping others i'm not sure why but i do but i recently went to a therapist for depression and he accused me of putting others before myself he didn't say i did it too often but i think thats what he implied can you help others too much and i am doing just that please help there is nothing wrong with helping others unless neglecting yourself too to do it if you don't take care of yourself and put all your effort into others then yes there is something wrong with it but if you also take care of yourself while helping others no there is nothing wrong with it there is no limit as to how much you help anyone or yourself just make sure you don't neglect your own needs to the benefit of others i think that's probably what he meant Laura Schlessinger Social rule Borderline personality disorder Transsexuality Clinical depression Chronic fatigue syndrome Occupational Therapy Procrastination Psychoanalysis South Park Ex-gay Copyleft Philosophical skepticism Current teachings of Prem Rawat Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Contract Jessica Lynch Criticism of libertarianism Erich von Manstein Psychiatry Evil Arguments for and against drug prohibition Pacifism Theory of conduct Wal-Mart Boyd Rice Pitaten Psychotherapy Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Bon Jovi Palliative care Domestic violence Utility cycling Patriotism Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Reparations for slavery Hillary Rodham Clinton Strap-on dildo Controversies in autism Medicine Zhao Yun Euphemism Koila Nailatikau Leonard Cohen Abortion debate Satanism Value of life Craps Falsifiability Characters in the Smurfs Altruism Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Beatles Health insurance Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Anorexia nervosa YuYu Hakusho Democracy Joseph Campbell Neopets Al Sharpton Equivalence principle Don Rosa Philosophical counseling Humphrey Bogart Singlish Oasis (band) Objectivist philosophy Wealth Neighbours False memory Poker jargon Paul Hackett Lauren Bacall Milton H.
