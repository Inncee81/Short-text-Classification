how long would you live if shot in the stomach i'm writing a story and need to figure out something a teen is shot in the stomach during a drive by shooting he can't get medical help how long would he have to live until he bled to death i repeat he can not get any medical help hi there in the medical world a person would live if the bullet only penetrated the abdomen thru to the stomach a possible minutes it is a horrible death as we all know that our stomach is filled with hydrochloric acid as the blood begins to intermix with the stomach acid this causes fatal toxemia and extreme blood loss in the individual i would bet that if no one received medical attention and a bullet penetrated stomach with substantial force that the individual would die of blodd loss within fifteen minutes of penetration my guess is just that a guess in healthcare it is hard to determine when someone would die of an injury of this nature as it is an easy easier said than done operation and people do not usually die from this wound because they seek medical attention hope this helps and good luck to you in the future kelly mcbride rdms Stomach cancer Suicide methods Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Pneumonia Drowning First aid Terminal ballistics Dying declaration Obstetrics Bleeding Myocardial infarction Death Gastroesophageal reflux disease Cancer 3-19 shooting incident Stroke John F.
