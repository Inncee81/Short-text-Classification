yesterday and today i noticed when i went to the bathroom this morning i had poop with blood in it i was wondering what this is that i have could i have ibs lactose intolerance crohn s disease constipation this has never happened to me before i am a year old woman could this be considered severe or not it is most likely nothing to worry about if the blood was bright red and fresh it is pretty much guaranteed to be normal it could be a fissure somewhere around the opening which sometimes you can't even feel if the blood is very dark it could be a cause for concern and you might want to have it checked out i have ibs and i usually don't have blood in my stool if you have been noticing any pains in your lower abdominal area over an extended period of time or flaring up after you eat a certain thing then it is time to go to the doctor if you are normal other than the blood i wouldn't worry Crohn's disease Irritable bowel syndrome Diarrhea Coeliac disease Fecal incontinence Colorectal cancer Dietary fiber Hemorrhoid Stomach cancer Abdominal pain Constipation Prostate cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Endometriosis Feces Cirrhosis Adjustable gastric band Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obstetrics Anal fissure Endometrial cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lactose intolerance The Shining (film) Autoimmune diseases Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Human adaptation to space Folic acid Cheese Time Out of Mind Charles Darwin's illness Anemia Blood on the Tracks AFI 100 Years series Milton H.
