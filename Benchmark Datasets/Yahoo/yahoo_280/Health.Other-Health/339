digestive problems im for about a year now i've been having problems with my digestive tract well i'm not even sure if it has to do with my digestive tract i've been to the hospital about times within the year of this problem for the same problem and they keep writing it off as a peptic ulcer but things just dont add up when they prescribed antacids pepcid zantac it would make me feel better for about weeks and then it would make me feel even sicker than before so i'd stop taking them i would then get better and it would stop for i'd say about maybe weeks and then the symptoms would come back my symptoms are about minutes into eating something my stomach would feel like it was on fire as though i'd had eaten glass i'd have to drink something to dull the pain then around the time i'd be going to bed my stomach would start hurting as though someone had stabbed me then i'd feel severly nauseause as though ready to vomit i'd then break out into a cold sweat sorry they only allowed me a certain amount of space so i will continue after the cold sweat i'd start burping as though i'd have drank a glass of soda i'd still feel very nauseouse sorry i always have trouble spelling that i would be up all night and then when morning came i couldnt stay awake any longer and i'd fall asleep and then when i'd wake up i think that i'm better but as soon as i would eat something the process repeated itself all over again when i'd go to the hospital they did an ultrasound and said nothing was there that they could see did blood work so the first time they said gastroentiris gave me some zantac and sent me home second time they did blood work took a pregnancy test see what use that'll do i'm not sexually active and told me peptic ulcer deisease i believe it has something to do with my stress but yet when i'm calm and happy i still get sick ive missed school so much that i've been held back also i forgot to mention that i become very constipated when this happens and the hospital has never checked me for h pylori they would always tell me when i went to the hospital to keep on a bland diet ive been on a bland diet for over a year now the one thing thats really gets me is i havent losed large amounts of weight maybe pounds at the most i dont eat spicy foods anymore i havent drank soda in over years i drink water green tea and fruit juices but mostly water ive tried so many things with my diet but nothing works ive even tried just saltines for a whole day to see if the way i was eating was the matter but id still get sick also my uncle who doesnt live with me is showing the same symptoms and signs as me and it seem we both start feeling better get worse comes back both at the same time the doctors dont know whats wrong with him hes went for so many tests if ur still awake plz plz e mail me rite away boycrazy yahoo com i need talk u about this check my source it has all the help u need Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hypoglycemia Prostate cancer Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Vomiting Vitamin C Coeliac disease Mouth ulcer Pregnancy Breastfeeding Adjustable gastric band Folic acid Helicobacter pylori Insomnia Gastroparesis Guinea pig Stomach Crohn's disease Kodocha Cirrhosis Cancer Dieting Obstetrics Heartburn Dietary fiber Coffee Soft drink Medicine Veganism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hydrochloric acid Sleep Insulin Caffeine Dehydration Tocopherol Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Foodborne illness One Tree Hill (TV series) Traumatic brain injury Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
