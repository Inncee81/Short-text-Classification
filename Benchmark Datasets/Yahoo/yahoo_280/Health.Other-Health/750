i want to become a nurse but i can't stand blood i really want to become a nurse practitioner i have wanted to do so since i was in th grade in just a few days i have to either pick a major or go for my general aa degree i am worried of trying to become a nurse though because i am rather squeamish and i cringe at the site of blood or anything gruesome is it foolish of me to try to become a nurse or is there a chance i can overcome this fear of blood etc is there anyone else who had the same problem but got over it please let me know thank you so much thanks i really feel better about it now knowing others have over come the fear i will go for it and also see about shadowing another nurse thanks again my cousin became a nurse and at first she was grossed out really easily she threw up her first day on the job but now she absolutely loves being a nurse from volunteering at a hospital i know that sometimes even the nurses working there find some things disgusting i think that if you definitely want to be a nurse practitioner you will quickly get over your fears after being exposed to them a lot it would be a very good idea to shadow a nurse to see what the job would be like and remember if you start to go for a major in nursing and can't stand it then you can switch majors it's not the end of the world there are also many areas of nursing you could work in some might allow you to avoid blood almost altogether like post op recovery i hope that this information helps you make your decision Nurse Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer EastEnders 1957 World Series Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Pitaten Nursing 2000 Australian Grand Prix Socrates Social rule Infantilism Medical prescription Reiki Physical therapy Certified Nursing Assistant Medicine Myocardial infarction Triage Humphrey Bogart Macbeth Lauren Bacall Midwifery History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Anesthesia Milton H.
