how does one get hydrocodone without a prescription i have a friend whom i think is addicted to hydrocodone i do know for a fact that he does not have a prescription for this and he won't tell me how he gets the drug i guess he just knows me well enough to know that i would be against it him taking the drug i mean if anybody can give me information about this then maybe i can put a stop to him getting the drug or at least tell somebody who can make him stop i'm pretty sure that if he does not have a prescription for hydrocodone he can get it from online pharmacies they don't require prescriptions and this might just be the way your friend gets his stash however the price of hydrocodone when bought online is significantly higher than if bought from walk in pharmacies you should probably alert your friend's parents about his hydrocodone abuse he can get treated for this and then he'll be able to live a normal life again Controlled Substances Act Drug addiction Hydrocodone Medical prescription Prescription drug Analgesic Rush Limbaugh Illegal drug trade Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Arguments for and against drug prohibition Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Prohibition (drugs) Methylphenidate Osteoarthritis Addiction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Drug abuse Diazepam Pharmaceutical company Methamphetamine Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Regulation of therapeutic goods Publicly funded medicine Clinical depression Opioid Antidepressant Bipolar disorder Pharmacy Health insurance Revco Food and Drug Administration Cocaine RFID Infantilism CVS/pharmacy Pharmacist Migraine COX-2 inhibitor Anorexia nervosa Drug test Pharmacology Alcoholism Kurt Cobain Oxycodone Anabolic steroid Shoppers Drug Mart Elvis Presley Emergency contraception English grammar Johnny Cash Health care in the United States Lorazepam Duesberg hypothesis Recreational drug use Withdrawal Acne LSD William S.
