what are electrolytes and what do they do for you electrolyte is a medical scientific term for salt electrolytes are important because they are what your cells especially nerve heart muscle use to maintain voltages across their cell membranes and to carry electrical impulses nerve impulses muscle contractions across themselves and to other cells your kidneys work to keep the electrolyte concentrations in your blood constant despite changes in your body for example when you exercise heavily you lose electrolytes in your sweat particularly sodium and potassium these electrolytes must be replaced to keep the electrolyte concentrations of your body fluids constant so many sports drinks have sodium chloride or potassium chloride added to them they also have sugar and flavorings to provide your body with extra energy and to make the drink taste better another example where electrolyte drinks are important is when infants children have chronic vomiting or diarrhea perhaps due to intestinal flu viruses when children vomit or have diarrhea they lose electrolytes again these electrolytes and the fluids must be replaced to prevent dehydration and seizures therefore drinks such as pedialyte have sodium and potassium in them like the sports drinks do however pediatricians do not recommend giving sports drinks to a sick child sports drinks have much higher sugar concentrations than pedialyte and the high sugar is not a proper treatment hope this helps Diarrhea Action potential Diabetes mellitus Rehydration Intravenous therapy Sodium chloride Diabetic ketoacidosis Hypoglycemia Pneumonia Protein-energy malnutrition Potassium Nutrition Potassium chloride Membrane potential Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vomiting Metabolic acidosis Hyperthermia Traumatic brain injury Kidney Alcohol Hydrochloric acid Bodybuilding Edible salt Glycogen storage disease type I Gatorade Diabetes insipidus Water Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Aspartame Stomach cancer Insulin Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Potassium bromide Sodium Fecal incontinence Chlorine First aid Urine Muscle Electrophysiology Ion channel Cancer Tocopherol Vitamin C Poison Adrenal gland Gastric acid Hypokalemia Nephron Clinical depression Diabetic coma Blood Gastroenteritis Cyanide Autonomic nervous system Hypomagnesemia Urinary incontinence Cholera Cardiac pacemaker Milk 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Salt NaKATPase Chronic fatigue syndrome Lithium Cirrhosis Folic acid Myasthenia gravis Lupus erythematosus Balance disorder Prostate cancer Renal physiology Atrial fibrillation Chemotherapy Battery (electricity) Hyperkalemia Eye Ebola Current (electricity) Resting potential Cramp Weight training Acute renal failure Hiking Epilepsy Common cold Aspirin Radiation poisoning Cocaine Myocardial infarction Hyponatremia
