how can i fix my sleeping cycle i go to bed at am i fall asleep at am i wake up at pm help how do i get to normal slepeing start going to bed around p i know this sounds early but you seem to have trouble falling asleep after climbing into bed once your body is used to sleeping earlier make a set bedtime that works best for you before midnite is best after a few days of going to bed at pm you're body will start to associate this time with sleep and you'll fall asleep faster once in bed stay there even if you can't sleep if you get up your circulatory system kicks into gear blood pressure heartrate rises making you more alert so when you climb back into bed it takes you twice as long to fall asleep if you stay in bed your system will eventually relax helping you to fall asleep if you're lying in bed worrying about things write them down before climbing into bed make a check list of the things you need to do the next day things you're worried about etc by writing them down you're tricking your mind into thinking they are taken care of and you won't think about them while trying to sleep don't drink or eat anything an hour before bed digestion can keep you awake at night so making sure you stop eating in enough time gives your body the chance to digest everything before sleeping if all else fails try talking to your dr about a temporary sleeping aide or take tylenol pm or benadryl i work nites and have used both these are non habit forming and will help get your body into a routine only use them for nites in a row if they aren't working stop taking them the tylenol isn't good for your system of a lengthy period of time hope this helps Sleep Insomnia Social rule Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence The Amber Spyglass Lucid dreaming Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Narcolepsy Sleep debt Philosophical skepticism The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Circulatory system The Shining (film) Dream Milton H.
