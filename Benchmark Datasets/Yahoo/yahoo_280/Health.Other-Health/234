why does getting a shot hurt more than drawing blood i always remember that getting a shot use to hurt alot for me but i had blood drawn last week and hardly felt a thing why is that most people are afraid of the needle so they tighten up the muscle where the needle is going to go in the nurse has to push the needle harder in order to get it into the muscle the muscle also pushes harder against the medicine which is actually a foreign substance taking up space which the muscle normally uses when you have blood drawn the needle goes into a vein just under the surface of the skin and not deep into a muscle obviously nothing is injected Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Insulin Hypodermic needle Urinary incontinence Intravenous therapy Lethal injection Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Venipuncture Suture Cocaine First aid Traumatic brain injury Dialysis Epidural Acupuncture Wound healing phases Carpal tunnel syndrome Stomach cancer Skin Arm Route of administration Pneumothorax Diving Sexually-transmitted infection Stem cell Bone marrow transplant Respiratory system Methamphetamine Ebola Lumbar puncture Vacutainer Pneumonia Suicide methods Pain Weight training Vein Massage Deep vein thrombosis Lung Needle aspiration biopsy Terminal ballistics Obstetrics Blood donation Chlorpromazine Allergy Tai Chi Chuan Cephalic disorder Soleus muscle Erection Tattoo Cardiac arrhythmia Myocardial infarction Scar Blood on the Tracks Sperm Whale The Inside Deltoid muscle AIDS Milton H.
