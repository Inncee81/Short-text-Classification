sleep problems i wake up at am work all day i live on a farm but i cant sleep until am or sometimes i dont get any sleep and even then i'm up until am why cant i sleep it is really hard with school too b c i have to wake up at am i'm only i dont drink coffee or tea sometimes i have some iced tea i almost never drink soda my doctor said it was b c i am a bit over weight and i should do more i dont think it is possible for me to do more i am always tired even when i get alot of sleep and when i fall asleep it is almost impossible for me to wake up i'll start out by telling you i know how it feels because i have also had this problem in the past ok now the reason you cant sleep is because after working all day your body has built up so much lactic acid that all ur muscles and your brain is wide awake and just like most things it needs time to cool down after large physical mental exercions another reason for u not being able to sleep even after staying awake the night befor could posibly be because u are at a point where your body is overtired which is also a simular conclusion to my last point how i got over my insomnia as it is called was meditation to relax my muscles and my mind aka yoga or even taking a warm bath with incense highly recomended another thing i found helped alot was warm milk and honey or herbal tea and trying to slow down a bit durring the day although in your case that wouldn't be possible while working on a farm if none of these methods help i would go see your doctor explain to them what is happening and tell them what you've done to try and help they should be able to help you a bit further then i can and if absolutly nessesary they will prescibe a sleeping tablet or something to help you sleep i hope this helped you in some way i say again i know how it feels and it really sux when no matter how hard u try u just cant sleep sorry about the length p s oh also if posible put a load of towles or blankets in the dryer and then take them out when u want to sleep just something i learnt off a movie i watched cant remember which movie but its worth a try if it is possible i didnt try that because i wasnt able to so i dont know how well it works Insomnia Caffeine Urinary incontinence Sleep Tea Out-of-body experience Dream Social rule Coffee Clinical depression Lucid dreaming Consciousness 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypnosis Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Futurama (TV series - season 5) Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Yerba mate Cannabis (drug) Avenue Q Fecal incontinence Meditation Sleep apnea Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Shining (film) Milton H.
