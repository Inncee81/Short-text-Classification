just headaches or migranes yesterday i had a terrible headache while i was at work it was hurting so bad i was nearly in tears i got back to my boyfriend's house and he said i might have a migrane because i couldn't stand the light in his house i've never had a migrane in my life but i can't compare that last headache to anything i've had before the sensitivity to light went away after i took two extra strength tylenol but the headache didn't leave until i went to bed i have two main things that do give me headaches heat and my jaw problem it might have just been my jaw problem because the pain radiated down to my jaw joints but i also had very loud ringing in my ears it was also very hot yesterday so was this just a really bad headache or was it a migrane sounds like it might have been a migraine that could have been triggered by the heat typically they cause sensitivity to light and sound disturbances such as the ringing in your ears nausea and even vomiting also migraines tend not to be in the back of the neck but rather almost behind the eyes or in a random spot talk to your doctor there are so many types of migraines it's usually hard to distinguish Migraine Cluster headache Headache Chronic fatigue syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tension headache Acupuncture Traumatic brain injury Multiple chemical sensitivity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pitaten Equine conformation Humphrey Bogart Psoriasis Vomiting Milton H.
