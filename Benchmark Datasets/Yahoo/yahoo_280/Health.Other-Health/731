i think i have a bladder infection i absolutely hate going to the doctor honestly would like to avoid it if at all possible so the urge to urine is quite often it burns like every other time sometimes the urge comes so fast that my stomach cramps had taken some azo last week when i first felt like this it went away for days or so just recently got the feeling back i eat and exercise decently almost never ever sick help please drink some cranberry juice that is supposed to be really good for a bladder infection but you really should go to the gp and get some antibiotics to begin fighting the infection right away they can't stop all the symptoms right away if you have a lot of pain your health care provider may recommend a medication to relieve the pain in your bladder this medicine will clear up the painful symptoms in about days although it will usually make you much more comfortable within hours it's important to take the antibiotics until the prescription is finished many people stop taking the medication when they begin to feel better but that doesn't allow the antibiotics to completely kill the bacteria which increases the risk that the infection will reappear if you ever develop a rash from an antibiotic or have difficulty breathing stop taking it immediately and call the health care provider who prescribed the medication for some infections you may only have to take antibiotics for days but usually you'll be on medication for to days it's important to drink lots of water during and after treatment because each time you urinate the bladder cleanses itself a little bit more cranberry juice also has been shown to have positive effects on utis don't use the kind of juice that says juice cocktail on the label that has too much sugar and is not concentrated enough with cranberries make sure the cranberry juice is juice many brands are now cranberry quality cranberry juice produces hippuric acid in the urine which acidifies the urine and prevents bacteria from sticking to the walls of the bladder if pure cranberry juice is not available cranberry capsules can be substituted they can be found in most health food stores always take these with a large glass of water vitamin c may also be recommended for you to take if you get help right away a uti should completely clear up within days to weeks you may be advised to avoid sexual intercourse until the symptoms have been gone for weeks which allows the inflammation to disappear completely Pneumonia Stomach cancer Common cold Psoriasis Diarrhea Breastfeeding Acne Folic acid Cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Kidney stone Medical analysis of circumcision Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fecal incontinence Vitamin C Escherichia coli O157:H7 Gonorrhoea Urine Group A streptococcal infection Cephalexin Decompression sickness Urinary tract infection Gastroesophageal reflux disease Guinea pig Chlorpromazine Mouth ulcer Cystoscopy Urinary system Aspartame Sexually-transmitted infection Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Osteoarthritis Fasting Traumatic brain injury Nutrition Tuberculosis Migraine Cellulitis Asthma Helicobacter pylori Crohn's disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever Lupus erythematosus Multiple sclerosis Marathon (sport) Gout Cheese Cystic fibrosis Cranberry Menstrual cup AIDS Insulin Penicillin Shock Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Antiretroviral drug Milk Hyperglycemia Malaria Sulfasalazine Antidepressant Conjunctivitis Coeliac disease Ulcerative colitis Anorexia nervosa Cirrhosis Hamster Endometriosis Atherosclerosis Coffee Botulism Tooth Homeopathy Medical cannabis Eczema Alzheimer's disease Isotretinoin Tooth enamel Bipolar disorder Herpes simplex virus Foodborne illness Clinical depression Dental caries Colorectal cancer Diazepam Infectious mononucleosis Tobacco smoking Ultraviolet
