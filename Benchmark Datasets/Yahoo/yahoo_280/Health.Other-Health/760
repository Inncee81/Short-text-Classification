is there problem with my blood it dries up too fast i went for a blood test a few days ago this morning the clinic nurse inform me that my blood sample collected in the test tube has already dries up and they need to withdraw my blood sample for a nd time is it normal for my blood to dries up so fast am i sick with any illness or virus i have never heard of blood being dried up so fast after collection there's nothing likely wrong with your blood if they are truthful they probably used the wrong tube to collect it in a clot tube instead of an edta tube which would have kept it fluid for testing the honest explaination has more to do with human error than a problem with your blood i doubt you are ill i suspect there was a mistake at the clinic or laboratory if it bothers you put them on the spot at the clinic and make them give you an explaination Medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Hypoglycemia Cytomegalovirus Blood plasma Prostate cancer Ebola Stroke Vacutainer Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Dialysis Complete blood count Stomach cancer Prothrombin time HIV test Automated analyser HIV EDTA Cancer Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Multiple sclerosis Pregnancy Chronic fatigue syndrome Liquid breathing In vitro fertilisation Prenatal diagnosis Glycogen storage disease type I Drug test Diabetes mellitus Obstetrics AIDS reappraisal Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Carbon dioxide Blood pressure Folic acid Blood transfusion Urinary incontinence Scientific method Crohn's disease Medical laboratory Spanish flu Mesothelioma Polymerase chain reaction Anticoagulant Marburg virus Medical prescription Hepatitis C Paracetamol Genetic fingerprinting American Red Cross Insulin Psychology Lassa fever Electrophysiology Computer virus Rocky Mountain spotted fever Blood Gastroparesis Sickle-cell disease Common cold Hepatitis Menstrual cycle Venipuncture Growth hormone deficiency Kidney Sleeping sickness Vitamin C Balance disorder Chagas disease Thermal power station Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Ovarian cancer Nutrition Blood on the Tracks Atheroma Clinical trial Coagulation Cirrhosis Lumbar puncture Manhattan Project Henipavirus Experiment Weather forecasting Drowning Emphysema Rheumatoid arthritis Normal distribution Infectious mononucleosis Human feces Liver function tests Natural Hygiene Intravenous therapy Heparin Glucose meter Tocopherol Atherosclerosis Halitosis
