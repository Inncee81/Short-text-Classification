how bad for your ears to listen to music loud with headphones on pretty bad with ipods for example about minutes at full volume will damage your ears i heard i don't know whether that is entirely true but definetely listening at a high volume for a long interrupted period of time will cause hearing damage apparently a safe volume for any amount of time is quiet enough that you could hear if someone was talking to you people recommend that you are meant to not use music with headphones to drown out other noise etc but make sure you look after your ears because or else you won't be able to hear your music at all Headphones Hearing impairment Hearing aid Gramophone record Equal-loudness contour Decibel Psychoacoustics Loudspeaker Microphone Binaural beats Audiophile Authentic performance MP3 Stereophonic sound John Cage Social rule Walkman Stereoscopy Noise pollution Binaural recording Diving Mixtape Shaggy dog story IPod Buddy Guy Ear Loudness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tinnitus WNNX (FM) Weighting filter Suppressor Music Electronic voice phenomena Roxette Heart sounds Noise-cancelling headphone Jack plug M__ni__re___s disease Prank flash Progressive rock Disc jockey Beamforming ITunes Bose Corporation Sant Mat Cochlear implant High fidelity Audio data compression Stuttering Pardon the Interruption Sound Redundant array of independent disks The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Podcasting Das Boot Audio level compression Gun safety Sly & the Family Stone Beatmatching Multitrack recording Sampling (music) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Noise music March (music) Etymotic Research Video game music It's All Gone Pete Tong Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Time Out of Mind Rush Limbaugh Cyberspace Explosive material Theory of conduct Rebreather Avenue Q The Dunciad Urinary incontinence Religious Society of Friends Internal ballistics Swimming Charles Mingus Sensorineural hearing loss Hearing (sense) Captain Beefheart Drowning Book of Isaiah USS Sea Dog (SS-401) The Who Body piercing Telecommunication Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind First Battle of the Atlantic Synthesizer Sydney Riot of 1879 Pirate radio Dynamics (music) Harmonic series (music) Big band Digital audio player
