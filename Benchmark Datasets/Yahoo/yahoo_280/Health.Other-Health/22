diagnostic medical equipment now causing cancer recently i heard a report on how those who have had ct scans mri's and such are at a higher increase of getting cancer the one in particular they spoke about was one that i dealt with where they inject dye into your heart angiogram and get the pictures they concluded that those patients have a higher rate of heart cancer as well as breast cancer today i recieved a call from my drs office wanting me to come in and i have to be honest i am concerned about what i am gonna hear my question is should a person have a ct scan done or mri's when they have now concluded it gives the patient a higher risk for getting cancer when does a person say enough is enough they meaning doctors the report was on the evening news as well as medical journals ct scans are worse than mri basically any kind of medical imaging involves bombarding your body with energy and seeing what happens magnetic resonance imaging works by using strong magnetic fields to temporarily alter the polarity of atomic particles in your body when they revert to their normal polarity they release energy which is then picked up by the imaging system i don't really know the details the major difference is that the technique relies on energy that's reflected back out of the body as things return to normal other types of scans often rely on bombarding your body with energy with you between the source of that energy and some kind of film or sensor then the image is derived from what your body doesn't block so in a vague way you could consider that one technique is done by your body giving off energy and another by your body absorbing energy so go for the mri and with other types of diagnostics get as few doses as possible each day you sit in front of a computer screen there's a teeny teeny tiny chance that you'll get some kind of cancer from a random mutation due to the energy coming off the screen its there with everything and its a lot higher with things like diagnostic radiation but its still a very small chance and its offset by the benefit of possibly diagnosing and preventing certain diseases weigh the risk ps i just read another answer as i posted this there are certainly a lot of bunk studies even within scientific and medical communities however it has been widely accepted in such communities since probably the late s that diagnostic radiation does very slightly increase the chance of genetic mutations that may result in cancers Breast cancer Radiation therapy Lung cancer Cardiac stress test Radiology Medicine Nuclear medicine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder X-ray Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Colorectal cancer History of brain imaging Mesothelioma Bipolar disorder Stomach cancer Chiropractic Androgen insensitivity syndrome Brain imaging Computed tomography Functional magnetic resonance imaging Autism Multiple sclerosis Aortic dissection Positron emission tomography Folic acid Oncology Diabetes mellitus Malignant melanoma Radiosurgery Medical imaging Stroke Ovarian cancer Radar Urinary incontinence Gamma ray Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Traumatic brain injury Tocopherol Schizophrenia Growth hormone treatment Hypoglycemia Mobile phone radiation and health Tobacco smoking Nuclear magnetic resonance Medical ultrasonography Abortion Mental illness Medical analysis of circumcision Technetium Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Pulmonary embolism Ultraviolet Radiation poisoning Syringomyelia Dieting Acupuncture Ataxia telangiectasia Solar variation Bone marrow transplant Cephalic disorder Traditional Chinese medicine Galileo spacecraft Prolactinoma Vitamin C Post-traumatic stress disorder Obesity Nuclear power Particle accelerator Allergy Plutonium Brain tumor Magnet Nutrition Ozone depletion Cryptorchidism Obstetrics Human brain Loudspeaker Malaria Growth hormone deficiency Transsexuality Chemotherapy Hodgkin's lymphoma Stereoscopy Psychosis Crohn's disease Microscopy Gravitational radiation Hard disk Cystic fibrosis
