i have had my belly button pierced for i have had my belly button pierced for a year now its a curved barbell with a ball on the botton with a crystal in the center anways i tried to take it out today by unscrewing the top ball and it won't move at all i also tried the bottom and i can't get it to move i assumed it is the type you just unscrew but now i am not so sure i have never obviously removed it before the piercer never specified to come back once its healed so they can take it off and i get a normal one and i can't go back there to ask anymore since i live in another state should i just try unscrewing it with some plyers maybe the piercer just screwed it on really tight when you get a first piercing that is a curved barbell are they usualy the types that you can take off yourself or do i have to go to a piercer and have then remove it as far as i know usually the rings or barbells that they start you off with for naval piercings are just your usual jewelery nothing like the keeper earrings that you can get for your earlobes or anything but if your piercer specifically told you to come back so they can remove it they may have put something like that in my suggestion would be to call the place you got it pierced before you try anything on your own they should be able to give you some info on how to remove it safely as you don't want to rip your existing hole by doing it the wrong way Earring Body piercing Barbell (piercing) Prince Albert piercing Ear piercing instrument Tongue piercing Poker jargon Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Navel piercing Motor oil Drill bit BS 1363 Professional wrestling match types Knife Ear Screw Violin Strap-on dildo Bong Elevator Suplex Snooker Billiards Extreme Dodgeball Weight training RuneScape quests 1957 World Series Stanley Cup Piccolo Junior Saga Upholstery GunBound Glossary of American football Mouse (computing) Lip piercing Condom Glossary of partner dance terms Golf Pinball Anchor AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes Umbilicus Wood carving Harmonica Technology in the Stargate universe Aes Sedai General relativity Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Manifold Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Yu-Gi-Oh!
