melatonin forcing dreams while you sleep anyone else had experience with this i take mg of melatonin at night to keep my sleep schedule on a schedule due to my differences in activity almost every day sometimes i'm just not tired at night but i still have to get up at and work all day the very first night and for the past three weeks i have been having very vivid and violent dreams i realize that everyone dreams when they hit rem or whatever but i am one of those people who do not remember any of those dreams at least when i'm not taking melatonin has anyone else experienced more vivid or just more dreams while taking melatonin i take mg tablets each night total i asked my dr to recommend something that didn't cause me to wake up feeling dragged out the next day like you my mind just won't shut off when i want it to he said that melatonin is found in our bodies naturally and that the reason i may be having trouble sleeping is because as we age our bodies produce less i read up on it and dreams do become more 'vivid' for some people i am one of those but my dreams just seem more interesting entertaining etc like my mind has taken a creativity course it is also being researched for its usefulness in preventing the onset of dementia or alzheimer's i have come to look forward to going to sleep to see what is 'on' each night mine aren't violent but very vivid violent dreams nightmares that recur nightly would be a side effect i would not want to tolerate Dream Sleep Lucid dreaming Narcolepsy Out-of-body experience Clinical depression Sleep paralysis Psychosis Melatonin Insomnia Delayed sleep phase syndrome Migraine Carl Jung Rapid eye movement Urinary incontinence Hypnosis Circadian rhythm Polyphasic sleep Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Shining (film) Traumatic brain injury Philosophical skepticism Schizophrenia Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Alzheimer's disease W.I.T.C.H.
