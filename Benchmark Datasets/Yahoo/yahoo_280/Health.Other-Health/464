burning my sinuses i guess in between back of nose and throat feel on fire what can i do for this pain i woke up with a dried irritated feeling but instead of going away it has gotten worse and now it is burning so bad i cant sleep or think what could this be i've tried using nasal saline spray and an otc pain reliever but it just keeps getting worse please any suggestions anything another thing you might want to try is a neti pot which you can purchase at most health food stores you can also purchase a saline solution some have a natural antiseptic ingredient so that it will help you clear out any possible infections neti pots have been used for thousands of years to clean out and restore the sinuses to their natural ph balance if nothing else works or your symptoms get worse it's time to schedule a trip to see the doctor to make sure that you don't have anything more serious going on Jala neti Nasal irrigation Chronic fatigue syndrome Common cold Nasal congestion Sinusitis Urinary incontinence Conjunctivitis Mouth ulcer Medicine Cannabis (drug) Methamphetamine Antiseptic Cocaine Mercury (element) Influenza Dialysis Fecal incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Capsaicin Body piercing Mucus Nasal spray Coeliac disease Multiple chemical sensitivity Medical prescription Psoriasis Hay fever Stomach cancer Hydrogen peroxide Breastfeeding Gastroesophageal reflux disease Contact lens Pepper spray Tobacco smoking Medical cannabis Traumatic brain injury Reflexology Oh My Goddess!
