i'm having a real hard time eating nothing tastes good to me anymore i will eat veggies no meat help i have made no changes in exercise medications etc but i food has lost its appeal i read in hospice literature that when this happens it is often a sign that the body is shutting down and preparing for death my doctor has given me a clean bill of health but i have lost about pounds in three weeks which is probably good as i am over weight i am not a teenage girl i am a year old woman but this really concerns me i have tried changing things in my diet but still often look at the food after i prepare it and just toss it out i do eat somethings but my appetite is gone all suggestions will be greatly appreciated please help thank you it might be due to the summer heat depending on where you live i know as soon as summer hits out here the very idea of food makes me sick and my appetite decreases dramatically if you think that could be the case try things like smoothies slim fast carnation instant breakfasts etc you'll still get some calories and nutrients but it's just like drinking a cool beverage good luck Dieting Obesity Atkins Nutritional Approach Milk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Folic acid Breastfeeding Super Size Me Hamburger Adjustable gastric band Food Vegetarianism Breakfast Fasting Stomach cancer Veganism Healthy eating Nutrition Fast food Alcoholic beverage Low-carbohydrate diet Coeliac disease Fecal incontinence Coffee Binge eating disorder Dehydration Egg (food) Soft drink Raw food diet Weight loss Kashrut Bodybuilding French cuisine Sucralose Ramen McDonald's Vitamin C Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cat Hyperthermia Sugar substitute Dietary fiber Tofu Human height Vegetarian cuisine Domestic rabbit Cannabis (drug) Chinese food therapy Fancy rat Diabetes mellitus Guinea pig Chronic fatigue syndrome Tea Cuisine of Denmark Cheese Chocolate MRE Little Britain Snack food Explosive material Aspartame Escherichia coli O157:H7 Babe Ruth Calorie Recipe Burger King Aztec Cancer Colorectal cancer Marathon (sport) Urinary incontinence Dog South Beach diet Tocopherol Garfield In-N-Out Burger Jewish cuisine Agriculture Domestic goat Tlingit Bread Prostate cancer Sauerkraut Stroke Energy Meal Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Roman eating and drinking Insulin Health insurance Hyperglycemia Omega-3 fatty acid Chicken Malnutrition Japanese tea ceremony Foodborne illness
