why did i feel this way i'm going to be a freshman and today was the first day of volleyball tryouts when i got there i felt fine and ready to work but as the tryouts progressed i started to feel sicker and sicker about minutes into the tryouts i started to have a little trouble breathing but that was just because i was working my body harder than i usually do and then i started to feel tired and a little dizzy lightheaded i think there the same thing eventually i started feeling like i was going to throw up and so i asked to go to the bathroom and i almost threw up but i didn't so i went to the bathroom and sat on the floor for a few minutes and i started to feel better i went to the bathroom because i didn't want to make a big deal out of it and ruin my chances i started feeling bad again so i asked my coach if i could sit and he asked if i felt dizzy lightheaded and i said no because again i didn't want to make a big deal out of it but i did say that my stomach sort of hurt and he said to just stand because that would be better than standing he also said to drink water but the water made me feel sick because it was warm i also forgot my water bottle and i was really thirsty so maybe i was dehydrated what do you think was wrong it was also hot and i was sweating alot i also have a sunburn but i don't know if that had anything to do with it except for the fact that it may have made me hotter warmer same thing i'd say heat exhaustion Hyperthermia Shaggy dog story Dehydration Sandy Koufax Jackass: The Movie One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q Diving Ron Weasley Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dialysis Social rule Satchel Paige The Shining (film) Panic attack Piccolo Junior Saga 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sauna Survival skills 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Hiccup Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind Volleyball Sin City Fecal incontinence Blood on the Tracks Poker jargon Sento Chronic fatigue syndrome Humphrey Bogart Breastfeeding Drinking Marilyn Monroe Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ben Johnson (athlete) Kitchen Mattress Ex-gay Muslim ibn Aqeel First aid Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Japanese toilet Milton H.
