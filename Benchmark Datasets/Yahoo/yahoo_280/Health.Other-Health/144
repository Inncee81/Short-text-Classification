why is it that some people look at overweight people and seem to hate them they don't even know them but they are willing to make fun of them and tease them unmercifully in the first place it is none of their business some overweight people have fought it for years others have a hard time getting motivated to lose some have health problems that prevent them from exercising and others take medications that cause weight gain i am not trying to make excuses but when you look at that overweight person you don't know what is going on in their lives and you have no right to judge them regardless i think that some people missed the point about it being none of their business and as far as being a burden on society you don't see people teasing and making fun of the drug addict they may be disgusted but they don't make fun of them or how about the alcoholic these people are a burden on societ too they actually kill other people talk about a burden and what about the criminals people may hate what they do but they don't usually make fun of them unless they do something particularly stupid as long as there is someone to point the finger at there is no need to look at yourself many people do not even realize this i try to offset the ignorance of people who do not know any better by making an effort to neutralize the attitude by ingnoring it or by calling attention to a positive in the person being ridiculed but what a nice guy he is or he would do anything for you the world is made up of all kinds of people refreshing isn't it Obesity Theory of conduct Arguments for and against drug prohibition Peter Griffin Eric Cartman Binge eating disorder Drug addiction Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Undergrads Kyle Broflovski Human sexual behavior Unemployment Alcoholics Anonymous Garfield Alignment (role-playing games) Abortion debate Clinical depression Political correctness Homophobia Rush Limbaugh Kodocha Value system Prohibition (drugs) Transactional analysis Health insurance The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Jim Rome Show Addiction Indian English Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Procrastination Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microeconomics Illegal drug trade Tobacco smoking Nicomachean Ethics Fruits Basket Mnemonic Humphrey Bogart South Park American Psycho Tax Libertarianism One Tree Hill (TV series) Sexual orientation Utilitarianism Political views of Lyndon LaRouche Recreation Mediation The Beach Boys Fair use The nature of God in Western theology Late Night with Conan O'Brien Criticism of libertarianism Methamphetamine Vernon Schillinger Mothers Against Drunk Driving Little Britain Have I Got News For You The Shining (film) Cocaine Scarface (1983 film) Caffeine Homer Simpson LaVeyan Satanism Tai Chi Chuan Goodness and value theory Migraine Camp Lazlo Anorexia nervosa U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Shaggy dog story The Marshall Mathers LP Characters of Naruto Ron and Fez Platoon (film) Urinary incontinence Social psychology Invader Zim Warez Involuntary commitment Stuttering Physical attractiveness George Costanza Drug policy of the Netherlands Psychiatric hospital Tom the Dancing Bug W.
