podiatrists orthotics shin splints dear podiatrists are custom orthotics a scam i e are they any better than over the counter do they have any value for a tennis player i have a mildly severe case of shin splints as i apparently have flat feet i read somewhere that orthotics will do little to help out with the shin splints they're intended for long term correction if orthotics won't eliminate my shin splints as caused by tennis or running a lot in a short period what can i do anyone had experience with custom orthotics and shin splints does anyone also play tennis had shin splints and then resolved it through custom orthotics dear patient i'm not a podiatrist i'm a kinesiologist who has custom made orthotics from some people custom made orthotics are the only option and there is no one that won't benefit from them from myself to friends to patients and clients i've seen many people correct many issues with proper orthodics they have value for everyone whose feet have stopped growing flat feet can aggravate shin splints but they are caused by weak soft tissue mostly weak muscles close to your tibia shin bone before shelling out for orthotics do feet exercise for weeks first ice your shins and use braces properly placed type of foam on your shins before during and after running be sure the soles of your shoes are not worn out no old sneakers see if that impacts it first that corrected my shin splints however i still needed orthodics to correct my gait warning your shins calves and feet will be in much pain for the first few weeks of having orthodics and using them this is because of muscles being used that are always used in that way what exercises put a towel under your bare foot flat on floor pull it towards you with your toes repeat often do calf raises off a stair Equine conformation Carpal tunnel syndrome Callus Iliotibial band syndrome Running High-heeled shoe Shoe Flat feet Stress fracture Massage Professional wrestling holds First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.
