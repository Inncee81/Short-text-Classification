ok so what's so bad with weed see i smokes weed i do estacy i trips on weekend and i drinks alot and i also purchase roids from my seller and i been doing that for years now but i just don't see any side effect that we learnt from health lessons so would the side effects come later or im just totally screwd by my seller oh yeah by side effect i mean like death you know not the other side effect which is totally awesome and fun omg im so wasted you see with some drugs like herroin and blow their are alot of bad side effects the problem is that parents are stupid and decided it would besmart to stretch the side effects so much that its not only unbeleivable but borderline lies and then they decided that it would be an even better idea to make up things about the other harmless drugs like weed to scare us into not doing them except it backfires on them because then when people try weed they realize that the things they learned in health were all lies and then they realize that not all drugs are bad and then we decide to try the other drugs thus turning weed into a gateway drug and then they think that since thats not working they should just make up more lies and try to scare us even more which just makes their situation worse besides the fact that most of them are hippocrits that did drugs when they were our age anyway but had to quite cause they got jobs its so funny how stupd adultts are your wasted dude if you were wasted you wouldnt be able to type right now cause youd be drunk thats the only way you can get wasted Avenue Q Sin City Humphrey Bogart Drug test Great Teacher Onizuka The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Marshall Mathers LP Social rule About a Boy Stone Cold Steve Austin Microeconomics One Tree Hill (TV series) Homer Simpson Theory of conduct Motion picture rating system Cannabis (drug) Illegal drug trade Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Bong Prostate cancer Tobacco smoking Ethics Methamphetamine Eric Cartman Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Maximum Exposure Everwood George Costanza Arguments for and against drug prohibition Friends Supply and demand Milton H.
