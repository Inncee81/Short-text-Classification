i want to donate blood but i'm a big girl's blouse when it comes to needles can anyone tell me a whether it's a really painful procedure b tips on how i can distract myself and not faint i faint rather easily c how long the procedure takes many thanks donating blood is actually how i got over my fear of needles when i was a child i would actually try to run away from the nurse when they would come at me with needles for blood draws and shots the answers to your questions are a overall no the only part that hurts is the initial stick if you are really nervous about it ask to have the the most experienced person on schedule do your stick don't be afraid to ask people do it all of the time there are people who are really good and some who aren't that's just a fact b look away when they actually do your stick i think that it goes faster when you aren't expecting it try to keep your arm relaxed i know that sounds easier said then done but it will help during the actual donating concentrate on squeezing of the stress ball that they give you they tell you to squeeze every seconds i think concentrating on counting off the time will help you focus on something else other than the fact that you have a needle in your arm c i think on average it takes a person minutes for the actual donation process but keep in mind you will probably be there at least an hour because of paperwork eligibility checking and then after they have you sit and drink something and munch on some snacks Blood donation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Intravenous therapy Theory of conduct Milton H.
