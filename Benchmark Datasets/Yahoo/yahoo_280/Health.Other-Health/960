how can i fix a broken bone that is jutting out of my arm i just fell down the stairs and landed on my arm my arm bone is sticking out of my arm and i am bleeding perfusly it doesnt hurt that bad so i dont think i need to go to the hospital can i just use an everyday household item to get the bone back in ok heres what you do listen carefully because your life is in grave danger warning this is not for the squeamish it is crude but there is not much time first call this is the budweiser hotline tell them about your situation they probably wont be able to help but someone needs to know what is going on in case you don't make it next go to the tool shed and get a pair of hedge cutters the bone will probably just get in your way so you need to cut it off kind of like if you have an arrow stuck in your thigh if you don't have any cutters around go to your local aubuchon or other hardware store next you'll need a knife any knife will work but make sure it's not rusty or you'll have bigger problems also make sure to sterilize it by putting it in boiling water for at least minutes with the knife make a inch incision below the bone make a perpendicular that's a t shape if you are an idiot incision a half inch in each direction away from the first cut separate the flaps of flesh and pin them so they don't get in your way inside the cut you will see two lines one red and one blue if you ask what these are people will tell you they are an artery and a vein carrying blood from and to the heart respectively wrong they actually provide power to your hand cut the blue wire strip the wire to expose the bare wire inside both ends of the cut wire solder these ends to the bone this will transfer power directly to the bone helping it to heal next you will need to get some soldier driver ants from africa to close the wound the ants work much better than any modern sutures and look way cooler when you get the ants have them bite on either side of the wound to close it up and break off their bodies they will hold it closed for several days until it completely heals congratulations if you have not already passed out from blood loss and are still reading this you have been successful make sure to call the budweiser guy back and let him know if you are not still with me then i am sorry i could not help you in time Bleeding Wound Textile manufacturing First aid Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Autopsy Earring RuneScape quests English longbow Drill bit Happy Tree Friends Professional wrestling match types Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Archery Wood carving Tourniquet Equine conformation Suicide methods Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Intravenous therapy Traumatic brain injury The Inside Maxilla Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Blood (computer game) The Amber Spyglass Screw Tesla coil Menstrual cup Tattoo Snooker Sin City Comanche Undergarment Sailing Trench warfare Land mine Suture Cephalic disorder The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bone fracture Female genital cutting Eskrima Diving RuneScape locations Embalming Glossary of climbing terms Theory of conduct Gramophone record Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Floppy disk Transformer Internal ballistics Hard disk Weapons of Middle-earth Naruto jutsu Barbed wire Blood on the Tracks Shark Weaving The Curse of Fenric Action potential Swingout Sphenoid bone Dominoes Mandible Pottery Overhead lines Woodworking Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Weapon Brewery Fast bowling Glossary of American football Bowie knife Skin graft Dialysis Crucifixion Hamster Printed circuit board Trapping Rigging Terminal ballistics Kitesurfing Occipital bone Single bullet theory Head
