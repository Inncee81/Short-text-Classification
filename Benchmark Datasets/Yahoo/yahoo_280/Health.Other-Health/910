have you been bitten by a brown recluse i need advice i was working in the yard and was covered in misquito bites and was stung by a yellow jacket one bite on my arm was especially tender and after i day it grew from the size of a pea to the size of a dime my skin had necrosis and inflammation and i had flu like symptoms i did my homework online and went to the doctors today i was rather disappointed by their care and am looking for sources of more information or personal experience all the doc did was poke at it with her finger confirm to the best of her ability without having seen the actual culprit that was probably brown recluse and put me on antibiotics this left me feeling rather lacking i've heard and seen all the horror stories about the recluse and i'm hoping someone can tell me they got bit took antibiotics and was better a week later the only thing i can find online is the extreme cases of tissue necrosis and nearly fatal occurances does no one report on the mild cases are there mild cases i'm worried while i've never been bitten by a brown recluse i've seen many people and talked to them and 'how well you heal' is really up to you keep the 'site' scrupulously clean and cover it with a 'dry gauze' with 'tape' around the edges because you don't want 'dirt' getting in but you want to let the 'sore' breath and slowly 'dry out ' all 'necrosis' means is 'dying skin' and that is actually a very good thing where a spider bite is concerned if you keep the 'sore' clean and dry the 'necrosis' should be 'less' than if you let it get dirty and wet the 'antibiotics' are not to fight the 'spider bite' that 'bite' is taking pretty much all of your immune system to get better so the rest of your body is 'more prone to getting infections' and that can kill you take your antibiotics as directed keep your 'sore' clean and dry at all times tape 'plastic wrap' over it when you bathe and wash it at the sink and dry it thoroughly to keep any 'poisons' from the rest of your skin get lots of rest take a nap every day and you should be 'fully healed' and 'back to your old self' in weeks to months yes it is 'a long time' but the brown recluse is actually the worst of the spiders that bite and in the 'old days' you would be dead now isn't 'technology' a wonderful thing First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Cellulitis Brown recluse spider Group A streptococcal infection Chronic fatigue syndrome Common cold Tuberculosis Acne Breastfeeding Social rule Hobo spider Prostate cancer Rabies Herpes simplex virus Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Fancy rat H5N1 Allergy Eczema Crohn's disease Traumatic brain injury Spanish flu Pneumonia Tarantula Hip fracture Sauna Bubonic plague Avian influenza Textile manufacturing Legionellosis Mouth ulcer Radiation poisoning Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Theory of conduct Body piercing Equine conformation Milton H.
