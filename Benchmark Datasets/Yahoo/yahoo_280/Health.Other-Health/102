boyfriend is sick my boyfriend has been sick now for about days he has been throwing up having diarrhea he cant hold down any food high fever sweats and he is just miserable he doesn't seem to be getting any better he has been holding down medicine and jello but can't hold down crackers everyday is the same the symptoms are the same and nothing is changing i miss him alot and the doctors don't seem to know what was wrong his mom took him to the hospital and he was severely dehydrated but that was days ago and nothing has changed since then he's upset cause he just wants to get better and i have been talking to his mom i wanna know what you might think is wrong and why none of the symptoms are getting better honey if he's still feeling that poorly he really needs to get back to a doctor either his family doctor or another trip to the emergency room by now he's probably back to severely dehydrated the doctor should give him some iv fluids to rehydrate him run some blood tests and maybe an abdominal ct scan to try and pin point what's going on with him it may in fact just be the flu or it could be something much more serious either way the bottom line is that the dehydration factor could end up being life threatening please encourage his mother to take him back to the doctor for further testing i hope he feels better soon Diarrhea Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Pneumonia Fecal incontinence Prostate cancer Common cold Ebola Stroke Miscarriage Dysentery Decompression sickness Kodocha Gastroenteritis Charles Darwin's illness Hypoglycemia Vitamin C Sulfasalazine Hepatitis C Cirrhosis Marburg virus Diabetes mellitus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Mesothelioma Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Malaria Diabetic coma Rehydration Food allergy Cancer Aortic dissection Gout Protein-energy malnutrition Coeliac disease Foodborne illness Terri Schiavo Obstetrics Friends Rocky Mountain spotted fever Myocardial infarction H5N1 Asthma Urinary incontinence Traumatic brain injury Bipolar disorder Rent (musical) Group A streptococcal infection Gastroparesis Infectious mononucleosis Lupus erythematosus Emergency Medical Services Futurama (TV series - season 2) Escherichia coli O157:H7 Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.
