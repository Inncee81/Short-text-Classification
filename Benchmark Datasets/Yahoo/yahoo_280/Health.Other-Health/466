what is the efficacy of mediation in reducing stress meditation my bad from observation i am not sure of medication's efficacy in reducing stress rather they say that physical exercise and good diet plus rest will help to alleviate stress more than pumping medication into your body even having a notebook to enter all your thoughts to see it on paper can unjumble things in your mind's consideration a brisk walk in the sunshine in the middle of the day maybe during your work lunch hour taking a few mins to break away they say that there are feel good hormones that get stimulated in your brain that come from exposing yourself to some sunlight medications can help some but our bodies are made fearfully and wonderfully and has many self healing properties i know of friends who personally got stressed out over their medication concerned if they would become slaves to its usage or do if meds will do gradual damage to their liver hopefully more people under stress would evaluate their lives and opt to get out there and get active rather than pop a pill of some sort good question sandy Clinical depression Prostate cancer Folic acid Urinary incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Sleep Medicine Atherosclerosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insulin Hypoglycemia Obesity Stress (medicine) Carpal tunnel syndrome Tocopherol Insomnia Pneumonia Post-traumatic stress disorder Diabetes mellitus Breastfeeding Cancer Autism Tobacco smoking Alzheimer's disease Multiple sclerosis Acne Dieting Panic attack Psoriasis Prayer Infantilism Vitamin D Reparative therapy Alexander Technique Psychology of religion Herpes simplex virus Hypertension Borderline personality disorder Glucocorticoid Scientology beliefs and practices Cannabis (drug) Alternative medicine Sunlight Bipolar disorder Epilepsy Patent medicine Caffeine Puberty Decompression sickness Vitamin C Anthroposophy Immortality Chlorpromazine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychosurgery Stomach cancer Diazepam Oral sex Menstrual cycle Malaria Blood pressure Paget's disease of bone Chiropractic Fasting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Growth hormone treatment Drug addiction Migraine Weight training Glucokinase Hearing impairment Out-of-body experience Neurofeedback Obsessive-compulsive disorder Fibromyalgia Asthma Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis Falun Gong Sigmund Freud Stuttering Nutrition Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Dualism (philosophy of mind) Aikido A Course In Miracles Philosophy of mind Cocaine Tai Chi Chuan Acupuncture Growth hormone deficiency Anger management Post Polio syndrome Abortion debate
