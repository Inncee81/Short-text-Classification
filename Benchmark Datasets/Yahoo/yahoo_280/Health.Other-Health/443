what are the benefits of substance abuse treatment i mean aside from the fact that it would get to treat an individual and make him sober again it's just that addiction treatments cost so much that i was just wondering if it's really worth it look at it this way when you enter a person into a substance abuse treatment program you would be giving that one person another chance to better his life if he does succeed in recovering from his substance abuse problem that's one person that will be able to resume his productivity and be of help to society besides think of the money that an addict spends for the drugs he consumes there are times wherein an addict is so desperate to get drugs that he is practically forced to steal just so he could appease his craving if that addict is then treated for his addiction then he wouldn't have to spend so much on drugs and there would also be less violence though treatment programs for substance abusers may be costly i think it's all worth it Alcoholism Drug addiction Addiction Arguments for and against drug prohibition Drug abuse Alcoholics Anonymous Health care in the United States Cocaine Controlled Substances Act Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Anxiety Schizophrenia Methylphenidate Borderline personality disorder Antiretroviral drug Convention on Psychotropic Substances Consensual crime Publicly funded medicine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Drug policy of the Netherlands Narcotic Cancer Pharmaceutical company Harm reduction Illegal drug trade Rat Park Diazepam Prohibition (drugs) Methamphetamine Tax Food and Drug Administration Traditional Chinese medicine Clinical depression Ibogaine Drug test Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Psychiatry Animal testing Obsessive-compulsive disorder Migraine Medicine Sexual addiction Domestic violence Traumatic brain injury Stomach cancer Narcotics Anonymous Microeconomics Methadone Anti-psychiatry Babylon 5 Bradley Nowell Veganism Duesberg hypothesis Folic acid National Institutes of Health Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Antidepressant Neurofeedback War on Drugs Word of Wisdom Waste management John Holmes (actor) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Divorce Mental illness United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Withdrawal LSD Dissociative identity disorder Inflation Barbara Hutton Lorazepam Narcissism Inhalant Malaria Theory of conduct Pornography addiction Rape Psoriasis Medical prescription AIDS in Africa Oxycodone Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Capitalism Homelessness Property (ownership right) Buprenorphine Obesity Goodness and value theory Food irradiation Transsexuality Involuntary commitment Post-traumatic stress disorder Adult attention-deficit disorder Chemotherapy
