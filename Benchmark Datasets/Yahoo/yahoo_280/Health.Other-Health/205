i have a question is acid reflux deadly what can i do to make it go away without going to the doctor thank you so much acid reflux is not deadly don't go to a doctor for this their solution is ridiculous and shows their ignorance of how the body works acid reflux is a term the drug companies have coined to put a label on a problem that is generating billion dollars a year to the drug companies the way it is portrayed is a farce and the drug companies know it and are promoting a solution that is not a cure but a perpetual drug solution that leads to many other problems and diseases as well as promoting more and more antacids to be taken on a regular basis once you understand what acid reflux is the solution is simple and can be cured forever it is not complicated but doctors pharmacists and drug companies are promoting antacids as if this is a cure it is not there is a home remedy that will help but you need some additional things that will solve the problem and create a cure for you people are suffering for no reason at all heart burn acid in digestion acid reflux is caused by the lack of stomach acid over of people over are suffering from in medical terms the condition of hypochloridia in simple terms this condition is due to the lack of stomach acid being in the stomach at the right time to digest food in the stomach as we age we produce less and less stomach acid by the time we are we are producing only about of the stomach acid we did when we were at to we are only producing about or less of what we did at this lack of stomach acid is also due to the fact we are eating cooked foods processed foods as well as age our bodies were designed to eat raw uncooked food when we eat cooked and or processed foods we use up the stomach acid at a faster rate in addition to us producing less stomach acid as we age when this lack of stomach acid condition exists the food we eat does not get digested and lactic acid is produced from the rotting fermenting food it is this lactic acid that causes the so called heartburn not stomach acid when anyone takes the advice of a health professional i guess that s why they are practicing medicine or a drug company on this issue and take antacids they are making the problem worse not better when the stomach ph is raised by the antacids the higher ph glob of rotting food then goes into the jejunum top of the small intestine close to the stomach where calcium magnesium and zinc are usually absorbed but the calcium magnesium and zinc can only be absorbed when the food is acidic from the stomach so guess what happens right the person becomes deficient in these minerals the problems that antacids create are loved by drug companies because the constipation diarrhea cramps and other diseases that come from the toxic undigested rotting food cause people to run out and buy more garbage drugs that create even more problems it does not stop there the fact that the rotting food is not acidic as it passes on through the intestines the higher ph does not trigger the alkali to be secreted further down the intestines and other nutrients do not get absorbed people are literally starving themselves of valuable nutrients a direct result of this is the larger waste line people develop this is probably the most blatant shameful example of what is happening to the american public from drug companies in our modern world the solution is so simple and very inexpensive the solution is to take a high quality betaine hcl after each meal and you will get no heartburn because the food is being digested now this process takes about minutes to happen if you also take an activator that contains nutrients like potassium you will remethylate cells and extend your life expectancy i also recommend a good digestive enzyme to be taken with each meal i purchase several bottles of the betaine hcl that will last me many months in relatively small quantities my cost is about for about capsules compare that cost with the drug company s solution the good thing is that it is not a chemical but a nutrient that your body utilizes naturally the home remedy is pink sea salt if you eat about teaspoon per day this will encourage your body to produce more stomach acid as well i strongly suggest you not go out and buy some pills of betaine hcl because those pills contain magnesium stearate and other excipients that keep the product from working well i purchase a dozen bottles at a time from www healthline cc not com because their products do not contain all the toxic tagalongs other pills do and you get the best results from them and i find them very reasonably priced i personally take after each meal to betaine hcl and to activator digestive enzyme during the meal and i never ever get acid indigestion problems everyone yes everyone whom i have suggested this to has solved their problem immediately you will be amazed at how effective this is and wonder why the drug companies doctors and pharmacies do not tell you about this you will also be amazed at how well you are digesting your food the energy you feel and how well you eliminate this is all because you will now be digesting your food and it won t end up as a spare tire around your rib cage good luck to you Adjustable gastric band H2-receptor antagonist Food Pharmaceutical company Ammonia Fecal
