equine uveitis have you or anyone you know ever had a horse with uveitis or moon blindness i had the vet come out the other day to see if my mare is pregnant or not thanks to a bunch of you rabid wolves who attack people when they ask questions and she diagnosed my mare with eru equine recurrent uveitis so my mare is like partially blind in her left eye and i was wondering if anyone has dealt with eru and how you dealt with it what you were able to do with the horse infected and what treatments works for your horses i need someone to talk to i am pretty devastated oh yeah mulereiner i am angry not for the folks who suggested i get her a vet to see if she could have complications but for those of you who told me i was unworthy of my horse because i had no idea if she was in foal or not oh and i only had the vet out to see her because she had an allergic reaction to penicillin i injected her because she has shipping flu called the vet out to take care of that and i did have a pregnancy test done because it was conveinient as of today her mammory vein is very prominent so i am pretty sure she is in foal i was to begin with but i will get the test back sometime this week thank you to the rest of you who answer my questions and actually help not send crappy spam my mare was years old and was totally blind due to uveitis it has been a long for me for the up to date treatment i can tell you that it took her over years to go blind in both eyes my mare rarely had pain and when she did i opted to bute her or give her banamine there seems to be a little controversary on which pain reliever better gets to the extremities both pain relievers did the job i liked the banamine because it's less hard on her stomach i did use several types of drops in her eyes and i was able to keep the uveitis as bay for many many years i will tell you that my mare did great with one eye blind and both blind i rode her when she was blind in one eye and she did find i put full blinders on her with one eye cut out for the good one i put those on for trail rides so she wouldn't injure the bad eye since she couldn't see the tree branches and such as soon as my mare went blind in the one eye i started to train her with voice commands and she did great when she did go competely blind we were prepared and that mare knew exactly what i was saying most people couldn't even tell that she was blind she would load lead still ride and knew her boundries so well even if i changed things around once she rolled and got caught in a fence and she stayed put with legs straight up in the air and perfectly still because i told her to i was able to take the boards out and cut the hot wire this was amazing proof to my hard work at training her by voice so worst case if it happens and it probably will not at least know that in my particular situation having a blind horse wasn't so bad i did take my mare to an equine teaching university with one of the top ten opthamologists in the country this was a long time ago so i am sure new techniques have developed at least i would hope so god bless and good luck wish i could have been more help edited keep a clean fly mask on her the blind eye is sensitive to insects sunlight and sunlight in the winter time too the eye will drain and you need to keep it clean i am sure you know this Horse Equine conformation Piccolo Junior Saga Milton H.
