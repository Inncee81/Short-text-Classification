what do you do if a horse is playful stubborn bucking no health problems or indication of bolting just no i dont wanna or how dare you be on my back and if it has alrady been lunged how would do you handle it im just curious and for my own reasons because every bucking fit etc ive been told is caused by health problems and ive never been told what to do if hes basically taking the p s i know exactlyhow you feel i too had a horse still have him that would try to buck me off every time i rode him literally i too had him checked out by a vet and nothing was physically wrong with him what happened is he was testing me and figuring out that he could get me off his back because that was the first time i ever had to deal with a bucking horse you can probably feel him getting ready to buck right so if i were you i would put an end to it right there turn him in circles and i mean as tight as you can go both ways because that makes it very difficult for the horse to buck or rear because he loses the power that he would need to buck then i would really start making him work by this i mean turns transitions back him take him over and through any obstacle you can imagine even if it is around a tree or barrel get him so he doesn't know what is coming next if he starts this i don't want to attitude i would go and get yourself a pair of spurs or a crop to get his attention and let him know that you aren't going to put up with his crap any longer but remember to only use these when necessary and don't overuse them either you only want to get his attention focused on you and what you want to do another thing you could try is if he does it but balks you the whole way you could make him do a bunch of other things as well and then return to what ever he doesn't like to do and then if he does what you want reward him and get off his back and be done for the day this is kind of like when a kid balks cleaning his room because he wants to go play basketball that is when the parent would say 'fine if you are going to give me this attitude then you are going to do the dishes vaccum do the laundry and clean your room before you go and do what you want to do with a horse like this i would only ride him for min tops if he does what you want him to do and you get what you wanted accomplished until he is really good and then you can ride him for however long you want to then he learns that his reward for a job well done is being done with his lesson but if he is being a pill make sure you always end things on a good note no matter how long it takes these are some of the things i did when i had a bucking horse and i'm proud to say that he hasn't bucked in years hope this helps Equine conformation Theory of conduct Milton H.
