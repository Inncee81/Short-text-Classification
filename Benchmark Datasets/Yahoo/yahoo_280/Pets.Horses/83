my horse pulls on me when i lunge him i own a year old mini gelding and i am currently lunging him every other day to get him in shape for an upcoming show normally he does very well and we have no problms but recently he has been pulling on me very hard he only does it one way clockwise and i don't understand what started to make him do it he will pull so hard on me that he actually bends his neck to the side i only weigh pounds while he weighs so it's hard for me to keep hold of him to make matters worse i have a bad wrist and it's not good to have him pull on it like that i can't afford a round pen or else i would get one so far i have tried to pull back on him when he pulls but that just makes him stop i have also tapped him with the whip when he does it but that just makes him pull harder i'm at a loss as to why he started to do this and how to fix it i know i'm not over working him because he doesn't even pant when i'm done if you have any idea of how to make him stop that would be great i have a mini gelding who likes to do the same thing he will do this just out of simple rebellion when i lunge him with the halter with the halter it doesn't bother him to pull on me but what i have found with him that works is either a chain over then nose or put a bit in his mouth put the chain through his halter around his nose and lunge as normal this way when he pulls the chain is a more direct and painful pressure so he will avoid pulling on it also simply put his bridle on with his bit in his mouth and put the lunge line through the ring of the near side and over the head to clip to the outside ring then lunge this way again the bit is a more adverse pressuer that he will be more likely to not want to cause on himself also if he's tending to try to run away out one side of the circle or even just pulling the whole way around remember that when you jerk on his head you must also give him a smack on the rear with the lunge whip this says give to the pressure but keep going forward simply continue this pull and smack pattern until he understands that you'll leave him alone when he quite pulling Equine conformation Dog training Professional wrestling holds Swingout Diving Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
