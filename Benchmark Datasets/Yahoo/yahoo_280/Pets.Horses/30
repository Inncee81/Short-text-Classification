any body on here from the saddlebreed industry i am going to show my five gaited horse at the world grand championship horse show in louisville ky does anyone have any tips if you are going to the world in any breed you should be the one giving us tips i don't know the show grounds or area but i would get on some websites for them and read the information about what is offered locally try to find a hotel nearby and book it now you will pay out the nose for it but it is worth it to be near the showgrounds take time out for the shopping as there will be lots of vendors selling things if you have never gone as a spectator try to get a map of the show grounds and get there as early as they will let you check in there may be an event being held there prior to yours so don't show up too early or you will be waiting to unload take your own bedding and feed to save money and assure the quality make a checklist of items you will need and reserve an extra stall for your tack bring along a chain and lock for it and curtains to put along the front so you can use it as a changing room take a lot of pictures and enjoy your horse while making new friends don't get imtimidated by the big stables you paid your money and you have just as much a right to be there i hope this is what you had in mind i assume at that level you won't be needing riding or showing tips probably the most important thing is to remember it is just another show and have a great time Equine conformation Horse gait Insurance RuneScape quests Seabiscuit Skateboarding trick Tennessee Walker Horse Poker jargon Betting (poker) RuneScape locations Christiansborg Palace Let's Make a Deal Bulk vending Sumo American Saddlebred Mad Money Professional wrestling match types Social rule 1957 World Series Professional wrestling slang Theory of conduct Gordon Banks Time Out of Mind Muslim ibn Aqeel Sydney Riot of 1879 Burning Man Legal research CPU cache My Little Pony Show jumping She Loves You Coming of Age (TNG episode) Credit card Shawn Michaels Paragliding Sears Holdings Corporation Cruising (maritime) Major League Baseball television contracts Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories StarCraft: Uprising Ocean's Twelve Columbine High School massacre Dressage Spaceward, Ho!
