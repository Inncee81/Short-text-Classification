is this a confidence issue when i am jumping my h cob i like to go at a slow rythmic pace but when i am riding with my instructor he is really good he always says to go forward but i feel like i am going very very fast and out of control and feel a bit uncomfterble doing it however i get better spots and i have a nicer round around the course i jump ' when i go slow my pace we get ok spots at the fences sometimes really small close and sometimes really really big when i watch the video of me going fast i really dont looks that fast as it seems when im riding him please help if it is a confidence thing please give me tips to get over this it is a confidence issue when your instructor tells you to go forward that means with a controlled strong carriage that gives you and your horse confidence if you aren't ready to go at jumps confidently you should start again at a lower level and focus on you and your horse's controlled strong approach uno come back to ground work with him until you are confident with controlling him at speed work on his forward motion collectively and you both will gain confidence Equine conformation Horse gait Aerial (dance move) Horse Skateboarding trick Show hunter Quake III Arena Seabiscuit Milton H.
