i ws looking at buying a percheron tb cross i ride dressage what do you think hes a yr stallion really sweet and willing to learn he stands at around hands right now i show first level dressage with my current horse and im looking at getting a new horse to train myself i was just wondering if he would make a good dressage horse or not a perch tb cross would make a perfectly fine dressage horse but if it comes down to the line it wont beat a warmblood warmbloods especially german bred ones are built for dressage they naturally come onto the bit easily and have free lateral movements my tb mare has been ridiculously difficult to collect sadly without a warmblood in dressage you often feel like you have to earn your points even more i'm not saying at all they cant win i saw a fjord cross win nd level at championships last year but it definetly is easier on a warmblood if you're not absolutely sure wait and try out some more you know when you and a horse click because you realize you just cant live without them in your life it makes it so worth it d Horse Arabian horse Equine conformation Dressage Charisma (horse) Horse gait Lipizzan Connemara pony Trakehner Hanoverian (horse) American Quarter Horse Eventing Show hunter Holstein (horse) Warmblood Thoroughbred Akhal-Teke Andalusian horse Horse tack Equitation Oldenburg (horse) Noseband Friesian horse Tour de France Horse show Kinsky horse Obedience training Show jumping American Saddlebred Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Lou Gehrig Domestication of the horse Dog training Sunday Silence Milton H.
