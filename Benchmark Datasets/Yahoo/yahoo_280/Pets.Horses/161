horse club hoof help i have a horse with whose front right hoof is clubbed and her shoe keeps on coming off when it starts to get loose like today we take it off along with her other front hoof to balance it off but i've noticed that her sole on her club hoof protrudes further than her hoof wall making it touch the ground i'm worried this will cause concussion problems in her legs and hooves so should i still ride her i'll only be riding in a field and the ground is quite firm with a layer of grass to soften it but i'm still worried will it damage her hoof even if i don't ride her if she's just grazing in the field ps the farrier is so busy at the moment we have to wait for a while for him to come and sort it out i wouldn't ride her without shoes i would also consider getting a farrier whose shoes stay on and is prepared to come on and fix his shoes when they come loose see if you can find someone that does corrective shoeing because that can really help the shape and form of a club foot Horseshoe Equine conformation Laminitis Horse gait Evolution of the Horse Dressage Horse Glossary of climbing terms Shoe Shaggy dog story Battles of Lexington and Concord Marching band Volleyball High-heeled shoe Show hunter Skateboarding trick Skateboarding Show jumping Chaps The Adventure of the Priory School Evidence of evolution Softball Laws of cricket Fast bowling Dog agility Comanche Mattress Curling Jersey Devil Cricket Clydesdale (breed) Desertification My Little Pony The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Punt (boat) Jon Secada Trot (horse gait) Sock Mercury Atlas 6 Pliocene Appaloosa 1957 World Series Ostrich Arabian horse Glossary of ballet terms Doom enemies Breaststroke Tennessee Walker Snowboard Claw Tire Saint Nicholas First English Civil War Naruto jutsu Bicycle frame Charles Goodyear Bicycle Loafers Wood carving STS-114 Unclean animals Paragliding Seabiscuit Backstroke Recumbent bicycle Airport Knife Glacier Foot Sleipnir Irish dance Football (soccer) Dragon Booster American football Undergarment The Beatles discography Trapping Shoe fetishism Walking Gliding Sport rowing Climbing equipment Piccolo Junior Saga Disneyland Grand Teton National Park Ben Johnson (athlete) Tank Field hockey Shodo Fenway Park Land mine Diving Shofar Golf Four square Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Battle of Vicksburg Sorraia
