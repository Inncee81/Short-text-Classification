irritating horse buyers i'm trying to sell my horse and have had the same people come to look at him times every time they come out they change the time around on me last minute and take well over an hour riding and playing with my horse last time they came out they brought out the kid they are buying the horse for and of her friends to ride on the fifth time they brought up price and how the other horse they were looking at was only so they wanted me to lower my price to that my horse is priced firmly at i'm in no hurry to sell they are still considering my horse and want to come out and see him agian my horse has been amazing for the kid and all her friends the friends cant ride at all i don't understand why they need to come out again i know they are serious about buying a horse and they deffinitly have the money how do i deal with these people i really dont have time to waste on giving the kids free pony rides they need to make a decision i really like the kid that would be buying my horse it would be a great home for him i understand they are taking their time because it is their first horse but is it just me or is trial rides just excessive tire kickers and they are all getting free time and rides on your horse if they are coming in at less than asking they don't have the cash and are wasting your time i'd say the next time that they call that you have someone else coming to view him so he won't be available and that the price is firm or whatever you want if they think someone else is interested they might increase their offer and stating that you are firm on the price should send a clear message you are putting yourself at risk every time they ride your horse in case they get hurt i'd cut that one off right now it's time for them to put up or shut up Supply and demand Microeconomics Privatization Monetary policy Arbitrage Rational pricing Enron Corporation Bond Poker jargon RuneScape economy Deflation (economics) PE ratio Mergers and acquisitions Equine conformation Ford Motor Company Warren Buffett The Amazing Race Keynesian economics Capitalism Diseconomies of scale Price discrimination RKO Pictures Corporate finance Economy of the United States Mattress Illegal drug trade Hyperinflation Disney's California Adventure Stock Jon Secada Sport utility vehicle Seabiscuit Mutual fund Say's law Garth Brooks Economics Shaggy dog story Mortgage Investment bank Option Futures contract Tour de France Wal-Mart Externality $ale of the Century IBM PC compatible MapleStory Muslim ibn Aqeel American Broadcasting Company Dot-com Wyatt Earp Criticisms of socialism Free trade Inventory My Little Pony Gambling MMORPG CBS Predatory lending Betting (poker) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus LiveJournal Derivative (finance) The Catcher in the Rye Toyota Prius Monopoly Technical analysis 1986 National League Championship Series Lance Armstrong Tax Finance Closed-end fund Advertising Health insurance Commodity Sydney Riot of 1879 Only Fools and Horses Short selling Publicly funded medicine 1957 World Series Security (finance) Supply-side economics Bank WTVJ The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Auction James T.
