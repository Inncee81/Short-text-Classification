can i make my own saddle pad i want to know if it is a good idea to make a saddle pad right now i only have this dinky little blanket that is probably very uncomfortable for my horse anyways how would i do it what type of material should i use couldn't i just buy some wool and cover it with material i also have a saddle fitting issue could getting a thick saddle pad help i can afford one i would rather make it for a project a saddle pad can never fully compensate for a poorly fitting saddle if the saddle fits properly you won't need a thick pad to keep him comfortable you can get a simple shaped fleece pad or a square quilted pad for pretty cheap and that's all you should ever need saddle fitting is something you shouldn't skimp on it's like someone asking you to wear shoes that don't fit right and saying that thicker socks will cure the problem your feet will hate you in the end for wearing them and your horse's back isn't going to be happy with you after riding in a saddle that doesn't fit just ride bareback or borrow a saddle until you can buy a saddle that fits properly Mattress Equine conformation Strap-on dildo Horse tack Bicycle frame Cowboy Diving suit High-heeled shoe Sanitary towel Shoe Undergarment Tire Sock Brassiere Bicycle Horseshoe Textile manufacturing Seismic retrofit Japanese tea ceremony Western Saddle Textile manufacturing terminology Climbing equipment Chair Mouse (computing) Tank Violin Stirrup Clothing Sample chess game Glossary of climbing terms Snowboard Upholstery Bicycle helmet Chariot Double bass Guitar Bull riding Shaggy dog story Floyd Rose Archery Joint Theory of conduct Welding Condom Stocking Gas metal arc welding Bicycle brake systems M16 (rifle) Free trade Ed, Edd n Eddy Bullet Comanche Milton H.
