how do i get my horse to stop throwing his head i have a horse who throws his head when i ask him to back or sidepass i know it is not that he has a sore tooth because he does it whether i am using a bit or a bosal how can i correct this without using a training fork or an overcheck my horse is a year old quarter horse gelding i use a tom thumb bit on him he has an appointment to get his teeth floated in a few days but he only throws his head when i ask him to back or sidepass i also know that it has nothing to do with his training as he has had extensive training and was at one point in his career a very successful show horse also he just began doing this a few weeks ago im going to throw this out there cause it hasnt been mentioned yet when was the last time you had your horses teeth floated is he young enough that he may have had his wolfe teeth forgotten i know several that they just didnt errupt till later and at that point it may have just left the owners mind no ones fault it just happens i had a friend with a year old well trained morgan gelding that all of a sudden he started with the head tossing and it was his wolfe teeth regular floating sometimes twice a year can become the norm as a horse gets older and if you randomly tie a horse down when hes in physical pain your not only going to cause him to act out more demonstratively but your risking your own neck look for the cause first i dont have much of an issue with a tie down if its used properly not as a quick fix Horse tack Equine conformation Horse Piccolo Junior Saga New York Giants Sin City First aid Pittsburgh Steelers Volleyball Dog training Arabian horse Sandy Koufax Cleveland Browns Coin flipping Wyatt Earp Professional wrestling throws Dog Tenshinhan San Francisco 49ers Domestic rabbit Weight training Professional wrestling holds Tennessee Walker Doom enemies Tour de France Battles of Lexington and Concord National Football League Lore Tooth Diving Japan Cup Super Bowl XXVII Northerly The Family from One End Street Scientology beliefs and practices Trapping Milton H.
