does it matter which feet are shod i am getting a horse this week and i was wondering if it makes a difference which feet are shod front two back two all or none my horses feet are shod on the front two i was wondering if you should get all of them done if you want to do jumping better or what does having just the back ones make it easier to do dressage or something for example or are they just put on there for the sake of it i will be doing hard work on my new horse hacking out alot and alot of jumping xc and schooling lots of comps etc if i do this kind of work should i get all feet shod please help ask this question to anyone with horses and you will get a million and one different answers ask a million and one farriers and they too will give you a million and one different answers horses were born with what they need we the horse owners are responsible for making their feet so bad that they need shoes to protect them there are only a few reasons that any horse needs shoes reason one that the horse wears away more foot then it can grow which will lead to lameness reason two reining in which sliders will need to be placed on the horses hind feet to allow it to slide reason three professional barrel racers that run on trash ground may need them to prevent injury to their horses although the ground in most arenas have been improved to the point that reason three is almost obsolete before booing this answer i challange every horse owner to research the barefoot trim on the internet and then give your opinion i barrel race and have horses one of which was foundered before she was given to me prior to barefoot trimming every one of my horses had issues with their feet one had a new abcess every week one wore away more foot then she would grow i still never had her shod one had a deformed hoof one had a very bad toe crack the list goes on and on after being trimmed the barefoot way for over two years none of my horses have taken a lame step the foundered horse that was given away because the former owner did not want to deal with her she is perfectly sound and i have the x rays to prove it she had been shod by a very good farrier for years with no improvement the bottom line is that most horse owners dont know why their horses have shoes on them most were bought that way so the new owner assumes that the horse needs shoes chances are that the owner before the previous owner did the same thing there are many hunter jumpers race horses barrel horses polo horses and endurance horses that are barefoot and do their jobs better then horses with shoes if you knew the damage that shoes do to your horses feet then you too would have them pulled here are some links for you to read if you want to some of the best horsemen in the business are barefoot for example clinto anderson lets see yall boo him Horse Horseshoe Horse gait Volleyball Dressage Horse tack Skateboarding trick Arabian horse Laminitis High-heeled shoe Fast bowling Shoe Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Aerial (dance move) Cowboy M16 (rifle) Drag racing New York Giants Diving Parachute Evolution of the Horse Curling 1957 World Series Babe Ruth Show jumping Irish dance Tennessee Walker Thoroughbred Dog agility Handloading Glossary of climbing terms Mario Theory of conduct Dog training Paul Is Dead Poker jargon Seabiscuit Hard disk Avenue Q Oakland Athletics Paintball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 GLOCK Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Toronto Raptors Callus Figure skating Milton H.
