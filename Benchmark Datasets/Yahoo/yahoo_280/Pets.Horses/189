my friends horse got loose in the stallion pen my friend's horse was in her pasture and she was in heat she was in teh pasture next the the stallion and during the night he kicked the gate open and she went in there we found her in the morning with marks in the same place on both sides of her and a hude swell mark on her shoulder what do you think happened we have no clue possabily bred to it's pretty obvious that she was covered mounted by the stallion and very possibly bred but whether or not she is pregnant is something the vet will have to determine in a few weeks the swelling is from where she was bitten by the stallion as he was holding her still for breeding in the future your friend should be more mindful to keep her mare away from an intact stallion while she's in heat Horse Lipizzan Karabakh Charisma (horse) Equine conformation Trakehner Thoroughbred Morgan horse Oldenburg (horse) Pony of the Americas Akhal-Teke Guinea pig Selective breeding Hackney (horse) Domestication of the horse Arabian horse John Lennon Smarty Jones Holstein (horse) Gray (horse) Oasis (band) Hinny Connemara pony Chocobo Sunday Silence Welsh Cob (Section D) The Lone Ranger Social rule Mule Bullfighting Przewalski's Horse Horses of Middle-earth Seabiscuit Hanoverian (horse) Selle Fran__ais Pegasus Tennessee Walker United Kingdom horse-racing Welsh pony of cob type (Section C) Livestock Welsh pony (Section B) Welsh mountain pony (Section A) Dressage Harness racing Dole Gudbrandsdal Clydesdale (breed) Rugby union Keeneland Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Japan Cup Svadilfari Trish Stratus Avalanche Obstetrics EastEnders Donkey Cat Hay Canadian Football League Jean Grey Minor Harry Potter Beasts Kimi Finster Pony Eddie Guerrero Barb (horse) Willie Nelson The Black Stallion American Saddlebred Sleipnir Dartmoor pony Opportunity rover Swingout Cattle Jeopardy!
