how do you train your horse to come to his name i own a y o paint gelding named howdy and i was wondering how i can teach him to come to his name when i call him thanx i did this with one horse that i got tired of chasing down in the field this is much easier with a horse that's really food motivated work in a round pen or a paddock somewhere where he is loose but can't get too far away from you have a bag of small yummy treats that he can eat quickly bits of apple and carrot work for most horses the yummier the better keep an eye out for nippy behavior since you are using treats a firm no and turning away helps keep that under control don't use his name for this trick since you say that all the time pick a word or a whistle i don't whistle very well so i used come in say the word and hand him a treat do it again do it again take a couple of steps back and say the word again when he comes to you looking to see if you have more treats give him a treat and a pat repeat until you think you're going to lose your mind slowly working out further and further away give him the word wait until he walks over and give him the treat if he stops responding move in close and start over if he is practically crawling into your lap and won't move away long enough for you to try it take a break never give him a treat if he's being rude or pushy that's just teaching him to bully you for treats make sure to stop on a good note you'll need to do this a couple of different days in the pen and make sure he really has the idea don't try it in the field until you're sure he's going to respond try from about twenty feet away the first time then forty it will take a couple of weeks but you get a really reliable response this way i would stand on the fence and yell allen come in and the beast would come thundering in made all of my friends very jealous Dog training Horse Tag Social rule Indianapolis 500 Aerial (dance move) 1957 World Series Piccolo Junior Saga Russian joke Shaggy dog story Battles of Lexington and Concord New York Giants The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Spidey Super Stories Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Apprentice 2 Wyatt Earp Customs and etiquette of Japan Fecal incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2000 Australian Grand Prix Time Out of Mind One Piece minor characters Dragon Booster Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Equine conformation Ben Johnson (athlete) Hamster Seabiscuit Little Britain Eddie Guerrero Skateboarding trick Paintball Timon and Pumbaa Japanese tea ceremony Glossary of partner dance terms Captain Thunderbolt Shining Time Station Dog agility Norway national football team Ocean's Twelve The Invisibles Spanking Columbine High School massacre Stuttering Highway 61 Revisited Marching band The Contender (television series) Sin City Death Note Knots Landing Swingout Dairy Cleveland Browns Fencing Contredanse Father's Day (Doctor Who) Sub-Zero Comanche Baseball Ron and Fez Kender Scientology beliefs and practices Ranma __ characters New York City Subway Glossary of American football Ayrton Senna Jon Secada Alexander Technique EastEnders Logo programming language The Jim Rome Show Full Metal Panic?
