how can i persuade my parents to get me another horse my parents bought me a year old mare years ago about years ago she got in an accident and hurt her back and hip so i cant ride her they know that im reasponsible but how can i persuade them more i really enjoy riding and would love a horse that i can ride try selling the you have as a companion horse or donate it to a rescue as a companion horse seems like your parents might just not have the money for another horse talk to them about it and see if that is the problem if so that should fix it i dont know where you live but i posted a question a couple days ago about a free horse if the problem is they dont want to keep horses then get permission to donate the other horse if the problem is the cost of a new horse there are a lot out there that need homes that are free or super cheapi just sold both broke and young yr old was a bred mare neither one did i sell for more then check out equine com they have a free horse link some of the horses are not free as in they are just free leased but still that might help also how old are you and where are the horse horses kept if boarding might be a problem and they might just be worried if your hitting the teen years that you will out grow it youmight try taking lessons at a local barn Garth Brooks Equine conformation Selective breeding Only Fools and Horses Spanking Link (Legend of Zelda) Lipizzan Canadian Pacific Railway One Tree Hill (TV series) Sin City Animal Crossing Oakland Athletics Horse gait Driver's license Arabian horse Jennifer Lopez Child sexuality Neil Young Milton H.
