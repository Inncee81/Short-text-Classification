spooky mare i have owned my mare for over two years now shes a year old cobx she is good in most ways manners etc but she is terribly spooky on the road large vehicles such as lorries and tractors or cars with trailers etc present a big problem she reels backward when she sees them coming spins and tries to run which is obviously very dangerous she just goes into a blind panic and is genuinely terrified considering i have done around of my riding with her on the road for the past two years i would have thought she would have settled in traffic at least a little but she hasnt this is presenting a huge problem as the only roads around the yard to ride on or the roads i have to ride on to get to a bridleway are country lanes and tractors etc are going through there all the time she is often grazed in a field next to a road which i would have also thought would get her used to traffic but doesnt seem to have made much difference any ideas of how i can get her better on the road i often ride with a friend on the road and her horse is perfect in traffic my horse watches him walk past it but it doesnt seem to occur to her that if he can do it she can do it like i said she goes into a blind panic i think she may be a bit claustrophobic because when i pull into a driveway with lots of room to let the tractor or whatever pass she is alot calmer than when she doesnt have much room i dont know alot about her history so i think there may be a chance she has had a bad experience on the road thanks to all for your answers xx well sounds like she is looking for something to give her an excuse to bolt do you ride her daily when a horse stands around for days at a time they get fresh when they just want to play and run they don't want to be serious and safe if you don't ride daily i would suggest giving her a short warm up in the round pen if you have access to one before you make a trip into traffic horse vs car accidents are tragic be safe and until this problem is resolved i would stay out of traffic unless you are hand walking her with a stud chain for leverage this step should be done very slowly and carefully taking the horse only to the edge of the comfort zone and talking gently rubbing her for reassurance there is only one of you and you can't be replaced same for your horse plus you could hurt someone else in their car horses are in nature creatures that would be preyed upon and depending on your horses fight or flight response the traffic bikes and other things could be deemed as threats causing the bolting desensitizing at home with whatever you have available might help but like one of the other posters said seeing the same object over and over made no difference whats that all about i drive my tractor by the horses almost everyday and when the bucket is high one of the mares freaks no matter what but if the bucket is down she doesn't respond at all the horse next to her walks up and watches as i pass by and they are best friends so the buddy theory may or may not work you have to be careful in traffic that's all i'm saying i landed on the pavement many times and luckily was not hurt badly or killed but i have had two friends who were killed while riding on the streets one her horse ran away with her in a field and fell when it hit the pavement killing his rider and it ran back to the stables while her year old daughter watched the other a very street savvy horse rider jumped in front of a big diesel rig killing his rider and leaving nothing but a scratch or two on him so be careful out there that's all i'm saying note came back to this thread and found i had thumbs down for my answer i have to say that bums me out i don't see safety first as being a thumbs down earning answer oh well i was and am going to add a bit more to my answer Horse Shaggy dog story Vehicular cycling Sport utility vehicle Motorcycle Hitchhiking Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
