having your horse trained i've considered buying this filly well a mare she just turned three in march mayish time but she hasn't been broke gentled to ride problem lol but she has been handled since she was born alot and has been halter trained and ponied around on trails have you had any personal experience with sending your horse to a professional trainer for or minus days was it terribly expensive and how if your horse well trained those questions probably sound dumb but this is something i've considered doing i want opinons from people who have done so or know people who have done so you don't know till yah ask thanks well if she is completely green it will probably require more than days there are some trainers that specialize more in breaking and some more in what i call polishing you can talk to someone who breaks horses and they sometimes will charge one fee to get it done sometimes they do it by the time required for them to do it i know where i am now in cattle country the local dressage hunter community sends their horses to this one individual who is actually a cattle farmer but uses horses for ranching he charges one flat fee per horse i'm not sure what it is though it will depend on the quality of the trainer and what they deem their services worth the thing about training is when you need it you don't have much of a choice when it comes to polish i've seen people charge as little as mo and as much as although i'm sure depending on skill level the sky is the limit generally as someone else mentioned they will require you to board in their facility or charge an additional fee for visiting your property if you are not going to be able to find someone who specifically breaks horses talk to your prospective trainers and ask how many horses they have started from youth you want to be very sure that your horse is not the guinea pig the other thing about training is that you can't look at it in time limits each horse is different your filly may take months to reach the same training level that only took another horse they all learn at a different rate and pose a new challenge each time when you talk to a prospective polish trainer ask them what their method is what their schedule is like do they work the horse daily do they gradually build up the exercises do they have a set schedule for every ride for example when i ride i warm up for minutes walking only for the first work on old things for minutes work on new things for minutes then relax the horse and walk out talk to them about challenge horses they've had you want to know that if something arises they can deal with it best of luck Horse Weight training Equine conformation Horse breaking Cowboy Arabian horse Education in the People's Republic of China Dressage Cable television GED Milton H.
