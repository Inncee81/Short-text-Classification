what are the causes of communication disorders what are some teaching strategies for students with communication disorders communication disorders include problems related speech language and auditory processing communication disorders may range from simple sound repetitions such as stuttering to occasional misarticulation of words and complete inability to use speech and language for communications aphasia some causes of communication disorders include hearing loss neurological disorders brain injury mental retardation drug abuse physical impairments such as cleft lip or palate vocal abuse or misuse emotional or psychiatric disorders and developmental disorders frequently however the cause is unknown it is estimated one in every americans of all ages races and genders have experienced or lived with some type of communication disorder including speech language and hearing disorders nearly million children under the age of have a speech or language disorder there are many potential causes of communication impairment the most common is mental retardation other causes include hearing impairment add learning disabilities autism schizophrenia cerebral palsy physical disability cleft lip and palate or malformations of the mouth or nose significant behavior or emotional problems including deficits in social skills vocal cord injury cri du chat syndrome gilles de la tourette syndrome poorly fitting dentures alcohol intoxication neurological disorders and diseases head trauma alzheimer's disease stroke transient ischemic attack the best treatment is prevention and early intervention parents should be aware of developmental milestones the most intensive period of speech and language development for humans is during the first three years of life a period when the brain is developing and maturing these skills appear to develop best in a world that is rich with sounds sights and consistent exposure to the speech and language of others there is increasing evidence suggesting that there are critical periods for speech and language development in infants and young children this means that the developing brain is best able to absorb a language any language during this period the ability to learn a language will be more difficult and perhaps less efficient or effective if these critical periods are allowed to pass without early exposure to a language the beginning signs of communication occur during the first few days of life when an infant learns that a cry will bring food comfort and companionship the newborn also begins to recognize important sounds in his or her environment the sound of a parent or voice can be one important sound as they grow infants begin to sort out the speech sounds phonemes or building blocks that compose the words of their language research has shown that by months of age most children recognize the basic sounds of their native language as the speech mechanism jaw lips and tongue and voice mature an infant is able to make controlled sound this begins in the first few months of life with cooing a quiet pleasant repetitive vocalization by months of age an infant usually babbles or produces repetitive syllables such as ba ba ba or da da da babbling soon turns into a type of nonsense speech jargon that often has the tone and cadence of human speech but does not contain real words by the end of their first year most children have mastered the ability to say a few simple words children are most likely unaware of the meaning of their first words but soon learn the power of those words as others respond to them by months of age most children can say eight to ten words by age most are putting words together in crude sentences such as more milk during this period children rapidly learn that words symbolize or represent objects actions and thoughts at this age they also engage in representational or pretend play at ages and a child's vocabulary rapidly increases and she begins to master the rules of language if you have concerns about your child's speech or language development you should talk to your family doctor your doctor may decide to refer you to a speech language pathologist a health professional trained to evaluate and treat people who have speech language voice or swallowing disorders including hearing impairment that affect their ability to communicate the speech language pathologist will talk to you about your child's communication and general development she will also evaluate your child with special speech and language tests a hearing test is often included in the evaluation because a hearing problem can affect speech and language development depending upon the test results the speech language pathologist may suggest activities for home to stimulate speech and language development these activities may include reading to your child regularly speaking in short sentences using simple words so that your child can successfully imitate you or repeating what your child says using correct grammar or pronunciation for example if your child says ball baybo you can respond with yes the ball is under the table this allows you to demonstrate more accurate speech and language without actually correcting your child which can eventually make speaking unpleasant for him or her the speech language pathologist may also recommend group or individual therapy or suggest further evaluation by other health professionals such as an audiologist or a developmental psychologist speech training is an involved and time consuming endeavor that can have profound results with consistent treatment speech training by a speech pathologist may include helping an individual with articulation disorders to learn proper production of speech sounds with voice disorders to develop proper control of the vocal and respiratory systems for correct voice production who stutters to cope with the disorders and to increase the amount of fluent speech with aphasia to relearn language and speech skills to understand their disorder and to help the individual achieve more fluent communication in educational social and vocational settings speech and language pathologists typically provide professional services in public and private schools hospitals rehabilitation centers nursing care facilities community clinics college and universities private practice state and local health departments state and federal government agencies centers for developmentally disabled research laboratories
