what can you do to stop this from happening to special ed after spending up big on updating special education support units for children with intellectual disabilities we now find that the state government is trying to close down special ed support units they do this by what i think is an underhand method by putting special ed support units under review knowing that while a special ed support unit is under review it can't accept new enrollments thus giving the government the ability to say that they are closing these units due to low numbers knowing full well that parents with kids are trying to no avail to enroll their special need kids but can't because the unit is under review the state government has decided in it's armchair wisdom that integration is the way to go and is obviously trying to force it to happen considering the amazing job that special ed teachers and their aids do with these kids it is obviously a bad idea just ask any teacher parent or special ed student special ed kids not only have to be taught their abcs but they have to be taught living and social skills they are also put in supported work experience programs which are invaluable for their future a lot of special ed students have physical disabilities which require the support unit to look after i e some students have to be toileted and or bathed the students also enjoy the support of their fellow classmates who have disabilities and to integrate them into main stream classes would only alienate them besides what teacher in the main stream could possibly have the time to teach main stream kids and look after the needs of child with intellectual disabilities and it's associated problems the special ed support units have been doing an amazing and difficult job with special need kids and their parents so why try and fix something that's already working even a simpleton could see that integration is an amazingly stupid thing to do my question is mr prime minister is simple can you stop this ludicrous thing from happening don't underestimate the power of organized dissent you have a number of groups who will be gravely affected by this policy the parents of students with special needs the teachers who will have to take on yet more responsibilities in the integrated classrooms the former teachers and aides for special education the educational psychologists who test and make recommendations for children with special needs and adults with disabilities who have had experience in the school system an organized group of parents can make a huge impact through a letter writing campaign a few very angry parents may get the attention of the news media a teacher who is fed up and planning to leave the system may make a parting statement that will get the attention to this issue that is needed there are some parents however that do want their children mainstreamed for their own reasons and accommodation for these families needs to be made one other hope might be to get close to one of these decision makers through the social network by trying to find someone sympathetic to the cause perhaps someone in the government who has been frank about having a child with special needs you have a lot to lose it is a sickening situation so why not go for speaking out and organized protest Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Intelligent design movement Education Homeschooling Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Autism Special education GED Center for Science and Culture Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Teach the Controversy Extreme Programming No Child Left Behind Act Education reform Unemployment Affirmative action Graduate school Autism rights movement Education in Japan Education in Romania Education in Malaysia Infantilism School choice Education in India Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in Hong Kong Tripartite System Education in Portugal Charter school Alexander Technique Education in Germany Fathers' rights Down syndrome Section 28 Experiential education Abortion Equal Protection Clause Brown v.
