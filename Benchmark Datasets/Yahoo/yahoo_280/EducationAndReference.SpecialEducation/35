hello my son's speech therapist just told us that he has a problem with pronouns are there any creative ways to help my child at home my son is three months shy of his fifth birthday he has expressive speech of a three year old and receptive speech is delayed about six months and could possibly be normal he has some social delay due to speech delay thanks apple betty we're working on prepositions what about pronouns he she i me etc the best way to work on speech omissions is to have the child repeat what he said with the missing part of speech or sound in place when he misses the word or uses another word improperly in it's place i am guessing he is using nouns to fill in for the pronouns repeat what he said back to him with the corrections in place then have him repeat it back to you if you read together point out the pronouns or place more of an emphasis on them you can also develop flash cards on one side place a photo or picture of a person or object along with the noun used to name it on the reverse write the pronoun that could be used in it's place make a game of it you can even make a full set of cards one with the photos one with the pronouns and have him play a matching game start with a small grouping no more than five pairs and increase it as he gets the hang of it finally ask the speech therapist what methods she uses with him to address the issue and apply them at home Spanish pronouns Bulgarian language Non-native pronunciations of English English plural Gender Finnish grammar Pronoun Capitalization Czech language T-V distinction English grammar Relative clause Esperanto grammar Meaning Mao (game) Japanese honorifics Spanish language Slovak language Proto-Indo-European language Dual (grammatical number) Liaison German grammar CPU cache Korean language Swedish language Noun Arabic grammar Chinese grammar Figure of speech Spanish grammar Hearing impairment Grammatical gender Catalan grammar Taiwanese (linguistics) Spanish verbs Irish syntax Extreme Programming Stuttering Shit Brazilian Portuguese Varieties of Arabic God and gender Singlish Tamil language Spanish nouns Kapampangan language Hiberno-English Speech synthesis Latin declension Disputed English grammar Modem Laal language Sesotho language Ojibwe language Vulgar Latin Irish morphology Table tennis Japanese language Vietnamese language CPU design Poker jargon Part of speech Password (game) Inflection Gender differences in spoken Japanese Contract bridge Hebrew language Preposition Drama Japanese titles Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Finnish language American and British English differences $ale of the Century Aphasia Italian grammar Gender-neutral pronoun Part-of-speech tagging Password Grammar RISC Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Indian English Quebec French Betting (poker) Transsexuality Wheel of Fortune Chenoua language Scottish Gaelic language Portuguese language
