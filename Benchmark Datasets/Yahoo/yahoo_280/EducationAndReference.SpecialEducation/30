to say somebody with learning difficulty is special needs is political correctness i think political correctness tries to remove bias from our language eg law inforcement officer instead of saying police man or police woman the word special has traditionally been applied to someone with superior and or extra ordinary ability it's use in describing people as having special needs who are mentally handicapped and often far less capable than the non handicapped is political correctness my sympathies jeanimus despite political correctness and perhaps because of it even people with all kinds of mental or physical handicaps are being put under the umbrella term of special needs i worked months in a residential house for mentally handicapped people all very very different they were defined as special needs even one of the staff had a child with special needs the child was profoundly disabled mentally and physically could do nothing nothing for herself while one of the residents in the house could catch a bus to town and back and look after herself but was unable to work while another resident had such manic behavior you had to protect him from the public and visa versa not that i think special needs is at all laughable but i just thought up something funny in relationship to miss use of the word special what if you went to a theatre and before the preformance a presenter told the audience and now for this very special preformance by and when the performer came out they were physically and mentally incapable of giving a performance the confusion in the use of the word special would leave an audience stunned and irate what's in a name a rose by any other name smells just as sweet or something like that its about sensitivities and not offending or labelling the affected or the inflicted english is a very strange language in my native language we call a spade a spade and don't keep changing names for it what is more important for us is that we acknowledge the condition and embrace and accomodate it into society political correctness is not therefore an issue change languages Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mental illness Mental retardation Disability Autism Transgender Philosophy of language Learning disability Franz Boas Rape Transsexuality Child sexual abuse Asperger syndrome Abortion debate Dyslexia Postmodernism Pedophilia 21 July 2005 London bombings Social rule Vulcan (Star Trek) Involuntary commitment Trademark Theory of conduct Models of deafness Homophobia Civil rights College Traumatic brain injury Mental Health Act 1983 Left-handed Second language acquisition Eugenics Animal rights Shamanism Divorce Hypnosis Human sexual behavior Autism rights movement Cultural relativism Motion picture rating system Homosexuality and transgender Coercion Domestic violence Gender-neutral language Abortion God Emperor of Dune Appeal Narcissism Brainwashing Milton H.
