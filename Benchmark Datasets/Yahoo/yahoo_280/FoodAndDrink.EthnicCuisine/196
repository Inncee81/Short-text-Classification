would you rent a dog there is a new organization in california called flexipets where you can rent pets what do you think about that i was just talking about that last week with friends there is a place in odaiba beach place in tokyo that rents dogs by the hour i saw a lot of families taking these dogs for a walk they could attatch two leashes so the kids could walk the dog too we were really divided about whether it is a good thing or awful on the dogs the dogs seemed to be mostly beagles or similar perhaps because they are easygoing and sociable they seemed quite happy and fairly indifferent to the humans at the other end of the leash we just hoped that they had good relationships with the people who looked after them at the shop perhaps it s better than people buying a dog and then neglecting it especially for families with kids we had to laugh there is a dog cafe just next door to the shop talk about a way to make extra money Dog training Social rule Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents Dog agility Friends Rent (musical) Garfield Neighbours About a Boy Nintendogs The Catcher in the Rye Socialization The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Jiddu Krishnamurti Pitaten Humphrey Bogart Obedience training Dog Leash Peanuts Odaiba Care Bears Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Our Gang Nicomachean Ethics 1957 World Series Invader Zim Snoopy Renting Paranoia Agent Rich Mullins Theory of conduct Ferret Surplus value Trailer Park Boys Economics Housing cooperative George Burns Doug Microeconomics Meat Loaf Oplan Bojinka EastEnders Guadalupe Mountains National Park American individualist anarchism American Dragon: Jake Long Family Guy Jack London Anarchism and capitalism Sinfest Bradley Nowell It's Walky!
