kosher non jewish can you not be jewish and still be kosher i've just always wanted to know of course but keeping kosher is not an easy thing to do everything that you buy that aren't vegetables or fruit has to be checked to make sure that every ingredient is permitted then when you get to vegetables you have to examine everything for tiny bugs eggs can't be eaten if they have blood in them no meat and milk can be eaten together only certain animals can be eaten and easier way is become vegetarian which is what i am it still takes me time to check foods that i buy then it's the price kosher meat is more expensive than normal killed animals why do you want to be kosher if you don't want to be jewish then you can follow the noachide laws then again they don't keep kosher either Kashrut Vegetarianism Unclean animals Vegetarianism and religion Halaal 613 mitzvot Meat Hechsher Mashgiach Pork Veganism Jewish cuisine Cheese Healthy eating Vegetarian cuisine Noahide Laws Shechita Hamburger Taboo food and drink Hot dog Clean animals Ethical consumerism Foodborne illness Animal rights Sausage Cuisine of Singapore Manna Sharia Slaughterhouse Kosher wine Buddhist cuisine Chinese cuisine Japanese cuisine French cuisine Egg (food) Livestock Cat Tofu Cuisine of the Philippines Chicken Soup German cuisine Organic food Dieting Wine Polish cuisine Judaism Breakfast Fecal incontinence Taiwanese cuisine Meat analogue Domestic rabbit Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Brazil Korean cuisine Crohn's disease Dim sum Compost Business ethics Curry Lisa the Vegetarian Fasting Dumpling McDonald's Cuisine of Denmark Bengali cuisine Food preservation Jewish holiday Raw food diet Beef Roman eating and drinking Chili con carne Cuisine of Africa Abrahamic religion Vegetarian nutrition Cantonese cuisine Cha chaan teng Cake Prostate cancer Sandwich Russian cuisine MRE Buddhism Pancake Miso soup Soybean Cuisine of Vietnam Pig Pizza People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Chicken soup Passover Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ice cream Escherichia coli O157:H7 Whaling
