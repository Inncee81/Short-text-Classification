what exactly is halal meat and is it better for you there is also kosher meat is this the same as halal can you guys please explain exactly what these ways or rituals are that's what i want to know as other users mentioned it is specific types of meat that is slaughtered to remove as much blood as possile but also with as little trauma to the animal as possible the types of halal meats exclude pork blood carcasses of animals that are already dead and carnivorous animals we're also not supposed to choose animals that are sick diseased or injured as you can probably guess this could lead to infection and diseases for the consumer most slaughterhouses in the us ignore this little bit and often cut off a cancerous sore to send to pet food manufacturers but use the rest of the sick animal for our grocery stores so in this sense halal or kosher is much better for you as far as the slaughtering method goes we are instructed to use the sharpest utensils so it will be the least painful to the animal we have to lead them away from other animals so they do not witness it and become fearful it should be done slow enough to allow the blood to drain but quick enough to end any suffering on the animal's behalf before the slaughter someone says in the name of god before proceeding only the caroid arteries and juggular veins should be cut and the spine and trachea left in tact it's still not pretty but of all the slaughtering methods i've heard of it's the most gentle on the animal also feed is also an important part as i said carnivorous animals are forbidden and making herbivorous animals into carnivorous or canniballistic ones feeding ground beef to cows the reason mad cow disease began is not permissible at any level since the animal is getting a healthier and more natural diet you can bet it's better for you just as organic fed and free range meats are a little off topic but i just saw on t v today that the yolks of two eggs from free range organic fed chickens contains more omega fatty acids than yolks from the average grocery store eggs anyways i hope this helps you and here's a little link if you want to read more about it http www azhar jp info halal eng halal html Slaughterhouse Kosher foods Livestock Taboo food and drink Beef Unclean animals Chicken Veganism Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Meat Nutrition Omega-3 fatty acid Dog Cat Egg (food) Vegetarianism and religion Escherichia coli O157:H7 Salmon Cheese Sharia Domestic rabbit Food Shark Breastfeeding Jewish cuisine Stomach cancer Carnivore Blood Hypoglycemia Spider Factory farming First aid Insulin Pork Tooth Horse meat Prostate cancer Gray Wolf Ferret Aztec Foodborne illness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Trans fat Tasmanian Devil Tyrannosaurus rex Traumatic brain injury Cancer Cattle Gelatin Brain Animal rights Ecology Fancy rat Atherosclerosis Kidney Mosquito Coronary heart disease Snake Tofu Trichinosis Hedgehog Orca Vegetarian nutrition Blood pressure Domesticated turkey Anemia People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Genetically modified food Pet skunk Chronic fatigue syndrome Liver Organic food Cardiovascular disease Decompression sickness Acne Tiger Shechita Cirrhosis Cantonese cuisine Tocopherol Barbecue Eucharist Shrimp farm
