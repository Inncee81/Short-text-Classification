how do you carry a bento i know what a bento is and i have heard people say they they take theirs to work with them for lunch but how food is normally in one or multiple fairly small containers so how do you carry them all together and without sloshing all the food around if you don't know what a bento is that's fine but please don't answer no that's not at all what i was talking about and i don't have time to answer people's questions when i'm simply trying to get an answer besides why would i tell people what something is when they obviously wouldn't know my answer so it would be pointless don't be an ignorant asshole the containers usually designed with separated chambers the lid can be closed tightly and the bento food usually not the kind of soupy watery food so it won't slosh mess around easily or if you want to carry soup anyway you can put it in a separated container with the secure cap to carry home made bento wrapped the box with handkerchief or just put in in a plastic bag bento foods from the store are using disposable container and simply carried with plastic paper bag just like the ordinary take out foods http static flickr com c fb jpg http images google co jp images q e bc e bd ie utf oe utf rls org mozilla en us official client firefox a um sa n tab wi http www cookingcute com bento boxes and accessories htm Bento Mozilla Firefox HTTP cookie Mozilla Application Suite Plastic bag HyperText Transfer Protocol Domain Name System USB flash drive Mozilla Thunderbird Hamster Ajax (programming) Plastic Japanese tea ceremony Professional wrestling match types Gmail Tea Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Web page Common Unix Printing System Web browser User agent Milk Scalable Vector Graphics Phishing Menstrual cup Sega Saturn Carburetor Xbox 360 Cascading Style Sheets Vacuum cleaner Textile manufacturing XML DVD 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Mouse (computing) Baby bottle Berimbau Customs and etiquette of Japan Internal ballistics Jabber Little Britain Stopping e-mail abuse Wine making Uniform Resource Locator MSN Messenger Agar plate Economy of Colombia Tofu Firearm Internet Relay Chat Japanese toilet Surveillance XUL Top-bar hive Password Seismic retrofit Netscape Web server Columbine High School massacre Cartridge (firearms) HTML Butterfly Gramophone record Downing Street memo Christmas tree Cremation Opera (web browser) Autopsy Coffee Entropy Drill bit Bridge Stereoscopy Printed circuit board Theory of conduct The nature of God in Western theology Freenet Phonograph cylinder Cross site scripting Poker jargon Intelligent design Transport Layer Security Medical prescription Bong Plame affair Harmonica Representational State Transfer Abstraction (computer science) Java programming language Violin ITunes The Pet Sounds Sessions Unicode Cannabis cultivation Shaggy dog story 21 July 2005 London bombings Transmission Control Protocol Ammunition Floppy disk
