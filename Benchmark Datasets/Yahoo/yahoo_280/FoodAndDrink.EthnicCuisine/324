i just cooked indian rice basmati brown rice i don't know if it came out right and is this rice healthy this is my first time cooking basmati rice i bought it at trader's joe and i followed the directions on the bag however i'm used to eating rice that is very very soft so i was wondering if basmati rice is suppose to be or feel like dried corn that was soaked in water or like oatmeal i don't know how to describe the texture of the rice but it didn't feel crunchy dried but it wasn't super soft so how am i suppose to know if it came out right it did taste good though also is this rice suppose to be healthy i'm trying a new diet i just made basmati rice for dinner and no it should have the same texture as a long grain rice you did not cook it long enough i don't even measure my rice and water here is how my mother grandmother taught me fill your pan halfway with water then put the rice halfway up the water that way you have about twice as much water as rice always use cold water and put it on the stove on high with no lid bring it to a rapid boil and then turn it down to low and put a lid on it cook it on low for about minutes until it looks dry but not burning on the bottom rice is a good food if you think about it some of the healthiest people on earth are asians they diet is primarily seafood and rice remember though rice is starchy and therefor does have carbs Rice Tofu Risotto Cuisine of Brazil Sushi Cuisine of Malaysia Bread Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of the Philippines Japanese cuisine Idli Rice pudding Cantonese cuisine Ramen Tea Flour Atkins Nutritional Approach Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Breakfast Food preservation Food Soup Cuisine of the Southern United States Tlingit Dumpling Barbecue Veganism Starch Quinoa Cajun cuisine Hamburger Peruvian cuisine Vegetarianism Muffin Vegetarian cuisine Coffee Cuisine of Singapore Mattress Porridge Egg (food) Soy milk Cereal Low-carbohydrate diet Plantain Fecal incontinence Bong Common bean Cookware and bakeware Japanese tea ceremony Potato Omega-3 fatty acid Little Britain Sweetcorn Chocolate Pig (zodiac) Miso Steaming Breakfast cereal Wine Sauerkraut Cuisine of Laos Ice cream Domesticated turkey Milk Banana Sake Couscous Chinese cuisine Cuisine of Thailand Kitchen Healthy eating Tortilla Beer Customs and etiquette of Japan Raw food diet Chili con carne MRE Gluten Portable stove Rice congee Apple Dieting Cuisine of India Pizza Gelatin Hamster
