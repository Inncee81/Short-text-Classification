van persi or berbatov who do you prefer dont get me wrong i think van persi has class but berbatov hes world class i think berbatov is one of the most complete players of the game i have seen since zidane came to the peak of his game i rate him that highly creative attacking style of play and an innate ability to score goals i think spurs will sneak the th spot for behind man u lpool and chelski in that order van persie has electric pace and is a superb dead ball player but berbatov just has a more rounded complete game he is to spurs what bergkamp was to arsenal Dennis Bergkamp Robin van Persie Football (soccer) positions Super Bowl XXXVI Volleyball Martin Peters Steve McManaman FA Cup Rugby league Fast bowling Striker Snooker Baseball Water polo Zin__dine Zidane Super Bowl XXXIV Norway national football team English cricket team Ruud van Nistelrooy Super Bowl XVII The Football League Rugby union positions Chicago Bulls American football FIFA World Player of the Year Lacrosse History of Arsenal F.C.
