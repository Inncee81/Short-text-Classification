spanish civil war guernica who was to blame nationalists or condor legion a who decided that guernica was a legitimate military target b was guernica just an experiment in the effectiveness of terror bombing i don't think it was a dry run on terror bombing at all but mainly a raid that did not have proper reconaissance beforehand and one which did not have effective enough leadership to bomb the correct target the bridge behind the town the town was a possible target both for the armaments factory outside the town and for the possible retreat route for republican forces in the area so i believe that the bombing raid was just not given enough time and expertise to carry out properly and as a result many civilian deaths occurred though not the claimed at the time but more like total though planned and carried out by german and italian forces the raid was probably ordered by franco or more likely the nationalist general in the area emilio mola Bombing of Guernica Spanish Civil War Aerial bombing of cities Terror bombing Gernika-Lumo Luftwaffe Legi__n C__ndor Shock and Awe Guerrilla warfare Siege of Warsaw (1939) Strategic bombing during World War II Guernica (painting) Francisco Franco Aerial warfare Corpo Truppe Volontarie RAF Bomber Command 11 March 2004 Madrid train bombings ETA World War II Second Spanish Republic Terrorism against Israel Korean War Al-Aqsa Intifada Iraq War State terrorism International Brigades Guadalajara offensive Battle of Britain Weapons of mass destruction History of Chechnya Emilio Mola Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia Blitzkrieg Area bombardment Participants in World War II Battle of Berlin (air) Anarchism in Spain Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II European Theatre of World War II Military history of the Soviet Union U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Pablo Picasso Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Lebanese Civil War Bombing of Hamburg in World War II Military description of the Warsaw Uprising History of Spain Iraqi insurgency Battle of France Kosovo War Israel Defense Forces Nuclear weapon 1982 Lebanon War The Blitz Operation Chastise Curtis LeMay Nuclear warfare United States Air Force Terrorism Second Chechen War Operation El Dorado Canyon Anglo-Irish War Chinese Civil War Palestinian National Authority 7 July 2005 London bombings Qibya massacre Greek Civil War Politics of Spain Operation Days of Penitence Civil Air Patrol Suicide bombing Heinkel He 112 Irish Republican Army (1922-1969) 2003 Invasion of Iraq 1948 Arab-Israeli War Bomb Abu Musab al-Zarqawi Fallujah Junkers Battle of the Bulge Asymmetric warfare Palestine Liberation Organization Algerian War of Independence Al-Qaeda Israeli Air Force Royal Navy Battle of El Mazuco Just War theory Madrid Franco-Prussian War Japanese American internment Operation Condor Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Bombing of Tokyo in World War II
