why were the battles at iwo jima and pacific islands so bloody enlighten me please what is there to enlighten about the japanese where dug in to the very terrain they had committed themselves to not surrendering they had no hope of escape and fought desperate like as they say a trapped rat the us troops had to land on open beaches and fight for each square yard of terrain some had no foliage to speak of for cover like iwo jima it had only volcanic ash and if you dug down a few feet or so the ground could slow roast you it was hot no water to speak of and no protective cover the japanese had tunneled into the volcanic mountain and the surrounding ash hills and fought for there very lives other island where heavy in foliage and riff with heat and disease this caused severe problems in conducting war fare and most ware ware in all the island was not armies facing armies but small groups in isolated area as attacking one another it was hand to hand in most instances the shore bombing they found did little it looked good but rarely affected the dug in troops no one wore body armor bullets came from all directions in such confused combat locations Battle of Iwo Jima Iwo Jima Peleliu USS West Virginia (BB-48) USS Wadsworth (DD-516) USS Indianapolis (CA-35) Battle of the Scheldt USS Saratoga (CV-3) USS Pensacola (CA-24) USS Washington (BB-56) Operation Downfall USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2) USS Enterprise (CV-6) USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Battle of the Aleutian Islands detailed account USS Patterson (DD-392) USS Helm (DD-388) U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Geography of Japan Burma Campaign Battle of the Bulge USS The Sullivans (DD-537) Kokoda Track Campaign World War II USS Twining (DD-540) Operation Market Garden USS Wedderburn (DD-684) Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens USS Taussig (DD-746) USS Waters (DD-115) USS Wasp (CV-18) USS Idaho (BB-42) USS Petrof Bay (CVE-80) Volcano USS Ammen (DD-527) Tank Landing at Anzac Cove USS Halligan (DD-584) Opportunity rover USS Santa Fe (CL-60) USS Hancock (CV-19) United States Marine Corps Franco-Prussian War USS Vestal (AR-4) Armoured warfare Land mine USS Yarnall (DD-541) USS Bagley (DD-386) USS Heermann (DD-532) European Theatre of World War II USS Alaska (CB-1) USS Vicksburg (CL-86) USS Texas (BB-35) USS Wilkes-Barre (CL-103) USS Aylwin (DD-355) U.S. 3rd Marine Division Worms weapons and tools USS San Francisco (CA-38) USS Walke (DD-723) Operation Barbarossa Australian 8th Division USS Taylor (DD-468) Imperial stormtrooper Eldfell Battles of Lexington and Concord Ogasawara Islands Battle of Singapore USS North Carolina (BB-55) Urban warfare USS Twiggs (DD-591) USS Pennsylvania (BB-38) Battle of France USS Remey (DD-688) Kamikaze Battle of the Kasserine Pass USS Salt Lake City (CA-25) Battle of Berlin Vietnam War USS Williamson (DD-244) American Revolutionary War USS Humphreys (DD-236) Military history of the Roman Empire USS Franklin (CV-13) USS San Jacinto (CVL-30) Operation Torch Second Sino-Japanese War USS San Juan (CL-54)
