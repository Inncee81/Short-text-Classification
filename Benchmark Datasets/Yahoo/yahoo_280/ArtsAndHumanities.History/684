why do conservatives get blamed for slavery really i can't believe the rap conservatives take for this everything i have ever read and have been taught tells me that the democrats were the main slaveholders republicans stemmed from the whig party right before the civil war and the abolitionists for crying out loud abe lincoln was a republican and he certainly never held any slaves and felt it was a scourge on our society frederick douglas was invited to the white house when lincoln was president to discuss the problems the blacks faced and did everything he could to help them douglas said he was very nervous to go the first time he was invited because he didn't know the reception he would receive because at that time in history the blacks were considered inferior to whites in a majority of society but when he went he said he could not believe the warm welcome he recieved from lincoln and said he believed lincoln was one of the nicest people he had ever met who treated him with respect and honor most of the republicans at that time wanted slavery abolished in the sixties civil rights movement you still could not go down south and be served in a restaurant if you were black and the south was mostly democrat at that time what is the other side of the story that i am not hearing i'm not sure conservatives get hit as hard as whites in general regardless of their political views the thing that you have to remember is that both political parties have evolved over the years i'm not sure why slavery is still an issue and more over i'm not sure why people blacks especially are seeking revenge for it while slavery is an atrocity in and of itself i feel no personal responsibility for any of it and i'm about as white as they come do i condone slavery no am i glad that its over absolutely nevertheless i've never done anything to anyone slavery nor any other sort of racist actions and therefore i don't believe i should have to apologize for nor should i have to explain the actions of those who lived hundereds of years ago i realize that the hardcore black leftists like to pin everything bad on republicans simply because the republican party has become the quasi embodiement of the 'white devil' but at the sametime i think thats why nobody takes them seriously now its one thing to have black activists and leaders educating and raising awareness about those unbelievably horrible atrocities that took place hundered years ago which is fine understanding the mistakes of history is the best way to prevent them from happening again furthermore those days of old were not only a defining time for black history but american history itself it really proved that we are a superior country because we did in fact not only realize that slavery is wrong but we indeed took the steps necessary to end it lastly we have to understand that the 'white devils' werent soley responsible for slavery we also have to note the african leaders at the time who sold their own people to slaver traders but for some reason that part of history always gets left by the wayside people like to make it seem like george washington blew over to africa single handedly abducted thousands of people and brought them back to america with absolutely no help from the african people give me a god d mn break in short the whole finger pointing at whites and conservatives for slavery is really just a bunch of bullocks most intelligent people that i deal with are progressive thinking conservatives who think that the entire religious right and republican party is just as corrupt if not more so than the meandering liberals it just goes to prove that broad generalization strikes again j Slavery Democratic Party (United States) Abraham Lincoln Republican Party (United States) Nation of Islam Southern United States Origins of the American Civil War Plame affair Reparations for slavery African American Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Racism History of slavery in the United States Religious Society of Friends Supreme Court of the United States Dred Scott v.
