before modern technology how did a low middle income family feed itself during the winter i'm thinking about britain but if you know about an area that is similarly seasonal your info is welcome so what i'm wondering is what did people eat during the winter did every family have its own food store or was it managed by a town or a local ruler how did people ration it out and what were the economics involved it's just a matter of curiosity in the period i study earl modern england and europe most towns had their own grain store which was managed by the town or city corporations councillors aldermen mayors etc in times of bad harvest these corporations would monopolise the local stocks and only pay such suppliers as there was set prices thereby ensuring the poor of the town were not priced out of the market some were more effectual than others in managing the supply and demand there are many instances of grain riots in england and europe at times when the corporations had not responded to the crisis quickly enough other towns were models of organisation e g lille now in france then in the walloon province of flanders as for individual stores it is hard to know but i have recently studied accounts for a lower gentry family in early seventeenth century and they were buying enough grain to last a couple of months at once therefore they must have had to store it somewhere those on lower incomes would obviously not have been able to buy as much grain at once as for perishables low income families in rural areas would have fed themselves by slaughtering and preserving their own animals getting dairy from their own cattle eggs from their own hens and vegetables preserved from the summer harvest most rural dwellers would have enough land even if its just leased for one or two animals larger local landowners would have also supplied them at a cost of course Famine Microeconomics Agriculture Supply and demand Gold standard Agriculture in Australia Capitalism Vegetarianism Livestock Wal-Mart Common Agricultural Policy Free trade Natural monopoly Alcohol fuel Economic history of Canada Organic food Tesco Organic farming Shrimp farm Capital accumulation Food Economy of Africa Labour economics Money Monopoly History of the United States (1918-1945) Economics Inflation Sears Holdings Corporation Tax Economy of Belgium Hyperinflation Kosher foods Mutual fund Economy of the United States Biodiesel Supply-side economics Commodity markets Economy of Russia Privatization Economy of India Rise of the New Imperialism Veganism Family farm Management Monetary policy Mercantilism 1973 oil crisis Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Asian financial crisis Protestant Reformation Economy of Pakistan Corporate governance Milk Local government in the United Kingdom Farmers' Alliance Great Famine of 1315-1317 Industrial Revolution Publicly funded medicine Black Death Intellectual property Medieval demography Food storage Management information system Dawson Creek, British Columbia Berkshire Hathaway Unemployment United Kingdom corporation tax Factory farming Illegal drug trade Kashrut Economy of the Soviet Union Deforestation MMORPG Monopoly (game) Tariff Labor theory of value Local food Cable television Flat tax Externality Serfdom Arbitrage Habsburg Spain Domestic rabbit Bank Digital photography Economy of the People's Republic of China Law of value American individualist anarchism Education in the People's Republic of China Nuclear power
