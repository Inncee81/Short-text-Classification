is it true that jesus was a follower of the jewish teacher 'helal' does anyone here know helal i'm looking how to say his name pronounced 'helal' on the dvd pbs special kingdom of david helal was a jewish teacher that used to teach a moral code eg a version of treat others as you would want yourself treated and it is believed that jesus was a student of his the reference i have is a pbs special on israel and there is no website for it so i'm basically looking for the correct spelling of 'helal' and if anyone scholars here know more about him or a link thanks the rabbi you are speaking about was named hillel and no jesus would not have been a student of his since he died when jesus was years old however contrary to what others have posted hillel was a harisee and the nasi head of the sanhedrin his academy was the leading academy and it his rulings that were considered authoritative both then and now in fact in the hundreds of disagreements recorded in the talmud between bet hillel the academy of hillel vs bet shammai the academy of shammai the talmud only rules in favour of bet shammai four times also throughout that period the saduccees were seen as heretics and not allowed to be part of the temple hierarchy in fcat specific rules were promulgated by the sanhedrin of the time by both hillel and shammai to prevent the saduccees heresies gaining hold its probably the one area they had no disagreements on after all the sanhedrin relied heavily on the mishnah oral law which the sadduccees denied Rabbi Halakha Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Mishnah Sanhedrin Talmud Yeshu Jewish principles of faith Heresy Cultural and historical background of Jesus Maimonides Shulkhan Arukh Semicha Jewish views of religious pluralism Exilarch Judaism Christianity Noahide Laws Geonim Capital punishment Jesus Orthodox Judaism Karaite Judaism Messiah Abrahamic religion Sadducee Korban Rabbinic literature Biblical canon Norman Lamm Prophet Kabbalah Oral law Jewish leadership Ten Commandments Jewish Messiah Essenes Torah Matthew 5:32 Fundamentalism Jewish ethics Tosafot Council of Jerusalem Names and titles of Jesus Chabad Lubavitch Tosefta Sin Balaam Mishneh Torah Jewish Christians God Historical Jesus Clergy Book of Daniel Bible Nahmanides Christianity and anti-Semitism Tefillin New Testament Abraham ben David New Testament view on Jesus' life Yeshiva Acharonim 613 mitzvot Deuteronomy Gospel of Thomas Hanukkah Jacob Neusner Jerusalem Talmud History of Christianity Aggadah Timeline of Jewish history Religious views of suicide Religion in Israel Jews as a chosen people Elisha ben Abuyah Apocrypha Samaritan History of ancient Israel and Judah Christian-Jewish reconciliation Jerusalem Shema Yisrael Sabbath Jewish history Davidic line Yitzchok Hutner Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Satan Legalism (theology) Beth din Mormonism and Judaism
