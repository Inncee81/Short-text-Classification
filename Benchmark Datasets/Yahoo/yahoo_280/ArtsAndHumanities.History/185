hi in the movie did the persians payed the priest to lie to king leonidas did priest lied to king leonidas of what the oracle said did the persians payed the priest to lie and why king leonidas did not leave with the rest of the allies other spartans together why did he stayed in the film leonidas visited the oracle before the persians did so i take it to mean not that they were paid to lie but paid to reveal to the persians what was said to leonidas of course you're talking about the film and not the reality of what happened so artistic license could've been taken at that point leonidas and his group of soldiers would not have left because it was bred into them to fight they saw it as a glorious way to die that's why he asked for men who had sons to carry on the family name and if you recall when they first arrived at the passage one of leonidas' men says that perhaps one of the persian soldiers will be good enough to give him a proper death Battle of Thermopylae Leonidas I Taranto Sparta Pausanias (general) Greco-Persian Wars Battle of Plataea Cleomenes I The Matrix Alexander the Great Timeline of Ancient Greece Battle of Salamis Ancient Greece Zeus History of Greek and Roman Egypt Jacques-Louis David Sicilian Expedition Escape of Charles II Ostracism History of Sparta Battle of Perryville Valens Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Xenophon Miss Saigon Bishop Battle of Marathon Oracle Cambyses II of Persia Book of Daniel Cyrus the Younger Oracle (The Matrix) Priesthood (Mormonism) Thebes, Greece The Bunker Crucifixion Antigonus II Gonatas Medes Seleucid Empire Highlander (film) The Invisibles Ancient Olympic Games Achilles Nico Robin Phrygia Aegina Battle of Gaugamela Thucydides Neo (The Matrix) British monarchy Pai Mei Norouz Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Trojan War Pharisees Agesilaus II Colony in Space Kimon Platoon (film) Kill Bill Darius I of Persia Ancient warfare Battle of Chickamauga Aida (musical) Vernon Schillinger Battle of Shiloh Pyrrhus of Epirus Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones Ezekiel The Curse of Fenric English Civil War Persepolis Battle of the Hydaspes River King Arthur (film) Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Wang Mang Conversion of Dale-Gudbrand Peloponnesian War The Day the Earth Stood Still Ayyavazhi mythology Rafael Le__nidas Trujillo History of Greece Penda of Mercia Multinational force in Iraq God of War Book of Ezekiel Battle of Waterloo Exilarch StarCraft: Uprising Babylonian law Kings of Sparta New Model Army Williamite war in Ireland Thirteen Years' War Turandot Biblical Magi John Wycliffe Memento (film) Harun al-Rashid
