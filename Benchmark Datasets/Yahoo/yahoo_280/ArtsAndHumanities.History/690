why do the americans not acknowledge that they committed genocide the systematic destruction of culture and religion and widespread premeditated murder of american indian peoples by the united states and yes i realise other countries did the same before them but on a much smaller scale has no other description than genocide or holocaust since it resulted in the near extinction of an entire race of indiginous people germany educates its people about the crimes commited by their nation yet the united states does not nor does it without very lengthy legal process compensate the families of those wronged why do the american government and people still believe in manifest destiny or do they just feel they are beyond reproach or maybe they just like to pretend it didnt happen loryntoo thankyou for the history lesson i have a degree in american indian studies and i'll think you'll find that the indians were told to give up there land or be deemed hostile the ones that gave up were rounded up and put onto crappy land and told to farm the ones that didnt were fired upon on sight who wouldnt fight for their land if it was being stolen loryntoo also most of you are misunderstanding or avoiding the main part of the question i'm not disputing that it is taught to varying degrees in schools or that americans are aware of the issue my point is that america does not seem to recognignise it as genocide and so far not all but most of you aren't either is it or isnt it and if it is why are you as a nation with a high jewish population so unwilling to admit that it was genocide they don't because of the laws here there is no statute of limitations on murder if the govt actually admitted to murdering any indian it would open the flood gates to prosecution and yes they can prosecute the govt as an entity weather or not the individual that signed the policy is dead or not because it's the office of the president that signs not the man this is also the reason the usa will never join the world court they would be charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity edit i could be wrong but i think he means america as in the assholes in dc running the show Genocide Murder Population transfer Population history of American indigenous peoples United States International Criminal Court Hate crime Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Capital punishment Racism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jew Politics of the United States The Holocaust Appeal Japanese war crimes Plame affair Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Holocaust denial Bangladesh Liberation War Theory of conduct Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Nuremberg Trials Unlawful combatant Human sexual behavior Srebrenica massacre Government of India Slobodan Milo__evi__ Bombing of Dresden in World War II Contract International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Human rights Anti-Defamation League Ward Churchill Political subdivisions of New York State Supernatural Israeli settlement Benny Morris Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Polygamy European Union American Revolution Education World War II Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Mein Kampf College John Lott Jewish principles of faith Lawyer Reparations for slavery Ethics Accession of Turkey to the European Union Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Holodomor Education in the United States Israel Gun politics in the United States Patent Anschluss International Court of Justice Serial killer Evil Extradition State Treaty Abortion debate Stolen Generation Genocides in history Public domain Law Indigenous peoples Separation of church and state Due process Israeli Arab Jean Kambanda Schutzstaffel Zionism and racism First Amendment to the United States Constitution Conspiracy Beltway sniper attacks Sabra and Shatila massacre Manifest Destiny Age of consent Criminal law Patriotism
