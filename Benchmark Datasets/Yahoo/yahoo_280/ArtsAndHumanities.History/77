did capote make a cameo appearance in the first in cold blood movie i am writing a book about another kansas murder featured in capote's in cold blood wondering if anyone knows if capote made an appearance in the film no he did not he's not even a character in it what is interesting about that movie the house where the clutter murders are filmed is the real clutter house the murders are all filmed where they really took place robert blake said it was extremely eerie way more than just killing a wife in infamous and capote they used old kansas farmhouses as stand ins whereas the real clutter house was actually a very modern for the time and large brick ranch style it's currently privately owned but still gets a lot of tourists taking pics from outside the link is to a great web site that has pics taken while capote lee were researching and pics of the clutter house today Truman Capote Robert Blake (actor) To Kill a Mockingbird Patricia Ford Harper Lee The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Kansas Red Dragon M (James Bond) Psycho War of the Worlds (2005 film) Who Framed Roger Rabbit William S.
