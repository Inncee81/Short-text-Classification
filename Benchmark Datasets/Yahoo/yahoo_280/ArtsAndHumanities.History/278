putting a freeway through an important historical site has anyone else heard about the freeway that the irish pm dick roche is having built through one corner of tara tara as in the year old mound of monuments and tunnels where the ancient irish kings were crowned so firstly my question is is anyone else as mad about this as i am and secondly there's a petition up on tarawatch org but is there any more direct way of getting results barring flying to ireland and joining the protesters a similar situation arose on okinawa island in japan during the early s shortly after the island reverted back to japanese control the japanese were going to build an expressway to connect the two largest cities on the island one in the south one in the north but they found the path of the expressway would cut through a hillside which contained historical artifacts of okinawa's ryukyan culture that pre dated japanese culture by over one thousand years needless to say the road was re designed to go around that hillside you might want to post a message at the below web site's guest book it's read by a lot of folks who live in okinawa and they might make cyber contact with those in the irish republic to stop this sort of nonsense Hill of Tara Highway Ireland Interstate 94 Early history of Ireland Interstate 95 Independent Subway System Okinawa Prefecture Dublin San Francisco Bay Area Speed limit Pennsylvania Turnpike British Isles Lebor Gab__la __renn Badaling Expressway Gyeongju Irish mythology Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead British Columbia provincial highway 1 U.S. Highway 1 Toll road U.S. Highway 6 Rail transport in Ireland Beijing Freeway Rules of the road Autoroute (Quebec) History of Ireland Elis Prefecture USS Ammen (DD-527) Rathfarnham Ballymena Bohermeen Battle of Okinawa Jingshi Expressway Motorway Segregated cycle facilities USS Taylor (DD-468) U.S. Highway 101 California State Route 1 Mexico City USS Taussig (DD-746) Transportation in South Korea Traffic sign Interstate 70 USS Yorktown (CV-10) Interstate 80 Parliament of the United Kingdom Family Guy Dublin City University Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin President of Ireland TransLink (Brisbane) services Post-Occupation Japan California State Route 2 USS Alfred A.
