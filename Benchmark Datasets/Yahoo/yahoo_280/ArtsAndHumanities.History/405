can someone tell the history of the yakuza from the crime library the origin of the yakuza is a matter of some debate some feel that its members are descendents of the th century kabuki mono crazy ones outlandish samurai who reveled in outlandish clothing and hair styles spoke in elaborate slang and carried unusually long swords in their belts the kabuki mono were also known as hatamoto yakko servants of the shogun during the tokugawa era an extended period of peace in japan the services of these samurai were no longer needed and so they became leaderless ronin wave men without the guidance of a strong hand they eventually shifted their focus from community service to theft and mayhem modern yakuza members refute this theory and instead proclaim themselves to be the descendents of the machi yokko servants of the town who protected their villages from the wayward hatamoto yakko the official yakuza history portrays the group's ancestors as underdog folk heroes who stood up for the poor and the defenseless just as robin hood helped the peasants of medieval england current yakuza members fall under three general categories tekiya street peddlers bakuto gamblers and gurentai hoodlums the peddlers and gamblers trace their roots back to the th century while the hoodlums came into existence after world war ii when the demand for black market goods created a booming industry traditionally the tekiya medieval japan's version of snake oil salesmen worked the fairs and markets while the bakuto worked the towns and highways the gurentai by contrast modeled themselves on american gangsters of the al capone era using threats and extortion to achieve their ends after world war ii in the governmental power void caused by the occupation the gurentai prospered and their ranks swelled they also brought organized crime in japan to a new level of violence replacing the traditional sword with modern firearms even though guns were now officially outlawed in the country as a result of the surrender the yakuza are proud to be outcasts and the word yakuza reflects the group's self image as society's rejects or you could try everything you always wanted to know about the japanese mafia http web telia com u yakuza htm Tokugawa shogunate Forty-seven Ronin Samurai Jidaigeki Ninja Burakumin Katana History of Japan Kabuki Seppuku Shogun Characters of Naruto Edo period Japan Triad History of theater Mafia Gang German Empire Japanese war crimes Military history of Japan Samurai Deeper Kyo Emperor of Japan Muromachi period Meiji period Sento Oda Nobunaga Tokugawa Ieyasu Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia Love and Theft Toyotomi Hideyoshi Kamakura period Leadership Professional wrestling attacks Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mercantilism Imperial Japanese Navy Bushido Cowboy Bebop Libertarian socialism Anarchism and society Japanese literature Nagasaki Pornography in Japan Homosexuality in Japan Gangster Clothing Nanban trade period Japanese name Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Shinto Capital accumulation Trade union Superhero Jacobo Arenas Left-wing politics Foreign policy of Japan Militarism-Socialism in Showa Japan William Adams Tariff Unemployment Martial art ETA Keynesian economics Samurai Champloo Airsoft Economic history of Japan Bosniaks Imperial Japanese Army Criminal tattoo Inflation Music genre Aikido Wyatt Earp Rurouni Kenshin Dalit (outcaste) Waka Sohei Liberalism Early modern warfare Karaoke Free trade Globalization Organized crime Russian Mafia Yojimbo (film) Rastafari movement Jewish principles of faith Firearm
