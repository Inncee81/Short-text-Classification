which south american adoption agencies can you recommend my wife and i would like to adopt some children from countries like chile paraguay or uruguay as we have a cultural affinity with them and would feel at home with them but it seems difficult to find adoption agencies there i am fluent in spanish though and would be happy to engage in correspondence in spanish with any agency you can recommend to me in case you wonder we live in new zealand and would need to export the children to it thank you for any input i searched and found a guatemala program here http www faithfuladoption org registration but to be honest that is all i found after minutes of searching apparently international adoption is not too popular in nz especially not from the countries you are interested in however go to abcadoptions com adoption org and adoption com and get on the international forums there you will be able to post your question and probably get some suggestions good luck Hispanic Operation Condor Domain Name System Paraguay South America White (people) Adoption Chile Uruguay Time zone Marriage Spanish language ISBN Pan-American Highway Plame affair Inter-American Commission on Human Rights Genealogy Gross domestic product International response to Hurricane Katrina Antarctic Treaty System League of Nations Argentina Central Intelligence Agency Latin American music Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Economy of Paraguay Infantilism Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works Joseph C.
