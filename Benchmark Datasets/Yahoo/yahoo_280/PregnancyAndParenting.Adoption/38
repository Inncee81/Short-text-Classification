would my parents have the right to force me to give my baby up for adoption i am yrs old going to be in november and am pregnant i am planning on keeping my baby but could my parents make me give my baby up for adoption thanks no they have no rights at all i don't care what other people think on this but there is only two people who have rights on this child and its you and the father of the baby if you have the baby after the age of the better for you both you can get help for your baby's health and get this some insurance company's out there say that you can be insured through your parents while you are in school before you get married and at times to a age limit talk to your doctor before your parents do and see if they can get you the information on this for you there are laws that protect you from your parents forcing you to do anything now say the father don't want the baby at all he cant force you to give the child up your parents or his parents either now if you were not wanting to give the baby up don't sign any papers at all on this matter no matter what happens and in some cases your parents will kick you out depending on how your parents are you can still get help i would find this help now just in case it does happen to you other things that can happen or come up now say your parents try to make you do anythig at all and you sign papers in the usa you have a period to say i want my child i have changed my mnd you will get your child back no matter what your parents have to say about this now if your parents try to get your rights taken away the courts will side with you since your the babys mother the courts will also make you tell who the father is and if you have no clue they will ask for ever person you have been with in the time frame of your conception now i do want to say that any infromation that is given to your doctor is for you and you alone your parents can never find out this infromation unless you say its ok so i would suggest that you tell your doctor to mot give out any information about you or your babys health in any way wow there is so much you can do and it may upset your life at home but if you want this baby like you say you do there is so much you have for you now since your almost talk to hud about getting housing for you and baby talk to your state assistance office for money for you and baby get on wic so you have food that can help your health go to a doctor so you can make sure you and your baby is healthy you can also do all this without your parents knowing what you are doing get a po box number in your name so you can have a privete mail box for everything your parents dont need to know about lets see tlak to the father about what you want and see what he wants to do with all this if he helps you out that is better for both of you if not the state will make him help you out you have more rights then you can ever guess you have just make phone calls and make sure you and baby are covered for anything that goes bad in your home with mom and dad i do want to say that you can still go to college if you plan on that its not unheard of at all so if you want a future you still have one no matter what crap anyone feeds you good luck in what you do and if you give up your child that is your right no one can stop you not even the father of the baby Abortion debate Health insurance Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Friends Fathers' rights Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion in the United States Breastfeeding Insurance Fathers' rights movement in the UK Child support Stomach cancer Divorce British nationality law Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Roe v.
