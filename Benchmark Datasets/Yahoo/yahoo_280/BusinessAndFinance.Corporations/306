how do television networks and radio stations make profit i understand that through sponsorships and commercials they can turn interest from investments but how did television and radio make money when they first started i can't imagine that sponsors and commercials pay for all expenses employee wages production costs etc where is this revenue coming from if a t v show network channel or radio station receive more viewers listeners than their competitors they're deemed successful but how does this translate to revenue we as viewers and listeners only pay the electric bill when watching t v and the cable bill for more channels i'll break it down into the segments for you but the networks and stations all make their money from advertising you should note that television advertising is a multi billion dollar a year business it's much bigger than you're giving it credit for television networks the best approach is using an example for example abc wants to creat lost they pay for a pilot and make a few episodes they air the show on all abc affiliates in prime time when most viewers are watching and when advertising costs are very high since it's in prime time they normally keep all but two or three of the commercial spots that air during the hour show this is true if they own the local abc affiliate or not then they package a national advertising deal with pepsi or bud light or ford or whatever and sell it they make a boat load of money and they made even more than that when it first started today it's tougher on tv b c of the internet and cable channels etc television and radio stations make their money selling spots during the rest of the day the fox station in baltimore for example makes most of it's money selling spots during it's self produced news programming it makes it's second most money on the show that airs right after american idol is over because many people just keep it on that channel advertisers know this and they pay for that time tv stations enjoy a great margin usually in the range meaning they net cents for each of advertising they sell meanwhile grocery stores generally net cents for each of milk and bread that they sell huge difference anyway back to your second question the revenues for the national spots come from ford pepsi nike etc the revenues from the local spots come from billy bob's used cars and janey jane's mortgage company you've seen the cheesy commercials and your third question the tv shows are rated by neilsen and the radio stations by arbitron those companies provide the advertisers with how many eyeballs or ears are tuning in and that drives up the cost per spot on that station versus a station with fewer eyeballs so if fox in baltimore is airing simpsons re runs that gets more eyeballs than the abc in baltiore who's airing re runs of frasier so people spend more to get their spots on the simpsons if you look up nexstar or young or sinclair on the internet yahoo finance you can see how much money they make selling space on a frequency of the spectrum Cable television Television syndication Fox Broadcasting Company American Broadcasting Company NFL on television ITV Major League Baseball television contracts Channel 4 Australian Broadcasting Corporation Wal-Mart CBS BBC Television commercial Public Broadcasting Service Music radio Fox News National Public Radio Soap opera Live Aid MTV Broadcasting MLB on FOX Insurance Television WNEP-TV Advertising NBC Television in Canada NASCAR WCCO Home Box Office Air America Radio Ford Motor Company Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
