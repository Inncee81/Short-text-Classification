what do you think needs to be done to restore middle class america and their self worth iamerica for quite some time has been moving from an industry based ecomy to a service based economy this has resulted over the last twenty to thirty yrs of the elimination of unions skilled laborers forcing them to change occupations several times this takes a toll on the laborer being retrained laid off retrained and laid off again untill they that were once highly skilled laborers are reduced to lackeys and degraded every step of the way while large conglomerations and ulilities circumvented the antiquated anti monopoly laws by merging under one company while giving the idea that they are diversifing others merge with technical loopholes in the law by avoiding the spirit in which the anti trust laws were written and probably with outright bribes t you forgot to add that during the retraining most people are earning less than what they were before the rich get richer and the middle class and rest become poorer laws are now aimed at making it harder for someone to get ahead in life insuring the rich stay in their socio economic class the only way to get ahead it seems is by treachery and thievery i think people realize this and have become numb and accepting of this situation for some reason also school costs are outrageous by the time someone graduates from college they are tens of thousands dollars in debt not a way to start your career and life out what needs to be done is that government needs to stop backing big business when its the small business that creates all of the jobs also a few heroes need to step up and create new rules for the social class to admire and look up to so we strive to better ourselves free education for the poor and middle class make the rich pay somehow Unemployment Economic inequality Education in the People's Republic of China Capitalism American individualist anarchism Microeconomics Minimum wage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economic history of Japan Tax Social Security (United States) Public policy Privatization Flat tax Outsourcing Capital accumulation Wal-Mart Economy of the United States Mergers and acquisitions Taxation in the United States Freeters Free trade Affirmative action Citigroup Inflation Mutual fund Economy of Africa Liberalism New Deal Great Depression Economy of Pakistan Exploitation Trade union Social Security debate (United States) Class in the contemporary United States Arturo Frondizi Slavery Labor-power Bank History of the United States (1918-1945) Tariff Unemployment benefit Intellectual property Weimar Republic History of the United States (1865-1918) Peleliu CPU design Surplus value Economy of the Republic of Ireland Anti-communism Monopoly Government debt Progressive tax Antitrust Publicly funded medicine Economy of Norway TransUnion Social structure of the United States Software patent debate Supply and demand Airline Economic history of Canada Economy of Russia London Congestion Charge Simone Weil Labour economics Education reform Deflation (economics) Economy of Macau Middle class Criticism of libertarianism Roaring Twenties Reaganomics Education in Romania Wealth Mercantilism Health insurance Economy of Trinidad and Tobago Software engineering Communism Gold standard Education in Germany Graduate school Economy of India Education in the United States Boston and Lowell Railroad Education in Japan Division of labour Wealth condensation Keynesian economics Celtic Tiger
