is it hard to be a cashier at wal mart i was a cashier at wal mart for a while but then i quit because i didn't like the people i worked with now they have built a supercenter the one i worked at was not a supercenter i was just curious what the difference is between the two is the pay any higher how do you scan the produce just some info would be a great help thanks i doubt that the pay would be higher at a supercenter they would just need more wal mart employees as to scanning the produce i would think it would be the same way that my local grocery store does it currently they look up the produce code in a booklet that they have at the register if wal mart doesn't have a sticker on the produce that says what the code is enter it into the register system and weigh it on a scale at the register Wal-Mart Hypermarket Sears Holdings Corporation Bank ASDA Bridgewater, Nova Scotia Supermarket Wall Street Tesco Electronic voting X86 assembly language Unemployment Argos (retailer) BIOS Vehicle registration plate Digital circuit Geographic information system Al-Qaeda in Iraq Computer virus SAS System Tax Cash register Assembly language German car number plates Apollo Guidance Computer Booting Primerica Financial Services Fundamental attribution error Automatic teller machine Apple IIGS United States Postal Service AmigaOS Labor theory of value Costco Computed tomography Domain Name System Sinclair ZX81 Piggly Wiggly MOS Technology 6502 Virtual memory Automatic number plate recognition PDP-11 Department store Temporal database Flat tax Early IBM disk storage RFID In-N-Out Burger Online music store British national identity card Meijer RISC Aldi ZX Spectrum Apple Computer British small press comics Harmonic series (music) Public domain Motorola 68000 Visual Basic Best Buy Cashiers, North Carolina Pretty Good Privacy CPU design Toll road Renewable energy Shoppers Drug Mart Vowel Acme Markets Universal Product Code Public policy Gross domestic product 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Windows XP 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Management information system Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma SCO-Linux controversies X-ray Sensor Life insurance Kroger Amiga Power IKEA Slot machine Subroutine Plame affair Point of sale Bass guitar Supermarket Sweep 64-bit Password Atari 8-bit family Cheque Destiny's Child Radio Compact disc Health insurance MiniDisc Plagiarism
