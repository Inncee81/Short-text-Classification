california based internet company where to incorporate hello we are a california based internet start up planning to provide web application that can be used globally we are ready to incorporate now please recommend a state where we should incorporate considering the non location based nature of our business some of the following have shown up when i did my initial research wyoming florida nevada delaware btw our office is based in california thanks i would recommend california or delaware for the following reasons as the rd response pointed out even if you register outside of california you'll have to qualify to do business in california anyway so cost wise its cheapest to do it in california if you really are a tech based start up my assumption is that you'll want to seek venture funding venture funds like to invest in delaware corporations and they are ok investing in california corporations they'll do other ones but its a pain in the ass because most of the law firms they use don't have like a nevada or florida office so they'll have to hire local counsel etc and that all gets netted out of your investment proceeds at closing the only reason that people like nevada and florida is that they've got very liberal shareholder exclusion and privacy provisions and i've also heard they've got lax conflicted party provisions this means that if you run the company and you want to be secretive about your company vis a vis creditors or a minority shareholder it might be an advantage to be nevada or florida but a i assume you're not running some little cash flow business where you are worried about that but trying to build something for an exit and b you don't get those protections anyway since because you are primarily based in california you are a quasi california corporation immediately whether or not you incorporate here due to section of the california corporations code you can look it up for the specific provisions you are subject to but look at the bright side in california you are subject to california labor law so when some vc tries to buy your company and subjects you to a non compete they have to obey the very limited non compete availability in california search using www yahoo com search Corporation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporate governance Intellectual property Mutual fund Insurance Life insurance Taxation in the United States Mergers and acquisitions Enron Corporation Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Bechtel Corporation Citigroup United Kingdom corporation tax Corporate finance Wal-Mart Microsoft Management information system Free trade Trademark Same-sex marriage in Canada Dot-com Bretton Woods system Elections in the United States Democratic Party (United States) Public domain Annuity Education in the People's Republic of China Stock Minimum wage Hedge fund Strategic management Microeconomics Venture capital Google Wall Street AMD Management Enterprise content management Lawyer Ford Motor Company Temasek Holdings Surveillance Trust (Law) USA Coalition Provisional Authority Pretty Good Privacy BT Group plc Patent ZIP Code Income trust Australian constitutional law Incorporation (business) Interstate Highway Democracy Political corruption Globalization Royal Dutch Shell Berkshire Hathaway Capital accumulation Hillary Rodham Clinton U.S. presidential election, 2000 Investment bank Race to the bottom Business ethics Bond FairTax Warren Buffett Cable television Airline Sun Microsystems Monopoly Privatization Breastfeeding Trade union Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Amtrak Barbara Boxer Mediation New Deal Finance Legal system of Hong Kong 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Institutional fund management United Parcel Service Amazon.com Idaho Bank of China (Hong Kong) Security (finance) Corporate personhood ITV Due process The Walt Disney Company Legal research
