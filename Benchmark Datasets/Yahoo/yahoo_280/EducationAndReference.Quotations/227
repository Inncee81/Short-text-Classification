grammar questions how can you tell when to use who or whom when using quotations like the one i used earlier should the question mark be out of the quotes or within the teacher's enthusiasm and obvious passion for the subject inspired students who had never before been interested in shakespeare why do we use who instead of what here when in this sentence its considered incorrect when the hometown crowd realized that its team was about to lose the game they started to leave the stadium its incorrect to use they instead of it you can try rephrasing the sentence in your head whom indicates an action that moves towards the other person for example the man whom i gave the money to could be put as i gave the money to him the pronoun him and particularly the final letter m gives you the clue as to whether to use who or whom it just doesn't sound right to say the man who i gave the money to if you're not sure which to use say to yourself did someone do something to that other person if yes then you should use whom as regards the quotation with the question mark you are quite correct in putting the question mark outside the quotes because your question was about the two words who and whom and it concluded the entire sentence the difference between who and what is usually defined as who refers to a human being or beings and what refers to an animal or an object i know that shakespeare said in macbeth what bloody man is that but he was asking what kind of man that was and he was not referring directly to the man now the hometown crowd strictly speaking it should be used before started but it just doesn't sound right it's what some call literary licence everyone knows that a crowd is made up of individual persons and that we should regard the crowd as a homegeneous mass as long as it is static i e watching the game but as soon as the crowd it starts to break up leave the stadium the crowd becomes a collection of individuals who are rightly referred to as they German grammar Non-native pronunciations of English English grammar Philosophy of language Slovak language Theory of conduct American and British English differences Spanish pronouns Objectivist philosophy Quotation mark Wheel of Fortune Tamil language New York Giants Franz Boas Pronoun Grammatical gender Disputed English grammar Jeopardy!
