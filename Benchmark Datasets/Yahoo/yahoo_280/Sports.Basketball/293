ncaa question were can i find a list of ncaa schools with mens division i basketball listed by what each school specifies in law business medicine ect i would imagine that any division school would have a business school with many having an attached law school however medical schools are a different situation say like lamarcus aldridge or durrant went to texas where there is no attached medical school on campus or even a medical school in the same town with the closest medical school being miles away but going to any division or division ii or division iii school does not stop you from applying and being accepted at a medical school now where the ih w bridge just collapsed wednesday that bridge was one of two bridges to the north of the university of minnesota campus just blocks away there are also two bridges just to the south of the university of minnesota campus there were a total of about four bridges up to last wednesday within a mile or so of the university of minnesota campus point being is that the university of minnesota has an attached medical school unlike some division i schools who have medical schools in the school system but just located in a different city my point is that applying for law or medical school is that it is not necessary to attend undergraduate school at that campus or even in that university system if you want details on a specific school as what majors they offer then i would recommend that you do an internet search of that division i's official school website to find out what is offered which at most division i schools should be a to z with the law school and medical schools usually being separate detached schools whether on the same campus or in a different city in the same university system to get to something like a medical school you apply to as many as you can if you qualify as there are only a limited number of spaces so a medical school often times will not be the same as an undergraduate school for most medical students National Basketball Association Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics Women's National Basketball Association Volleyball NBA Finals Chinese Basketball Association Dodgeball Basketball Shyness Street photography Philip Zimbardo Street basketball College basketball Netball Julius Erving Sylvia Sidney Big East Conference New Jersey Nets Andre Agassi Magic Johnson Doug Collins New Mexico Lobo Basketball Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Wilt Chamberlain Tennis court Everwood Alfred Lee Yao Ming Vince Carter Four square Playoff Moses Malone Detroit Pistons Rasheed Wallace Love-shyness Louis XV of France Roger Federer University of Kentucky Wheelchair basketball James Naismith Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics Grace Coolidge Atlantic Coast Conference Korfball Coyote Ugly (film) Badminton University of Missouri - Columbia Memorial Gymnasium (Vanderbilt University) Alexis Bledel Tag Remus Lupin Dartmouth College Bill Russell (basketball) Pat Summitt The Championships, Wimbledon Tim Duncan 2005 NBA Finals Power forward (basketball) George Mikan Lisa Leslie Mike Krzyzewski Utah State University Jesse L.
