is jermaine o'neal being selfish he wants to give himself a better chance to win a championship but he said this i love indiana and the fans and we have a lot of nice young talent but obviously they're in a situation now where they're rebuilding o'neal said i told them i can't be in a rebuilding mode right now i'm at a point in my career where i can't wait another five years to contend i'm not in a position physically to take in five years of losses and downtime translation they'll be horrible in the next years in the eastern conference larry bird is a hard man to deal with o'neal said he tries to make unfair trades he wants to gut a team but the lakers are trying to get over the hump i want indiana to benefit but with some nice young players and draft picks i want to make it clear that i don't want to gut a team that i come to because then it'll be like i'm in indiana all over again isn't he basically talking crap about his gm is that ok for him to do so he's a great guy he's saying it how it is and speaking unlike other nba players who just try to make themselves look good he stating the facts and instead of stereotyping kobe as selfish he is looking at his situation and understanding it about larry he is what he is and every gm wants to get good value its not wrong to say that he wants a good trade also about indian sucking he is reaching his peak and he repeated many times he loves indiana but he sees an opportunity and who wouldn't want to go to an opportunity you woul grant hill wants a ring jermaine wants to go help another team he is being perfectly right and curt in what he is saying Michael Jordan Larry Bird NBA Finals Chicago Bulls New York Knicks Utah Jazz San Antonio Spurs New Mexico Lobo Basketball Wayne Gretzky Julius Erving Pittsburgh Steelers Houston Rockets Cincinnati Bengals 1957 World Series Los Angeles Clippers K__rp__t 1986 NBA Draft 2005 NBA Finals Indiana Pacers Orlando Magic Major League Baseball New York Giants Los Angeles Kings Dennis Rodman Super Bowl XXVII Detroit Red Wings New Jersey Nets Milwaukee Bucks Tim Duncan National Football League 2004 NBA Finals Washington Wizards Karl Malone Craps Baseball statistics Steve Nash Lakers-Celtics rivalry Super Bowl XIV National Basketball Association Wilt Chamberlain Super Bowl VI Tic-Tac-Dough Robert Horry World Series Buffalo Bills Ipswich Town F.C.
