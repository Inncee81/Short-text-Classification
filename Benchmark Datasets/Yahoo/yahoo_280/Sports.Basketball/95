where can i find some competion to play with i go to the y but it seems like none of the good players ever show up till week ends in winter the courts has nobody there most the time unfortunately nobody on my team likes to play in the off season i heard playing with better players makes you better where else should i go yea see the thing is it might be hard getting a ride to the ghetto if you're in socal go to venice beach since i don't know where you are go to the most ghettoest neighborhood around your town and there has to be some rough and tough players out there or you can always go on a college gym Volleyball Leeds United F.C.
