laker fans i have a question so if we did keep caron butler and chucky atkins where would we have played those two guys sure phil jackson will make atkins come off the bench but what about butler c chris mihm pf lamar sf walton sg kobe pg smush where would butler go or would phil jackson make smush sit on the bench which he should've done and make butler and kobe the starting back court since he's in love with tall guards in the backcourt but then again we would've had a thin front line cuz devean george foot and turiaf heart were injured and bynum was a rookie coming so imagine today was what woulud you have done with the roster with atkins and butler traded them away for someone else keep them but if we did we would've been thin in the center spot you guys do know next to kobe and lamar luke walton is the best at understanding the triangle offense phil jackson loves this guy he gave him plenty of playing time in his rookie season which phil jackson rarely does why do you think with phil jackson's recommendation the lakers just signed walton to a year million deal he won't start or play well for another team but for phil jackson's offense he is the perfect fit and he's very valuable in his system the question would not be where they would go i agree with the trade to get kwame even though he is a stiff because he may have worked out the problem is that the lakers kept devean george instead of caron if you keep caron instead then you have your third scorer devean never materialized into that third scorer both made almost the same amount of money at that time and the lakers let devean walk the following year so if they planned to get rid of him anyway why not do it then mitch cupcake should have known the kobe was working out with caron and they have a genuine good relationship it was obvious from the start whenever kobe was out caron took over like kobe used to do when shaq went out those two jelled on the court and off caron allowed kobe time to heal and rest because he could score with the best of them mitch paid no attention to this and didn't ask kobe how he felt about it until after the trade was made if i had a choice of starters caron would have started before walton thus giving the lakers more scoring power walton could then be inserted for either to keep the flow of the triangle as far a chucky he could score but he couldn't play d the idea of the trade was good it was just one player off Kobe Bryant Chicago Bulls Los Angeles Clippers Los Angeles Lakers New York Knicks Steve Nash Indiana Pacers Phil Jackson New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets NBA Finals 2004 NBA Finals Toronto Raptors Michael Jordan New York Giants Carolina Panthers Gary Payton (basketball) 1986 NBA Draft July 2004 in sports Boston Bruins Yao Ming Pittsburgh Steelers 1957 World Series Minnesota Timberwolves Katelyn Faber National Football League Toronto Blue Jays Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Babe Ruth Kwame Brown Larry Bird Orlando Magic Basketball Leeds United F.C.
