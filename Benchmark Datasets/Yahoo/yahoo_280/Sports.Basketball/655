should reggie miller stay retired it was a report sayin he was thinking about joining boston what do you think i think he should realistically how is he going to contribute meaningfully let alone to the extent that he'd help the celtics in a playoff situation sure miller is one of the best clutch shooters of all time but he's been retired for a couple years and if he isn't already in his 's he's very close he's going to be a defensive liability will have trouble getting open to begin with and won't be able to play many minutes plus the celtics already have ray allen and and miller's basically an older version of allen so miller's only going to be there to rest allen and as insurance in cast of injury and because of that miller's not going to be on the floor when crunch time comes around so there goes his greatest strength obviously miller should do whatever he wants to do but i think it's in his best interests to just run a trash talking clinic and bring young players up in the fine art of talking smack NBA Finals Basketball Oscar Robertson Steve Nash Chicago Bulls Julius Erving Tim Duncan John Stockton Michael Jordan New York Knicks Utah Jazz Boston Celtics National Basketball Association San Antonio Spurs NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team Larry Bird 1986 NBA Draft Dream Team Karl Malone George Mikan NBA Draft Bill Russell (basketball) Bobby Knight NBA Rookie of the Year Award Jerry Lucas Allen Iverson Center (basketball) Hakeem Olajuwon David Robinson (basketball player) 2005 NBA Finals Baby boomer Larry Brown Wilt Chamberlain LeBron James 1984 NBA Draft Emanuel Gin__bili Indiana Pacers 1981 baseball strike Toronto Raptors Stephon Marbury Houston Rockets Robert Horry New Mexico Lobo Basketball Orlando Magic Tim Hardaway Denver Nuggets Pete Maravich Detroit Pistons Continental Basketball Association David Stern Kappa Alpha Psi Dwyane Wade Bill Laimbeer Reggie Miller NBA Live series Ben Wallace Magic Johnson Golden State Warriors Charles Barkley Carlos Arroyo Portland Trail Blazers NBA Jam Milwaukee Bucks 1981 World Series Chuck Cooper Kevin Garnett Moses Malone Jason Kidd Isiah Thomas 2004 NBA Finals Dikembe Mutombo Tony Parker Dennis Rodman Yao Ming 1990s Cincinnati Bengals Salary cap Philadelphia 76ers Muggsy Bogues Phoenix Suns Don Nelson Toronto Blue Jays Hank Aaron Cleveland Cavaliers January 2005 in sports November 2004 in sports Luther Head Major League Baseball television contracts New Jersey Nets Los Angeles Clippers Rasheed Wallace NBA Street Sunday Times Rich List 2004 Kevin McHale Sue Bird Los Angeles Dodgers Phil Jackson SBC Center Kobe Bryant Temple University
