what is the difference between rent and lease what is the difference between rent and lease kindly enlighten the circumstances under which the rent is used and under what circumstances the lease is used kindly educate me with the examples and illustrations with legal positions when you rent out a property you will need to decide if you wish to offer your tenants a lease or a rental agreement although these terms are often used interchangeably they are not the same a lease for a rental property has a finite term such as six months or a year for which a tenant will agree to rent the property during this time period also known as the duration of the lease the tenant and the landlord are bound to uphold the terms of the written agreement having a lease means that neither party may change any terms of the agreement until the lease expires unless both parties agree to the change for example if the current amount of rent is per month you may not increase this amount until the lease expires under a lease tenants are obligated to make monthly rent payments as agreed upon as well as follow any code of conduct or other stipulations in the lease while it's in effect it also means that a tenant may not vacate the property without breaking their lease in some cases the tenant may be held liable for the remaining amount of rent due under the lease or they may be required to find another person to fulfill their end of the lease a lease is generally used for landlords who prefer the stability that comes with locking in a tenant for a specified period of time if you have a mortgage payment to meet having this set amount of income can help you budget your expenses most tenants are familiar with long term leases and will not have a problem committing rental agreements differ from leases in a number of ways standard rental agreements are month to month and there is no set period of residence both the landlord and tenant are free at the end of each day period to make changes to the rental agreement subject to any rent control laws these changes may include a rent increase modification of terms of the rental agreement or a request to vacate the property however in most states both landlord and tenant are required to give days' notice before any changes can be made if your state does not require a notice you are free to change any part of the rental agreement at your discretion rental agreements are useful for landlords who are having difficulty attracting new tenants especially if they are in areas that cater to students or professionals on the move they appreciate the freedom a month to month agreement provides and landlords who offer these arrangements may have an edge over landlords who require long term leases a rental agreement is typically auto renewed without notice after each day period has elapsed as long as neither party has stated that the tenant will vacate the premises before you rent out your property you will need to take into account the differences between a lease and a rental agreement this will allow you to make the best decision for your needs Eviction Estoppel Concurrent estate Housing cooperative Waste (law) United Kingdom corporation tax Intellectual property Insurance Microeconomics Renting Public domain Mortgage Annuity Property (ownership right) Divorce Treaty Barrister Babylonian law American individualist anarchism Islamic banking Copyright law of the United Kingdom Life insurance Trust (Law) USA Taxation in the United States Real property Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Article One of the United States Constitution Copyright Monopoly (game) Capitalism Anarchism and capitalism Education in the United States United States Constitution Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Serfdom Eminent domain Judiciary of Hong Kong Property tax Modding Student loan New Hampshire Supreme Court Standard form contract Public-key cryptography Domestic partnerships in California Child support Intermediate consumption Squatting FairTax Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Bond Negligence Bretton Woods system International law Patent Free trade Allodial title Rent control Kyoto Protocol President of Germany Economy of Russia Geolibertarianism Copyright infringement of software Personal finance European Convention on Human Rights Credit card Same-sex marriage in Canada Thomas de Littleton Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Unreformed House of Commons Slander and libel Land reform Apartment building Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India SCO-Linux controversies Passport Bailment Football (soccer) Consensus decision-making Gentrification French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools International Criminal Court Economic rent Harlem Euro Board of Cooperative Educational Services International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Poker jargon
