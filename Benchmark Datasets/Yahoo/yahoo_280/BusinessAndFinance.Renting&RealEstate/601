sheriff's sale homes i am very interested in a home that is going up for sheriff's sale at the end of the month my question is are you able to view the inside of a home prior to the sale also does anyone know if you are able to make an offer or purchase the home prior to the day of sale i live in ohio if that makes a difference i have also contacted the sheriff's department several times but the person who i am directed to talk with is not available until the middle of next week thanks for your help in advance sheriff's sales are a great place to find a home if you are willing to put some money into the home you must contact the sheriff's department usually it's secretary to learn more about the property and if you are able to view the home prior most homes you are able to view prior to or the day of the sale you might want to contact the mortgage company prior to the sale and inquire about the price you may have to wait until after the sale and if the mortgage company happens to buy it back then you would be able to make an offer good luck chubi Mortgage FairTax Internet fraud Mutual fund Plame affair Islamic banking Great Depression Real estate broker Bond Life insurance Sheriff Intellectual property Wal-Mart $ale of the Century Monopoly (game) Federal National Mortgage Association Unconscionability Warren Buffett Donald Trump UK Singles Chart Best Buy Predatory lending Short selling Video game crash of 1983 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Insurance Enron Corporation Tax Security (finance) Theory of conduct Citigroup Foreclosure Joseph Smith, Jr. American Broadcasting Company Tesco Nintendo Management Monetary policy Social rule Commodity Customer relationship management First-sale doctrine Treasury security Contract Ashton-Tate Plame affair timeline Microeconomics Auction Donald Rumsfeld Tennessee State Constitution Mergers and acquisitions Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March MMORPG Branch Davidian Gross domestic product Reservoir Dogs Title insurance Athens County, Ohio Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Billboard Hot 100 Mortgage-backed security Electronic commerce Government National Mortgage Association The Standard Bank Hamilton County, Ohio Oakland Athletics Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq Sears Holdings Corporation Prices of production Supply and demand Taxation in the United States Sales Personal finance Price discrimination Arbitrage Primerica Financial Services Deflation (economics) Sears Catalog Home Home Box Office Value added tax Monroe County, Ohio Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Amway Divorce Animal Crossing Knox County, Ohio Logan County, Ohio Clermont County, Ohio Patent Trumbull County, Ohio Deed RKO Pictures Montgomery County, Ohio Stamp duty Privatization Irish Property Bubble Economics
