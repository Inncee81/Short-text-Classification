if i partake in a land contract can i sue the person on the first mortgage if they don't make timely payments how does this work legally i'm trying to find more financing options and this sounds safe the only thing i'm worried about is if the seller decides to default on their st mortgage there would be an attorney involved i'm not entirely stupid we've been doing real estate land contracts for over years and if done properly you really don't have to worry about the seller taking the money you send for payment on the first mortgage and going to the casino instead the key to guaranteeing you that the mortgage will be paid by the seller when you make your payment to the seller is in the escrow company instructions you must have the seller agree within the contract that when you make the payment the amount received by the escrow company will be disbursed first to pay the underlying debt of the mortgage that the seller owes with the balance payable to the seller at the end of the year the escrow company third uninterested party licensed to be an escrow company will send you a showing how much interest you have paid on your debt to the seller default of the mortgage would now fall on you if your payment is not made and not on the seller who is relying on you to make their first mortgage payment best of luck to you Mortgage Derivative (finance) Real estate broker Islamic banking Life insurance Debt Annuity Contract Insurance Security (finance) Allodial title Short selling Student loan Collateralized mortgage obligation Unconscionability Option Taxation in the United States 401(k) Assignment (law) Credit card Personal finance Title insurance Concurrent estate Credit derivative Microeconomics Bank Advance fee fraud Futures contract Tax Donald Trump Internet fraud Interest Monopoly (game) Leasing Oil-for-Food Programme Money Estoppel Put option Corporate finance Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Construction Public-key cryptography Arbitrage Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Call option Deflation (economics) Intellectual property FairTax Commodity markets Primerica Financial Services U.S. public debt Credit default swap Conveyancing Mutual fund Consideration Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Government debt Salary cap E-mail spam Health insurance Real estate bubble Annual percentage rate Rational pricing Stock Child support Real estate Cheque Economy of the United States Bank fraud Gold standard Housing cooperative Credit score Credit risk Predatory lending Trust (Law) USA Capitalism Babylonian law Lawyer Pyramid scheme Treasury security Finance Real estate developer Copyleft Betting (poker) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Actuarial notation Accounting methods Schabir Shaik Trial Cost of capital Liability
