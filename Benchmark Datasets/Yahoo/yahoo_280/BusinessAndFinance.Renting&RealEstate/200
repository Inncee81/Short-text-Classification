i want to buy a house in houston how can i find a good real estate agent i am a first time buyer i need a real estate agent how would i know if the agent is good there are so many on the internet does it matter if the agent belongs to well know companies like remax first off finding a realtor is kind of like finding a shrink you have to find one who you feel comfortable with and who is trustworthy for that reason you should talk to as many as possible instead of trusting the first one you meet one way to do this is to look for houses in your price range in good neighborhoods get in contact with the real estate agents who are selling those tell them what you like about the house in question and ask them if they will help you find other houses that have those same characteristics find out which agents are cooperative and which of those you like and keep working with them obviously the for sale by owner guys won't help you find other houses and obviously the larger companies like remax and red carpet are generally more trustworthy than nifty ned's real estate still you should find out about an agent's creds how long they have been working their specialty continuing education certifications awards etc and even google for complaints about them usually the good agents with large companies will be quite open about their credentials good luck Pretty Good Privacy Internet fraud White flight Mortgage Microeconomics Real estate Mutual fund Insurance Auction Contract Mediation Life insurance Deflation (economics) Trusted computing Tax Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act SCO-Linux controversies Dividend Citigroup American Broadcasting Company Ford Motor Company Babylonian law Multiple Listing Service Housing cooperative American Psycho Concurrent estate GNU General Public License Stock Sears Holdings Corporation Supply and demand Plame affair Publishing Enron Corporation Mergers and acquisitions Real estate bubble Maryland General Assembly Election, 2006 Trademark Economics Islamic banking Mid-levels Capital accumulation Productive and unproductive labour Naming rights Retailer Google Avenue Q Monopoly (game) Surplus value Oakland Athletics Title insurance Station wagon Public-key cryptography Estate agent (United Kingdom) Price discrimination Donald Trump Intellectual property Harlem Sears Catalog Home Monetary policy Best Buy LiveJournal The Emancipation of Mimi Council house My Little Pony Advance fee fraud Gold as an investment Marketing Real property RuneScape economy Tesco Insider trading Karl Rove Crystal Lake, Illinois Erling Dekke N__ss UK Singles Chart Warranty Airline American Football League Property (ownership right) Option Eaton's Vehicle registration plate Ford Falcon Inventory Real estate economics Sport utility vehicle Short selling Restrictive covenant Microsoft Government National Mortgage Association W.
