what is better renting out or selling your home i love my home but need to get a bigger house we thought about renting it out does anyone know how to go about this or would it be better to just sell it we want to try and make some money out of it if we can any thoughts thanks it depends on what you wnat to and are able to do for long term financial gain renting is by far the better option property investment is by far the best way to develop your financial future you retain ownership the renter pays all or most of the expenses you continue to get tax deductions off the rental property as years go by the rent will increase giving you a rising monthly income while property values will also increase giving you a much greater asset there are a couple of issues that are important though that could make this a bad choice for many people number one is will you originally get enough rent to pay the mortgage and expenses if you do it is a much easier situation but if you can't there may be years where you must pay a little every month out of your pocket to cover the difference between rent and mortgage many people can't do this fortunately most homes can be rented out to at least cover expenses there will have to be management and this is no easy thing you would either have to deal with being a landlord and dealing with renters and hundreds of books have been written on that subject are you willing to be called in the middle of the night because of a stopped toilet or you can hire a management company a management company will take of the rental income in fees which cuts into your monthly income but maybe worth it if you only deal with property questions monthly instead of daily i have owned rental properties both as a landlord who handled his own as well as having a management company take care of the properties it was quite profitable and if it hadn't been for a divorce that came along i would still be doing it with the glut of homes on the market now i am planning on re entering the market the decision depends on you being a landlord is a hands on investment you have to deal with people some of who are great some of who think all landlords are scum when in reality you are just a business person trying to provide an extremely important service if you have the right temperament it will be the best thing you ever did for your family's security if you don't it will be hell good luck Mortgage Housing cooperative Personal finance Insurance Taxation in the United States Leasing Renting Mutual fund Microeconomics Warren Buffett Donald Trump United Kingdom corporation tax Monopoly (game) Annuity Life insurance FairTax Tax Capital accumulation Bond Leasehold estate Public housing Flat tax Capitalism Real estate bubble Security (finance) Property tax Citigroup Finance Intermediate consumption Economic rent Intellectual property Rental agreement Bank Health insurance Productive and unproductive labour 401(k) Anarchism and capitalism Privatization Progressive tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Value added Economy of the United States Stock Inflation Blockbuster Video Harlem Corporate finance Temasek Holdings Income trust First-sale doctrine Interest Socialist economics Operating surplus Real estate economics Corporation Hedge fund Economy of India Islamic banking Great Depression Supply and demand Political economy Social Security (United States) Property (ownership right) Gentrification National Kidney Foundation Singapore Credit card Predatory lending Labor theory of value Economy of Russia Income statement Unreformed House of Commons Accounting methods Divorce Trust (Law) USA PE ratio Economics Babylonian law Social Security debate (United States) Cable television Supply-side economics Real estate developer Wal-Mart Primerica Financial Services Capital gains tax Money Dividend Corporate governance Netflix Estoppel Debt
