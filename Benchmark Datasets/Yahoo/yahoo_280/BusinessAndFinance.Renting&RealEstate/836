moving a double wide home i live in a mobile home park where i own the home and rent the land i have a double wide home the wheels are still under it i was thinking if the owner of the park will be able to move the home to a different area of the park will it be a major job to move its only a few houses away but right now my back yard needs alot of mowing and a trail is behind it which i get alot of wheelers and kids walking across my yard this area would be more private to move a double wide home you have to split it into two and move each piece seperetly that will up the cost and then you have to zipp it back together will be more hastle then any thing might not be worth it if your only going a couple houses over Property tax Mobile home Pittsburgh Steelers Rail terminology Glossary of American football Celebration, Florida Property (ownership right) San Francisco 49ers Rent control Monopoly (game) GunBound Lawn mower Solarquest Blackburn Rovers F.C.
