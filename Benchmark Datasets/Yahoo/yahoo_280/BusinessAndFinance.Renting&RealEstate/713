are there companies that specialize in just building houses for private owners of property i own a vacant lot that can be built on and want to contract an entire house is this a good idea how much would an entire single family house cost to build first find out the zoning ordinances for the area in which your land is located if it is zoned residential then start doing your homework regarding the utility issues in your area the lot may or may not have utilities that can be tapped into for instance it may not have public water available in which case you may have to resort to well water if public sewer systems are not established in that area then septic tanks can be installed and maintained to take care of disposing used water and waste if natural gas lines aren't running through your property like many homes you can possibly rely on propane if you have never contracted the building of a property i would recommend that you hire a very reputable custom home builder in your area also consult with an architech to help you design the layout of your home and he will provide your builder with blueprints to follow in the building process be sure that the three of you communicate well with one another and are on the same page this is your home built with your money they are working for you and there is no such thing as a stupid question when it comes to such a large investment how much your home will cost depends will depend on many factors if you want extremely highend cabinetry flooring bathroom and kitchen counters and fixtures it will cost more fireplaces moldings the types of windows doors heigth of ceilings lighting fixtures as well as energy efficiant insulation all effect the price everything from the type of foundation to the type of roofing material have a broad range of prices ultimately all of these choices determine the price per square foot that you will be paying for the home if you want more space and can live with fewer frills your home will obviously cost less per square foot you can have a more simple yet large home built now and add upgraded creature comforts later on as your income and budget allows keep in mind however that the larger the home the larger the utility bills to heat and cool it's best to build a home that is usual and customery for the surrounding area for example you probably wouldn't want to build an square foot tuscan villa nextdoor to a mobile home park or sewage treatment facility you also need to be careful about building something extremely unique to the area such as a log cabin or dome style home if will be needing a mortgage loan rather than paying cash the reason being the appraiser will have a hard time finding comperable home sales in the area from which to help determine the value of your home the home is the collateral for the lender in the event you default on your loan it's value is just as important as your credit worthiness to the lender my philosophy is live beneath your means and don't become overly extravagent when building a new home unless you are independently wealthy the newest craze at the home and garden convention is always extremely expensive when it first hits the market and comes down in price in a couple of years make sure that your home is built in such a way that it can be upgraded as your budget allows or your family grows if you have or plan to have a family consider implementing what's known as a split master concept the kid's bedrooms on one side of the home and the parent's on the other young children typically go to bed earlier than their parents and this allows the parents to have private time visiting without waking the children conversely teenagers may stay up later during the summer break and parents tend to want to be in a quieter part of the home and may go to bed earlier the split master allows parents the luxery of not having to hear their teen's giggling music or tv hopefully i cannot stress enough the importance of checking out the credentials of your builder with the home builder's association in your area request numerous references and view homes that you can validate were actually built by this builder it's hard to believe that some people do not have the skills and abilities that they represent make sure he or she has the required license and that it is up to date it is also imperative that the builder is in compliance with obtaining building permits otherwise the building process can come to a complete halt until they are obtained while you are being charged interim interest each day regardless of progress or lack thereof that is being made on your home check in on the job at random times and make sure that your builder has his crew doing their job at all times once completed enjoy the gift of homeownership
