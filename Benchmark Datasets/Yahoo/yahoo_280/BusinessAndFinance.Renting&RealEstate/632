holding deposits in california legal help please i gave as a holding deposit to my landlord on the th of july set to move in aug th as of yesterday i decided to not move in because of unforseen circumstances he called me today to let me know that he was keeping the and he might charge me for the additional day a day i looked up holding deposits in california and it states that landlords can keep some or all of the deposit if they incur additional costs to rent it the previous tenant paid through the end of july and so the apartment has only been vacant for days and being that the manager stated he had other tenants lined up the apartment wasn't going to be ready until the next week he was installing carpet and paint the charges he incurs really are not that high am i entitiled to some or all my deposit back and can he charge me for those days he doesn't have a tenant also and here's where i got stupid there's nothing in writing no receipt no lease everything was verbal also if i put a hold on the money order then get my money back will i get into trouble since technically since all we had was a verbal agreement and there is nothing in writing just my application the fact that you paid him money implies that there was an agreement in place so a written contract for deposit isn't necessary he is entitled to keep the this late in the game but he can't charge you another per day that is when he would need something in writing stating that you were aware that you would be charged that if you did not move in you see the difference let him keep the he's entitled to it it's very very hard to find a tenant after the st of the month and most likely he will lose rent for the entire month of august b c you backed out next time get everything in writing and don't worry about him collecting anymore he doesn't have a legal leg to stand on Leasehold estate Leasing Rental agreement Estoppel Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Eviction Islamic banking Annuity Credit card Avenue Q Housing cooperative United Kingdom corporation tax Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Divorce Babylonian law Microeconomics Mortgage Insurance Betting (poker) Concurrent estate Taxation in the United States National Football League Friends Monopoly (game) 2003 California recall Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Knots Landing Apartment Social rule Barrister Mutual fund Salary cap Hercules Linton Plame affair SCO-Linux controversies Bond 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Property (ownership right) Rent control Euro Stuyvesant Town Manorialism Public domain Shaggy dog story Satchel Paige Surveillance Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Major League Baseball television contracts Surplus value Judiciary of Hong Kong 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Alex Ferguson New Deal Windows XP Kodocha Craps National Kidney Foundation Singapore Newcastle United F.C. 407 ETR Assignment (law) Politics of Hong Kong Short selling Gold standard James T.
