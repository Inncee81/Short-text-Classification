credit for apartments would you be able to rent an apartment with not good credit what if you have a roommate what affects credit i did have a credit card but i paid all that off do unpaid bills effect credit or not i have a bankruptcy on my credit credit score is only and i was able to rent a nice place in a nice part of town with no cosigner i made sure the places i was looking at were well under the of my take home income that most landlords require that was the st step the nd was to not lie about my credit i told the leasors upfront that i have bad credit before i let them run my credit this way they could tell me upfront what their policy is on bad credit bankruptcy to be honest usually they only make you pay a double deposit but occasionally they require st last and security deposit with bad credit rd they will not rent to you if you have an eviction or a forclosure so if you have one of those you might want to consider renting from a private citizen who will take a word of mouth referal instead of running a credit check also many places i went to wanted discharge papers from the bankruptcy they do not rent if you are in bankrutpcy and not discharged so if you have a bankruptcy you may want to bring those papers with you Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Money Bank Taxation in the United States Student loan Leasehold estate Credit score Apartment Bankruptcy Public housing Credit card Economic rent Mortgage Bond Hani Hanjour Rent control Rental agreement Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Social Security debate (United States) Renting CPU cache Housing cooperative Identity theft Donald Trump Interest Deflation (economics) Money supply Bank fraud Economy of Russia Babylonian law Gold standard Appeal Avenue Q Irish Land Act Internet fraud Government debt Poker jargon Solarquest Eviction Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Estoppel NorthBridge Apartment Complex Anarchism and capitalism Cheque FairTax Bankruptcy in the United States Tom DeLay Annuity Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Leasing Chatham Square The Commons British House of Commons Vista Way Hyperinflation Pump It Up Capital accumulation Accounting methods Credit union Stuyvesant Town Identity document Fractional-reserve banking Debt consolidation Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Intermediate consumption Babe Ruth Schabir Shaik Trial 1957 World Series Land use forecasting Insurance Mutual fund Property tax Blackjack Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 The Inside Economy of India Value added Elections in Malaysia Gross domestic product Wonderful Town Social Security (United States) Sears Holdings Corporation Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Octopus card Monetary policy Theory of conduct Squatting One Tree Hill (TV series) Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) International Criminal Court Ocean's Twelve Debit card The Amazing Race Scottish clan Centrelink Prostitution Poverty line
