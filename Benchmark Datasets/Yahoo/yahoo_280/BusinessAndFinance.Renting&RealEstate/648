sue for an illegal apartment i recently moved out of my apartment for several reasons i was technically forced out with constant harssing of the landlord either by him screaming at me and my wife for little things like leaving the hall way light on or running the ac when it wasnt over a certain degree outside my job is going to relocate me in the coming months and to be nice i told my landlord and said that i would keep him posted on the date thats when he started harassing us about stupid things mentioned above well apparently he had an imaginary conversation with me and that i told him i was moving out in july but how could i give him a date when my job hasnt even given me a date a day after we move out he calls me and says hes keeping part of my deposit cause he has to repaint the apartment for his new tenants isnt repainting normal for when new tenants move in and to make it worst i just found out that the apartment is illegal can i sue for past rent and my deposit or should i just eat this one and make his life miserable like he had done to me and my wife by reporting the illegal apartment and the numerous zoning violations to the township im not a spiteful person but he made living there the past few months hell and keeping my deposit just tips the iceberg i want to know what are my options here are more details i had no written lease just verbal agreement that i could move into the apartment the state is nj and again the apartment is illegal the apartment was illegal cause he doesnt pay property tax for that apartment theres an oven and stove in there theres a gas fire range built into the wall theres a full bathroom all of which the township doesnt know exsists and doesnt pay taxes on any of them he put all that stuff in after and made it into a self made apartment so should i take him to civil court for my deposit then turn his a in and why hes repainting the gas fire range on the wall is the cause of the stain to which he says is cigarette smoke but its not on any of the other walls i've never heard of an illegal apartment in what way what kind of lease did you have re painting an apartment is considered regular maintenance of an apartment and he cannot hold your deposit for that only unless you wrecked the walls or painted it a color yourself that was not in keeping with your lease each state has different laws concerning rentals i know in nc a landlord or lessor cannot legally with hold a security deposit unless it is for repairs or cleaning not considered part of usual wear and tear the lessor must also provide the lessee in this case you with a copy of the charges that were deducted from the deposit ie let's say your deposit was he must provide you with a statement within so many days of you vacating the apartment stating something like oven left dirty cleaning broken window and so on unless you can prove he was harrassing you that is a moot point i would research rental laws in your state look over your rental agreement and then decide if small claims court or an attorney is your next move if it's going to cost more in time and grief than what the deposit was i would just chalk it up to a lesson learned all imho of course Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Rental agreement Kitchen Apartment Contract 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Sin City Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Karl Rove Estoppel SCO-Linux controversies Assignment (law) Renting Babylonian law Unlawful combatant Avenue Q Concurrent estate Public domain Barrister Housing cooperative Appeal Anti-Defamation League Stuyvesant Town EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Intermediate consumption Waste (law) Microeconomics Supreme Court of the United States The Inside Public housing Ten Commandments Columbine High School massacre Terri Schiavo Smoking ban Insurance United States territory Identity theft Oakland Athletics Patent Fred Phelps Karla Homolka Fair Game (Scientology) Social rule Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Asbestos Article One of the United States Constitution Guantanamo Bay Conspiracy Public-key cryptography Monopoly (game) Slander and libel Miss Saigon Economy of the United States Credit card Property law Mortgage Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Prostitution in Germany Rosa Parks Property (ownership right) Lawrence v.
