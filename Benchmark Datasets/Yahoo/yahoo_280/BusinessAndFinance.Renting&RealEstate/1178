do you think the mortgage market will correct its self soon or get worse before it gets better it will get worse before it gets better there has just been too much rope given to the subprime market which never should have been given in the first place so now all the nervous financiers are pulling that rope back in fast continuing to upend the housing and mortgage market think of it as a self perpetuating cycle when the market starts pulling its support no one is willing to pump any more money into that part of the market when this happens demand goes down and prices of the esoteric products created in the mortgage market go down as well we already see that most subprime borrowers cannot meet their monthly payments anymore and with the market jittery there is little to no chance of banks being forgiving and holding off on forcing forclosures of course this pumps more unwanted homes into the market increasing supply as demand continues to drop due to tightening credit requirements and higher interest rates so no the market won't likely correct itself soon Mortgage Deflation (economics) Bond Monetary policy Bank Debt Predatory lending Federal National Mortgage Association Keynesian economics Money supply Mortgage-backed security Economy of Russia Inflation Real estate bubble Interest Money Insurance Asian financial crisis Government National Mortgage Association Gold standard Monetarism Hyperinflation Economy of India FairTax Financial markets Supply-side economics Great Depression Capital accumulation Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Savings and loan association Derivative (finance) Central bank Life insurance Annuity Interest rate Business cycle Financial capital Student loan Fiat money Say's law Primerica Financial Services Economy of the United States Credit card Exchange rate Finance ACORN Yield curve Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Islamic banking Reaganomics Personal finance Free trade Taxation in the United States Futures contract Privatization History of post-Soviet Russia Microeconomics Security (finance) Unemployment Economy of Romania Renewable energy development Monopoly (game) Economic history of the United States Economy of Pakistan History of the United States (1865-1918) Labor theory of value Law of value Arbitrage Labour economics Citigroup Black market Short selling Euro Money market Monopoly Supply and demand Airline Corporate finance Technical analysis Securitization Mutual fund Operation Market Garden American individualist anarchism Real estate economics British property bubble Social Credit Siphon Irish Life and Permanent Deficit spending Hydrogen economy Stock market Social Security (United States) Kyoto Protocol
