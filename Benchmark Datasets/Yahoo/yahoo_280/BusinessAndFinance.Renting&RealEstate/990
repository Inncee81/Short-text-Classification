i want to quit my job and be at home more with my new baby which is better real estate agent or appraisal keeping in mind we rely on my salary i am in real estate school right now and have to warn you the market is so bad i don't suggest either if you decide to go for it though you are better off starting with your real estate license because to become an appraiser here in indiana you not only need to know what is taught in that class but you will need an appraisers class as well as being an apprentice it is really hard to find an appraiser to take you under their wing since you will be competition for them this is exactly what my r e teacher said just last week once you get your r e license you can work a year under a broker then get your brokers license once you have both take a class in mortgage financing this last few months has been really hard on that industry with over major players going under the job market there is tight as heck but soon enough the government is doing a bail out to help but by that time many of the workers will have moved on congrats on the new baby as a business owner my suggestion to you is to do a great deal of research for your area before jumping in they say on average it takes months for you to make your first sale and the yearly average is sales if you are in a ballooned area watch for the pop last thing think about buying hud homes and fixing them up then carrying the mortgage many peeps these days can't get conventional mortgages or keep them if you carry the mortgage yourself you can build equity then expand the draw back is this takes quite a bit of time to pan out i have sold nearly houses in the last years for a company that does this i work mainly on down payment fees and it has been worth it Mortgage Real estate broker Mutual fund Insurance Government National Mortgage Association Donald Trump Real estate Federal National Mortgage Association Capital accumulation Housing cooperative Primerica Financial Services Intellectual property Construction Short selling Property tax Graduate school Taxation in the United States Debt Wells Fargo Unemployment Predatory lending Bond Mortgage-backed security Citigroup Life insurance Great Depression History of the United States (1918-1945) Security (finance) Corporate governance Islamic banking Real estate appraisal Personal finance Economy of Russia New Deal Student loan Title insurance Toronto-Dominion Bank Real estate bubble Warren Buffett Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Habitat for Humanity International Monopoly (game) Deflation (economics) Business Advertising Berkshire Hathaway Oakland Athletics Google White flight Finance Copyright NASDAQ Microeconomics Real estate developer Copyleft Lawyer Tesco Annuity Nintendo Trademark Commodore International Delta Air Lines Investment bank Wal-Mart FairTax Carl G.
