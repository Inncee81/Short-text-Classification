sellers did not go for st appt for sale of hdb unit what are the legal financial consequences property agent did not wait for hle letter and rushed the sellers to sign the unconditional otp without even giving them time to think for days the hle was rejected bacause sellers cannot move from rm to rm and the sellers back out from st appt because they are currently serving bank loan fluctuating and hefty and they do not want to go for second one they only decided to sell after being convinced by the agent about their eligibility to sell a rm and buy a rm all the while the agent had been giving wrong infos misguiding and misrepresenting facts sellers had been busy in work and study so had given complete responsibility to her trusting her they just complied following her instructions without doubting her a bit the case was mishandled and it all happened due to the agents negligience the buyers have sent a legal letter to complete the deal the agency is not helping and suggesting to carry on with the sale but through bank loan please advice and suggest options it is impossible to give any reasonable answer what advice do you need are you the buyer are you the buyer's agent are you a terciary party seller of the second property or assuming you are the buyer then it sounds like there was a deal pressed together with the flimsiest of grounds and it has toppled i have never yet seen an unconditional otp ever through a real estate agent the forms they use are chock full of outs and conditions for instance with the hle if the otp was based on an hle that is a general agreement but you still have to agree on the details of the hle if the two parties do not agree to the details then there us no deal you can try to force the sellers to sell under the original terms but you would have a huge amount of court time involved in taking them to court and getting a judge to agree with you i would suggest that if you can do bank financing do it if you can't start looking for another deal if you are not the buyer then say what your standing is so people can give appropriate advice either way good luck Contract Real estate broker Islamic banking Mortgage Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Life insurance Microeconomics Internet fraud Security (finance) Capitalism Option Short selling Economics Trademark Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Debt Appeal Scots law SCO-Linux controversies Stock Babylonian law Tax Trust (Law) USA Royal Assent Insider trading Warranty Student loan Price discrimination Surplus value Gold standard Futures contract Divorce Investment bank Theory of conduct Supreme Court of the United States Consideration Coercion Hire purchase Mediation International Criminal Court Arbitrage Call option Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 7 Annuity Leasing Deflation (economics) Conveyancing Intellectual property Patent Civil unions in the United Kingdom One-time pad Financial markets Money Schabir Shaik Trial Derivative (finance) Australian constitutional law Citigroup Standard form contract Bank fraud Privatization United Kingdom corporation tax Causality Mutual fund Inventory Monetary policy Capital accumulation 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Estoppel Polyamory Property (ownership right) Housing cooperative Enron Corporation Jury GNU General Public License Real estate Law of the People's Republic of China Poker jargon Agency (law) Advance fee fraud Epistemology Consensus decision-making Same-sex marriage in Canada Unlawful combatant Free market Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Sales UK Singles Chart Put option President of Germany Productive and unproductive labour Copyright Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal
