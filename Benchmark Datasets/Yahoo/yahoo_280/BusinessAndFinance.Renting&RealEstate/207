how is a double closing done i wish to buy a home but complete a double closing with me purchasing and another buyer paying the owner how is this done i also wish to refinance and take cash out how do i do this i already have a contract for and i need the refinance money most people who are looking to sell and buy aren't looking to refinance to cash out money usually the money they need will come to exist when they sell their house less their loan amount which is used in whole or part on their next home sometimes a seller can time it so that the sale of their first home closes on the same day as the closing of their new home but it really isn't necessary since you can allow yourself extra time between the two transactions to move when you don't have a contract on your house for sale and wish to buy another house you merely write an offer on the new house contingent upon the sale of your old house your existing contract on the old house give you as much bargaining power as anyone else but you still must include the same contingency because the sale has not closed Real estate broker Microeconomics Mortgage Islamic banking Insurance Contract Stock Tax Mergers and acquisitions Illegal drug trade Short selling Futures contract Price discrimination Life insurance Credit derivative Unconscionability Option Warranty Supply and demand Security (finance) Monetary policy Margin (finance) Dividend FairTax Derivative (finance) Internet fraud Financial markets Capitalism Money Arbitrage Investment bank Conveyancing Oakland Athletics Day trading Money supply Hire purchase Babylonian law EFTPOS Call option Credit card Enron Corporation Auction Corporation SCO-Linux controversies Rational pricing Privatization Inventory B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Sales Primerica Financial Services $ale of the Century Dot-com Predatory lending Bulk vending Put option Wal-Mart Closed-end fund Consideration Hyperinflation Amway Poker jargon Oil-for-Food Programme MMORPG Variable universal life insurance Leeds United F.C.
