when your home is in foreclosure can you sell your home when your home is in foreclosure can you sell your home two ways get a buyer with enough money to pay off your mortgage the title company will set it all up and the bank will be thrilled to drop the foreclosure to get a check for the full amount you owe at the closing or you could try for a short sale you agree to let the house be shown without notice at any agreed upon times you agree to get out with no rights of redemption immediately at the closing which will be when the bank can find a buyer at any price you agree to stay to maintain the house and keep it safe until said closing you may get the bank to agree to not report you to the credit reporting bureaus the bank will only report that the mortgage has been discharged paid banks agree to this for a few reasons they don't have to pay to secure the house they pay less in legal fees they don't have to worry about vandalism since they are probably losing money anyway why not limit the loss a little in exchange for less legal hassles and the waiting that foreclosure means sometimes you can even get them to agree to give you some money for moving expenses typically to you may get to live free as the 'caretaker' for several months while they find a buyer of course this only works in an area that is saturated with foreclosed houses and when you owe more that the house is worth and if your property is well maintained currently if you owe far less than the house is worth or your property is a pig sty or your property is desirable this ploy might not work get with your mortgage holder and start negotiating good luck Foreclosure Bond Government National Mortgage Association Security (finance) Predatory lending Allodial title Microeconomics Short selling Credit card Insurance Debt Capitalism Contract Internet fraud Derivative (finance) Mutual fund Islamic banking Gold standard Taxation in the United States Great Depression Tax Real estate broker Deflation (economics) Monopoly (game) Poker jargon Hyperinflation Money Futures contract Supply and demand Copyright Conveyancing Unconscionability Bank Concurrent estate Leasing Financial markets U.S. public debt Option Gold as an investment Advance fee fraud Cheque Student loan Mergers and acquisitions Corporation MMORPG Intellectual property Estoppel Fractional-reserve banking Bretton Woods system Public domain Arbitrage Housing cooperative Temasek Holdings Enron Corporation Monopoly 401(k) Inflation Dividend Wal-Mart Capital accumulation Labor theory of value Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Child support Anarchism and capitalism Annuity Price discrimination United Kingdom corporation tax Copyleft Primerica Financial Services Title insurance Fiat money Interest Auction Investment bank Call option Economy of Russia Federal National Mortgage Association Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Commodity markets Monetary policy Mortgage-backed security SCO-Linux controversies Real estate bubble Health insurance Construction Life insurance ITV Mobile home GNU General Public License Privatization Lehigh and New England Railroad American individualist anarchism Craps Option style Identity theft
