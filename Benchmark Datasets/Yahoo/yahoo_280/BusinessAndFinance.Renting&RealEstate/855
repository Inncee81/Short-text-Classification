can i buy a house with cash i mean like walk upto someones house with sale sign and say heres the money then thats it or do u have to go through solicitors the reason i ask is my dad has come into money and wants to buy me a house but i dont have a bank account blacklisted and i dont want to have to pay for surveys etc or middle men or anyone lol the house i want is the exact amount he will give me if you can't just buy a house why not thanks oh forgot to mention my dad is an all round builder so any problems with the house dont concern me the reason i wanted to know is because he said you cannot just go too someone and say heres the cash wheres the deed's so to speak and the house i want is door's down from him and i am trying hard not too run up their path cash in hand you can buy a house with cash most people don't have that kind of cash so they have to mortgage you're better off paying cash because then all you do is build equity unless the house is a total money pit or in a crappy neighborhood it will only increase in value and because you own it free and clear the money is all yours just don't go over extending yourself just because you can if you get k for example don't buy a k house buy a k house and bank the rest leave some for repairs and upgrades and bank the rest you'll still need to pay property taxes too to lean more about smart money management check the website listed below Mortgage Personal finance Life insurance Monopoly (game) Money Mergers and acquisitions Mutual fund Poker jargon Finance Microeconomics Bond Deflation (economics) Economy of Russia Bank Monetary policy Craps Primerica Financial Services Annuity Construction Security (finance) Estoppel Octopus card Surveillance Wheel of Fortune Credit card FairTax Boston and Lowell Railroad Corporate finance Slot machine Privatization Islamic banking Debt Stock Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Hyperinflation Citigroup Insurance PE ratio Capital accumulation EFTPOS Tax Babylonian law Derivative (finance) American individualist anarchism Investment bank Dividend Inflation Externality Productive and unproductive labour Government debt Flat tax Money supply $ale of the Century Institutional fund management Internet fraud Health insurance Child support Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Humphrey Bogart Real estate developer Donald Trump Futures contract Ford Motor Company Schabir Shaik Trial Bank fraud Money creation Cheque Supply-side economics Double-entry book-keeping Trust (Law) USA Charles Ponzi Gold standard U.S. public debt Betting (poker) Wall Street Marshall Plan Taxation in the United States Liability Shaggy dog story MapleStory Economy of India Financial audit Robert Kiyosaki Gross domestic product Temasek Holdings Make money fast Campaign finance reform Concurrent estate Predatory lending Universal Studios Asset Wal-Mart Surplus value Babe Ruth Live 8
