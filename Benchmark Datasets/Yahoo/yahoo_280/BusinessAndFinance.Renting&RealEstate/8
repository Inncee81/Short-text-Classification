just entering real estate and what should i expect transition is scary however i live in a high end area i've heard stories anywhere from you will not get paid for a year to great move is it better to start part time which i will keep my income but i won't have much time to learn orrrr do it full time to get a full grip of it with a part time job please answer if you have experience in this field and thanx i am not going to lie its a tough market right now people who have been in the business and through this before understand that this is actually a normal market not a down market the people who joined in the last yrs think this is the great depression because they were selling in a market where a monkey could have sold a house you put a sign out front and minutes later you had offers on your desk now that is not a fair picture of how real estate works now is you have to price your listings correctly market them heavily be prepared to spend a lot on ads you also will have to really qualify your buyers because loans are folding last minute by the 's a high end market could be good because you make a higher commission but the pool of buyers is slim and getting slimmer by the day it is getting harder and harder to get loans especially jumbo loans for properties in the high range i would really do my research on what this market is all about by going and talking to offices in your area not to people online most here hate realtors anyway as far as everyone saying you have to work nights weekends and holidays they are a slave to the business there are several books out there that tell you how to run your real estate career as a hr mon fri work week i never works nights weekends or holidays now i am not saying on occasion i wont show a house to someone at those times but if its once a month i would be surprised you need to learn how to make people work on your schedule i encourage you to join the business but only after you do your research and make sure this is what you want it is not as easy as people think and you do not make money hand over fist as most think if you work hard and are honest and dedicated you can make figures easily but if not you will end up making k per year also don t expect a check for your first months good luck re agent remax Real estate broker Mortgage National Football League Economics Monopoly (game) Microeconomics Real estate bubble Poker jargon Mutual fund Supply and demand Gold standard Education in the People's Republic of China Insurance Privatization Labor theory of value Virgin Mobile Real estate Government National Mortgage Association Alex Ferguson 2000 Australian Grand Prix Labour economics Graduate school Inflation Islamic banking Unemployment Life insurance Keynesian economics Fast bowling EastEnders Babylonian law Economy of Russia Topps Bank Great Depression IBM PC compatible MMORPG Financial markets Tax Gross domestic product UK Singles Chart The Standard Internet fraud Enron Corporation Screenplay Monetary policy Betting (poker) Education in Germany Warren Buffett Final Fantasy XI Security (finance) FairTax Education in the United States Norway national football team Stock Tesco Economy of the United States Neopets Social rule Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Investment bank Saturday Night Live RuneScape economy Leeds United F.C.
