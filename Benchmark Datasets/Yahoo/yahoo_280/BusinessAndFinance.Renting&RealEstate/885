how can i find out how much my husband's house sold for a few years ago i want to know how much the house sold for to see if he made on it my husband and his buddy bought a house together yrs ago before we were married and then ended up having a big blow up we were still making payments on it after we were married and his friend chad was still living there alone after we were married and not paying us a dime we were also making payments on our home at the same time which finally forced us into bankruptcy chad's dad is a realtor and sold the house without telling us how much he made on it he just told us they didn't make anything on it which we really don't believe they aren't friends anymore by any means and we feel like we got the raw end of the deal chad just called this week to tell him that he found out that they overpaid on pmi on the house they owned together and needs him to sign something to get the money back i don't trust him and don't think he'll split the how can we find out if this pmi thing is true all owners must sign the paperwork so if your husbands name was on the title it could not legally be sold without his signature perhaps this dude forged your husbands signature or con'd him into signing something he wasnt aware of write letters to both chad and the realtor his dad stating that you want copies of all documents from the sale of the home include the address and estimated date of sale and that the home was mutually owned and was sold without your knowledge if this is true send them certified so that you have proof that they received them give them like weeks to produce the documents you should also be able to go down to city hall and ask for any documents they might have they keep records on who owns property do not sign anything else until you get these documents if it comes to it sue the pants off chad and is sleezy dad Real estate broker SCO-Linux controversies The Emancipation of Mimi Plame affair Knots Landing Bond Make money fast Concurrent estate Divorce EastEnders Plame affair timeline Garth Brooks Internet fraud One Tree Hill (TV series) Mortgage Contract Insurance Life insurance Donald Trump Estoppel TLC Spice Girls Destiny's Child Fancy Crane Public-key cryptography Major League Baseball television contracts Grandview, U.S.A.
