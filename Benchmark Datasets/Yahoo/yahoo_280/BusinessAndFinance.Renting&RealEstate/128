where in line can i get a mortgage lease on line to ensure i will get my rent from my tenants for sometime now my husband's family have our property for some home group business this people haven't paid rent to us every sense this whole thing started and they have the house on foreclosure so many times i decided to make this legal and demanded rent is being more than four years and they haven't gave us nothing out of this business but bad credit i demanded rent enough to pay the mortgage on time and some for us i need to make a legal contract that obligates them to pay us rent sense this house is in my husbands name this way we would pay our own mortgage and the house won't be in foreclosure again this people they are bad people they don't care about our needs they say we don't deserve money out of the business because we didn't invest any money in the business but haven't being for my husband signature they would not have a business so they refuse to pay rent i know i could take this to court and i will but first i need a mortagage lease where can i find one it sounds to me that the first problem is that you have no written instruments with these renters if so the law provides for you to evict them and sue for back rent if indeed there is no written lease in place they are month to month tenants and as such all states that i know of require you to give them a day notice to vacate the premises then if they do not vacate you will be required to sue them in magistrate court or district court for a writ of restitution eviction payment of back rent and damages caused you for having to take this action after the judge signs the orders then if they do not vacate you take the order to the sheriff and they will remove the tenants if they do not pay the amounts stipulated in the judge's order you will need to reduce your judgement to a collection by asking the court to order so and you can collect your money through various ways including garnishment of any wages of the tenant best of luck to you Leasehold estate Mortgage Eviction Appeal Estoppel Contract Concurrent estate Rental agreement Leasing Divorce Babylonian law American individualist anarchism Article One of the United States Constitution Taxation in the United States Great Depression Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Allodial title Squatting Housing cooperative ACORN Judiciary of Hong Kong Theory of conduct Renting Property (ownership right) Deflation (economics) Foreclosure Child support Waste (law) Islamic banking Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 FairTax Government National Mortgage Association Monopoly (game) Intellectual property Unemployment Sheriff Money Terri Schiavo Life insurance Property tax Capitalism Annuity Microeconomics Scots law Barrister Student loan Tort Public housing 2005 trial of Michael Jackson New Hampshire Supreme Court Capital accumulation Negligence Thomas de Littleton Charles I of England Schabir Shaik Trial Debt Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Same-sex marriage in the United States Economy of Russia Supreme Court of the United States Interest Anarcho-capitalism National Kidney Foundation Singapore Civil rights Government of Maryland Fixtures Parliament of the United Kingdom Minimum wage Bailiff 613 mitzvot Manorialism CPU cache Copyright Personal finance Royal Assent Eminent domain New Deal Domestic partnerships in California Grover Cleveland Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Public good Surplus value Notary public Rosa Parks Legal fiction National Football League Derivative (finance) Trust (Law) USA Public policy
