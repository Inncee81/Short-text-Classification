i need help i'm renting a house and the renters are late with months of rent how can i get them out legally now i have been asking for the rent and now they are saying i'm harrasing them the refrigiator is not working and they want me to get them a new one even though they haven't paid the rent it depends on what you have written in your lease since they are already two months late you just need to give them a written notice signed and dated stating that if they have not paid the rent owed to you in the x amount of days then they must quit the premises a standard notice would be days but since they have not paid for two months you could probably get away with a shorter period look over the lease you had them sign and be sure to act accordingly to what you agreed if you do not have a section that covers this in your standard lease be sure to create an amendum for your next renters as for the fridge you will need to have it fixed otherwise if the renters take you to court they will use it against you and try to make you look like a slum lord believe me the courts are more often on the side of the tenant than the landlord my family and i have rented many properties Leasehold estate Rental agreement Leasing Renting Eviction Estoppel Public housing Squatting Taxation in the United States Apartment Irish Land Act Monopoly (game) Section 8 (housing) Housing cooperative Harlem Serfdom Copyright Boston and Lowell Railroad Blockbuster Video Babylonian law First-sale doctrine Royal Assent Stuyvesant Town Intermediate consumption Scottish clan Mortgage Public domain Allodial title United States Copyright Act of 1976 Concurrent estate Barrister Contract Waste (law) Insurance Real estate economics Rent control Apartment building Islamic banking Thomas de Littleton Unreformed House of Commons Economic rent Land tenure Judiciary of Hong Kong Property (ownership right) Microeconomics Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Assignment (law) Home insurance Annuity Plame affair Appeal Modding Rent (musical) History of Ireland (1801-1922) Online DVD rental United Kingdom corporation tax Property law Satchel Paige Tithe American individualist anarchism Newtown, New South Wales Article One of the United States Constitution History of Dublin Surplus value Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 16 Capitalism Eminent domain Operating surplus Property tax Anarchism and capitalism 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Lend-Lease Demesne Cable television French nobility Credit card Supply and demand Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Real property Student loan Value added Bond Income tax Civil unions in the United Kingdom Domestic partnerships in California The New School at West Heath Bailment Chatham Square Trust (Law) USA Legal system of Hong Kong Therion (band) Auto insurance History of Santa Monica, California Notary public Rest area Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory
