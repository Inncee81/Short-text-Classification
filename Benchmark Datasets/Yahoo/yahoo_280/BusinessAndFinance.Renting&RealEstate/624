how long do you give a landlord to fix a problem my brother in law has a real bad ant problem in his apartment i've given him all the home treatments to take care of this issue but the problem is the ants are living in the walls and they are coming through a big hole in the wall how long should he give the landlord to fix the problem before filing a complaint with the health department or taking further legal action he's been living with this ant problem the entire summer but he's never officially written a letter to the landlord requesting that it gets fixed so i am typing up a letter for him but i dont know how long the landlord should get to fix a problem is it hours or is it week the guy can't even have food in his house the ants are in the refrigerator so what to do anyone thanks in advance from a landlord perspective i always try and have problems fixed within hours but that isn't always realistic i think that at the extreme it should be fixed within a week i think a week is reasonable when a tenant has a problem it is our problem as the landlord to fix it in your situation it may be as easy as the landlord calling an exterminator Poker jargon Eviction Mortgage Medical prescription Betting (poker) Breastfeeding Computer virus Scientology beliefs and practices Leasing Kitchen Animal Crossing Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Downing Street memo Public housing Annuity Theory of conduct Patent Babylonian law Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Ant Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Estoppel Slippery slope Cross site scripting 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Abortion in the United States Harlem Extreme Programming Terri Schiavo SMTV Live Probation officer Killian documents Love Hina main characters Texas hold 'em GunZ The Duel Cheating in Counter-Strike 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Abortion Prostate cancer Apache Ant Neoclassical economics EastEnders Medical malpractice Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti The Inside Rent control C programming language Pretty Good Privacy Computer and video game genres Waste (law) Trust (Law) USA File sharing Stomach cancer Contract Medicine Live Aid Ombudsman Ashton-Tate Avenue Q Concurrent estate Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hamster Billboard (advertising) Cannabis rescheduling in the United States History of Microsoft Windows Atari 8-bit family GameFAQs Sheikh Abdullah SimCity 4 Land reform Monopoly (game) Hikikomori AMD Irish fiction Housing cooperative MMORPG Ethics Negligence Star Trek Customizable Card Game Mental Health Act 1983 Fancy rat Ozone depletion Fathers' rights Education in Romania Class action Bottom (television) Manorialism Web crawler Health care in the United States Carbon dioxide Quantification SimAnt Livestock Certified Nursing Assistant Stroke The Skeptical Environmentalist Public policy
