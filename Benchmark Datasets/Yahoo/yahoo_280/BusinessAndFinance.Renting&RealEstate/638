closing date delayed my closing date has been delayed due to the buyer's lender i am a seller and my house is in florida but i live in other states before i got notice from my agent i have already sent all sighed documents by fedex to title company because i do not want to go down to florida in this case i would like to know i am in secure or not and also i need to know what next step would be please tell me thanks if they have not closed by the specified date on the contract they are out of contract have you signed a written extension if not you can claim the buyer's deposit as liquidated damages according to what is specified in writing in the contract however the best idea is for you to close and sell your property especially in this weak market the docs will have to be re done since the tax proration is based on the day of closing and this date has changed you have every right to ask for additional deposit money from the buyer which should be put into escrow along with the original escrow money get on the phone to your agent and get them cracking they stand to lose commission should the deal not close so it should not be hard to get them motivated if they are slow in getting back to you call the title company and speak to the closing agent never count your money until you leave the closing table or in your case until you get the fed ex with the check from the title company or the wire transfer from the title company's bank Real estate broker Mortgage Advance fee fraud Internet fraud Insurance Bond Short selling Conveyancing Financial markets Bank fraud Monetary policy Option Contract Annuity Oil-for-Food Programme Money supply Futures contract Gold standard Margin (finance) Derivative (finance) Stock Bank Title insurance Jack Abramoff Deflation (economics) Enron Corporation Liberty Dollar Poker jargon Computer virus Islamic banking Salary cap Gold as an investment 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Supply and demand Privatization Mutual fund Plame affair Money creation Investment bank Put option Real estate Temasek Holdings Babylonian law Call option Central bank Euro ITunes Music Store Public domain Arbitrage SCO-Linux controversies United Kingdom corporation tax Insider trading Stock market Rational pricing Economics Octopus card Trust (Law) USA Tom DeLay Surveillance Money Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Economy of Russia Extreme Championship Wrestling Dividend American Broadcasting Company Finance Citigroup Charles Ponzi Debt British House of Commons Estoppel Illegal drug trade Free market Equine conformation World Championship Wrestling Government National Mortgage Association Article One of the United States Constitution Corporation Oplan Bojinka United States Postal Service Blackjack Interest Coercion Wal-Mart Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Digital rights management Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch CPU cache Information Services Procurement Library DBS Bank Fair market value Money market Usury
