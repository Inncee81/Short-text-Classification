looking for info on buying a single wide any help me and my wife bought a old single wide trailer to move into and save money to buy a house the only thing is i cant get the roof to quit leeking so im thinking on trading it in on a new one any one now how much a should be looking at to get a base modle plan jane nothing fancy to get us threw untill shes done with school and when you trade it in do they remove the old one free an help would be great thanks from upstate ny years ago before my wife and i were homeowners we lived in different mobile homes before becoming homeowners i sold the second one and used the money to buy property and we built a house you are definitely thinking right and on the right track i also worked at a dealership and sold new and used trailers they are trailers unless you live in one then they are mobile homes i always asked people how long they planned to live there just like a real estate agent would if the answer is less than years stay away from a new one they depreciate just like cars there is even a nada book published quarterly with values on used ones by manufacturer just like cars on the other hand the market is always rising which means on an older one which has already done its major depreciation it will never be worthless unless it is trash your roof leak is serious and must be repaired quickly just like a house before structural damage is caused by water i would go up to the roof and clean off all the old sealant from the joints with a putty knife carefully take a grinder or file and round the corners on the putty knife so they don't catch and rip your roof most roofs on older homes are very thin aluminum and you can poke holes with power tools easily our nd mobile home was a bank repo i got by attending an auction open only to dealers and i paid it had a skylight i couldn't get to quit leaking after caulking it for the third time and it still leaked i went up on the roof with a putty knife and gently removed my own caulk and all the old junk under it don't walk on a trailer roof with anything but tennis shoes if you ruin them throw them away they are cheaper than a roof i filled two paper grocery bags with old dried out putty from previous owners attempts but i got down to almost bare metal then went to sears and bought their best aluminized mobile home roof sealant and applied it i spent the whole saturday on my roof but my problems were over you do realize that you only need to seal the seams not the whole roof right if you can't get it to quit leaking quickly hire a contractor who does mobile home repairs you can paint over water stains on the inside with b i n white laquer which is sold at most paint stores but don't do this until the leaks are stopped you need to see where they're at then go over the bin with flat white paint or whatever it takes to closely match what is already there maybe the manager of the trailer park you're at could recommend someone local and reputable don't be afraid to go to a new dealership and ask questions if they are reputable they will treat you as well as any other customer if they blow you off as a small customer i wouldn't even think about shopping there for a new one you will have already discovered their attitude as far as trading in on a new one and them removing the old one you're the customer anything goes just like selling a house or car if the dealer wants your business he's going to do whatever it takes to earn it the day i spent on my old roof paid well i replaced the ac put in a new bathtub the previous owners had stolen the existing one during the repo process and did a few other minor repairs like the screen door latch probably and my wife and i had about invested and sold it for after living there for two years that's a rebate from the landlord you will never get from an apartment since i worked at a dealership and got a bank repo and had access to parts and supplies at wholesale prices my situation is probably not typical but it is probably possible for you to make money instead of losing it or at least get back most of what you've spent Sears Holdings Corporation Mobile home Poker jargon Tesco Asbestos Ocean's Twelve Wal-Mart Mutual fund Knife Monopoly (game) The Inside Insurance Sin City Inflation Mortgage Illegal drug trade Seismic retrofit Sento Warren Buffett Wayne Corporation Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Atari 8-bit family Tire Money Gold as an investment IPod Knots Landing Bong Home repair Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Economy of Russia Floppy disk Shaggy dog story Diamond Gross domestic product Citigroup Hard disk Capitalism Dairy American Motors Columbine High School massacre Confidence trick Carl G.
