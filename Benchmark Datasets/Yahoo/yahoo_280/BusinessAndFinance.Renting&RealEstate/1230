what happens if your landlord doesn't let you move in on the day your lease starts hello before i signed my lease i told my landlord everything up front he knows i am pregnant he knows my lease ends at my old apt on the same day i move into my new apt and he knew i would have furniture delivered the day the lease started my lease with him starts tomorrow he never told me the prorated rate for this month so i did the math myself and guessed he never told me if i paid enough too much he never returned my phone calls on when i can pick up keys and today his cell phone is just turned off and goes right to voicemail when he showed the apt the person who lived there didn't care enough to clean it and make it look nice to show so i am worried he won't clean it when he leaves either also it is currently furnished but the landlord was going to remove all the furnishings before i moved in so with my lease starting tomorrow and no word from him yet what can i do i am terrified what if the furniture truck arrives and the old tenant hasn't cleaned up or the landlord hasn't moved out his furnishings or the old tenant isn't even gone i don't know what to do if i can't even get ahold of the guy he only rents out units total so i understand it is not his main job but i can't just leave my stuff outside the apt and wait around tomorrow ideas take pictures you can sue the landlord for the expense it takes you to have the apartment ready much like the way other landlords try to stick it to tenants moving out i am sure your movers will be happy to remove the furniture existing in the property for an extra fee or i suggest you look for another apartment to move into you can always get your deposit back from the first landlord if you never move in Leasehold estate Friends Apartment Leasing Housing cooperative Apt Pupil Rental agreement Ocean's Twelve Shaggy dog story EastEnders Miss Saigon Kodocha Airport (film) Avenue Q The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Estoppel Rent (musical) Social rule Phoebe Halliwell Blood Simple StarCraft Episode VI Reservoir Dogs Renting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City George Costanza Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kender Modding Pitaten Full Metal Panic?
