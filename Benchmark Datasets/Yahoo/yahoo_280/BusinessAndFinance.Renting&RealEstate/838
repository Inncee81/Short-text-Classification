seeking ideas on how to utilize idle land i have a half an acre piece of land in a small village town which has been lying idle for some time we planned to build our rural home when we bought it but recently we decided against it and instead bought a plot in the capital city which we are in the process of putting up a family house the small town has a few shops hotels three churches a school and the usual open air markets found in small towns i have a desire to put up something which may not be specifically commercial but that which in a way will benefit the local community there are many idle youth in the area who have taken to heavy drinking and drug abuse and i always wonder if there is sometimes i can do to help them i wouldnt mind donating the whole or a portion of the land to the local community if it can be used to improve the lives of the local community please help me with your ideas tell the town you want to donate it as a park put up a basketball goal yourself and put out a few trash cans maybe a park bench or two recruit the local garden club or school agriculture or horticulture classes to plant and landscape it if the town has a drug alcohol rehab clinic recruit those people to help too donate it to the town as a dog park fence the entire half acre and let people bring their dogs off leash to play donate it to one of the churches they could make it a community outreach of some sort to help drug alcohol abusers make it a community garden section it off in small plots and allow people from town to plant their own vegetables there in some towns people may even rent the plots to plant if they don't have their own land to do so put up a small but cheap portable building and make it a community reading room ask for volunteers to maintain it and ask people to donate their old books so kids can go there and read or take books home put up a small but cheap portable building and make it a senior center ask volunteers to run it with weekly bingo games and activities for seniors in the town rent it out as additional open air market space allow vendors to set up stands there for a small monthly fee and sell their items just hang onto it as a special use area maybe once a month or a couple of times a year coordinate with the town to hold a small town fair festival or gathering there let the churches set up booths for fundraising and sell food have some kind of entertainment there local band or school groups perform plant it in corn and in the fall have a corn maze charge admission to cover cost of corn planting hold a town raffle keep the money you make or donate it to the churches or someone needy in the town set up a museum there ask people to donate items dealing with the past or history of the town and have volunteers run it someone else in town may have an old historic building they wish to donate and move there for that purpose dig it up for a pond put a walkway around it and put ducks in it let people come fish and feed the ducks there Grand Forks, North Dakota Animal Crossing Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Agriculture Epcot Chatsworth House Sugar Land, Texas Fullerton, California Organic farming Boise, Idaho Lechaina Carnegie Mellon University Alcohol fuel Monopoly (game) Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Mid-levels Food Elis Prefecture Cerritos, California Fresno, California Cranford, New Jersey Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Education in the People's Republic of China MMORPG Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University Tung Chung Poker jargon University of Southern California Westheimer Street Festival Pacific, Missouri Country house Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center Salvation Army Illegal drug trade Oasis (band) University of Minnesota Assonet, Massachusetts Alcoholics Anonymous Beverly Hills, California Sukkot Knots Landing Advertising Tsing Yi Surveillance Dawson Creek, British Columbia Indianapolis, Indiana Ice cream Biodiesel Eugene, Oregon Sengkang Baseball Education in the United States P__voa de Varzim Wrigley Field Homewood, Illinois Dogpatch USA Health insurance Emergency preparedness National parks of England and Wales Pasadena, California Taxation in the United States Microeconomics Wan Chai Scientology beliefs and practices Nintendo Entertainment System Zuiderzee Works Texas A&M University Yearbook Embedded system RISC Agricultural policy Organic food King City, Ontario Mission, British Columbia Genetically modified food Dairy Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area Food and Drug Administration Hopkins School Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mortgage RuneScape quests Spokane, Washington South Beach Carlsbad, California Common Agricultural Policy X Window System Milpitas, California Portland, Oregon Urban planning Insurance
