selling my home but our new neighbors have trashed their house we have been living in our beautiful home for about years we live in a quiet little community in indiana and have decided to move to a smaller home we have kept our home updated and have put a lot of time and money into our house however our next door neighbors moved into their house about years ago and have let their property in a very distressed state their home is in very poor condition and only getting worse they have a car on blocks in the back yard with high grass and trash everywhere the house is such a eyesore and destryoing our property value is there anything we can do can the city make them clean this up what rights do we have i know our neighbors have very little money so legal action to abtain money won't result in anything need help why are you afraid of talking to your neighbor they have been there for years and you probably do not even know them wouldn't your help resolve the issue quicker and allow you to sell your house for a higher price if all in life that is important to you is money consider it as a good investment for shame so few consider the real benefits of good neighbors or the downside of pissing off your closest possible friends government will not watch your back as well as a good neighbor surely you can call code enforcement and waste a lot of time government moves so slo on the other hand you may be able to interest other neighbors to help the po folks out you will certainly pay thousands of dollars to a real estate sales person where a small investment to clean up thier property maybe less than can offer you much bigger rewards you can also offer to mow their lawn etc the cost will be minimal your help and their cooperation will get you faster results to acheive what you desire the additional value you receive when you sell will more than offset any price you pay do not count on the city to help you although some cities do provide some help paint etc i am always constantly amazed at the lack of communication with people that are nearest to us it seems we would rather punish or persecute when a simple remedy is at hand please take an interest in your neighbors it will pay off in more ways than you ever expect or just hide in your hovel and fear evrything your choice Microeconomics Capitalism Tax Insurance Poker jargon Capital accumulation Intellectual property Mortgage Gross domestic product Contract Supply and demand Inflation Public good Minimum wage Economy of Russia Trust (Law) USA Gold standard Bond Estoppel Taxation in the United States Labor theory of value Tariff Privatization Property (ownership right) Illegal drug trade Hyperinflation Deflation (economics) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Keynesian economics Externality Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Make money fast Flat tax McMansion Income trust The Amazing Race Annuity Arguments for and against drug prohibition Free trade Law of value Islamic banking Mutual fund Property tax Donald Trump Blackjack Anarchism and capitalism American individualist anarchism Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Monetary policy CPU design Great Depression Political economy Opportunity cost Divorce Bretton Woods system John Howard Yoder Canadian and American economies compared Real estate broker The Apprentice 2 Warren Buffett Compiler optimization Software patent debate Money Unemployment CPU cache Monopoly Yield curve Health insurance Betting (poker) RISC Commodity markets Major League Baseball television contracts Ethical consumerism Prisoner's dilemma Ra (board game) Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Dodge Charger Gerrymandering Progressive tax Digital photography Enron Corporation Credit card Cable television Arbitrage Social Security (United States) Economic inequality Economy of the United States Citigroup
