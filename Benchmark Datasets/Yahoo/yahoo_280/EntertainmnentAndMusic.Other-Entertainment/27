how do you avoid copyright contravention having spent weeks piecing together a home made karaoke you tube actually rejected it for copyright reasons however there are loads of karaoke type vids on there and on similar sites i was told there's also a similar channel on sky tv where the publics vids are broadcast but how do you actually get your vid to sky tv does anyone know anything about it we know why things are copyrighted the fact is even tv flaunts copyright rules and even some sites that reject certain performances allow other similar video's not quite the tv channel pays broadcast royalties in much the same way that a radio station does another way is to buy an authorised copy of the soundtrack for karaoke purposes moral of the tale check before you spend weeks on it now that you have spent weeks on it you can approach the labels and ask permission they may grant you free permission for the publicity although that isn't terribly likely they may simply offer you a royalty contract to pay a fee each time it is played but again you may struggle simply put copyright means exactly that the right to copy which you don't have Public domain Copyright GNU General Public License Australian copyright law Copyleft Software patent debate United States Postal Service SCO-Linux controversies Fair use Cable television First-sale doctrine Japanese copyright law UK Singles Chart SCO v.
