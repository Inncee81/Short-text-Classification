why does hollywood stll use reels when everything today is so high tech ya know everything is turning from digital to high def and they are still working with very old technology even the films themselves have come along way with computers in my personal opinion they should do away with movie theaters and cinimas because people can watch movies at home for a tiny fraction of the cost of going out to the theater standing in line buy all that stuff then watching a movie that would look better on your hd tv anyway if this really is the information age then why haven't they caught up there are actually reasons st film is the only medium which can be projected onto a big screen in a theater yes there are digital projection devices but they do not compare to current wide screen film projectors nd film is non volatile it can't be lost or corrupted because of a power surge or loss of power the actual production of a movie may be done in a digital medium but the end product which makes it to the public in a movie theater is a film strip which runs through a projector film is cheap and film doesn't forget the movie industry is moving to all digital cameras to do production instead of huge film cameras and actual film then they do editing and post production in the studio with digital editors and such add special effects again digitally and then they transfer the final cut to a film strip film is still the final stage since there is no adequate projection system for digital media directly to the big screen theaters will never go away a good example is the movie master and commander which i just saw recently on the tube it was nothing compared to seeing the whole thing in a decent theater maybe you do not appreciate the magnitude of a theater but i and a lot of other people do it may be that people can watch at home for a fraction of the cost but the important part about going to the theater is the magnitude of the experience the sound system in your home does not hold a candle to the modern day movie theater things like soap operas on tv skip the final transfer to film since it will not be shown in a theater and never be seen on a screen bigger than the largest tv so in that sense tv programs you are right they are moving to all digital productions but even on the best and biggest hd tv master and commander still looks better on the big screen Movie projector Film Digital cinema Computer IMAX Movie theater Traditional animation 3-D film Widescreen Digital cinematography Serial Sound recording Photography High-definition television Gross domestic product IBM PC compatible Digital camera Cinerama Software engineering Home cinema Movie studio Machinima History of film Sound film Game programmer Computer animation Computer numbering formats Digital projector BBC One Motion picture rating system Transistor Loudspeaker Sound effect Motion capture Apple Computer Floppy disk Digital Contemporary culture of South Korea Stereoscopy Bluetooth BBC television drama George Lucas Movie camera CPU cache Technicolor Modem Warez Camcorder Demoscene Silent film Laserdisc Nuclear fusion Digital rights management Panavision Oscilloscope Vacuum tube Konica Minolta Electrical engineering Transformer Audiophile Crime film Geographic information system Hard disk 35 mm film Gramophone record Soap opera Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Meta-reference Compact audio cassette NTSC X Window System Dubbing (filmmaking) ABS-CBN Computer display Independent film 19th century in film Surveillance ITV Digital circuit Sony Projection screen Windows XP Solar power Channel 4 DVD Hollywood, Los Angeles, California Trailer (movie) Explosive material Blu-ray Disc Pornography CPU design
