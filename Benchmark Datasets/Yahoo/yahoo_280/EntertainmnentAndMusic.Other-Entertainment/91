why is comedy so stupid now why is comedy so stupid now i remember when tv shows cartoons movies were actually funny and it seems like now everything is completely stupid i miss being able to laugh why is it that random stupid stuff is considered to be funny it's cheap and takes no talent to create i've come up with better things when i'm going to bed half asleep tv shows cartoons movies depend upon the uniqueness of the talents of comedians to provide the strings of comedic lines that are appropriate for their genres however if you look at the world that we are living in and the shape of our society there has been very little to laugh it seems that we are receiving a reguritated glop of the same stuff over and over and that's why it's not funny you've heard it before you are correct it's cheap and takes no talent to create very few of the shows have a real audience with some longevity they also depend upon the 'actor' to be able to 'deliver' the mess in spite of whether the material is funny or not case in point i like patricia headron everybody loves raymond and i like kelsey grammar fraizer as just mediocre actors in comedic positions but enough is enough they have their own shows and now they are going to be placed 'together' on a show this fall i don't see how the two of them together will be able to pull a show off anyone who has seen them will relate them to their old shows surely there are others out there who have something new to add to the soup i miss shows like the jeffersons sanford i love lucy and others who used their entire cast to create the comedic effect from week to week to keep their audiences laughing even seinfield was funny because the cast members created their own individual 'haha' and together they played off of each other i wonder what's coming down the pike where are the new students who are learning their craft of being comedians everybody today depends too much upon putting other cultures down in order to make 'funny' i have to admit there is one guy who is super funny to me and it's because he hardly breaks his lines it's a continuous laugh and he might be funny on television as a regular if given a chance katt williams but then again he uses so much profanity i doubt if they would write a script around his type of comedy he is definitely for the redd foxx after midnight hour smile Social rule I Love Lucy Situation comedy Monty Python I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Tokusatsu Saturday Night Live Squidward Tentacles Shaggy dog story Whose Line Is It Anyway?
