are the bagpipes hard to play i've wondered how to play and are bagpipes expensive well that's a hard question it's like any other musical instrument you're not going to pick it up and just start playing it takes the average beginner about a year on the practice chanter like a recorder before they are ready to go on the big pipes about another year before they are ready to go out in public and perform i've seen people playing the pipes within a year of starting and i've seen people taking practice chanter lessons for years it all depends on how much effort you put into it pipes are not inexpensive a brand new 'cheaper' set will cost about and then the price goes up depending how how many bells and whistles you add but one thing to remember is silver gold and ivory don't make it sound better or make you a better player now out of all the people who enquire about playing the pipes are you going to be one of the who pursue it further by contacting a local pipe band or piper Uilleann pipes Bagpipes Music of Brittany Music of Ireland Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias Organ (music) Gaida Flute Music of Scotland Great Highland Bagpipe Swedish bagpipes Clarinet Timpani Harp Pipe band Saxophone Just intonation Electronic organ CPU design Plastic Tin whistle Violin Social rule Uilleann Guitar Universal Serial Bus Mandolin Hurdy gurdy The Waterboys Roddy Piper Extreme Programming Solar cell Davy Spillane French folk music Monopoly (game) Western concert flute Recorder Brian Jones (musician) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Harmonica Mutual fund Samples of music from the United States Seamus Ennis Percussion instrument Current teachings of Prem Rawat Bicycle lighting Woodwind instrument Piano Music of France Laserdisc Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Rush (band) Redundant array of independent disks Leo Rowsome Tubular Bells II Microphone Radeon Player piano Yohoho!
