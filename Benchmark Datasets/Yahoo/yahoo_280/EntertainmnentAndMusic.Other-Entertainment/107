in afi's hit song love like winter i have asked many many different people this question and every one of them has been as confused as i am about the answer maybe you have an idea in the chorus of the song davey sings i met my love before i was born he wanted love i taste of blood he bit my lip he sings the chorus three times in the song and although in the second of the three he uses the word she instead of he the first and last are sung with the word he they aren't gay so why would he sing about his first love being a man and having him bit his lip dont try to tell me that he is singing that line on behalf of the females listening to the song because we all know that rockstars dont pretend they are a girl singing about their male lover hahahahaha that actually did happen except it was at a concert while he was singing xp Another Side of Bob Dylan She Loves You I Want to Hold Your Hand Jon Secada Avenue Q Rich Mullins Whose Line Is It Anyway?
