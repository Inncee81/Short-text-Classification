cribbage play anyone ever played handed cribbage if so how do you play it as i was growing up my old man would sometimes take me to his weekly crib game and depending on who was in town we played handed handed and even handed crib there are two versions of the player game is often called captains crib where the dealer is the captain and the other two people act as partners to defeat the captain everyone takes turns at being the captain the second is cut throat where everyone is against everyone when we played handed this is is how it was played the card version of crib as opposed to the american card version was played the person right of the dealer the person who last had the crib would put their single throwaway card back into the deck everyone else would put theirs into the crib we played with two teams and an odd person it was easy for us to decide teams cause one team was me dad and the other was the husband wife friends play would be done as normal crib except the odd persons points were doubled good if a nice hand bad if a poor one you could play all against each other with the throwaway card heading to crib as above but i found it quite interesting with the doubling of points and the pegging point blocks the older wiser one's used to employ against him i used to think the odd person was at a disadvantge like when one of the teams had pegged out and it became effectively against but they always played a dime or as we call it ten cents a hole just to add bragging rights and the individual money jars would go up and down each week but over the many years they played no top ups were required the cut of the deck is the same and all other play is the same as in normal crib i can't imagine the game working with a card deal but with a card deal the game was still quite interesting both tactically and socially Poker jargon Card game Blackjack Contract bridge Cheating in poker Mao (game) Euchre Dominoes Betting (poker) Sheepshead Spades Draw poker Baccarat Piquet Table tennis Community card poker Skat Glossary of American football UNO (game) Volleyball Texas hold 'em Seventh Sea (collectible card game) ROOK 500 (card game) Stud poker Shuffle Baseball Poker Star Trek Customizable Card Game Craps Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Oh Hell Yu-Gi-Oh!
