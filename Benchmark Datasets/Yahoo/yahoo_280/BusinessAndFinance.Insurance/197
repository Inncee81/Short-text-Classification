i am representing myself in car accident is it true that you can request one check for medical bills injury how your claim would get paid depends on the type of claim that you have medical payments pip liability and the laws in your state with out knowing more about your situation its hard to to answer the best thing to do is ask the adjuster that is handling your claim most people don't realize that insurance and claims is one of the most heavily regulated industries adjusters are held to fair claims practices and standards many states have laws saying what adjusters can and can't do we don't trick you into settling if the other party is at fault his insurance adjuster is going to want to settle your claim for a fair value sometimes there are disagreements on what is fair but in the end an adjuster's job is to pay claims the best thing to do is keep the lines of communication with the adjuster open if you have a question ask it if you want to double check anything the other co adjuster tells you check with your agent or adjuster at your insurance company you can even check with your states insurance department most claims do not require the assistance of an attorney i always recommend that you try to work directly with the insurance company adjuster you can always hire an attorney later if you think things are not progressing please keep in mind an attorney is going to take expenses from your settlement for his fee if he files a law suit his cut goes higher also hiring an attorney does not speed the process up it usually slows it down b c another person has been added to the equation although plaintiff attorneys like to get on tv and say that insurance adjusters are afraid of attorneys the reality is we are not i work with attorneys every day i know which attorneys in my area are smart and are good advocates for their clients i also know which ones are idiots like any job there are some adjusters that are really good at what we do and a credit to the profession and there are some that are idiots attorneys are the same way just cause he graduated law school does not mean he knows his way around a claim good luck Insurance Tort reform Lawyer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Medical malpractice Health insurance Barrister Contract Attorney at Law Class action Slander and libel Life insurance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Mediation Advance fee fraud Microeconomics Solicitor Paralegal Asbestos Mutual fund Credit card Software patent debate Apple Computer Health care in the United States Probation officer Wal-Mart Scientology beliefs and practices Workers' compensation Law firm Auto insurance Road traffic accident Tom DeLay Citigroup Mortgage Social Security (United States) Discovery (law) Unemployment Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Commodity markets Eliot Spitzer Fair Game (Scientology) Karl Rove Juris Doctor Speed limit United States Postal Service Tennessee State Constitution Patent application Roe v.
