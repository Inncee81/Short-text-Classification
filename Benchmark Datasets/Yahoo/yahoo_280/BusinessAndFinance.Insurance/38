my health insurace company is givng me trouble i have blue cross blue shield from ford motor company where i work i went out of the country and had to be hospitalized i ad to pay about dollars and theyre suppose to pay me that money back what should i do i am covered and its not extra i have reciepts and everything they do cover out of country hospitalization the uaw told me that if they dont pay me than theyre gonna have their lawyer handle the matter actually its not that unusual for an insurance company to cover medically necessary emergency services rendered outside the us i used to work for different large insurance company one of which actually used to be a part of bc bs then became its own separate company it was a standard part of all policies to cover services rendered outside of the country no special rider was needed and i can't believe that someone who is an agent would never have heard of such a thing perhaps they should check more closely with the companies they represent in case the question ever comes up with one of their clients this is how a person would have went about getting reimbursement from the companies i worked for get an itemized receipt and description of services rendered doctor or hospital notes etc if the documentation is in a foreign language get a translation and send it in with the records this will speed up the process for you if you send notes in a foreign language to the insurer and they need to find a translator it just makes it take that much longer for you to get your money back payment would be made for services that would have been covered for services rendered in the us according to your benefits on the contract ex if you have coverage reimbursement would be made at following whatever exclusions might be on your contract etc at the companies i worked for the nurses in medical review would take a look at the documentation translations and then forward the information to claims with authorization to pay for the service since there would be no usual customary rate for foreign doctors claims were processed at billed charges using the exchange rate in effect at the time of the service for the currency type of that country have you sent all of the documentation to bc bs i'm confident that you should be able to get the reimbursement due to you once all the documentation is submitted i'd clarify from your insurer exactly what paperwork is needed and keep copies for yourself also make sure that your name and insurance id number are clearly indicated on all of the pages in case they get separated Publicly funded medicine Health insurance Contract Medical malpractice United States Postal Service Canada Health Act CPU cache United Kingdom corporation tax Managed care Health care in the United States Health maintenance organization Auto insurance Health savings account Plame affair Advance fee fraud Unemployment benefit Value added tax Security (finance) HIPAA Medical prescription Medicare (United States) Commodity markets Bank US health reform under FDR Estoppel Notary public Asian financial crisis Euro Appeal Patent application Open access XML Government debt Unemployment E-mail spam Canadian and American health care systems compared Tax Mortgage Hyperinflation Taxation in the United States Debt Social Security (United States) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Currency Wal-Mart Emergency Medical Services Copyright Public domain Bond Gross domestic product Pharmaceutical company Web crawler Divorce Arbitrage Variable universal life insurance National Insurance OpenDocument Information Services Procurement Library FairTax National Kidney Foundation Singapore Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bank fraud 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Involuntary commitment Medicine Lawyer Enterprise content management Timeline of the Enron scandal Probation officer Schabir Shaik Trial Cascading Style Sheets Compensation of employees GSM services HTML Intellectual property Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Lloyd's of London Deflation (economics) Outsourcing Internet fraud
