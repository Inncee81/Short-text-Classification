my ex husband died and left me beneficiary of his life insurance and my kids as contingent beneficiaries his daughter has contested this life insurance policy and prudential is depositing the monies into court she claims that i can't recieve the monies because i am divorced but what about my kids she says she was listed on the old beneficiary claim can they prudential and the courts revert back to the old designation thanks the divorce is irrelevant she's wrong the named beneficiary at the time of death gets the money sure she might have been the old beneficiary but unless the designation changed after his death the one at the time of death sticks i'm actually surprised she found a lawyer willing to take this on she must be paying him up front and out of pocket because this is definately a losing case for her if you do hire a lawyer be sure to countersue her for legal fees Life insurance Trust (Law) USA Trust (Law) non-USA Insurance Annuity Probate Tort reform Ponzi scheme Prudential plc Third party beneficiary Variable universal life insurance Divorce Contract Daredevil Trusts and estates Same-sex marriage Dial M for Murder Term life insurance Taxation in the United States Express trust Medical malpractice Affirmative action Public good Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Babylonian law Appeal Intellectual property Microeconomics Lloyd's of London Inheritance tax Estoppel Alberto Gonzales SCO-Linux controversies Terri Schiavo Unemployment benefit Health insurance Lawyer Public domain Finance Newark, New Jersey 1919 World Series Mary Astor Attorney's fee Social Security debate (United States) Prudential Financial Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia EastEnders Solicitor Indian National Congress Social Security (United States) Badly Drawn Kitties Citigroup Immigration to the United States Money Liability Attorney at Law Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mortgage Will (law) Primerica Financial Services Lawsuit Allodial title Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act New Deal George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron Shawn Michaels Fractional-reserve banking Same-sex marriage in Canada British Royal Family Common criticisms of Microsoft Freeters Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2005 Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Tom DeLay Same-sex marriage in the United States David Blunkett Standing (law) Tax Bank Public Eye H-1B visa George Galloway Paula Jones Pension European Convention on Human Rights Ann Coulter Bob Rae Vivian Solon Cheque Medicare (United States) Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Money supply Karl Rove 2005 Philippine electoral crisis Product liability Paul Newman Publicly funded medicine Federal Marriage Amendment British monarchy Copyright
