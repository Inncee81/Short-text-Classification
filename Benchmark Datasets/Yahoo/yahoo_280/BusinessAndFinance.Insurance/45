texflex my husband said he would like to get me braces but he wants to pay for it through tex flex we live in texas but we don't know if we will be able to or not i'm looking to see if someone out there has ever used this and if you can or can't use it to pay for braces with help please i'm guessing that is how it is spelled he works for the state and maybe that would be a little more help on the situation yes you can use texflex to pay for your braces texflex is a flexible spending account for state employees your husband will have to sign up for it during the employee benefit enrollment period this should be coming up soon so be sure and check the dates now the amount of money you choose to have available for the flex account will be deducted from your husband's paycheck before taxes are deducted they will divide the flex amount by the number of paychecks per year and that will be the amount deducted each pay period make sure that you only elect the amount of money you know you will use during the coverage year as the irs rules are use it or lose it the texflex plan also uses a debit card system so this is very convenient for payment to the dental provider you don't have to pay first and submit for reimbursement anymore ultimately you are still paying for the braces but you are using before tax dollars which lowers your tax liability at the end of the year check the website below it is the texflex website Social Security (United States) United Kingdom corporation tax Taxation in the United States Credit card Insurance Health savings account FairTax Flat tax Publicly funded medicine Payroll Life insurance Tax Microeconomics Health insurance Unemployment benefit Annuity Food Stamp Program National Insurance Student loan Auto insurance Cheque Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Child support Mortgage Wal-Mart Retirement plan Public transport Tax protester Personal finance Medicare (United States) Variable universal life insurance Bank Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Tax resistance Progressive tax Social Security debate (United States) Tax avoidance/evasion Apprenticeship Limited liability company EFTPOS Article One of the United States Constitution H-1B visa Compensation of employees Health care in the United States Medicare (Canada) Mutual fund Government debt Income trust Dividend George W.
