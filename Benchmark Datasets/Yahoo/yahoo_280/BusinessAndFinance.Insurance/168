i have a serious question please help ok my brother was driving a friend's car while intoxicated and hit parked cars he got a ticket for a dui his friend gave him the keys to her car and told him to drive and she knew he didn't have any driver's license how dumb of her right will her insurance company pay for my brother's medical bills she's saying that her insurance company is suing my brother and she's the one who gave him the keys to her car when he was drunk can they actually do that or would she be the one to get sued let me know thanks this is his first dui by the way since your brother was driving the car with the owners permission he automatically is afforded liability coverage to cover the two parked cars if the friend did not have enough coverage to pay for all the car damages your bro might get stuck paying the excess damages depending on if the friend has med pay or personal injury protection pip his medical bills would be covered up to the limits of that coverage if the friend did not have med pay or pip then your bro has to pay the med bills himself unless he has health insurance and can talk them into paying the bills if your brother was driving the car with the owners permission he is considered an insured under the friends policy insurance companies can not sue permissive drivers for the damages they caused edit in most states not having a driving license does not mean coverage will not apply i have paid hundreds of claims over the years where the driver was unlicensed Auto insurance Insurance Life insurance Medical malpractice Liability insurance Contract Publicly funded medicine Drunk driving (United States) Driver's license Automatic number plate recognition Driving under the influence Copyright Public domain Road-rule enforcement camera Drug test Workers' compensation Tort reform Home insurance Negligence Corporation Health care in the United States Pharmaceutical company Nuclear power phase-out Mothers Against Drunk Driving Wal-Mart Non-economic damages caps Medicare (Canada) Evel Knievel Tort Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act Estoppel Mobile phone radiation and health Automobile National Kidney Foundation Singapore U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Driving Saskatchewan Government Insurance Medicine Lloyd's of London Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Taxation in the United States Consensual crime London Congestion Charge Employee Retirement Income Security Act Intellectual property Nintendo Entertainment System Fox News 2005 trial of Michael Jackson John F.
