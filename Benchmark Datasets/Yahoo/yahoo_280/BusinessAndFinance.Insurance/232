i had a small kitchen fire better to claim it on insurance or pay for damages myself i had a small kitchen fire my fault totally i left a pot on a burner that was turned on and then went to work ugh not any structural damage to home but kitchen will have to be replaced and lots of smoke damage throughout entire house i've seen questions from other folks that seem to indicate once they make a fire claim their carriers drop them i'm insured through nationwide and they have trouble getting subsequent homes insured i really can't afford to repair the damages myself it will probably take me months to pay for all the necessary repairs myself piecemeal does anyone in maryland have any experience good or bad with regard to similar claims filed through nationwide file the claim it is what you pay your insurance for if it were for i would say suck it up and move on but this is serious damage and you are going to come out ahead in the long run trust me you may have to change carriers at renewal if they jack up your rates it will depend on how long you have been a customer and your prior claims experience versus their company's policy on the reprocussions regardless smoke damage seeps deep into the walls and fabrics of everything and you need a professional company to come in and clean up you can get by sleeping on a couch for awhile but you cannot get by with a partial kitchen for an entire year you deserve to be compensated for what you have been insuring yourself for accidents like these no matter how stupid it was you have already paid for it with your premiums over the years your premiums will go up the next three years until the claim drops off no matter what company you are with but nationwide may not penalize you if you have been with them for a few years do your research for companies such as allstate and farmers insurance that do not penalize their loyal customers for one claim every x number of years the cheapest rates aren't always the best companies to place your trust in and unfortunately claims are normally the way most people find this out if they don't have an insurance agent they meet with to discuss their needs Insurance Life insurance Health insurance Kitchen Auto insurance Lloyd's of London Plame affair Contract Medical malpractice Mutual fund Sears Holdings Corporation Unemployment Wal-Mart Variable universal life insurance Publicly funded medicine Cable television Best Buy Berkshire Hathaway United States Postal Service SCO-Linux controversies Workers' compensation Liability insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Home insurance Daylight saving time Theory of conduct Health care in the United States Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Nuclear power phase-out Medicare (Canada) Social rule Title insurance Tort reform Adverse selection Annuity Poker jargon Microeconomics Blackjack Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Delta Air Lines Citigroup Doomsday argument Patent ACORN United Airlines Warren Buffett Trust (Law) USA 2005 trial of Michael Jackson New York City Unemployment benefit Air New Zealand Corporate governance USS Tunny (SS-282) Amtrak Public domain M16 (rifle) Asbestos Eliot Spitzer Slander and libel Hyperinflation Seismic retrofit Taxation in the United States Causality Bond Primerica Financial Services Solar cell Outsourcing Credit card Evan Mecham Saskatchewan Government Insurance Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company Total Annihilation Flat tax Pretty Good Privacy Jos__ Luis Rodr__guez Zapatero Beavis and Butt-head One Piece minor characters Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Giffen good U.S. Democratic Party presidential nomination, 2004 Major League Baseball television contracts National Football League Earthquake insurance Model (economics) Fire fighting GunZ The Duel Stove Telephone numbering plan Debt Strategic management American International Group Wall Street Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act Hendrick Motorsports
