home owner insurance i am buying a home where previous owner had an insurance claim in does my hoa premium will be higher because of that also am i obliged to informed by hoa company about this previous claim thanks my mistake i should not write hoa i mean hoi home owner insurance i will correct it in my original question actually strange as it may seem the previous owner's claims experience can figure into your rate if the claims arises from some problem with the property itself or its location and just as strange if not more so is the claims experience you had with a previous property which is totally unrelated to the new property you own or are about to buy go figure but either way the issues are arguable and logical instruction may persuade the current carrier to forget all that stuff but you said five years ago unlikely that would survive to haunt your rate today are you obligated to tell your insurer about it only if they ask in which case i would say something like there was some kind of claim i think about years ago obviously i wasn't there at the time so i can't tell you much more truth is the insurer already knows about that claim because it all goes into a big database what they really want to know is are you telling the truth and thus you come to realize that you are important to the risk as is the property be guided accordingly Insurance Life insurance Lloyd's of London Annuity Health insurance Capitalism Oakland Athletics Mortgage Publicly funded medicine Auto insurance Vietnam Microeconomics Identity and change Institutional fund management Privatization David Hume Intellectual property Estoppel Title insurance Philosophy of language Adverse selection Modal logic Logic SCO-Linux controversies Scientology beliefs and practices Scenes from a Memory Medical malpractice Contract Capital accumulation Wealth Citigroup Divorce Philosophy of business Labor theory of value Risk management Doomsday argument EastEnders Anarchism and capitalism United Kingdom corporation tax Slander and libel Unemployment Theodicy Ownership Berkshire Hathaway Abortion debate Tax American individualist anarchism U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Digital rights management Public domain Liability insurance Channel 4 Debt Warranty Mutual fund Plame affair Donald Trump Unemployment benefit Cable television Variable universal life insurance Member of the European Parliament Goodness and value theory Intelligent design British national identity card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Predatory lending Edgar Cayce Simone Weil Ethics Earthquake insurance Donald Davidson (philosopher) National Insurance Economy of Russia Warren Buffett Trademark CPU cache Geometry Truth G__del's incompleteness theorem Education Collateralized debt obligation Anarcho-capitalism Doctor (Doctor Who) Economics Bayesian inference Metaphysics Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Financial markets Security (finance) Bertrand Russell Victor Cousin Dynamic Systems Development Method Martin Heidegger Model (economics) Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Belief revision Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited
