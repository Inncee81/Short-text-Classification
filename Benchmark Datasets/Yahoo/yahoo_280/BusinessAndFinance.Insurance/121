what should i be looking in a health plan to cover a family of four i e hmo ffs etc i'm starting a new job and have to choose between different health insurance plans and i'm very confused i would choose a pos point of service plan if i could afford the higher premiums first if not i would choose a ppo preferred provider organization and thirdly a hmo health maintanence organization all types use networks but pos and ppos allow you to go outside the network whenever you want coverage won't be as good out of network with an hmo you must use an in network provider unless it's an emergency this means your current doctor may not be on an hmo plan and you would have to switch doctors with an hmo there is a gatekeeper meaning you have to get approval prior to having specialized care with a pos plan you need a doctor's referral and with a ppo you need no prior approval all types of health plans have copays typically and hmos have no deductibles while ppos and pos plans do this means that with an hmo only your copay will come out of pocket and witha ppo or pos you may have to satisfy a deductible and cover a portion of the charges usually if you have a major medical event this makes a good case for hmos but hmos have the highest degree of utilization review meaning the hmo will often refuse to pay for treatment that may be medically necessary hmo doctors either receive a salary or a set fee for service from the hmo as well as bonuses for keeping costs down this may lead them to recommend that you don't need treatment that you may need or you may receive substandard service in order to keep costs low hmos are all about preventative care and they try very hard to not pay for expensive treatments and surgeries ppos and pos plans have some utilization review but it is on a much smaller scale than hmos typically the best claims processing and claims approval to denial ratio is with a pos plan that's one reason why pos plans cost more Publicly funded medicine Medicare (Canada) Insurance Preferred provider organization Life insurance Canadian and American health care systems compared National Health Service Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health savings account Medicine Wal-Mart Microeconomics Transsexuality Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Mutual fund Medical malpractice Canada Health Act EFTPOS Obesity Mental Health Act 1983 Nurse Education in Germany Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medicare (United States) Kaiser Permanente US health reform under FDR Education in Portugal Cable television General practitioner Telephone numbering plan Anorexia nervosa Food and Drug Administration Mortgage Physician Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Healthcare system Relationship marketing United Kingdom corporation tax Centrelink Open access Medical record Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Involuntary commitment Legal aspects of transsexualism Alternative medicine Growth hormone treatment Medical prescription TGV Social Security (United States) Medicare (Australia) Gas metal arc welding For-profit hospital People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement Tax Health care in Canada Stomach cancer Information Technology Infrastructure Library Divorce Natural monopoly Homeopathy Myocardial infarction X.25 Antiretroviral drug Auto insurance National Kidney Foundation Singapore Thermal power station Pharmaceutical company High-definition television Abortion Contract Emergency Medical Services Breastfeeding Virgin Mobile Graduate school Student loan Abortion in Canada FairTax Psychiatry Employee Retirement Income Security Act Medical ethics Economic inequality Podiatrist Church of Christ, Scientist Taxation in the United States
