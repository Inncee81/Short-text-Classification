slip and fall accident over a year ago and my atty is just now sending a demand is this taking along time is he just wanting to go to trial to get even more money but my expenses keep going up also can i get a second laywer and they split the are you still treating or have recently finished demands are rarely made until it can be determined how much the medical bills will be and what type of ongoing injuries you will have an insurance company and or jury isn't going to pay you for a future injury if your doctor hasn't determined that you will have ongoing effects and your lawyer would be committing malpractice to attempt to settle without knowing if you will have future issues once your treatment has reached a stable point or finished the lawyer will request the medical records and bills to date this can take a couple of months to compile and prepare a demand so if it has been months since you finished treating and there still isn't a demand call and ask what the delay is attorneys don't want your case to a lawsuit in general non suit cases get them while suit cases get them however the attorney does very little work on a non suit case they send out a couple of letters they have staff compile and summarize medical records and they argue with an adjuster a couple of times it isn't worth their time going to court for an extra couple of percent as for hiring another lawyer it can get complicated your first lawyer has a lien on any settlement they might be willing to share your money with another lawyer but they aren't required to and if the delay is your only issue it isn't worth going into how to change lawyers your best bet is to call your lawyer's office a couple of times a week find out who his her paralegal is and get them on the phone if they can't explain the delay make yourself a pain in the by taking up a lot of their time the paralegal will bug the lawyer to get this case moving as for your slip and fall i have never seen a case i thought deserved any money the world is dangerous watch out this is your warning sign Medical malpractice Insurance Plame affair Lawyer Tort reform John Edwards Attorney at Law Tom DeLay Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Divorce Karl Rove Lawsuit Appeal Prostate cancer Juris Doctor Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Ronnie Earle National Kidney Foundation Singapore Canadian and American health care systems compared Microeconomics Fair Game (Scientology) Health insurance Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Same-sex marriage in Canada Fred Phelps Theory of conduct Asbestos American Civil Liberties Union Inflation Contract Extreme Programming Rosa Parks Supply and demand Life insurance Law firm SCO-Linux controversies Non-economic damages caps Slander and libel 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 EastEnders Law & Order Katelyn Faber FairTax Unlawful combatant Tennessee State Constitution Growth hormone treatment Common criticisms of Microsoft Childbirth CPU cache Israeli settlement Barrister Pharmaceutical company Asbestos and the law Wal-Mart Purple Heart Hillary Rodham Clinton Cyprus dispute Jessica Lynch Urinary incontinence Abortion in Canada Same-sex marriage in the United States Advance fee fraud Plame affair timeline Conspiracy (TNG episode) Involuntary commitment Fathers' rights Abortion in the United States Bipolar disorder Los Angeles Clippers Negligence Hearsay Traumatic brain injury Legal research Make money fast Keynesian economics Article One of the United States Constitution First aid United States Code ROC presidential election, 2004 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Supreme Court of the United States 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Alternative medicine Mental Health Act 1983 Arguments for and against drug prohibition Discovery (law) Judith Miller (journalist)
