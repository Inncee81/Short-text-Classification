can my grandparents insurance policy keep them from moving my grandparents claim that their insurance company said that they cannot move from the town they live in because their insurance will not cover them in another town also even if the town is nearby and they could drive to appointments they still would not be covered is this possible because they live in a really bad neighborhood and they really need to move please help by the way i think their insurance is medicare of medicaid medicaid is state specific so if they've got medicaid they lose it if they move to a different state they'd have to apply with the new state and depending upon income levels and guidelines of the new state they may or may not qualify medicare is from the federal government so is good all over the nation it actually sounds like they have medicare with a medicare advantage plan these plans are county specific so they may not be covered if they move to a different county however they will qualify to get on a different plan in the new county these plans are guaranteed issue so they won't have any problem switching you are right about not being able to keep the current plan and driving to appointments Publicly funded medicine Health insurance Medicaid Medicare (Canada) Medicare (United States) Taxation in the United States Life insurance Health care in the United States Social Security (United States) Social issues in the United States Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Canadian and American health care systems compared Economy of the United States HIPAA Flat tax Barbara Boxer Canadian federal election, 1965 US health reform under FDR Democratic Party (United States) Social Security debate (United States) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Policy Debate National Insurance Unemployment benefit Health maintenance organization Medicare Part D Medicare (Australia) George W.
