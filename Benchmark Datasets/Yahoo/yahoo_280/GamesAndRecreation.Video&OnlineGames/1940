neopets i need a neopets account that is months old the reason is becuase mine is only days old and i don't wanna waste months to have to restock if you have one you don't use i would love to have it thanks a lot it's against the rules to give away an account sorry you don't have to be months to restock you just won't be able to see the higher rarity items if you have a day old account because your old one was frozen i suggest you make a side account so that if your new main gets frozen you won't have to wait another months to restock higher rarity items Gradius Konami Code Contra (arcade game) Konami Cheat code Contra Force Power-up Boss (video games) John Donne Parodius Operation C Twinbee Super Contra Treasure Co.
