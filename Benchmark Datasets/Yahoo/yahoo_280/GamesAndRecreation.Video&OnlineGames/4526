how does nintendo wi fi work for the nintendo ds mainly for pokemon diamond pearl i don't have the wi fi usb adapter thing yet but i might get it i haven't found a website that explains how it works and i tried asking the guys working at ebgames but they have no idea what they're talking about the only game i would play on wi fi would be pokemon diamond i know how to go wireless with my friend's ds and diamond at my house but i don't understand wi fi and how it works and what your computer needs to have to be compatible with the wi fi adapter i heard you needed like a wireless internet connection i'm pretty sure i have broadband internet i have windows xp and a usb adpater on the tower i also heard that their is a distance thing that you can only be so many feet away from the wi fi adapter or the connection won't work thanks if you have a d link or any type of wireless internet routers then just turn the game on with the pokemon in then just fix your wireless connection on the main menu of diamond pearl Latios Latias Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon (anime) Pok__mon Adventures Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Heroes Pok__mon Abilities Pok__mon Trading Card Game Pok__mon Pok__mon Colosseum Altaria Sapphire Elite Four Pacifidlog Town Missingno.
