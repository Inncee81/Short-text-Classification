my broke first everytime i played a game it would freeze and that happens off and on now when i put a game in it sounds like it is getting scratched and makes a loud rumble noise what should i do is it over heating because my games were hot when i took them out if you have and early model then yes it is over heating try not playing as long and saving and turning ur off when you get up to do something like make dinner or go to the bathroom it may take longer to play but it cools the system down after a couple minutes and its worth it if you don't want the red ring of death Pok__mon Abilities Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Pok__mon types Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Trading Card Game Pok__mon Emerald Elite Four Gengar Missingno.
