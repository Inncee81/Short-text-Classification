which move is better stone edge or avalanche which one should i use with toterra against flying with not very high speed stone edge rock pp damage acc has high chance of critical hit or avalanche ice pp damage acc if user is struck before attacking damage is doubled arrrrrrgggghhhhhhhhh silly me torterra cant learn ice attacks xd the question is now should i use stone edge or rock slide sorry i had to use capitals just so people can notice the change of question since it is a flying both would have the super effective neither has stab however stone edge has that high chance critical hit and does more damage with reduction of accuracy is still a good chance to hit in pokemon my personal recommendation is stone edge i like that critical hit ratio over the that the other has also if it doesnt hit you should hopefully have enough hp to cover since it has a decent amount of defense base stats im pretty sure that a flying attack would be physical if it gets a chance to use one should be a one hit ko Pok__mon types Pok__mon Abilities Diablo II: Lord of Destruction RuneScape weapons GunBound Wild ARMs 2 Professional wrestling attacks Limit Break Naruto jutsu MapleStory Final Fantasy magic Drill bit Floppy disk Pok__mon move Professional wrestling throws Fast bowling Volleyball Baseball statistics Fuzion RuneScape Ragnarok Online Blitzball Unreal Natural disaster Final Fantasy XI Warrior (World of Warcraft) GunZ The Duel Togetic 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Team Fortress Classic Protoss Pok__mon evolution Ice hockey Gameplay of StarCraft Avalanche Professional wrestling aerial techniques Mountaineering Baseball Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Knife GURPS Rugby league Fielding (cricket) Internal ballistics Terran (StarCraft) Weapon Aggron Castle of the Winds Diablo II Pok__mon Gold and Silver Drowning Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Terminal ballistics Defense of the Ancients Table tennis Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Worms weapons and tools Lairon Mattress AC/DC Aerial (dance move) Heinkel He 100 Solar system Hard disk Items in the Metroid series Natural Selection (computer game) Stall (flight) Hitmonchan Baseball Stars Tank Guilty Gear Day of Defeat Starsiege: Tribes Phase (matter) Curling Softball Ace Combat 5 Helicopter Groudon Stopping power Races of Final Fantasy Lift-induced drag Quake III Arena Chansey Tsunami Movie projector Decibel Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory F/A-18 Hornet Nuclear fission Orre Bagon V-1 flying bomb Deoxys Paper Mario Dice Metroid Prime Battle of Jutland
