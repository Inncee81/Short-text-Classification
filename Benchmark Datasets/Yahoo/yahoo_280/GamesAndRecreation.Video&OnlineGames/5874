project gotham racing achievements for completing solo game silver level what about bronze gamerpoints i am currently completing all races at bronze level and then repeating them on silver directly after each race gamerpoints are available for completing all the championships at silver level and gamerpoints are available for completing all at bronze level because it is too time consuming and too easy to do each race twice if i stop doing the races on ease bronze level and only do them on medium silver level when i finish all the championships on medium will i also receive the gamerpointsfor completing the championships at easy level many thanks in advance adam ok cheers guys one expanded point then the game shows you the top medal achieved for each race but for example where i have achieved a silver medal in a race not a bronze say i skipped it how are we supposed to know which races we still have to complete at bronze level if there is no way of knowing it would suggest that the only way of getting the easy novice gamerpoints would be to go through all the races one by one on that difficulty again bizarre the people who answered are wrong i completed all champtionships at easy level and upon completing the last race i received a message saying i had unlocked achievements and received gamerpoints for easy and for novice therefore if you just do them on silver you will get gamerpoints for the difficulties in pgr you will unlock not only the highest difficulty you completed but every difficulty below that will be consider passed also unlocking the lesser difficulties simultaneously The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Pools of Darkness The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Diablo II RuneScape economy Kingdom Hearts MapleStory The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time places The Legend of Zelda RuneScape quests Final Fantasy Legend III Ogre Battle: March of the Black Queen Blood (computer game) Dragon Quest RuneScape Resident Evil (video game) Norway national football team Chrono Trigger BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Final Fantasy IV Princess Zelda Fighting Fantasy Game Books Hash table The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Temple (Mormonism) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Dragon Quest III Ragnarok Online The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Link (Legend of Zelda) Sly Cooper New York City Subway Legacy of Kain Zelda II: The Adventure of Link Newbie King's Quest Darth Revan Pok__mon Gold and Silver Legal research International League RuneScape weapons Neopets Zones of EverQuest Destiny of the Doctors Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Quest Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem Computer role-playing game Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade Read-copy-update Arimaa The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Search algorithm $ale of the Century Resident Evil 4 Tomb Raider The Legend of Zelda series Fable (video game) Computer chess Sierra's Creative Interpreter Laxius Power III Samus Aran Algorithm Diablo II: Lord of Destruction EverQuest MMORPG Search engine Gaia Online Final Fantasy Final Fantasy XI Golden Sun Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Homestar Runner Super Bowl XXIII Bagpipes Quake III Arena The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown The Ersatz Elevator Sonic & Knuckles Adventure game Time Out of Mind Final Fantasy Mystic Quest Self-balancing binary search tree 2005 English cricket season Metroid Prime Legend of Mana Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game NBA Finals .hack//INFECTION Fallout (computer game) Items in the Metroid series Ra (board game) Sorting Gothic rock RuneScape Mini-Games Animal Crossing Adventure racing
