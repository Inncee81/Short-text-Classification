how do i get magic armour on twilight princess how do you get the magic armour on the legend of zelda twilight princess okay this is one of those side quests that makes zelda so great and so time consuming at one point in the game malo takes over an empty storefront in kakariko village there's a goron inside asking for donations so that malo can expand his business to the big city there's two ways to do this you can give him enough money to re build the bridge and then continue giving him money until they've gotten all they need or you can just fund his bridge rebuilding project and then talk to the goron outside the store to do the powder keg miniquest either way the bridge has to be rebuilt once all that is taken care of malomart opens a second store in central castle town in the area with the fountain and the musicians the magic armour is available there for a hefty price if you're just trying to get it to say you have it then go for it but it really didn't do me much good once i bought it check out gamefaqs com for more detailed information good luck RollerCoaster Tycoon Roller coaster Valleyfair!
