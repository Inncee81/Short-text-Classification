when does your kid finally talk in harvest moon magical melody in my old file my kid was and still couldn't talk i started a new file and i am really curious as to when this happens unfortunately the main characters in the harvest moon games typically do not have a voice of their own i have often wondered why this is the case myself as i have played every version of the game i think they may have carried that aspect of the game over to the kids too i didn't play that particular version beyond the point you have though so it still remains to be seen here's hoping that we are lucky enough to bear children that speak lol Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Koopa Kid Breath of Fire III Yu-Gi-Oh!
