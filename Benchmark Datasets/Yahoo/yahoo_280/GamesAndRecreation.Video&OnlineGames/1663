i'm joining world of warcraft and was wondering what race and class i should be needs to be strong good for pvp i need hourd if thats how you spell it lol maybe a rouge or a hunter is an undead rouge a good choice as a main well you want to be horde so that narrows your choices down a bunch and you are looking for good pvp so you have a few choices an undead warlock is a great pvp class and comes with an npc pet so is great at soloing well good in groups too a great overall choice an undead priest who specializes in shadow is also a great later game pvp choice and everyone will want to group with a priest shadow specs are still the best healers out of all other classes until late game tauren druids are my personal favorite as they can switch between different class roles at the press of a button good at pvp if you spec in feral otherwise they can be great healers tanks and dps but not at the same time in my opinion these three make the best pvp and are very fun enjoy the game RuneScape MMORPG MapleStory RuneScape skills RuneScape cheats RuneScape economy RuneScape locations RuneScape dungeons RuneScape weapons Computer role-playing game RuneScape slang and terminology RuneScape quests RuneScape Random Events RuneScape gods RuneScape Mini-Games RuneScape runes Neopets Bow Wow Wow Scrabble E-mail World of Warcraft E-mail spam Jagex Star Wars: Galaxies Stopping e-mail abuse Dragon Quest Kalphite Queen Super Mario Bros.
