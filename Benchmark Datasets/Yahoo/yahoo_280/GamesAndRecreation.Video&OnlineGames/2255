my sims game keeps on crashing when i try to put my sims into a house well i downloaded a bunch a stuff on modthesims dot com my new sims are still in the family bin thingy and i cant put them in a house or play with them or anything cuz everytime i try to do that a window says that it needs to terminate what do i do to have it work well the problem you are describing usually happens when you are trying to enter a lot where something has got corrupted or you have placed a piece of custom content that is not working properly if you haven't put any of the stuff from mts in that lot i think it's unlikely to be that though it might be mts has fairly strict acceptance proceedures for the stuff that is posted and of it is problem free assuming you install it properly and have the right expansions or can you not enter any lot with that family in that case it's likely to be a problem skin and i'd guess you'd used a custom skin that is causing problems on one of the family members you'd need to find the skin and delete it does the same thing happen if you try to enter an empty lot try deleting groups cache it's a file in my documents ea games the sims don't worry about deleting it this sometimes helps with crashes but might not in this case if you think it's a problem with the lot try this turn on debug mode this is the thing that many people wrongly call boolprop go into your neighbourhood screen and then enter the cheat code boolprop testingcheatsenabled true i'm assuming you know how to get the cheat box up this turns debug mode on try to enter the lot and see if the game throws an error if it does first of all try to work out from the error and there will also be an error log in the logs folder to look at too what is causing the problem secondly choose the delete option the lot should load normally if it's a problem with the lot though the thing that was causing the problem will have been deleted if you are not used or nervous about using debug mode turn it off which is the same cheat but with false instead of true it will reset anyway when you close the game Nintendo Game Boy Handheld game console Game Boy Color Pac-Man Game Boy Advance Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation Portable Computer and video game genres Platform game Poker jargon Video game controversy Sega Game Boy Micro History of video games (Sixth generation era) Nintendo GameCube History of computer and video games Commodore 64 Pok__mon (video games) Nintendo Revolution Palm OS Donkey Kong Mortal Kombat Neo-Geo Apple Newton IBM PC compatible GamePark Game programmer Sega Game Gear Atari 2600 Computer role-playing game Game show Rare (video game company) Mouse (computing) Nintendo Entertainment System Donkey Kong Country Atari I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Microeconomics Super Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Saturn Wheel of Fortune Gradius Console game TurboGrafx 16 Tai shogi Final Fantasy (video game) Handheld electronic game Mario Intellivision Motion picture rating system Minesweeper (computer game) Colecovision Resident Evil (video game) Metal Gear Solid First-person shooter Graphical user interface The Legend of Zelda series Gameking Mao (game) Macromedia Flash Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Video game console The Emancipation of Mimi RuneScape cheats Commodore 128 Nintendo Power Console wars Cheating in Counter-Strike Computer animation Sega Dreamcast Home computer Betting (poker) Computer and video games Fischer Random Chess Donkey Kong (arcade game) Donkey Kong 64 King of Fighters Aerial (dance move) Microsoft Xbox 360 Atari Lynx Super Mario remake series Billiards Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest Mattress ZX Spectrum Embedded system PostScript Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories PlayStation 2 Slot machine Digital photography Ebook
