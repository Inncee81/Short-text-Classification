death once she's finished go through the gate ye olde road now you play as donkey go down the path destroying everything one crate near the end has a mug on the left before the two on crates go onwards destroying things one crate behind a rock on the left where three peasants attack you carries a mug if you see a trophy on top of crates you've just passed it go onwards collecting that trophy and still destroying everything until the carriage starts throwing hay at you go up the rocks to the left of the path and beat up the two peasants and crates one of them has a mug keep chasing the

the carriage once you're inside the building beat up all the peasants go onto the stone platform on the left collect the trophy then break all the crates then meet shrek acadamy grounds go forward and

around and you'll find the nerd in the top right corner of the map there's a trophy in the top right and a mug in one of the statues after the nerd runs away again he moves to the bottom left go get him he runs to the gate now go meet him collect the key then go through the gate run ahead while beating up the witches soon you will play as puss go into the water then climb the ledges the platforming in this game is terrible so it will be a bit difficult anyways once you're at the top jump over the barricade and break the crates to the left for a mug then activate the lever now you're shrek go into the gate then after you talk to the kid take an immediate left run down the pathway and enter the empty door go down here fighting the jocks and breaking the lockers the last set next to the witches has a mug fight the witches then keep going into the gymnasium fight the jocks here go onto through the open door and there will be a boss battle like the last one this time don't use the soccer balls donkey and puss give you run to the back and use the barrels then once you hit the red witches with them run up and whack them once they're done cutscene prison cell block now you play as sleeping beauty whatever break everything in the cell then use your fairy dust attack on the prisoner before you go straight ahead go right and take out the crates for a tiara fight the prisoners in the prison cell then take that path that goes straight ahead fight your way onwards once you're outside you will fight trees and prisoners there's no real difference so just fight onwards it's a linear path anyways up ahead is the first real puzzle of the game stomp on the center one then stomp on the left one twice all three are yellow diamonds and the gate is open beat up the guard and press on destroy that wooden thing at the end for another tiara then go into the cell on the right and float down the hole break the barrel at the bottom for a mug and then go all the way to the back for another mug then go forwards up the stairs and fight onwards break the barrel next to the column in the room with foor columns for another tiara keep going up ahead is a room with gaps that sleeping beauty can float down and platforms with coins on it just fall down and try and float near the top right of the hole so that you can get the mug at the bottom stomp on the switch and hit the locker to free the geek then head right and go down the path you can jump down again in case you missed the mug there's also a colouring page too in the bottom left otherwise jump across the platforms and through the gate the wooden thing to the left of the gate holds another mug up ahead is another boss battle of sorts only strong attacks work on him so use them destroy the crates for more goodes including the last tiara get the key then go back to the locked door which had a silver mug behind it lancelot's castle capture okay now you play a sort of minigame called castle capture you basically have to knock down the enemy's towers basically just aim with wasd and hold space to control the power tab and q change weapons that's about it really easy high high peak there's nothing to do here but run forwards and beat up gnomes and snowmen the first and third snowmen have hats for you to collect there will be some whelps too but they're nothing different the snowman across the first bridge has a hat after you cross the second bridge and are ambushed by whelps go down towards the camera you will see a red coin go to where it is and jump to the bottom right of the screen there will be a mug on a platform after you get it go back and continue going right on the platform where two gnomes hide behind snowmen the one to the left has a hat after you're done with them jump to the right onto the platforms and head into the cave in the cave the gnomes will set up three fights between you a knigt whelps and a flying whelp it's not hard once you're done go through the door fight the knights and chase the gnome down into more knights once they're all gone go through the doorway on the right at the end of the tunnel and go along the ledge before jumping onto the platforms with coins turn left and get the mug then go onto those platforms hit the lever at the top then run all the way back to that gateway you just opened head on down the path you will come across a bunch of knights so beat them up the leader has a shield so just charge up your strong attack to break it once you're done ice comes out use it to jump up onto the mine tracks if the ice melts hit the snow pile for more go along these tracks to the left hit the lever and the snowman for an opened gate and the last hat go through the opened gate back where you got onto the tracks and collect the key proceed on this path and you'll drop down onto a familiar place jump on the platforms and go back to arthur and use the key on the door ice lake go down the path and beat up the knights destroy the last snowman on the left for a hat to get the floating mug hit the ice pile to let loose a cube for you to stand on and jump to the mug then go to arthur now the lady wants shoes go the to the right of the area and collect all the shoes to get the first one which is in midair hit the ice pile for a cube and push it within range do it quick before it melts there's another one near it so get it too then go back to where you came you'll see another shoe in midair where the snowman with the mug was use the ice pile to get another cube to get it then go back to where you started the game there's another shoe in the alcove there keep going left for more shoes jump off the ledge to get the shoe in midair use the ice pile to get a cube for the mug then head right to get another shoe jump on the platforms there to get the last shoe once you've got it head back to the lady now you will play as arthur who is by far the best fighter yet follow the tracks and go into the door that was closed before follow the tracks and fight whatever comes in your way at the end of the tracks the camera will shift and focus on a button go towards the camera for a colouring page then go stomp on the button go back to that now opened door and ride the elevator down fight the gnomes on the way at the bottom just go and activate the well now you have to go to the left and fight your way along the platforms just do it once you get to the top follow shrek through the platforms collect the mug on the way just after the knights you'll see a hat go get it and continue on into the cave ice cave go down the path and fight everything along the way the second snowmen has a colouring page after you see the dragon you will play as arthur fight down his path too no extra goodies okay now comes the first real boss battle of the game and to be honest it's relatively hard the dragon has an assorment of physical attacks from a simple punch to a bite they're easily avoided by moving arond sometimes it breathes or shoots ice at you you can avoid it easily the thing to watch for it when it jumps if it lands while your'e still on the ground you will be stunned so jump up too when it calls down icicles run around to its tail and start hitting it there's no way to do massive damage to this thing what you have to do are get in hits here and there the best strategy is to run around in circles as far from the dragon as possible then occasionally jump in hit it once or twice then land back where you jumped from all while going in that far circle once the dragon knocks you up go to donkey prison detention center go back and crack open the big crate for a colouring page then head down the path break the first stump outside for a mug then keep going down the stone path break the barrels opposite to the building entrance for a tiara then keep going through the path in the building now you'll have to avoid some traps easily done as it's just some columns going up and down they stay up for quite a while so you can easily run through break the stuff on the way for a tiara the last column has a hole under it so float down and proceed along this path you'll come to another cyclops and his minions beat them all up for the cyclops block his attack and strong attack him once you're done break all the crates for food and then use the cage to jump up to the ledge where the cyclops was break the boxes there to get a mug then stomp on the switch to open the gate go through it once you go through a prisoner in a cage will come rolling down thanks to the havok engine it will probably be slowed down stopped or deflected so it shouldn't be of any real concern just go along the path a guard will lock you in and an infinite amount of prisoners will come at you break the stuff in this room for a tiara and mug use the fairy dust attack on the guard to get him to open the gate so you can proceed along the path up ahead are more traps then comes more platforms like last time you played as sleeping beauty but this time you can't fall down break the barrel on the left for a mug then get across to the other side and head left you'll see a hole you can float down ignore the stairs and jump across floating down the far wall there you can get gold coins and another tiara meet with fiona at the bottom use you fairy dust attack on the guard to get him to open the gate now you're fiona use her fairy dust attack on the door to open it hit the statue of the fairy godmother for more fairy dust the next room will have a respawning guards to stop them use fiona's fairy dust

tree you will take massive amount of damage go get the third horseshoe then destroy the big wooden beaver then destroy the trunk for a mug then make your way up the path right as you get to the top
