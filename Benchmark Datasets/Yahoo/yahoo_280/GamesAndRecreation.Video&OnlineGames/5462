world of warcraft question i want to do gemcrafting to make money but i do not know how to start i have mining as a profestion i already bought a gemcrafting box but i dont no how to use it plz help if you are alliance go to exodar and pick up up from the trainer there it is like any other crafting profession but i caution you you will not make money until you are about skill when you can make blue gems and to get to that point you will spent hundreds of gold to do so so it is a large investment upfront before you start making money and even when you get to the blue patterns are boe and sell for a couple hundred gold on my server so that is more upfront investment before you make money in my option there are far better ways to make money with professions based on the upfront cost Nintendo Nintendo DS Super Mario 64 Video game character Nintendo Power Nintendo GameCube Boss (video games) Computer and video game genres Super Smash Bros.
