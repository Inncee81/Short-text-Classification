how do you get mail beta to work on wii i want to use the yahoo mail beta on the wii it use to work about months ago but now it brings me to mobile yahoo mail beta and i dont want to use the mobile one the orignal yahoo mail style does work its only the beta that doesn't the yahoo beta mail system uses special scripting languages that are only understood by full grown desktop browsers the opera browser used in the wii is only a slimmed down version of the original opera browser for pcs and therefore can't handle the mail beta you should however contact yahoo and tell them about it as long as it's a beta they are actively looking for things that don't work as intended and if you tell them it won't work on the wii they have still a chance to change it so it could work on the wii Opera (web browser) Gmail Mozilla Firefox Mac OS X XML Microsoft PHP Browser wars Windows XP Netscape Communications Corporation Yahoo!
