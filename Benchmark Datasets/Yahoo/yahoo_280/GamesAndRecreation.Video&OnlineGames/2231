another guild wars question hi all there are guild wars games up to now and soon eye of the north will be released i want to ask a question i dont have any of the games though i know they are stand alone but i havent understood onw thing assuming i get all games 've read somewhere that if you are a pvp player you should get factions if u r pve nightfall if i get one of them am i gonna be able to see players from the other games what is the difference if someone has all games and other one only lets say i wanna play necromancer what bonus am i gonna have buying all three games instead of stand alone nightfall for example will there be more spells lets say i buy prophecies first and i get lvl if i buy factions and nightfall the quests are gonna give me better items or the best items are in the last game nightfall as you can see all my questions refer to one thing about the usage of the games and why i need all of them since i can get lvl if i get only one thank you hello jouliesk i've played guild wars since it first came out in may i also happen to have all campaigns so hopefully i can be of help to you to answer your first question if you just get one of the campaigns you will see players from the other campaigns if those players have that campaign plus the other one for example if you have nightfall you will only be able to see players originally from let's say factions if that player has factions and nightfall basically if you buy prophecies you have access to the tyria kryta continent factions is the canthan continent nightfall is the elona continent if you purchase prophecies and then factions once your character arrives at a specific city in the tyria continent lion's arch there will be a message that appears saying something like to unlock travel to cantha take the quest from guardsman so and so once you finish that quest you will arrive at the main city in cantha and from there you can travel across that campaign basically the same type of thing with nightfall as well the main differences between the games are different additional skills different weapons and armor different pvp arena areas and heroes in nightfall with each campaign you get around skills for all of the professions you get new classes with factions which are assassin and ritualist you get dervish and paragon classes with nightfall so you must have those campaigns to be able to use those specific classes and the other games automatically come with what they call the core classes which are warrior monk mesmer elementalist ranger and necromancer so if you bought factions you would have those plus the assassin and ritualist if you just bought nightfall you would have the plus dervish and paragon if you just bought prophecies you would just have the heroes are a major advantage because they are basically henchmen or computer controlled characters that you can customize how you want so instead of only being able to take along a henchman warrior from town to quest with you you can take a specific hero from the nightfall campaign you can have up to heroes at one time with you you can change heroes weapons upgrade their armor and change their skills whereas with henchmen you cannot do any of those things you gain heroes to keep with you throughout the game by completing specific missions or quests to me that is a major advantage of nightfall nightfall also seems to have an advantage with overall better skills the skills tend to use less energy and do more damage as compared to the other campaigns nightfall also introduces items that are inscribable meaning that they have an extra upgrade you can put on the items which is another big advantage overall if you are just buying one of the campaigns i would recommend nightfall nightfall has a long campaign up to missions whereas factions only has i believe and feels much shorter prophecies probably has the longest campaign with missions if you are very much into pvp factions does tend to focus more on that and it has the alliance battles which are large vs capture the flag bases type battles which are a lot of fun too however nightfall still seems to be superior with weapons that can be upgraded more better skills heroes etc one site that helps me a lot with a ton of information is gw wiki posted in sources box in conclusion you don't have to have the campaigns each one mainly adds more content with nightfall i believe adding the most i hope that helps you Missingno.
