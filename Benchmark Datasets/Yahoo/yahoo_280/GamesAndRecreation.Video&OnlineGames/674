xbox for ps i am currently pissed off because microsoft makes very little games for xbox now i am considering trading my xbox for a ps does anyone know of a main stream store ebgames bestbuy etc that will let me trade in an xbox for a ps any commercial store like eb games usually has an incredible markup on trade ins i got cents for a ps game once so i would say it's not really worth it but you should still have them appraise it for you if you wouldn't mind waiting you could sell your xbox separately and probably get enough money for ps xboxes are selling for around on ebay and ps s are usually around so if you just sold the xbox you sould be fine keep in mind that the new games being made for the ps are better than the xbox but sony is still leaning towards ps games Xbox 360 Xbox Computer and video games PlayStation 2 Modchip Nintendo GameCube Grand Theft Auto III Xbox Live Psychonauts Game controller Sega Rare (video game company) Sony Computer Entertainment Bulk vending PlayStation 3 Console wars Final Fantasy XI RISC Halo (video game series) Electronics Boutique Video game music Penny Arcade (comic) GameSpot Nintendo Dead or Alive (video game) Acclaim Entertainment Hot Coffee mod Game programmer The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Sega Saturn Make money fast Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Console game Video game developer Spider-Man (games) Game programming Game Critics Awards Video game console Monopoly (game) Defender (game) Legacy of Kain Halo 2 ITunes Music Store History of video games (Sixth generation era) Karaoke Sega Dreamcast 50 Cent Halo: Combat Evolved Timeline of computing 1990-forward History of video games (Seventh generation era) Square Enix Online music store BloodRayne Stormfront Studios Madden NFL Red Storm Entertainment Bungie Studios NVIDIA History of computer and video games Neopets Star Wars: Battlefront Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Digital video recorder Nintendo 64 EverQuest Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX DVD Nintendo DS XML From Software GameFAQs Phantasy Star Online Electronic Arts Football Manager Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield DualShock Retailer Console manufacturer Virtual economy Wal-Mart Rockstar North ATI Technologies Microsoft Game Studios X86 PE ratio Video game crash of 1983 Universal Serial Bus MAME Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Spawn (comics) Crash Bandicoot Spawn: Armageddon Donkey Kong Action Replay Broken Sword Poker jargon Computer and video game packaging Crimson Skies Nintendo Revolution
