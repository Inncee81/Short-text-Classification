how do you get the mystery goo in kingdom hearts i know you're supposed to get the mystery goo from the white mushroom heartless but i always get gems and magic bubbles from them not the goo i need so how do i get it please help the white mushroom this is the mushroom with the red hat and white robes who is the one that most people will likely encounter first in the game the only way to defeat them is to use magic and the mystery is what magic to use and how many times how to defeat it and get treasure you must successfully cast spells that correspond with the mushroom's mood fire use when it crosses its arms and looks like it's shivering blizzard use when it leans back and fans itself thunder use when it has a light over its head cure use when it has fallen on the ground aero use when it is spinning in place stop use when the mushroom has frozen in mid move gravity use when the mushroom is floating in mid air summon there is no summon mood for the mushroom for example even though mushu's fire attack is a fire elemental attack it is pointless to use this on the mushroom when it shivers because you will receive no item for using the fire attack on the mushroom even though it will appear as though you were successful because the mushroom won't disappear summon's against mushrooms are a waste of your time if you hit the mushroom with spells but did not receive the special item mystery goo and received some other random item instead then it is because those three spells were not all three the same exact spell so the percent rate was lower in the japanese release version of the same magic spell on the mushroom gave a percent rate of dropping a mystery goo the usa kh version was tweaked some and the drop rate for mystery goo is somewhat lower so since the majority of you reading this have the usa version the best way to get mystery goo is to cast of the same spell on any mushroom as that yields the highest drop rate for the mystery goo item on another note regarding of the same spell castings if you were to cast fire spells for example then not only might the mushroom drop a mystery goo item but also a fire gem because you used fire spells but also a fire arts the same applies to all the other spells that blizzard spells will produce a blizzard arts and thunder with a gem and arts but gravity stop aero cure don't have gems but do drop random items and do have arts all seven spells have arts gravity arts stop arts etc as far as the arts are concerned these are useful in that if you collect all and get all max level spells firaga thundaga curaga etc you will recieve the shield of dreams from merlin in traverse town if you go speak to him mushroom locations and moods all mushroom locations usually have fire thunder blizzard moods these are marked with a extra moods are listed next to the asterisks such as cure denotes a location with fire thunder blizzard and cure traverse town hotel red room wonderland lotus forest deep jungle outside of tent cure deep jungle jungle hideout cure in the main room with the hole in the floor hades cup tier no treasure dropped atlantica undersea cave stop area on the way to triton's palace marked with two tridents pointing into a small cave atlantica the shipwreck below deck stop agrabah treasure room gravity cave of wonders area with the mountains of gold halloween town graveyard aero this is the first section of the graveyard just past the gates into it end of the world room before last rest save point stop aero gravity cure extra tips there is one mood that really isn't a mood at all the mushrooms do it just to throw you off this is when they freeze in place for a second and look around like they are confused this mood is sometimes followed by the mushroom getting bored and walking around for a few seconds just keep them targetted and follow them so they are still in your line of sight pick one mushroom and stick with him the mushrooms sometimes spawn close together and area spells sometimes hit another mushroom you don't have targeted try to get all the arts and mystery goo you need before you complete the hollow bastion from my own personal experience it is a lot harded to find white mushrooms because the percent rate for the rare truffles another type of mushroom is much higher after this point in the game black fungus this mushroom looks just like the white mushroom except it is wearing dark blue and black robes with a purple hat however to kill these you don't need to use magic but you can if you want depending on what part of the game you fight them in and your character's levels the only advantage fighting them usually yields is experience points how to defeat it and get treasure rarely will the black fungus drop a mystery goo it is theorized that the percent rate of the drop rate is much higher if you use critical hits and combo chains to damage them and critical hits to kill them one of the most rare items in the game is one called mystery mold it is much like pretty stone that you find in the beginning of the game in a chest other than to just have it in your inventory if you are a completeist they sell for in traverse town's shop but if you are in dire need of money don't take this route you'd be lucky to even ever get a mystery goo from a black fungus much less to ever even see a mystery mold a few tips for easier ways to kill these guys are as follows use the trinity limit if you have it this should kill the black fungus outright if you run into them in halloween town use the exploding pumpkins to your advantage they also kill the black fungus in one hit use stop magic then attack them or if you are low on hp or are just tired of fighting them because of their poisonous attacks let donald and goofy do the work for you mushroom locations halloween town pumpkin patch this is the area with the twirly bridge thing that three little kids walk over the spawn rate isn t very high but the black fungus does spawn here end of the world room before last rest save point spawns all mushrooms so it drops the chances of getting only black fungi still fairly quick agrabah bazaar this is the far right and back area accessible only via one route pegasus cup tier ah the annoying battle which makes the speed battle for this cup rather annoying at times hallow bastion dungeon rare truffle these guys look just like the others except they were blue robes and a yellow hat and are replicas of the final fantasy black mage they jump around the place and the only way to defeat them is to keep them in the air with air combo attacks or to cast an aero spell on yourself and keep yourself under them at all times bouncing them back up into the air how to defeat it and get treasure if it is mystery goo extra items and experience points you're after this is the mushroom you want to fight like the white mushroom they are however pretty easy once you know the trick and that trick is to bounce them up in the air over and over and over again of which there are a few ways uppercut trick when you come upon a rare truffle spawn you must first lock on to one of the truffles with lock on abosultely needed watch as the truffle jumps when it lands run up to it and smack it once and only once you notice that when you hit it it bounces into the air despite the fact it was on the ground before anyway you have just smacked the truffle in the air what you want to do now is wait a split second then jump after the truffle and attack it in the air before it comes back and hits the ground you need to jump and then tap the attack button once this will have you attack with an uppercut attack and not the aerial spin attack if you have that ability equipped if you attacked with an aerial spin it s because you didn t jump before hitting the attack button flying neverland trick since you can fly here you can simply fly up and keep smacking truffles with impunity some limitations apply in that you have a little less control of which way a truffle will bounce up and you have to watch out for running into background scenery aero trick this is perhaps the easiest one cast your version of aero and run up and touch the truffle into the air it goes stand under it bounce it recast aero as needed before it runs out to extend bounce sessions as needed and reap easy rewards ragnarok trick use in conjunction with the uppercut trick select raganarok and let it rip on a truffle make sure you pull off the entire combo good finisher lots of hits you get treasure based on how many times you hit and bounce a truffle times mystery goo elixir times mystery goo elixir shiitake scroll times mystery goo last elixir matsutake scroll the scrolls items like the other special items are again not much worth the game explanation simply noting that these scrolls show your ability in being a master of bouncing the truffle or times an interesting extra the scrolls shiitake matsutake are names after actual types of japanese mushrooms finally juggling rare truffles nets huge amounts of experience where n equals the number of times you bounced a mushroom you gain n n experience for each juggling sessions what that means is for a hit juggle you will gain experience easily the fastest way to level up in the game should you get ahold of enough rare truffles combine this with fighting rare truffles in the collesieum as well as hitting pause right before a battle ends to redo a rare truffle battle and you can make max level in less than an hour or two mushroom locations end of the world room before last rest save point again the save reload or respawn trick here easiest place to fight the truffles outside of the collieseum with the uppercut trick neverland deck of ship this is the area you fight captain hook tho of course you will not see truffle s here the first time you get there the ship structure makes straight up truffle fighting really not easy but there is always the option of flying for a real air combo as per the above trick spawn rates are seemingly good halloween town area right before boogie s house this is the area with the short bridge and the water passage which leads back to the fountain in guillotine sqaure spawn rates seem very small but its possible to find rare truffles here geography can make fighting here easy or hard easy because you can trap truffles in the corners of the sewer area where the spawn hard because the camera can go crazy in those areas note if you hit a truffle onto a slope and it slides down and you hit it before it hits the water it does not count as the truffle touching land and disappearing hercules cup tier i highly recommend beating the time attack for this cup so you can freely select to battle truffles here of course no dropped items but practicing here is mad exp and is good for training for the uppercut trick hades cup tier you can fight this one fairly easily without having to do time attacks to get the selectable battle option but really if you have the hades cup open the hercules time attack should be doable monstro throat they appear here in the area before the monstro main fight truffle tips this is the truffle that once you got your jump then attack rythym down assuming using the uppercut trick you will have the mystery goo's rolling in i was fighting them once and checked how many i had and my count was at enough to make enough attack point items to max out sora s attack level at p during a typical fight don t expect to get much more than mystery goo's however as getting the combo limit takes some time and you only have enough time to combo two truffles up to before the others dissappear this is assuming no mistakes on your part and not accidently hitting other truffles as you combo the truffle you have locked onto a fairly common occurence but as with white mushrooms centering one mushroom at a time is important for success still it s much faster than beating up other mushroom heartlesses third a note on combo ing the truffles you can bounce them fairly high but you don t really want them flying too high which is what happens when you hit them offscreen the uppercut attack especialy with the longer keyblades has an insane vertical attack range from somewhere at sora s knees to body lengths above him and can easily hit off screen truffles now the auto tracking for attacks not the camera strangely enough in game is superb and will often track things way over your head in battle but its still possible to lose truffles you bounce too high so when you combo a truffle make sure he is on screen when you hit him don t worry you will hit a truffle if you let him drop in altitude before you swing as sora s uppecut hits a larger area than you may think as written above less of a problem if you are flying in neverland and less if you are using the aero trick something that will likely happen if you use ragnarok though last you may want to pre kit your character ability wise for fighting rare truffles if you expect an encounter namely un euipping the glide party ability helps fast glide is ok but the normal glide is bound to the jump button tho also un equipping the aerial sweep ability from sora s list can help as you will want to be hitting with an upper cut not an aerial spin anyway this assuming uppercut again for all the other tricks no kitting is really nessecary general hints all of the mushroom heartless are timed battles if you take too long they will dissappear doesn t usually happen with black fungus but is something you will happen with white mushroom hunting a lot white mushrooms and rare truffles will chance dissappear without dropped items if you don t use the proper attacks you may want to summon something when fighting some mushroom especially white mushrooms reason being donald and goofy will often do a superb job of blocking your view on whats going on and thus aught to be removed at decent level a single summon will last you long enough to take out mushrooms recommendations go to mushu white mushrooms or bambi in order to help spawn some mushrooms in the world areas realize that once you beat completely beat a battle in one small area of the game i e outside the tent area in the deep jungle world a new battle will not respawn until you run areas away from area you want respawned with new monsters so in the tent area case running to the first bamboo forest area and back will not respawn the monsters at the tent but running to the area where you fight clayton and back will an easy way to get new monsters also an easy way to level up in certain places of the game which allow you to run in circular patterns thus constantly spawning monsters the only area in the game where this works differently is at the the room before the last save at end of the world this room will always spawn new monsters whether you ran or areas away from it the end of the world room before the last save is most easily taken advantage of spawn wise for mushrooms by first saving the game at last save then run into the room before this if the desired mushrooms aren t there simply reset with the quick reset option this is not the reset button on the ps rather push and hold start select r r l l this will take you straight to the new game load game screen for some reason tho you can use the area respawn trick for this room reloading over and over again is almost always quicker i believe there is something in the coding for how the game parcels out mushrooms encounters in that it gives a higher chance of a mushroom encounter if you have just arrived at the world and not if you have been actively looking for mushroom encounters alternately for mushroom spawn points that are close to save points you can respawn monster areas without fighting by checking out and area leaving riding your gummi ship then re entering the world with the spawn point you are trying to hit up for world areas like end of the world or the deep jungle white mushroom spawn point there is seems to be alot of random chance in finding a mushroom encounter knowing this will help you tear out less hair finally if you do end up fighting for mushrooms at the end of the world alot be aware that mushrooms aren t the only special items you can collect there the devil and angel monsters which spawn the most at end of the world will infrequently give out orichalcum and mythril in addition to their normally dropped gale so doing the normal respawn fighting while looking for mushroom spawns may make sense if you are keen on maxing out your level attack defense ap parameters rather than relying on the quicker save reload trick for mushroom only encounters Console emulator Super Nintendo Entertainment System ROM image Emulator
