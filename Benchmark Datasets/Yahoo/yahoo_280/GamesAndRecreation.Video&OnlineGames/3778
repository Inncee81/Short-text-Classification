what's ev and iv train pokemon i really don't know so if anyone does please tell me i'll explain it ivs individual values you may remember catching a few of the same pokemon only to find that despite being the same level and species their stats were different this is because every pokemon has a different set of ivs ivs influence stats and are a value ranging from the way the stat formula works as a pokemon's level increases its ivs and evs have greater influence upon their stats and at level in the case of ivs they can make a difference of stat points which is a fairly large difference you cannot change a given pokemon's ivs but you can use breeding to try and make off spring with all around strong ivs evs pokemon that have been trained are stronger than those just caught from the wild this is because of evs or effort values they are referred to in game as base stats though this is misleading every time one of your pokemon defeats another in battle it earns evs they can have up to total with a cap of per stat like ivs their influence becomes more pronounced as they grow closer to level at level evs stat point this means when training for specific evs you should try and use multiple of fours otherwise you'll waste evs it should be noted that isn't divisible by and there will always be at least evs left over a total of evs in a stat will provide an increase of stat points in closing ivs and evs are very influential and can be influenced and controlled respectively to create stronger more specialized pokemon PlayStation Portable Universal Media Disc HyperText Transfer Protocol Noob Saibot Patch (computing) Ford Motor Company Newbie World Wide Web Mozilla Firefox Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Noob Smoke Homebrew (video games) Toyota Prius GunBound Regional lockout IGN Smoke (Mortal Kombat) HTML GameFAQs Lin Kuei Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Mortal Kombat Wireless Application Protocol Website Lumines Cascading Style Sheets Character encodings in HTML RuneScape cheats Transport Layer Security Mortal Kombat 3 Uniform Resource Locator Neopets Mortal Kombat II Windows XP SpongeBob SquarePants Web server MSN Messenger Paintball Transmission Control Protocol RuneScape economy CPAN BitTorrent The Sims 2 Internet DVD Sega Comparison of web browsers Final Fantasy VII Mikoyan MiG-29 Championship Manager Defense of the Ancients Windows Update Sony Computer Entertainment Web browser Slapt-get IPod Domain Name System XHTML RuneScape Street Fighter Alpha WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 Xiangqi Gmail HeXen B3ta Wipeout (game) Steam (content delivery) RuneScape slang and terminology Mortal Kombat: Deception Resident Evil 4 Spyware Floppy disk Pure Pwnage Football Manager Game Boy HowStuffWorks Sonic Adventure 2 April 1, 2005 HTTP cookie Spider-Man Michelin Guide Ajax (programming) Best Buy Mozilla Application Suite GameSpot Apache HTTP Server Reiko Chess strategy and tactics Spider-Man 2 General Motors The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Jaguar E-type Apple Macintosh Railroad Tycoon Internet forum Wget JavaScript Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Netscape Communications Corporation
