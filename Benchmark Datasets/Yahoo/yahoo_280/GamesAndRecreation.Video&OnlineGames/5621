xbox technical problems have all the xbox problems been solved i mean have they fixed all the ones that havent been sold yet so that way they dont have problems later on i ask this question because i am about to buy a microsoft is aware of the problems that plague the xbox and recent hardware revisions likely have resolved all or most of the major issues that cause the hardware to fail they haven't been out for long though so time will tell if they really have fixed anything also because these changes are so recent that if you go out and buy one right now you'll likely to get one of the older xbox s that just haven't been sold yet unless you're planning to get the elite version if you're getting a premium model then you should check the manufacturing date or if it has hdmi to make sure you are getting a newer one it should say on the box the new year warranty and new ability to order a repair online should also give you peace of mind Grand Theft Auto (series) Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Rockstar North Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Grand Theft Auto (game) Grand Theft Auto Advance Liberty City (fictional) Xbox Take Two Interactive PlayStation 2 Video game controversy Hot Coffee mod Grand Theft Auto: Vice City soundtrack Lazlow Electronic Arts Rockstar Games Computer and video games DRIV3R Abandonware Jack Thompson PlayStation 3 Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven GIMP MAME Mach kernel Craps Nintendo Censorship in Australia Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever Game Boy Expansion pack Postal__ Vice City Need for Speed History of computer and video games Mortal Kombat Microeconomics Action Replay Greater Toronto Area Descent: Freespace Spider-Man (games) The Sims 2 Championship Manager Yu-Gi-Oh!
