i am going to start a videogame website how much money can i earn a month hi folks well i got my international diploma in computer studies and al my education etc however i cannot get a job in it because it market has pretty much saturated i think a good job these days is nearly impossible even with a degree so i have no choice but to start my own thing i need to buy food and i am very hungry right now as well so my only choice is to make my gamesite i want it to be like gamespot or gametrailers com or something i will have hd vidoes to download of the latest games mostly ps and pc games i will allow free downloads of my hd game videos in return i will ask people to please support my advertisements by clicking on the adds i sm thinking about using vbulletin or nuke evolution i am wondering how much money will i earn after the first year i am looking to earn atleast us a month after the first months can i accomplish this folks or am i just wasting my time ps i have a great passion for video games i don't think its feasible to earn any substantial income on a gaming site that is just starting out you need to make connections first how are you going to get the games to review how will you get advertisers to pay remember also that only reviewing ps and pc games drastically reduces your audience i would get a job and do this on the side you're going to need a lot of money to start up you will only get free games systems and advertisers if you are a respected gaming site with a lot of hits each day it's going to take a couple of years to get noticed and will most likely take a lot of money to get there also remember that it will be impossible to play that many games and write reviews all by yourself you're going to have to employ people after you get started you have to be a good writer you have to play games you hate you need to be unbiased and you need to analyze everything on top of all that you have to create manage your website it's possible but definitley not by yourself especially after you really get started Computer and video games GameSpot Internet fraud GameFAQs Economic inequality IGN The Standard The Sims IPod Norway national football team IBM PC compatible Video game crash of 1983 Windows XP PE ratio Wheel of Fortune Spyware Nintendo Video game console Nintendo GameCube Google Make money fast Neopets Galactic Civilizations Civilization III Commodore International Freeters MMORPG Education in Germany The Apprentice 2 Virgin Mobile Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Advertising Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Labour economics Counter-Strike Abandonware Theory of conduct $ale of the Century FairTax Video game music Super Mario 128 Wal-Mart Health insurance Amiga Power Slot machine Opportunity cost Spam (electronic) Final Fantasy XI Economics Poker jargon Stardock We Belong Together PlayStation 3 Opera (web browser) Apple Computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Pretty Good Privacy Video game developer The Sims 2: University Yu-Gi-Oh!
