i have a should i get a the game rock band or guitar hero my suggestion would be rock band as far as replay value you have paths to go down for the single player mode guitar drummer and singer you really cant beat that for replay value guitar hero is a great franchise but it just cant compete with the variety rock band will have one big thing though rock band will cost to get the mic guitar and drums with the game if you are looking at cost as a factor its already out of the running guitar hero will be a great game of course and there is no reason not to get that if you cannot afford rock band you really cant go wrong with either game there really isn't any reason to get the new guitar though if you already have the gh ones real electric guitars are not wireless so really they are making it less realistic by going wireless Rock band Fleetwood Mac Eddie Van Halen Big band Europe (band) Judas Priest Good Charlotte Blonde on Blonde AC/DC The Yardbirds Iron Maiden The Who Bee Gees The Jackson 5 The Band Alice Cooper Sly & the Family Stone Blues Sonic Youth Megadeth Blur Nirvana (band) Aerosmith Nu metal King Crimson Grateful Dead The Clash Guns N' Roses Deftones Electric guitar The Wall Computer and video games The Jam Beastie Boys The Cult The Velvet Underground Rush (band) Ritchie Blackmore Sex Pistols Manic Street Preachers The Police Collective Soul Deep Purple Joy Division (band) Phil Collins Bass drum Electric Six The Doors The Doobie Brothers The Pretenders Black Sabbath Velvet Revolver T.
