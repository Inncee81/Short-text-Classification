pokemon sapphire how do i beat wattson in mauville city because the pokemon i have are tentacool lv lombre lv dustox lv grovyle lv zigzagoon lv but he kills them can i buy rare candy anywhere cos i cant use rock smash yet i have to beat wattson any suggestions please wow no wonder he kills them all okay first off get rid of tentacool it just takes up space in your team try to replace it with a ralts or a tailow lombre and grovyle both need to be trained to lv at least rare candies are not the way to go zigzagoon is only good as a pickup pokemon beacuse after a battle there is a chance that it picked up a rare item nuggets rare candies and full restores your dustox is dead weight replace it with a makuhita or a geodude from dewford cave and train it to level or so your big problem is that you rely to much on pokemon that in the long run won't really help you that much your grovyle is a great pokemon and it has a lot of potential you need to have at least pokemon at gym leader level before you can take wattson on wattson's gym leader level is about i really hope this helps you Pok__mon Abilities Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Pok__mon Emerald Pok__mon Trading Card Game Zigzagoon Luvdisc Missingno.
