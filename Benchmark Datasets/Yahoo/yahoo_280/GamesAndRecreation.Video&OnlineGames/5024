a good moveset for umbreon ok im going to be using umbreon as a sponge annoyer i think it should work out pretty well i am having a little trouble with his moveset though i was thinking about something like this umbreon leftovers timid confuse ray moonlight toxic i was thinking about double team but i have heard from numerous people that that move is illegal i was going to use mean look but i wasn't too sure on a how to get it on him does he learn it and b what's the big deal if they switch out i can just start again on their next pokemon and infect their whole team i think that double team would be better to use so i couldn't get hit and when i did i just recovered the hp with moonlight while toxic slowly saps their health away confuse ray will also lower their ability to hit me so they have to go through confuse ray double team and moonlight why would that work it makes no sense screech lowers def while shadow ball is a sp attack move im playing diamond and moonlight is to heal which is a must to stay alive and annoy even longer first of all i nooby and don't know what a sponge annoyer is but double team is not illigal why on earth is it in the game then with over trainers with multiple pokemon with that move how on earth is double team illigal it would be good ot have but if not try something like crunch or another move that may make it flinch PlayStation Portable IPod Digital photography Knoppix Windows XP Mouse (computing) USB flash drive Floppy disk History of Microsoft Windows PNG Windows Vista Gmail Blue screen of death Mozilla Firefox Trusted computing Streaming media Screenshot Emacs Secure Digital card Computer Web browser Digital rights management Cache Internet Explorer Computer virus Google Desktop Uniform Resource Locator Memory Stick AmigaOS Kazaa Linux Opera (web browser) Creative Zen HTTP cookie IPod shuffle Windows 2000 Website Macintosh Finder ITunes World Wide Web Danger Hiptop USB mass storage device class Sony File Allocation Table Computer forensics JPEG Google Modchip Internet privacy MSN Messenger Universal Serial Bus Computer hardware Mandriva Linux Nintendo Revolution Common Unix Printing System Cascading Style Sheets Copy protection GIF Malware File Transfer Protocol Web page Bootable business card Flash memory Spyware Apple Computer Password HTML element HyperCard Sega Dreamcast Novell NetWare PlayStation 2 Mac OS X v10.4 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Ebook PlayStation 3 Internet fraud Mac OS X Apple II family 2channel History of the Internet Mozilla Thunderbird International Phonetic Alphabet Xbox Apple Macintosh Internet OpenBSD E-mail IBook Digital camera DVD Object Desktop Mozilla Application Suite Wiki Server AirPort Commodore 64 AlphaSmart Java programming language
