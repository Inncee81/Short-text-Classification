anyone else mad about the new expansion that world of warcraft announced or what do you really think of it i am tired of having to lvl from again it just seems too soon to have them come out with a new expansion notice this is in the video game section so if you dont like this question then dont answer it its that simple first of all they just annouced it it will not be shipped for quite a while blizz would not put all the time and effort creating new instances just for them to be obsolete in just a couple of months they are just planting the seed for poeple so they will remain excited about the game also i dont mind leveling in a new expansion it was cool to see all the new areas when tbc came out and i am sure it will be the same when this one comes out i have a holy priest that i leveled holy since level so i am not thrilled about leveling that guy but my others 's should be fun Xbox Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 Nintendo Entertainment System Video game console PlayStation 2 DVD Sega Saturn Sega SCART Computer and video games Nintendo Revolution Nintendo GameCube Video game music Nintendo Sega Dreamcast Halo: Combat Evolved Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Console game Television Atari 8-bit family Modchip Game controller Super Nintendo Entertainment System Game programmer FIFA Series Console wars Halo (video game series) ATI Technologies Game programming Machinima Universal Serial Bus Xbox Live Computer role-playing game Sonic the Hedgehog Beatmania IIDX History of computer and video games Electronic Arts Resident Evil Bubble Bobble NVIDIA Computer hardware PC Engine Gameking Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic MP3 First-person shooter Halo 2 Commodore 64 Nintendo 64 Bluetooth Pump It Up Atari ST IBM PC compatible Vorbis Dance Dance Revolution NTSC Nintendo DS SNK Playmore TurboGrafx 16 Atari 2600 Intellivision GoldenEye 007 The Covenant 3DO Interactive Multiplayer Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Original Amiga chipset Timeline of computing 1990-forward Defender (game) ZX Spectrum Mortal Kombat Grand Theft Auto III Rare (video game company) Neo-Geo Game Boy Karaoke Doom 3 Unreal Resident Evil (video game) Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire High-Definition Multimedia Interface 8 mm video format Counter-Strike Crash Bandicoot Double Dragon Headphones Handheld game console Phonograph Unreal series National Football League Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Atari Jaguar Dead or Alive (video game) Home computer Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Final Fantasy (video game) TRS-80 Color Computer Table tennis
