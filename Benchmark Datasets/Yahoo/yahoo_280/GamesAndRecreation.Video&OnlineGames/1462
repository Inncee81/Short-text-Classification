need a good nintendo ds emulator hi i was using a ideas emulator to play ds but it wont play the d stuff right and it gets all broken up like into peices you know and like doesnt show d right its also amazingly laggy and the sound is all fuzzy but i can live with the sound being bad its just the other things that make playing ds games impossible does any one know a good emulator or a way to fix these problems ive tried games and they all did this three points the ds is still a relatively new system and as hard as people are working in making a decent emulator of it it'll be some time before it's perfected though the ds doesn't seem as powerful as say a gamecube or a ps it is still a highly specialized game platform which adds to the problem of trying to emulate it on the more versatile pc if you want to know why it's possible to find so many roms when the emulators don't work correctly it's because roms are easy all you do is get a copy of the game and rip the code from it trying to get a system that will take that code and run it on a computer is significantly more difficult i know that these don't really solve the problem but i'm not sure there really is a solution other than to wait for future versions of the emulator hope this at least helps explain why it won't work Computer role-playing game Nintendo Super Nintendo Entertainment System Computer and video games Video game music Video game crash of 1983 Rare (video game company) Nintendo Entertainment System hardware clone Sega Wario Nintendo DS History of computer and video games Nintendo Revolution Super Mario remake series Donkey Kong Wisdom Tree ROM image TurboGrafx 16 Gradius Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Double Dragon Super Mario World Computer and video game packaging Super Mario Bros.
