does anyone agree that using legendary pokemon is lame it seems like every time i try to find a match online everyone uses legendaries i believe it is because they just suck at the game so they cannot raise them themselves or just have such crappy pokemon that they have to resort to using legendaries and i just think it is cheap i mean my team is all at level because i spent the time to raise them all and because i sacrificed my legendaries for better pokemon and i end up beating them anyway pleas if you agree please say so yea it is partially because they think they're special because they caught it and like you said because they are too lazy to raise pokemon themselves i do the same thing you do and trade them for some of my favorite pokemon Pok__mon (anime) Latias Latios SCO-Linux controversies Pok__mon Heroes RuneScape cheats Gmail Ken Jennings Phishing Neopets E-mail spam Internet forum Jack Thompson E-mail Something Awful Pok__mon Trading Card Game Mozilla Firefox Able Danger Shogi 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Opera (web browser) Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Webmail Call centre Indian nationality law Domain hack Titanic (1997 film) Customer relationship management Public domain Family Feud E-Reader Crossword At sign Goldberg Variations Catechism Sola fide Quantum computer GED Anonymous remailer Gemological Institute of America Haunted Apiary Detroit Tigers Plame affair Hotmail System Shock Play-by-mail game Pok__mon Emerald Pretty Good Privacy The Hobbit Pok__mon (video games) Software engineering Prince (artist) Ben Harper Wheel of Fortune Education in Romania New Zealand National Front New York Knicks Electronic mailing list Microeconomics Direct marketing Democratic Party (United States) Altruism Domain Name System Midwifery The Wealth of Nations Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Email authentication Statistical survey Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Monty Hall problem ROM hacking Deus Ex The Standard Criticism of Prem Rawat Microsoft Windows 2000 A Course In Miracles Nick Berg The Twilight Zone Web hosting Linux kernel MIME Homestar Runner Guru Blog Scrabble Guns, Germs, and Steel Dutch Schultz Advance fee fraud Economy of Botswana Edmund Curll A Tale of a Tub Chess opening Netiquette Match Game Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Delphi method Pacifidlog Town
