my sons he wants to make a pc game i asked before but the game was wrong just any game any ideas any ideas help please hes got an iq of and is really good with computers he justc ant find the program hehe at that age kids often think that it would be really easy to make a good game that you just type a few lines of code and you're done this is very far from the truth it is very difficult for any single person and particularly someone that young to design and develop a game by themselves your son has to understand that making a game requires a lot of work as well as a good deal of programming and mathematical knowledge the most important starting point is to know a programming language computer games always boil down to an underlying system written in one language or another there are games that aren't in real time there are games without graphics there are games as simple as tic tac toe but all of them require that you know how to code if your son already knows a programming language then all he needs to do is be able to put in enough time and effort however if he still needs to get past that first hurdle i would suggest starting with javascript it's a relatively simple scripted language that works on just about any web browser so it's probably a very good starting point one of the best javascript tutorials is available here http www w schools com js default asp it is probably necessary to know some basic html as well in order to use javascript effectively luckily html is even easier to learn than javascript w schools has a tutorial for html as well http www w schools com html default asp although javascript is a relatively slow and limited language it is still quite possible to write games in it here are some examples of games written in javascript http javascript internet com games i would always suggest making sure you can use one language effectively before moving on to another one and this applies equally if not more so to an year old kid it would probably be best if he chose a simple language like javascript to learn and mastered that before setting his sights higher keep in mind that children that young often don't have the attention span or understanding necessary to really get good at a programming language learning the language will be a good test of your son's resolve to actually write games World Wide Web Hello world program Cross site scripting Ajax (programming) JavaScript Web design HTML Visual Basic Website XML HTTP cookie PHP Web browser Forth programming language Macromedia Flash Python programming language Cascading Style Sheets HTML element Emacs Opera (web browser) Domain Name System HyperCard ASP.NET HTML editor Unicode and HTML Unicode Gmail Java programming language Extreme Programming JADE programming language Uniform Resource Locator Object-oriented programming AmigaOS Common Unix Printing System Wiki Web page HyperText Transfer Protocol Web server Client-side scripting Wget Portable Document Format Compiler optimization Web application Konfabulator Mozilla Application Suite Rich Internet Application XMLHTTP Programming language Scripting language Stopping e-mail abuse Game programmer Web crawler Expert system Lisp programming language Exponentiation Lotus Notes Assembly language Visual Basic .NET XSL Transformations Computer virus Apache HTTP Server Password JavaServer Pages Mozilla Firefox Server-side scripting Dynamic HTML ALGOL 68 Theory of conduct IBM PC compatible Markup language Debugging Embedded system SAML Netscape Navigator Netscape Communications Corporation Regular expression CPU design Ebook Game programming Windows XP Categorical list of programming languages Logo programming language PostScript ActionScript OpenGL History of the Internet Quotation mark Scheme programming language Internet
