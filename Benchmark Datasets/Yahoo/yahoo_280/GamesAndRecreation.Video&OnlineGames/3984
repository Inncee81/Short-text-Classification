i had purchased a game and lost the registered code how do i retrieve it i still have the game downloaded on m pc but would lke to have the code just in case my pc crashes the name of the game is bejeweled and one the page that comes up when it plays says yahoo and also popcap games it depends on the game what game are we talking about many games will place the code in a file within the same directory others will make a registry entry and keep the code in there you could also check out the forums or help and support page for the game in question if you don't reply in time for me to try and help edit i was hoping that it wouldn't be a casual game like bejeweled because bejeweled is resold at so many different websites and the key is typically based on hardware information from your specific computer it's very hard to locate where the registration code would be and on top of that decrypt it your best bet if you would really like the code is to send a quick e mail to the site you originally bought the game from usually all they need is just your e mail address and they will resend you the registration key sorry i couldn't help you more on this one 2D computer graphics Computer-generated imagery Common Unix Printing System Digital image editing World Wide Web Web page Computer animation Forza Motorsport HyperText Transfer Protocol Photolithography Machinima JPEG Microsoft Paint Computer Wireless Application Protocol Surrealist techniques Slashdot trolling phenomena Paint Sound effect Screenshot Proxy server RuneScape cheats Cross site scripting Atari 8-bit family Scalable Vector Graphics Vector graphics Image file formats Domain Name System GIMP Web browser JavaServer Pages Uniform Resource Locator Geographic information system HyperCard PNG Virtual hosting Pixel art PlayStation 3 Ajax (programming) Hot Wheels Super Nintendo Entertainment System Raw image format Adobe Photoshop Mozilla Application Suite QuickTime Representational State Transfer Digital art Unix MSN Messenger Java programming language Cyfac ASCII art Website BitTorrent HTTP cookie Virtual memory CPAN Mod (computer gaming) Mac OS X v10.4 Phishing Editor Wget Mach kernel HTML Alexi Laiho Enterprise content management Manicure Linked list Traditional animation GameFAQs File format JPEG 2000 Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Opportunity rover OSI model Xbox File system 3D computer graphics Computer graphics Culture of Korea Drawing Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within Mac OS X Digital photography Filmmaking Roope Latvala Lotus Notes Legacy of Kain Tagged Image File Format Netscape Navigator Steganography Squid cache Casting W.
