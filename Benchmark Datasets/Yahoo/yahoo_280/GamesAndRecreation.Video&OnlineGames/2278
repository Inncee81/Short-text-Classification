should i get sonic rush or metroid prime pinball i want to get one of these cause they're both or so but i'm not sure which one i only made so i want to get one of these at least i do not want to get anything else sonic rush would be kinda short but fun to get ranks and the metroid prime pinball is fun to play to get high scores plz help i will give best answer stars and also tell me the advanteges and disadvanteges describe for both games i would really appreciate which game would be more repetative too sonic rush is more like similarly playing those sonic advance games but better since sonic rush is on ds metriod prime pinball sounds ridiculous because it's probably about a pinball game if i had to choose either of them i'd rather get sonic rush a pinball game isn't fun for me i'd rather play a real pinball machine at the arcades than in a game for a console or a handheld Bash NWo The Great American Bash Mark Calaway Eric Bischoff Gothic metal Rugby union positions Computational complexity theory Eddie Guerrero The Shining (film) Linux Bash.org Randy Savage The Basement Tapes Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back El Goonish Shive X Window System NP-complete Green's function Problem solving Nikita Koloff Bad Brains Hole (band) Canon (fiction) Leon White Page Falkenberg Batman Forever Thermal power station Internet Relay Chat The Visitation Frame problem Rodney McKay 117th IOC Session Inspector Gadget RuneScape quests Jet engine Prisoner (TV series) King's Quest Street fighting Back to the Future trilogy Shor's algorithm Code: Lyoko Ric Flair Gottfried Leibniz Partial differential equation Particle in a box Piccolo Junior Saga Carolina Panthers Pok__mon Chronicles Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks Steffi Graf Electric motor Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis AFI (band) Franco-Proven__al language Star Trek Customizable Card Game Transformer The Wall Sluggy Freelance Ultima VII System Shock 2 Sting (wrestler) Bobby's World Friday the 13th (film series) Welfare economics The Boondock Saints Digital circuit Andrew W.
