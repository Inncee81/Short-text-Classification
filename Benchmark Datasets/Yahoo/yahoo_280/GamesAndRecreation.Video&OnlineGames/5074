what is your favourite ps games mine is god of war i felt like crying when i completed it lol i think the best ps game i've ever played is probably the first god of war i played through it or times and unlocked everything the art music story gameplay everything was perfect with that game god of war was a great game as far as visuals and gameplay but i'd give it a d on story now that you got me thinking of it metal gear solid was an outstanding game and the ending is definitely awe inspiring and makes you want to cry yet another outstanding ps game was ratchet clank going commando later installments seemed too quickly put together unoriginal or focused too much on a single aspect going commando was a huge game and did everything right Pok__mon (video games) Missingno.
