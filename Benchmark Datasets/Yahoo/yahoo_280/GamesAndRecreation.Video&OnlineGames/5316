when will the th generation of gaming most likely be released i'm not sure whether to buy an xbox or wait for the new generation of gaming i bought a gamecube about a year before the wii was released and now they stopped making new games for it i don't want that to happen again so when do you think the next generation of gaming will be released the th to th generation lasted from to which is six years the th generation began in with the dreamcast and continued through ps gamecube and xbox and in some ways is still going but we will put the end date at the same time the x came out in which makes it years the gamecube came out in and bringing it to when the came out thats years you just purchased the gamecube very late in the cycle i would expect this generation to last at the very least more years and i would put the th generation of gaming around no one has been seriously talking about ps xbox or nintendo uss or whatever names the companies go with if you pick up a new system now you will have plenty of use out of it Pok__mon Pok__mon (video games) Pikachu Team Rocket Pok__mon Yellow Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Celebi Pok__mon (anime) Magical Pok__mon Journey Snorlax Mewtwo Pok__mon Heroes Chikorita Ash Ketchum Viridian City Pok__mon Colosseum Clamperl Legendary Pok__mon Smoochum Pok__mon: The Movie 2000 Pok__mon Emerald Groudon Mightyena Pok__mon Crystal Ralts Latios Pok__mon (manga series) Pok__mon Gold and Silver Charmander Raichu Misdreavus Altaria Spoink Pok__mon Red and Blue Articuno Scyther May (Pok__mon) Torkoal Glitch City Meditite Azumarill Muk Pok__mon 3: The Movie Entei (Pok__mon) Giovanni (Pok__mon) Misty (Pok__mon) Mew (Pok__mon) Pok__mon 4Ever Jynx (Pok__mon) Marill Gastly Kadabra Ditto (Pok__mon) Azurill Typhlosion Missingno.
