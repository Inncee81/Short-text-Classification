sims barcode question i'm buying a used sims seasons and a used sims pets from ebay i was wondering if i buy both of them am i going to need to spend more dollars for a new barcode for both of them or i just use the original barcode both of the games have the original disc manual and box if the games have the original codes with them you can use those to install your games the only thing is you can't register them at thesims com if the codes have already been used but that is really no big deal i played my games for months before i got around to registering them and it doesn't matter what order you install the games you will play from the seasons disc once both are installed The Sims Barcode The Sims 2 Universal Product Code Electronic Arts Copy protection DVD Modchip ZIP Code Wheel of Fortune Neopets Cash register MAME Gran Turismo (game) Hot Coffee mod Tic-Tac-Dough Computer and video games Game programming ISBN Resident Evil 2 Canadian postal code ROM image Let's Make a Deal PHP GunBound The Joker's Wild Billy Sims Enterprise content management Nine Inch Nails Expansion pack Barcode reader $ale of the Century Sister Princess Visual Basic Simulation game Arcade cabinet Regional lockout Copyright infringement of software Dead or Alive (video game) Sex and the City Virtual economy Wal-Mart MegaMan Battle Network World of Warcraft The Sims 2: University Electronic toll collection The Sims 2: Nightlife Invader Zim Combat flight simulator Knoppix Final Fantasy VI Chrono Trigger MMORPG Business process reengineering Family Guy Angel Stadium of Anaheim Game show Machinima Gross domestic product GNOME APL programming language Arianne Ren and Stimpy Internet fraud Advanced Squad Leader The Inside SimCity 4 GameFAQs Terran Confederacy Steam (content delivery) Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Tron 2.0 Scooby-Doo Digital rights management The Pet Sounds Sessions Maxis Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Poker jargon Best Buy Amiga Power E-Reader FIFA Series Final Fantasy VIII 2004-05 NHL lockout Hollywood Squares Aston Villa F.C.
