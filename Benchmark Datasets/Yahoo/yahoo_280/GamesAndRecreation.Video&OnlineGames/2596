question for fable players i just have the normal fable game for the xbox and i beat it like a couple months ago playing as a good guy or watever and now i wanna play it again and i was just wondering for those who played both as good and bad which was more fun which did you enjoy more or should i just play as a bad guy now to completely beat the game i think it was more fun playing as a bad guy or evil because you don't have to worry about the quest were you have to kill villagers or guards and plus you get scorms bow if you evil enough Shiny Pok__mon Charizard Missingno.
