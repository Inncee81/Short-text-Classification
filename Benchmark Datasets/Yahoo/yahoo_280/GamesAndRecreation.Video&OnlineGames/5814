what is causing my game to lag not online game i just recently bought the hitman trilogy for the pc note this is not an online game so it has to be a hardware problem one of the games works fine with no lag at all the other have unbearable lag the one game runs around k of memory space and that is obviously way too much i have a feeling it's my video card but i want to see if it's something else before i dish out the money for another video card here are my computer specs windows xp pro gb memory nvidia geforce fx video card has latest drivers pentium ghz processor these specs meet the required specs that the game instructions suggest i've tried a few things but no change at all i also bought age of empires a few months ago but i returned it because i was having the same problems i had to turn down all of the graphics to play it wasn't worth it so i returned it does sound like a video card problem but it meets the specs of these games however any suggestions very often overlooked when it comes to lag is the sound card if it is an embedded sound card it can be processor heavy and lag a lot when loading playing new sounds especially games that have a lot of ambient sound effects aoe is a good example check to see if sound is skipping a lot with lag and to see if the lag appears during a new sound being loaded you may want to decrease sound settings to see if it improves the game i have a good new video card but the amount of cache i have for my sound card is horrible and it slows down my games to the point of not playing anymore because it gets 'framey' hope that tip helps another obvious tip is to disable antivirus before playing good luck The Sims 2 The Sims Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Nurse Machinima Mod (computer gaming) Midwifery The Sims: Superstar Premature birth The Sims Online The Sims 2: University Medicare (Canada) The Sims 2: Nightlife Nursing home General Hospital Childbirth Hospital Virtual economy SimCity St. John Ambulance Renai game Public health in mainland China Simulation game Publicly funded medicine Pregnancy Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable EverQuest Flight simulator EastEnders Marilyn Monroe History of computer and video games National Health Service Mental Health Act 1983 Scrubs Maxis Interactive Achievement Awards Carry On Nurse The Sims Bustin' Out International response to Hurricane Katrina Melanie Wilkes Kingdom Hospital Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Jessica Lynch Creative Technology Billy Sims Emergency department Rais massacre Theme Hospital Exponential distribution Hera Medicare (United States) Uppsala University History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Carry On films Sim racing Will Wright Nintendo DS Talking Heads (plays) Combat flight simulator Sophie, Countess of Wessex J.
