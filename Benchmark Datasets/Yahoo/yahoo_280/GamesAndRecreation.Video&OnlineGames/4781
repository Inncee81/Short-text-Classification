which nintendo ds games should i buy my year old son his birthday is coming up he will be and he already plays transformers autobots we have deceptacons but he only plays the other one i agree with the other voters who said mario and ninentodogs because those games are perfect for children there is nothing wrong with letting a four year old play video games as long as its not for too many hours straight or something and it is something that kids love to do and its false that no one will talk to them and they will become a nerd or something i haven't played any nickelodeon games personally but there should be some like dora and diago or blues clues or something like that what i would also suggest is calling up your near by game stop and asking what games are good for young children good luck MMORPG Guild Wars MapleStory Final Fantasy XI Discworld MUD Galactic Civilizations RuneScape Betting (poker) RuneScape weapons World of Warcraft Diablo II Counter-Strike Dungeons & Dragons Ragnarok Online Star Wars: Galaxies Gameplay of StarCraft Paintball Player versus player Seventh Sea (collectible card game) RuneScape skills Doomtown Neopets Alone in the Dark (series) RuneScape quests Quest for Glory Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Yu-Gi-Oh!
