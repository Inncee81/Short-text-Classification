why does a liter of mountain dew cast and a ounce bottle cost this is because of a very small cost of production for the actual mountain dew liquid litres and oz's cost about the same amount to the company that produces them i believe the last time i read a cost on a litre of coca cola it was approx including the bottle but don't quote me on that price anymore if that's the case how big of a difference could there be between the cost of a litre and a oz product now of course that's just production cost and doesn't take into account marketing overhead and all of the other things that are associated with selling a product Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Pok__mon Emerald Pok__mon Crystal Game Freak Pok__mon (anime) Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pok__mon Red and Blue Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Missingno.
