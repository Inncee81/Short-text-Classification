xbox hard drive memory isn't reading correctly i just got a gb hard drive for my xbox and when i go over to the system tab and go to memory it shows that there is only gb of free space on it i don't understand where the gb went because i didn't put anything on my xbox yet pictures movies games ect does anyone know why it is doing that yeah you have system information videos demos and network settings stored on the harddrive i am assuming this hd is brand new one other thing is if a hard drive that is used for xbox live has a corrupt gamer tag or corrupt game save and the hd is formatted while hooked up to xbox live because most people have their xbox live log on as soon as they cut their xbox on then instead of erasing the whole drive it will make a permanent partition so the corrupt areas cant ever be accessed so hoping that your situation is the st of the i hope i have cleared things up a bit for you and the sounds familiar i think it is just the stuff preloaded on your drive Tamriel The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Vvardenfell Morrowind (province) The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Mod (computer gaming) Daedra The Elder Scrolls Bow (weapon) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dagoth Ur DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Minor characters in Morrowind Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Nerevar Bethesda Softworks Archery Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon Video game music RuneScape weapons English longbow House Redoran Garry's Mod Computer role-playing game RuneScape locations Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics Vivec MapleStory Sandbox (videogames) Pump It Up House Hlaalu In The Groove (game) Fallout (computer game) Fable (video game) Fantasy Elves Computus Dark elf Scrolling Compound bow Modding Kyudo The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Dart (missile) RuneScape Case modding Skyrim Weapon Speedy Leet Battlefield 1942 Green Arrow Archery at the 1988 Summer Olympics RuneScape slang and terminology Age of Wonders Thief (computer game) Kagome Higurashi Castle of the Winds Yabusame Scrollbar Ultima IX Society for Creative Anachronism History of computer and video games Boss (video games) Horse archer Modular arithmetic Super Nintendo Entertainment System Hot Coffee mod Link (Legend of Zelda) Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Common Gateway Interface Parallax scrolling Slashdot trolling phenomena Archery at the 2000 Summer Olympics Final Fantasy XI RuneScape skills Diablo II Sotha Sil PHP The Legend of Zelda series characters Symphonic Game Music Concert Jeremy Soule Book of Daniel Archery at the Summer Olympics Archery at the 1996 Summer Olympics Red Arrows Scrolling shooter Myth (computer game) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Apollo Call to Power II Module file Archery at the 1992 Summer Olympics
