i've gone and messed up my character on flyff help on my character in flyff i made him a yoyo archer however i would rather him be a yoyo user unfortunately i am currently on level and have str and dex which means my yoyo attack is extremely low is it too late for me to continue using the yoyo and start a new charater or what level would my yoyo attack be higher than my bow attack so until i get to level my yoyo attack will be lower than my bow attack even if i continue to raise str only i'm not too sure about the str sta yoyo builds you do need some dex stop putting any more dex and just pump your str and some sta yoyo damage is low there's no getting around this you'll get better when you reach your nd job change at level though Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 2 Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen Uchiha Sasuke Naruto geography Naruto (manga) Hatake Kakashi Uzumaki Naruto Naruto jutsu Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 4 Characters of Naruto Rock Lee Nara Shikamaru Ninja Akatsuki (Naruto) Hyuga Neji Haruno Sakura Naruto ninja ranks Kusanagi Konami Code Naruto: Narutimate Hero 2 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Ninja Gaiden Naruto kekkei genkai Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 Kunoichi Jiraiya (Naruto) Naruto: Narutimate Hero Video game music Harry Potter Naruto the Movie Tenchu Orochi Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Reptile (Mortal Kombat) Mortal Kombat II Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions Smoke (Mortal Kombat) Lightsaber Gaara Ryu Hayabusa Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance Onimusha Final Fantasy XI Nintendo GameCube Shinobi series Bebop and Rocksteady Mortal Kombat Ganbare Goemon Final Fantasy (video game) Temari (Naruto) Taki (Soul Calibur) Nintendogs Mortal Kombat 3 Hyuga Hinata Yagyu Jubei Mitsuyoshi Gray Fox (Metal Gear) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Yoshimitsu (video games) Shinobi (video game) Metal Gear Solid: Integral Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters Quan Chi Fighting game Hattori Hanz__ Ninja Burger Glitch Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series) Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Keiji Mutoh Dance Dance Revolution 5thMIX Sub-Zero DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution GunZ The Duel Science Ninja Team Gatchaman Dance Dance Revolution KONAMIX Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) Noob Saibot Raphael (TMNT) Ermac Ayane (DOA) Weebl and Bob Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (film) Hayate White Ninja Comics Metal Gear Solid Michelangelo (TMNT) April O'Neil Bad Dudes Inuzuka Kiba Palladium Books WarioWare characters Power Rangers: Dino Thunder The Last Ninja Dead or Alive (video game) Dance Dance Revolution 4thMIX Halo (video game series) Samurai Deeper Kyo Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Soul Edge
