is there a way in maplestory to take stuff on one of your characters and trade it to another in maplestory i want to take my items on one charactersr and give it to another one of my characters how do i trade to an offline person i guess is the question if both your characters are on the same account then you could just use the stash guys that appear in every town but if the characters are on different usernames say john is on doe and jane is on doe then u could try transferring with a trustworthy friend possibly go to a place where people rarely go example would be the pet revival place in far lower right in ellinia its hidden under that plant or if no one is on u could drop your stuff in a hidden place that u kno for sure no one goes to that leaf place again and log off and log back on with a different character i use to do that with a friend and we transferred at the top of the golem place we were sins so using the invisible move and transferring was quite easy so yeah there ya go same account use the stash different account drop and come back but be careful if u get logged off and are unable to go back on ur items will disappear in a few minutes so be quick about it i recommend puttin both your guys in the same place before transferring and then drop get off the first guy get on second guy and he should be right there lowers the risk of someone coming or dissapearring yuup hoped that helped Neopets Seiken Densetsu 3 RuneScape locations Legend of Mana Feri Tradition Elemental spirits (Seiken Densetsu) MapleStory RuneScape The Faerie Queene Characters of The Sandman Neil Gaiman Dungeons & Dragons (TV series) Britannia (Ultima) RuneScape dungeons RuneScape quests E.V.O.: Search for Eden Final Fantasy (video game) Sonic Adventure Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Twisted Metal Shannara creatures Dragon Quest Triathlon RuneScape weapons Perfect Dark RuneScape skills Asheron's Call 2 Wang Chongyang The Elfstones of Shannara Hatake Kakashi Lake Hylia The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time places Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Lost in Space Ceres, Celestial Legend Guild Wars Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Golden Sun Toa Minor characters in Morrowind Quest Dragon Quest II Homosexuality and Neopaganism Choose Your Own Adventure The Books of Magic The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age) Drizzt Do'Urden Rick Cook Umbra (World of Darkness) Fairy EverQuest II Elvis Costello Drakengard Discworld MUD The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath Terry Jones Population inversion Locations in the Warcraft Universe Columbia University Gaia Online Final Fantasy X The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Guinevere Jones Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie World of Warcraft Chocobo Piccolo Junior Saga Locomotive Affirmative action Kain (Legacy of Kain) Epic poetry King's Quest RuneScape Mini-Games Roller coaster Bonnie Tyler Blood (computer game) Disgaea: Hour of Darkness Drifting (motorsport) The Fairly OddParents Kalimdor The Dark Tower (series) Kirby College Mermaid Bionicle Car handling Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Tomb Raider Wolverine (comics) Koholint Island Wizards (film) MacGuffin MMORPG Tesla coil Goblin Races in the Warcraft universe Game show
