why is psp verions bad because people can't homebrew on their psp with the best version for psp is because it will allow you to install emulators on it like nes snes n sega genesis etc and be able to play those games on it which is very cool you can't install emualtors on a psp with version because sony thinks it's illegal and they want to not allow it i don't think it is you should be able to do whatever the f ck you want with it i mean you bought it it's a free country at least us and canada i know of is do what ever the f ck you want with what you buy not what sony tells you what to do that's why the psp version is bad Legendary Pok__mon Pok__mon (anime) Mewtwo Pok__mon Colosseum Pok__mon Emerald Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Trading Card Game Rayquaza Dragonite Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Latios Pok__mon Gold and Silver Latias Jirachi Pok__mon Heroes Shiny Pok__mon Metang Pok__mon Crystal Indigo Plateau Salamence Pok__mon Blaziken Crobat Zubat Groudon Hitmonlee Missingno.
