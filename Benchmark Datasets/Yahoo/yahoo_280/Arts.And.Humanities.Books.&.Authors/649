changing their names i plan on writing a book about my family and how messed up they are will i have to change their names to avoid any legal issues or can i use their real names as an expression of freedom of speech if i use their real names will i have to pay them any percentage of my sales if i make money off of it i don't plan on giving out any last names just the first does that change anything first two answers are good the problem is anything you write about a real person you have to be able to prove or they could sue you for libel get their consent first agree also to remove any portions that they insist on having removed from the book the alternative is to use a pen name and change all of their names as well in that case they have to prove that you have committed libel and that the defamatory statements have been associated with them rather than the characters of the book if you keep everything anonymous including your own identity it seems unlikely that they will be able to sue you i hope this helps jim http www life after harry potter com Slander and libel Contract Freedom of speech David Irving First Amendment to the United States Constitution Anonymity George Galloway Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Trust (Law) USA Microeconomics FanFiction.Net McLibel case J.
