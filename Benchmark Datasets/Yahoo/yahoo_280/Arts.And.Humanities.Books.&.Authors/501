what was your favorite chapter in harry potter and the deathly hallows mine was 'goblin's revenge' 'godric's hollow because i liked harry seeing the place where he temorarilly lived and seeing his parents graves so sad 'bathilda's secret' 'xenophilius lovegood' 'malfoy manor' ahh 'the prince's tale' 'king's cross' just because it tied up so many loose ends and revealed other things i never could've predicted i was litterally like omg when i found out dumbledore knew he was going to die no one could've predicted that and 'the forest again' simply because i feel it's the most touching chapter but almost horrifying because harry thinks about what dying is like and thinking he is going to die but the part i like best is when voldemort makes himself mortal by destrying his last horcrux 'the flaw in the plan' because harry finishes voldemort and he learns ron and hermione are alright i love the way harry talks to voldemort careless and unafraid i liked the epilouge too but i would've liked to learn what happened to other characters besides just ron hermione harry ginny draco and neville i love the last two sentences though mine was the prince's tale because i was so happy to find out that i was right about snape i thought it was really sweet i also liked kings cross station because you had no idea if harry was dead or not and he and dumbledore are just sitting there talking but of course they were all amazing Dates in Harry Potter Ginny Weasley Magical objects in Harry Potter Hermione Granger Lord Voldemort Harry Potter: Book Seven Severus Snape Albus Dumbledore Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Battle of Hogwarts Magic (Harry Potter) Hogwarts subjects Draco Malfoy Ministry of Magic Rubeus Hagrid Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Dumbledore's Army Luna Lovegood Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Sybill Trelawney Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Lucius Malfoy Horace Slughorn Rita Skeeter Minor Ravenclaws Hogwarts Houses Sirius Black Tom Riddle's diary Cho Chang Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Nymphadora Tonks R.A.B.
