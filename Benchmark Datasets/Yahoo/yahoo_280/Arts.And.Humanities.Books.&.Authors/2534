couple questions about the end of harry potter seven so i just finished the book yesterday and was wondering a few things harry said that the elder wand was draco's somehow when and how did that happen i must have missed it in the epilogue whats going on with lupin's son ted it kinda confused me in the epilogue does it ever mention what happens with anyone else other that neville harry ginny ron hermione and draco if so who it's been a while since i've read the other books but i can't for the life of me remember when the ring with the second brothers stone in it came into the story can anyone jog my memory and if not do they know what part of what book it's in thanks for the help draco became master of the elder wand when he disarmed dumbledore in book draco never actually had the elder wand but the wand recognized him as its new master because he defeated its old master voldemort mistakenly believed that snape was the new master as snape was the one that actually killed dumbledore but this didn't matter to the wand ted has been kissing a girl named victoire since her name is french and harry and ginny's son calls her our victoire she is apparently bill and fleur's daughter an english person would only call another person our whoever if they were a relative since harry is ted's godfather then ted comes over to their house a lot but he lives with his other relatives and not harry and ginny no the epilogue leaves a lot of characters out j k rowling did give more information on what happened to her characters in a chat with mugglenet but she didn't include this in the book see the link below for the chat transcript the ring appeared in book there wasn't much about the stone in that book but it was the horcrux ring that dumbledore found in the ruins of the gaunt house the ring used to belong to marvolo gaunt and volemort stole it and made it into a horcrux he apparently did not realize that the stone in the ring was special dumbledore destroyed the horcrux part of the ring but the ring and the stone still existed Hermione Granger Magic (Harry Potter) Death Eater Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Sirius Black R.A.B.
