what is harry potter celebratory edition since it's called an edition it must be that the book has been re issued ie it has been re printed the fact that it's called celebratory i think is to celebrate the fact that the final book of the series so the celebratory editions are a new consignment of an old book that has been re printed to celebrate the release of the last book in the series they are not different from the original book Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter in translation Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) J.
