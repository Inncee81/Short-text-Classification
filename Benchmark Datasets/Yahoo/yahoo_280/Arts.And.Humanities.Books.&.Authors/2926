truman capote's in cold blood i just finished reading truman capote's in cold blood i loved the book but there were some things i didnt understand what exactly is the main idea of the book and what exactly was the author trying to communicate it doesnt really seem to me like it has a main idea its just a biography of events can someone help me out i am interested in what others thought of the book to so feel free to share any other thoughts you have on the book my general impression was that he was bringing a level of humanity to the actions of well known murderers to make the story more powerful the murder was so hugely publicized that it would be like documenting the colombine or v tech shootings in book form today providing a part perspective from the pov of the killer Truman Capote In Cold Blood Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Scientology beliefs and practices Scenes from a Memory The Brothers Karamazov Social psychology Theory of conduct Sigmund Freud Rudolf Hermann Lotze A Course In Miracles Cultural Revolution Free will Marshall McLuhan Summa Theologiae Crime fiction Civil rights Extreme Programming Eucharist Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ten Commandments Anarchism and society To Kill a Mockingbird Drama Frank Herbert Predestination Philipp Melanchthon Marshall Plan Margaret Truman Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Harper Lee George F.
