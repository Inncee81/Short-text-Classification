what is so great about wurthering heights i read about chapters of this book and it is one of the worst things i ever read it is so hard to get through for me i know one reason i don't like it is because i don't like books written in first person but still it's not that it's too complicated for me or anything but if someone can defend it and tell me why they like it i'll pick it up again thanks personally i found the story interesting but annoying i just couldn't get into the idea that people fall so passionately in love that they actually die from it i found the book too melodramatic and unrealistic for my tastes i read it because i heard it was a great love story and was really disappointed in it i'm assuming people who do like it like it because they really believe that someone could die from a broken heart i'm just a little too practical to be that romantic i personally prefer jane austen although i did like jane eyre by charlotte bronte Jane Eyre Victorian literature Wuthering Heights Novel History of modern literature Pride and Prejudice Romance novel Mary Wollstonecraft Charlotte Bront__ Fan fiction Jane Austen Fictional character Douglas Adams Roxette The Eyre Affair Charles Dickens Sexual orientation Tao Te Ching Genre fiction Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Slow Train Coming Gwen Stacy Fahrenheit 451 Jane's Addiction Objectivist philosophy Mary Jane Watson Friends Mary Poppins Theory of conduct Camille Paglia Big Read Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Walter Scott The Chronicles of Narnia Shot of Love Rod Stewart Lolita Originalism C.
