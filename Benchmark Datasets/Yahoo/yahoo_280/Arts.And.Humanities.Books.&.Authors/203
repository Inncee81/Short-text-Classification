why does frodo leave middle earth this question is for the lotrs guru's out there why does frodo leave middle earth with gandalf and the three elves at the end of the return of the king i know there heading for valanor but why so far the answers are very close to why i thought he was leaving if i remember correctly from the documentaries from the extended edition of rotk it is said that when frodo gandalf and elves leave they are passing into death or the scene is a metaphor of death their time in middle earth had ended they left that world to the men and were leaving for their own time if frodo stayed he would have been miserable he carried around the one ring for a long time and that damaged him as well as the witch king's blade on weathertop in the movies this was seen clearly when frodo was on the ship and he gave a small smile frodo was able to work through his sorrows and elrond's medicine would probably help heal him ever year when the stab wound starts to hurt again frodo basically felt that he couldn't stay on middle earth any longer without suffering poor frodo Frodo Baggins The Fellowship of the Ring The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film) The Lord of the Rings Weapons of Middle-earth Witch-king of Angmar Gandalf The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) One Ring Saruman Timeline of Arda The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film) Faramir Middle-earth Gollum Aragorn Arwen Monomyth The Two Towers Galadriel The Hobbit Meriadoc Brandybuck Bilbo Baggins Sauron Horses of Middle-earth Rings of Power Council of Elrond Bag End The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series) Elf Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age Sam Gamgee Baggins family E__rendil Peregrin Took Fellowship of the Ring (characters) Gimli (Middle-earth) The Chronicles of Narnia The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy Elijah Wood Elrond Wolfrider Elves (Middle-earth) History of Arda Moria (Middle-earth) The Death Gate Cycle Mithril __oldor The Return of the King (1980 film) Eldarion Shannara creatures Glamdring Red Book of Westmarch Middle-earth canon The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age __owyn The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Glorfindel Shaggy dog story Legolas The Hobbit (1977 film) The Subtle Knife Scouring of the Shire Memento (film) Hobbit Gr__ma Swingout Eagle (Middle-earth) Tolkien fandom Battle of the Morannon Battle of the Pelennor Fields Arda Social rule Shannara Druids Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Imrahil Gildor Inglorion Metaphor Parsifal Consolation of Philosophy Valinor Mordor Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wizards (Middle-earth) Kodocha Nazg__l Monty Python and the Holy Grail Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Philip K.
