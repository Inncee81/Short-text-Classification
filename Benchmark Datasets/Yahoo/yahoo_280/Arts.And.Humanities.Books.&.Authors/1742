i think the last harry potter book was not good at all the end sucks what do u think well each reader takes from it what they want i would not say the end sucks but i think i can see where some folks would like more from the ending that is i can understand why some people would not like the way it jumps from the end of the battle at hogwarts to years later but this is how rowling and perhaps her editor wanted it to be one reason there is this huge gap is that she has material to put into an encyclopedia of harry potter to say the whole book was not good well that's overstatement by far the book was excellent and she not only told a gripping tale of the three harry ron and hermione searching for the horcruxes she also wrapped up the series and several story lines quite well the flashbacks in the pensieve of snape's life answer a lot of questions and totally change harry's perception of snape in the end i am satisfied with the story and its conclusion i think the years later bit also helps to answer the what happens after questions and it also removes the pressure to write more the series is done she accomplished the complete telling of the tale she wanted to tell there's my couple of cents rp Harry Potter: Book Seven Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter (character) Severus Snape Hogwarts subjects Hermione Granger Horace Slughorn Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Ginny Weasley Dates in Harry Potter Battle of Hogwarts Hogwarts Houses Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Hogwarts Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Rita Skeeter Rubeus Hagrid Lord Voldemort Minor Ravenclaws Sybill Trelawney Minor Hufflepuffs James and Lily Potter Magic (Harry Potter) Professor Quirrell R.A.B.
