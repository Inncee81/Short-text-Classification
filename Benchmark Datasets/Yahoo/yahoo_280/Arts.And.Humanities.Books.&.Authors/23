in harry potter and the deathly hallows in the end i didnt get it when voldemort and harry were talking circling around harry said that draco was the true owner and then he says that he harry is the true owner well how is that possible and how did voldemort die harry had one part of his soul how could voldemort possibly die without harry dying this is really confusing me alright one more time for the cheap seats in the back draco was the one who was suppose to kill dumbledore who was the owner of the elder wand if he was the one to kill dumbledore then the wand was never snape's even though snape killed dumbledore so voldemort killed snape for no reason when harry took draco's wand from him he because the true owner of the elder wand because he had taken it from the person draco who took it from the original owner being dumbledore when voldemort hit harry with the curse it didn't kill him but it did kill the one piece of voldemort's soul that was living in harry because as we see voldemort made harry a horcrux when he tried to kill him the first time as a baby this made it possible for voldemort to die in the end because once nagini was killed there were no more horcruxes left during the final battle between harry and voldemort harry was the true possesser of the elder wand and when voldemort hit him with the curse it rebounded and voldemort was killed with his own curse i hope this helps a little bit i know it is confusing but if you think about it and read certain parts over again you'll get it Death Eater Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Albus Dumbledore Magical objects in Harry Potter Hogwarts subjects Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter: Book Seven Ron Weasley Battle of Hogwarts Severus Snape Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Rubeus Hagrid Order of the Phoenix Magic (Harry Potter) Ginny Weasley Sirius Black Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Lucius Malfoy Bellatrix Lestrange James and Lily Potter Draco Malfoy Sybill Trelawney Professor Quirrell Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Tom Riddle's diary Frank Bryce Hermione Granger Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Fawkes Unbreakable Vow Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Peter Pettigrew Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Remus Lupin Neville Longbottom Dark Art Cedric Diggory R.A.B.
