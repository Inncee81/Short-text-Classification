whats the connection between a stag and a doe the patronus of james and lily i don't get it whats the connection between a dog and an otter ok so here's my theory snape knew about james' animagus form which is a stag male deer his partner lily then would be well represented in animal form as a doe female deer therefore the doe represents lily in animal form as she is connected to james personally i can't think of a more appropriate animal for lily especially as harry's patronus established a clear connection between james and the stag it did seem a little strange at first that snape would represent lily as so connected to james but as jkr says you cannot choose your patronus rather it takes a form that represents something you hold close to your heart and which gives you strength and therefore represents your strength and love which is how it fights dementors i think what jkr is trying to tell us with this is that snape pined for lily and loved her deeply but the reality of her love for and connection with james never escaped snape which is why his representation of her is so connected to her husband very deep if you ask me but this is why jkr refused to reveal snape's patronus earlier even though it was the order of the phoenix's form of communication it would have given away too much about his character and ruined her ending though she did strongly hint at the snape lily connection throughout the series if you want more examples just ask this conversation has turned to hermione and ron's patronuses or patroni so i'd like to give my quick take there too if i may hermione's patronus is an otter and ron's is a jack russell terrier i would have bet my arm hermione's would have been a cat but jkr gave me the slip there first hermione yes the otter is related to the weasel even more intriguing the burrow is outside of ottery st catchpole in england which is next to the otter river a haven for otters so the otter is connected to ron in addition otter comes from the old icelandic otr which means water wet or winter and for native americans the otter is associated with aquarius in the zodiac both a winter and water sign otters were also revered for their ability to live in the different environments of land and water excelling in the latter in norse mythology the otter was a shape shifter which i think is an interesting connection given hermione's many connections to the animagus concept she also was able to call lupin in werewolf form though werewolf lore states that one may only be called by its own kind weird in addition to the addition jkr loves otters and describes hermione as particularly close to her now for ron jkr does confirm in interviews that she owns a jack russell terrier and that they are playful crazy little creatures jack russells are also notorious for being same sex aggressors and we know ron has a history of that they are also notoriously cat aggressors which could lend credence to some previous comments about ron and cats but they are the same way with other small fur bearing mammals like rats as they were bred as small game hunting dogs aside from those musings it's everyone's best guess jkr did do well to keep us talking after the series Patronus Charm Severus Snape Deer Sirius Black Harry Potter (character) Magical objects in Harry Potter James and Lily Potter Harry Potter: Book Seven Remus Lupin Nymphadora Tonks Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Hogwarts subjects Rubeus Hagrid Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Half-Blood Prince (character) Ginny Weasley Blood purity (Harry Potter) Peter Pettigrew Battle of Hogwarts Magical beasts (Harry Potter) Hogwarts Houses Death Eater Weasley family Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) Rita Skeeter Dementor Harry Potter Lord Voldemort Minor Ravenclaws Taikyoku shogi Minor Hufflepuffs Minor Harry Potter Beasts Sea Otter Werewolf Tai shogi Shapeshifting Dates in Harry Potter Animagus Cat Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Dog Jack Russell Terrier Otter Relatives of Harry Potter Cowboy Bebop Dursley family The Twelve Labours Minerva McGonagall Lycanthropy Order of the Phoenix Terrier Horace Slughorn Platypus Stoat Causality Hunting Narnia Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Poker jargon Philosophy of language Medieval hunting Kakapo Sexual selection Diagon Alley Game show Kim Possible Zoophilia Chinchilla Hamster Trapping Sybill Trelawney Predestination paradox Morphology (linguistics) Friends Loch Ness Monster Chinese calendar Hogwarts Rabbit Monkey Island Fauna of Australia Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Chinese astrology Ministry of Magic European Otter The Secret of NIMH Inuit Characters of Naruto Badger
