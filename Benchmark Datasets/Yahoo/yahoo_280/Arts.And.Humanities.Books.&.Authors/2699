year old wants to prepare to publish a book hello thank you for taking your time to read and respond i've always written short stories since little i am now currently years old loves to read i've always been told i'm a good writer but i have problems accepting compliments so i never paid much attention although my grammar isn't as good i am willing to improve lately i've been having the urges to actually try and publish a book even if it's a children book what are the steps and requirements and the pros cons thank you this is a long reply just so you know anyway the steps are fairly simple once you have your book complete the first thing you'll want to do is not waste the editor's time so you'll want to have anyone who you respect and knows basic grammar and spelling to read over your book you will of course catch various misspellings and grammatical errors on your own while you're writing and rewriting your book but a few always slip through no matter how hard you try to catch them usually a fresh set of eyes can find the ones you didn't get once your book has been read by a few people and they've found as many errors as they could and you've corrected them it's time to actually send off your book to publishing houses google will be your friend here as well as your local bookstore you can use google for general searches such as children's book publishers or whatever your genre is and such but you may not find all of them that's where your bookstore comes in find the section that best suits your story and browse through it write down the names of the various publishers you see and then try to find their web page if it wasn't listed in the book when you get back home you can also go to your library and look through the writer's market and the novel and short story writer's market for even more publishers each publishing house has it's own particular rules regarding submissions some will accept unsolicited submissions from anyone and others will only accept submissions from agents submit to the ones that will accept submissions from anyone first as it's much easier to get an agent when you already have a publisher interested in the book be sure you read the submission guidelines also any deviation from what they want and most editors will simply pitch the manuscript in the trash they're not doing it to be mean but they get hundreds if not thousands of submissions they have to go through and they figure you're not worth the effort if you don't follow their submission guidelines unless the publisher states otherwise the basics are to send your submission in loose pages either paper clipped together if there's only a few pages or in a manuscript box if there's a lot of pages the pages should be double spaced after each line you hit return enter to put a blank line between the line you just wrote and the next one this allows the editor to put written instructions and corrections directly on the manuscript the font should be simple usually an arial font is fine or times new roman at around points don't get fancy keep everything as simple as you can somewhere on the manuscript usually the top right corner you'll want to put your contact information along with your name if it's different then you want the book published under you'll also want to give the approximate word count usually whatever program you're writing it in will have a function to tell you how many words are in your document it doesn't have to be exact just give the editor an idea of the length once you're all set just mail it off and wait it could take anywhere from six weeks to six months to get a response and unfortunately it'll likely be a form letter stating that they appreciate the submission but they can't use it it's no fun but get used to it you'll get plenty before you sell your book also unless the publisher explicitly states it somewhere in their submission guidelines it's fine to submit the book to multiple publishers at once you may get lucky and have more than one interested in it and they may begin bidding on it if a publisher says something to the effect of no simultaneous submissions then they don't want any manuscripts that other publishers are getting at the same time it's fine to send the manuscript to them after another publisher has rejected it but don't send it to them and other publishers at the same time my advice would be to start out in a general sweep of the publishing houses and narrow down after that begin by sending it to every publisher in your genre that accepts submissions without an agent and will accept simultaneous submissions this way you're getting your book in front of as many people as possible without tying it up and having to wait for responses if they all reject it then you can start submitting to publishers individually that don't allow simultaneous submissions and go from there if you exhaust all of them then you can try to find an agent to submit to the ones who only accept submissions from agents speaking of agents whatever you do don't pay one up front any reputable agent doesn't get paid until your book is sold then they take or more of what you get as an advance and possibly a percentage of royalties for a set amount of time for that fee they'll negotiate your contract with the publishing house your royalty rate advance and other issues and if it would make a good movie they'll try to get that done for you too they'll also work on getting foreign publishers interested usually though agents don't take unknown authors unless they're exceptionally good if you want to give it a try just send your book to agents who accept submissions from unpublished authors some may want a query letter first there's a link below where you can find a listing of agents but be sure you check them out carefully first as there are a lot of scams the link also shows you how to write a query letter to an agent another place to look is the guide to literary agents which can be found at your local library or bookstore scams are prevalent in the publishing industry too stay far away from any publisher that wants you to pay them publishers pay the author not the other way around the only time you would pay the publisher is if you're going to a vanity press or self publishing in either case the company is not really a publisher but more of a printer and probably wont get your book into stores if you do decide to self publish i'd suggest going with lulu com their one of the best to be found give traditional publishers a shot first though my last bit of advice is to keep writing once you have your book complete and you've mailed it off start your next book don't worry about your first one being accepted just start writing again once your second one is complete you'll start the process all over again with the submissions and start your next book your first one may never sell so you've got to try again there are a number of now famous authors who have still never sold the first book they wrote but they sold the second or sometimes third one to a publisher good luck Theory of conduct Peer review Gmail CPU cache E-mail spam
