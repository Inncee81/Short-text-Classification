'this is graceanne's book' has anyone ever read it i started reading a couple of pages i am now at chapter but i'm totally confused i have no idea what is going on in the book should i keep reading will it get better later on someone explain to me please ohh and i'm so if you can tell me if this book is too complex for me thanks in advance this novel is about the resiliency of the human spirit and about how strong the bonds of love between siblings can run it's definitely an intense book but it has so much in it about survival and overcoming adversity it's a terrific book but it might be more appreciated by an older more life experienced reader it is written from the perspective of a nine year old that's why it might come across as confusing to you persevere with it and if you're still having a tough time put it away for a few years and come back to it my guess is if you keep reading it it will grab you at some point good luck Urantia Reincarnation Perseverance of the saints Love Near-death experience Dog Creation according to Genesis Douglas Adams Frank Herbert Goldstein's book House of Leaves Deconstruction Church of Christ, Scientist Harry Potter Emanuel Swedenborg Jean-Jacques Rousseau Rule of St Benedict Carlos Castaneda The Lovely Bones Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Marriage F.
