stephen king your best book and why gonna go with the stand surprise read it when i was young and it blew me away then i read the stand uncut version and loved that too i think sk likes it too as characters from the book turn up again in the dark tower series which is kings most personal series of books my opinion the cell is a pretty good book too but i personally wasn't that keen on the ending but it dealt with similar themes to the stand and had a cool bad guy in the harvard man edit oh yea desperation is also a hell of a book thanks little miss sunshine for reminding me Stephen King Randall Flagg Cardcaptor Sakura Dragon Ball Z Hip hop collaborations Desperate Housewives James Bond Humphrey Bogart The Ashlee Simpson Show Our Gang C.
