in the harry potter movie do you think they made bellatrix a little too deranged i don't know but for some reason i thought of bellatrix being this snobby extremely evil woman but not as crazy as they made her seem in the film don't get me wrong i think helena bohman carter did a good job but i was expecting her to be more cruel and cool cool as in distant and evil not all crazy like that even though i'm sure you would go mad after all those years in azkaban i don't know just my thoughts and i thought kingsley was going to look like the guy from lol i had the same thoughts myself i pictured her to be cold and calculating not psychotic and surprised i loved that they cast helena bohman carter as she is a personal favorite but i did find the licking of her dark mark and her getting caught off guard a lot of the time a bit distracting again for the movie it was a good show but for the integrity of the original character it was a bit off kingsley was perfect when they first introduced his character they noted his ethnicity Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Bellatrix Lestrange Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Sirius Black Stock character Three Stooges Ron Weasley Evil Nymphadora Tonks Magical objects in Harry Potter Blood purity (Harry Potter) Charmed Death Eater Harry Potter: Book Seven Ginny Weasley Knots Landing Social rule EastEnders Emotions (album) The Fairly OddParents The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Time Out of Mind M*A*S*H (TV series) Theory of conduct Friends R.A.B.
