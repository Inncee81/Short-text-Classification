this is for a book i'm writing what do you remember about arriving at college for the first time the biggest thing i remember was the sensation both excitement and trepidation of being away from home for the first time and the possibility of self reinvention brought on by this i would be around people who did not know me so i would be able to portray myself in any way i wanted to interesting to note that things didn't work out this way this was partly because my older brother decided to go to the same college same department as me starting at the same time he was behind me in school and applied after i was accepted so he sort of dragged much of my past along with him in a way only siblings can but mostly i think it was because if you really aim to reinvent yourself it's difficult also to be sincere and true to yourself so if you're someone who has trouble with insincerety self reinvention is tough edm Social rule Humphrey Bogart One Tree Hill (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Philosophical skepticism Blood on the Tracks Coercion Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The nature of God in Western theology Book of Mormon Pantera Memorial Stadium, Clemson Blur EastEnders Honey and Clover Socrates Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Mojave people Transsexuality Victor Cousin Love Hina main characters Sonic the Hedgehog New York Giants Edward Gibbon Wakefield Public-key cryptography Knots Landing Lucid dreaming Henry Cow History of SNL:1980-1985 Saved by the Bell Shaggy dog story Education in Germany The Strangerhood Ludwig Wittgenstein W.
