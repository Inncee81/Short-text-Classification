first chapter of eclipse by stephenie meyer if you haven't read the first chapter of eclipse then don't read any further i don't want to spoil it for you even though it has been out for like three months ok here is my question why does edward think he has the right to tell bella that she can't go and see jacob i know werewolves are unstable when they are new but bella owes jacob a lot for being there when edward wasn't now jacob is the one who needs a friend and edward is flat out refusing to let her go see him what the heck is that all about he owes jacob more than bella does in my mind bella would have fallen apart if it hadn't been for jacob and now just because he is a werewolf she isn't aloud to see him what a crock please those of you that have already read the book don't spoil anything for me i don't what to know what happens i just want to know what people think and to see if anyone can justify edward's actions i am from the us i am talking about only the first chapter and it was published at the end of the special edition of new moon and it is also posted on stephenie meyer's web site the first chapter is all i want to know about just thoughts edward is probably just being overprotective he knows how close bella and jacob are and he doesn't want competition i cant wait to see what happens in the book Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind W.
