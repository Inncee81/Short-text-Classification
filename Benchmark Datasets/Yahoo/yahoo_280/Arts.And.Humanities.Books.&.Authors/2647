explain to me again why harry's wand works on its own when voldermort attacked him in beginning of the book okay it is said that the wand choose the wizard and it develops a sort of a close relationship with the wizard recognizing it's master when voldemort used harry's blood to strengthen himself and to surpass the magic that lily gave harry when she died he thought that now no one could defeat him from ending harry's life but we know what happened voldemort and harry's wand had a sort of a connection that helped harry to escape from the graveyard now dumbledore explains in the chapter king's cross that since voldemort had harry's blood running in his veins they both could be recognized by harry's wand so the wand got confused as to who was following harry to the tonks's house it recognized voldemort as a master and enemy both because he was following harry to kill him because of the blood that they shared it is one of the ways that the wand recognizes its master Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dates in Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter (character) Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter: Book Seven Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Sirius Black Death Eater Magical objects in Harry Potter Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Magic (Harry Potter) Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Rubeus Hagrid Diagon Alley Horace Slughorn Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Hogwarts subjects James and Lily Potter Hogwarts Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Horcrux Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Peter Pettigrew Battle of Hogwarts Neville Longbottom Minor Hufflepuffs Ginny Weasley Remus Lupin Hogwarts Houses R.A.B.
