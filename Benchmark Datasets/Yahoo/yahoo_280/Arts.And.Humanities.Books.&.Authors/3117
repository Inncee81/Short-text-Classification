is curds and whey cottage cheese i always thought so anyone know for sure sorry raven i was referring to little miss muffet basically yes it is although i'd heard it in older sources like the old nursery rhymes little miss muffet i actually read a description of it in one of the laura ingalls wilder books it was little house in the big woods st book before little house on the prairie and one of the many reasons i liked those books so much was the detailed descriptions they gave of daily life from over a century ago one passage talked about cheese making and the step by step process they used the fresh milk was allowed to sit and curdle hence the word 'curds' for several days until there were enough solids to use all of this was poured into a cheese mold a round shallow wooden container with small holes in the bottom then a round wooden disk was placed on top of the curdled mass with a heavy rock to weight it down it would be left for a while as the rock slowly compressed the curds gradually compacting them and squeezing out a thin liquid called whey this was saved as of course everything was no wasting and would be mixed with some of the curds that had been saved from the cheese making the main portion of the curds would continue to be compressed until there was a wheel of cheese ready for aging as far as the word cottage i'm not sure i would guess because it was a simple type of cheese that people would make at home for themselves to eat it couldn't have been kept for taking to market like aged cheeses it had to be eaten fresh or it would spoil Dairy Tofu Milk Curd Dairy product Casting Bread Laura Ingalls Wilder Hamster Breakfast Internal ballistics Drill bit Ricotta cheese Pottery Japanese tea ceremony Wood M__m__lig__ Bong Two-stroke cycle Hamburger Kosher foods Pancake Plastic Glossary of partner dance terms Vegetarianism Butter Screw Little House on the Prairie Compact disc Jewish cuisine Glass Roquefort cheese Cuisine of Singapore Poker jargon Yoghurt Mozzarella cheese Russian cuisine Glacier Polish cuisine Geology of the Moon CPU design Bengali cuisine Ice cream Andrew Dice Clay Soap Cuisine of Brazil Sake Spidey Super Stories Amateur telescope making The Time Machine Cuba (town), New York Scuba set Almanzo Wilder The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Chair Water Diving suit The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Mattress Death Valley National Park Bodybuilding Solar cell Food Clarinet Chili con carne Jet engine Snake Nuclear weapon design Shaggy dog story XML German cuisine Waste management Opportunity rover Floppy disk Sewage treatment Swiss cheese Urinary incontinence Cannon Bicycle frame Solar system Disc brake Black hole Thermal power station French fries Cartridge (firearms) Breastfeeding Atari 8-bit family Fossil Kitchen Wind turbine Threaded code Quark (food)
