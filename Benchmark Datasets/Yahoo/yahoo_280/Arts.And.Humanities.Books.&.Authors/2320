how do you write music when a song is written does the writter write the lryics or music first as a writer of music i am afraid the answer to this question is either if you start with lyrics pretty much the most common then you generally apply a melody to those vocals once you have decided on how it will be sung find those corresponding notes and the chords that are relative to that particular scale and mood can be found by exploring the tonal range and mode of the scale personally i do my best work when i conjure up a riff or three and define an arrangement based on their progression it allows the mood and tension of the piece to influence not only what the lyrics will discuss but also what specific words best deliver on the intended emotional theme the gershwin's swore up and down that you always use the first method but they were writing musical scores for theater performances play it from the heart the voice is an instrument too and all will come together on it's own Musical mode Songwriter Music Baroque music Sonata (music) Blues Romantic music Heavy metal music Figured bass Music genre Classical music era Metal music Tone (linguistics) Timpani Folk music Musical theater Serialism Blood on the Tracks Sonata form Native American music Barbershop music Chord (music) Harmonica Fugue Jazz James Bond music Choir Klezmer Saxophone Charles Ives Music of the United States Modulation (music) Ira Gershwin Igor Stravinsky Emotions (album) Interval (music) Music of Iran Music theory Definition of music Trance music Henry Cowell Authentic performance The Emancipation of Mimi Violin Key (music) Sacred Harp Counterpoint Contemporary classical music Trey Anastasio Jewish music Umphrey's McGee Gustav Mahler Carnatic music Hey Jude Claude Debussy Pachelbel's Canon Scientology beliefs and practices Modernism (music) Arab music Music of Nigeria Bebop Joseph Haydn Musical analysis Louis Armstrong Minor scale Jethro Tull (band) Guitar solo Phish Olivier Messiaen Gospel music Sampling (music) Hindustani classical music Bj__rk Opeth Musical form Sheet music Tone cluster English grammar King Crimson Johann Sebastian Bach Nu metal Brian May Tempo Just intonation Chromatic scale Witold Lutos__awski I Want to Hold Your Hand Mixtape Voice instrumental music Please Please Me Kraftwerk The Beatles
