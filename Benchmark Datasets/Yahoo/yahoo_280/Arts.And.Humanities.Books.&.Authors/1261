which should i write i'm working on writing a book i'm but my literary skills are pretty good for my age the person that wrote eragon was when the first was published i have two suggestions i'm thinking about writing something that could be the next harry potter it going to be a fantasy as well it includes a magical school something about blood lineage and a prophecy the main characters however is a girl two or her friends and a magical creature that shares a connection with the girl i'm hesitant about writing it because the magical school idea was a big part in harry potter and i don't want to be accused to plagiarism i feel a little safer about this one but i'm not quite as into it as the first it takes place in medieval times includes mythical creatures such as an elf and the main character is a boy it has a few references to famous characters in arthurian legends such as king arther merlin and lady of the water magic is a major part of the plot as is sry lady of the lake not lady of the water yeah sorry about the mistakes i was typing fast and running out of letters you might want to work on your spelling and grammar if you are thinking of writing a book there were several mistakes in this one post now onto the book part there are probably hundreds of books or atleast a few that are about a child at a magic school the only thing is you don't know about them it woudl not be plagiarism unless you copy what j k rowling says word for word if you go along with the idea of magic that's not illegal there isn't just one book about each subect in the world that doesn't work now does it good luck in writing your book it's a tedious task but well worth it i'm sure i just woudln't expect to be making money or the bestsellers list on your first book Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Hermione Granger Eragon Hogwarts Minor Harry Potter Beasts Literature Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Wizard King Arthur Canon (fiction) Ron Weasley Discworld Wizarding world Albus Dumbledore Rubeus Hagrid The Chronicles of Narnia Negima Alaga__sia Ginny Weasley Hogwarts subjects Magic (Harry Potter) Fan fiction Harry Potter in translation The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Yu-Gi-Oh!
