views needed please me and the wanted lurking in a young girls dream is a reality that i once lived he the passionate i the master of the day dream first time romance knows no heartbreak as we waited for tomorrow to start and forever to wait it's beautiful i like the idea if calling the couple by such names as 'the wanted' the passionate' 'master of the daydream' although idealized there is also a taste of the forbidden romance 'lurks' rather than 'shines' or a variety of other words that would be acceptable but not as good i read it as a story of first love it's idealized passionate can wait for forever but not for tomorrow a beautiful picture of a first time taste of romance if over idealized remember much of it isn't told as it actually happened but as it played out in a 'young girl's dream' i'm tempted to say 'don't touch it' but it might be built upon a little but always save a copy of the poem as it is it's a firm foundation you've captured the general feeling if you feel you can do more by all means try but you capture the basic feeling in these unembellished lines a winner at capturng the basics of what you intended to tell Jon Secada Novel Arthur Machen Miguel de Cervantes Cliff Richard AFI 100 Years series The Amber Spyglass Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) The Tale of Genji Love Rod Stewart God Emperor of Dune Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Philosophical skepticism Frankie Laine Sharon Tate The Shining (film) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Phoebe Halliwell Force (Star Wars) Soap opera Endless Nights Leslie Cheung Jean Grey Tag YuYu Hakusho Parsifal The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars Atomism Hall & Oates A Course In Miracles Empire Burlesque Brigadoon Scenes from a Memory Immanuel Kant Reality The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Objectivist philosophy Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Socrates S__ren Kierkegaard American Idiot Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) William Shakespeare Futurama (TV series - season 5) Time Out of Mind Anne Murray One Tree Hill (TV series) Dream Literature Lancelot Paradise Lost Extreme Programming Spice Girls Narcissism Whitney Houston TLC The Smoking Room Spanish verbs Die Meistersinger von N__rnberg Yu-Gi-Oh!
