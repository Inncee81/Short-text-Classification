how come most of the good books are written by girls biggest proof harry potter no there are good books by men dont get me wrong im not a fan of harry potter books but everyone reads them and like them first harry potter is not proof of such a statement jkr only accounts for books just it may be that as a woman you find female authors to be better than male authors because you can relate to their stories better don't believe all that hogwash some other answers gave about women being better at english than men or reading more than men to the best of my knowledge there are no statistics suggesting this even on a cultural level let alone on a genetic one also ignore those answers about how many great books have been written by great men in the past in the not so distant past it was unusual for a woman to attain the education necessary to become an accomplished author likewise in the even more recent past it was considered a man's job so what does that leave us with really are women better writers than men i could recommend grisham king etc etc then someone else would mention mccaffrey kurtz jkr etc etc what do i get when i search for bestselling authors here is the most bona fide site i could find http archives cnn com books news sellers index html only of the top authors is a woman and only of the top ten books again what does that tell us only that men still dominate the world of authoring books does that mean that men are better authors of course not does that mean that women have to work twice as hard and be twice as good to make it as an author of course not does that mean that men are naturally more gifted as authors than women of course not all it means is that more men are authors and naturally as a consequence more of the bestselling authors are men sorry to disappoint you but there is no evidence that women are better authors than men just fewer jim http www life after harry potter com Harry Potter Chuck Palahniuk J.
