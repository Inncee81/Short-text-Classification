what qualities made you like the harry potter series and what would would you like to see in a similar book this was posted before but i accidentally ended the answering your other answers have been taken into account but i would still appreciate more i'm looking for some ideas and inspiration to start a series of books with a similar overall literary structure as the harry potter series ex centralized on three main characters an adventure quest toward a mutual goal that is not immediately realized by the main characters main characters are strangers but their relationship grows evolves strengthens through the predicaments and situations they are forced through i would like to know three things you believe would make the story enjoyable and gripping the setting time period i was thinking 's the plotline and antagonist just a rough example of what you would like to read and anything else you would like to suggest i know this is a lot to ask but i seem to be having writer's block and i would very much appreciate the help thanks in advance i decided to write this book i've written others before because of my utter despair at the ending of the harry potter saga and even though i searched i couldn't find anything that matched the experience of reading one of j k rowlings novels so i set out to start a series off my own i will address one theme that i believe made rowling's characters truly believable and interesting this aspect suggested itself throughout the books but i think deathly hallows tied it up very definitively that is even the most admirable characters have pasts serious flaws and may have done bad things and even the worst of them can change for the good the discernment shown especially by harry potter transcended the petty blame and fault psychology that seems to epitomize works with a bias i e works that have an author bias for or against a character or philosophy rowling's characters were shaded more and more towards the end and were complex and engaging for that very fact i think she set the stage even back in book one when all signs pointed to snape being the bad guy a great job of misdirection on her part and leading slowly to the unexpected quirrell voldemort denouement with snape being a very interesting red herring my advice is not to write with harry potter in mind take a leaf from her book in terms of characterization and structure perhaps but the storyline must be uniquely yours otherwise it will be obviously derivative and we don't need another harry potter knockoff all that said if you came close to creating a character as interesting to read about as severus snape was i might be tempted to give it a read as for the rest of the details just let them grow from a character sketch and brainstorm from there the farther away you get from harry potter in this regard the more original and probably more interesting it is bound to be for you and if it isn't interesting to you it won't be interesting to us p s i didn't know if you wanted to create a secondary world or set the story in the primary world whichever way you do it world building is difficult it must blend with aspects that a large number of readers will be able to visualize rowling's skill in weaving the unseen wizarding world into the modern real world is something to really study in this regard in terms of non modern worlds examine tolkien's middle earth for a really good example of secondary world detailing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter Hogwarts subjects Ginny Weasley Canon (fiction) Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Lord Voldemort Wizard Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Hogwarts Houses Draco Malfoy Hermione Granger James and Lily Potter Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Albus Dumbledore The Chronicles of Narnia Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Deconstruction Magical objects in Harry Potter Ron Weasley Discworld Literature Remus Lupin Magic (Harry Potter) Genre fiction Blood purity (Harry Potter) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Philosophy of language Theory of conduct Diagon Alley Mary Sue Death Eater Maurice Merleau-Ponty Meta-reference Postmodernism Rubeus Hagrid Horace Slughorn The nature of God in Western theology C.
