j k rowling said that lily's eye's had something to do with book what was in the book about lily's eyes other than the part about albus harrys kid having them spoiler alert for those who have not read hp deathly hallows harry's eyes were significant for his relationship with snape because they reminded snape of the unattained and lost love he had for lily the reason why snape's patronus was a doe the female counterpart of a stag with their childhood history together it was because of snape's request for lily's protection that voldemort told lily that she needn't die that she simply had to give up baby harry voldemort did not recognize the importance of the love between lily and harry nor snape's everlasting love for lily voldemort killed lily without realizing his action created two new problems a traitorous snape and an inspiring boy who voldemort would try and fail to kill repeatedly the history of lily and snape they were best friends in their early years at hogwarts being neighbors at home snape revealed the world of magic to her he began to love her and spied on lily and petunia at the playground as they grew older snape a slytherin picked up the doctrine of hating mudbloods and thinking them inferior but he never called lily a mudblood until she came to his aid when james taunted him lily understood that snape's circle of friends would lead him down a different path and knew that the outburst of calling her a mudblood was no pure accident their friendship splintered snape was always jealous of james potter as harry's father was the image of cool quidditch seeker etc but he hated james for taking lily from him as a deatheater snape did voldemort's bidding and the prophecy he told voldemort about brought great guilt to snape as he did not realize voldemort would target lily's son when voldemort would not recognize snape's love for her snape turned to dumbeldore to protect lily but the damage was done lily died and harry became the boy who lived when harry became a student at hogwarts his similarities to james made snape despise the boy yet the green eyes so like lily's ensured that snape would protect harry muttering countercurses against quirrel during a quidditch match remaining a double agent who pretended to be a death eater yet remained the final barrier between voldemort and the carrows and hogwarts the effect of loving lily even made snape stop using the word mudblood as seen in the memory where the portrait refers to hermione as a mudblood snape maintained his loyalty to dumbledore because of the good influence of love which for dumbledore is considered the strongest and most redeeming magic that exists harry's connection to his mother gave him valuable protection from snape because he had loved lily despite his sad and dark history Sybill Trelawney Harry Potter Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Diagon Alley Ministry of Magic Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Dursley family Hogwarts Floor Directory Minerva McGonagall Minor Slytherins Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Peter Pettigrew Luna Lovegood Horcrux Tom Riddle's diary Neville Longbottom Bellatrix Lestrange Minor Ravenclaws Dementor Wizarding world Potions in Harry Potter Rita Skeeter Triwizard Tournament R.A.B.
