what is the meaning of the poem 'the bells' i thought that it was about a war with the first part being before the war the second being soldiers getting married before leaving the third being some sort of bombing and the fourth being the aftermath but i haven't been able to find any other sources that say this we had discussed the poem at the university and i have a good interpretation of it i'll look for it maybe i can find it if you are interested what i remember about it is that the different bells in the poem suggest the different stages of life youth marriage etc but the interpretation doesn't mention your idea however a poem is a piece of literature and literature can be interpreted in many ways the symbolism employed is very relative it could be read in the way you read it too Gary Snyder Apology (Plato) David Bohm Socrates William Shakespeare Robert Browning Theory of conduct Japanese poetry Bell's theorem Logic Tarot Philosophy of language Jorge Luis Borges Ernest Hemingway Deconstruction Dmitri Shostakovich Harold Bloom C__dmon Many-worlds interpretation EPR paradox Edgar Cayce Normal distribution Literary theory Chen Duxiu Drama Penda of Mercia Sigmund Freud Canadian literature Augustus De Morgan H.
