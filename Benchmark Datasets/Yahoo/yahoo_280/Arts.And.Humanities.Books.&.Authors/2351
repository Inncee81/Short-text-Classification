spoilers did anyone also finish reading eclipse what did you think of it spoilers ahead if you haven't finished the book please do not read this i finished eclipse honestly i'm torn if anything the book solidified the fact that bella is hopelessly and undoubtedly human bella's admission that she loves jacob was hard for me to read i hated the fact that she broke down in front of edward poor edward i am still absolutely in love with him he's such a gentleman though it's bella's choice to stay with edward i could not understand why she was upset over telling jacob that she could not be with him i liked the mature exploration of adult themes i am glad that edward insisted on marriage first even though his resolve did slightly crumble later on thank god bella decided otherwise but i couldn't help thinking that at one point when bella was trying to seduce edward she was only doing so to get her mind off jacob she seemed to be going for it for all the wrong reasons one must admire edward's character he's a great guy vampire i also finished eclipse and of course loved it it is just story but i do agree with you on some things well even though bella is going to be a vampire that changes nothing on how she reacts now to things because she is still human it was hard for me to read about her loving jacob too i have never been anti jacob even though my friends have tried to get me on that side i can't help liking him but with edward there is absolutely no competition edward is just so perfect and i do feel sorry for him at times i'm so glad that bella chose him i do understand why telling jacob she couldn't be with him would be hard even though she had chosen edward jacob had greatly helped her when edward was gone and she realized that she loved jacob too i also liked how the mature things were handled i am also glad that edward insisted on marriage first and then that bella did later in the meadow edward is just an amazing person just wow i mean he's edward i also loved learning about jasper's and rosalie's stories that was very interesting for me all in all i loved eclipse it even made me cry a little at times it was just a masterfully written tale Knots Landing Theory of conduct Anne Rice One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart EastEnders The Apprentice 2 About a Boy Avenue Q God Emperor of Dune Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Contender (television series) Free will Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Subtle Knife Jon Secada Pok__mon Live!
