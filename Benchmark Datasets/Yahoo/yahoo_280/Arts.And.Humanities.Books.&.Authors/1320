do you think j k rowling has seen potter puppet pals i wonder what she thinks of them if she has i also wonder if she has read fanfiction i mean i know she has better things to do and obviosly wouldn't read fanfiction for fun because that would probably be very creepy to see characters she created in such um odd situations interesting nonetheless and even if you aren't a fan of the books you must visit potterpuppetpals com watch the animations first starting with bothering snape i'm sure she's read at least a few of fanfictions out of interest i haven't not really interested in those even if she hasn't seen the potter puppet pals she's either really like it or think it's really stupid and pointless i personally really like the potter puppet pals Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Draco Malfoy Fan fiction Ginny Weasley Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Slash fiction FanFiction.Net Albus Dumbledore Shipping (fandom) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Mary Sue Neil Cicierega Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Canon (fiction) Hermione Granger Dates in Harry Potter Hogwarts Houses Anne Rice Minor Ravenclaws Discworld Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Magical objects in Harry Potter Ron Weasley Harry Potter fandom Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter J.
