how is it am only yrs old and this is the first chapter of my book it s a beautiful morning the sun was peeking from the horizon the spring air was fresh and the grass was damp from the morning dew the earth slowly awakened from the peaceful night before jake clemons was always up in time to watch the sunrise he s up before the rooster crows he got dressed quickly to watch the sunrise he had to be quiet as he put on his red shirt ad blue jeans he tiptoed down the hallway and he passed jamie s room jamie was his year old sister after he passed everyone s rooms he hurried down the stairs and out the door he jogged towards the big red barn he felt the dampness of the grass seep into his shoes he then ran through the dry hay and to the silver ladder leading up to the loft jake climbed up the ladder and then he crawled towards the loft window and opened it he sprawled out on the hay and gazed at the sunrise watching the sunrise was a good time for jake to think and get his thoughts together it was his only moment of peace during the day he couldn t possibly think in the day with all the commotion from his little sister and all the work that had to be done there was just no time o doodle doo the rooster cried it was time to get back to the house and cook breakfast jake usually made breakfast because everyone was just waking up at the sound of the rooster this morning he cooked scrambled eggs toast and he heated up some leftover sausage from the morning before everyone got seated at the table it was delightful meal and got the day started off his parents usually watched the news right after breakfast and then they get ready for work apparently they left it on because jaime was watching it when they got done watching it he flipped the switch to turn the tv off hey jaime whined jaime you shouldn t be watchin this stuff it gives you nightmares jake had already gone through experience a few weeks ago they were watching the news and it was talking about some guy who escaped from the county jail near chester jaime couldn t go to sleep that night because she thought he would come and get her while she was sleeping fine she scoffed as soon as she left the room he turned it back on there is currently a prison escapee on the loose he stole the security guard s keys and escaped he goes by the name of greg richards it showed a picture of the escapee he had a brown buzz cut a goatee and his ear pierced he had a tan and he looked to be in about his late s the news anchor continued with the story he was last seen driving a black dodge ram if you have any information about this man please call the police jake turn that off you ll probably have nightmares just like jaime his mother was always comparing him to jaime like that yes ma am jake turned off the tv his parents left for work about eight and they usually got home about his mom worked at the grocery store as the manager and his dad worked at the local bank there was nothing to do at the house so jaime asked jake if he could play a game with her he didn t mind but she wanted to play some of the stupidest games okay jaime what do ya wanna play jake asked reluctantly let s play hide and go seek jaime shouted jake never argued against having to play hide and go seek it was one of his favorite games he usually let jaime hide otherwise she would whine and cry they ended up playing hide and seek for hours his parents finally arrived home so now he could go do something instead of playing with jaime all day jake figured he d ride is bike it was in terrible condition with worn out tires red and rusted paint job and the seat torn up but he didn t care it was his only option to get away from the world it made him feel free he rode it everywhere around town of course the town was small enough to see everything in less than an hour on a bicycle the town was called chester it s a population of about people chester has a bunch of old buildings from a long time ago but most of those are abandoned people just had a hard time keeping business in chester a whole bunch of people moved which caused a lot of businesses to move also his brown hair was waving in the wind as he was riding his bike he heard some bells from a distance not like the bells you hear at christmas time but big bells they made such a noise that the whole town could hear them maybe even the whole county he decided to check and see where the bells were coming from he followed the sound of the bells it took about minutes to get to where they were they were coming from some large brick building with a white steeple at the top of the steeple there was a small cross what kind of building has bells and a steeple with a cross he wondered he decided to take a look inside he walked down the aisle of red carpet there were people sitting in long stretched pews everyone was dressed nice and elegant he felt like an outcast with the raggedy clothes he had on excuse me young man why are you wearing such clothes an older woman asked him he tried to speak but words wouldn t budge he was embarrassed young man she said he ran to the back of room as he tried to get out the door a man spoke jake turned around and saw a man in the front of the room the man was tall and he looked to be in his s he was wearing a white robe with a green stripe down the middle thank you everyone for being here tonight he said speaking through a microphone i am the new preacher my name is dan miller i have recently moved here from alabama with my daughter carley and my wife joyce he stated gesturing to his family in the front row carley had shoulder length brown hair she had the most amazing blue eyes jake had ever seen she looked nothing like her mom joyce jake figured he would stay and listen what dan had to say he didn t have to be home until and it was only he went and got seated in the last pew he paid attention to this preacher as he spoke god has a great amount of power he is so big he can do anything dan exclaimed raising his hands in the air anything jake whispered to himself dan preached for the next hour about this god person he said god was the man who created this very earth and created us to live in it jake couldn t wait to tell his parents about god jake glanced at his watch it read at exactly jake was supposed to be home at sharp he jumped on his bike and sped away his house was about mile out of chester so it took him about minutes to get home but at the speed he was going jake could ve swore he got there in less than minutes he jumped off the bike and ran to the house he got to the door swung it open and ran inside he tried to be sneaky he didn t want his parents to know he had come in late he completely forgot about the door making a ruckus every time it closed he raced to door to try to stop it from making the noise jake is that you his father had asked from the living room jake was so exhausted from the ride home he could barely speak yes dad he said panting where in the hell have you been jake you were supposed to be home minutes ago his father was really strict about being home on time he wanted to say he was just outside for a bit but he couldn t stand lying to his father i was at a church jake said looking down at his shoes a church why were you at this church his father asked him with and eyebrow raised well i was listening to this guy talk about god jake explained innocently my gosh jake there is no god people just say that so they can have something to believe in now go upstairs and finish your homework jake ran to his room and went to his bed he lay there thinking his dad was usually right about stuff maybe there was no god maybe dan was full of himself and didn t know what he was talking about he listened to a complete stranger and believed it his dad was right there was no god jake dinner is ready his mom called from downstairs he headed downstairs at the pace of a gazelle he was so caught up in all this god stuff he almost forgot about his stomach he sat down and as soon as he was about to attack the food his mom smacked his hand not until everyone is seated she said as she was putting the food on the table he looked around and everyone was seated except his sister he almost forgot about jaime who was still upstairs in her room jake go upstairs and get your sister his mom ordered from across the table jake rushed upstairs and headed towards jamie s room her room was all pink she had a pink bedspread pink lamp and a pink chair her room was also a mess toys were everywhere there was so much clutter that you couldn t even see the floor jake hopped everywhere around the room trying not to step on anything he finally reached jaime who was playing with her dolls hey sis it s time for supper he said tapping her on the shoulder okay she replied they both headed downstairs and got seated at the dinner table jake and jaime sat across from each other and his mom and dad sat at the ends of the table like the queen and king in old medieval times today s dinner was his mom s specialty corn on the cob mashed potatoes and gravy and grilled pork chops his mom sure did make a mean batch of mashed potatoes jake could finally start eating since everyone was seated so are you two ready for the first day of school tomorrow his mother asked yes ma am jaime called out jake just sat there not knowing what to say jake what about you are you ready for school tomorrow his mother asked eyeing him from across the table uh yes ma am he lied when the truth was he wasn t ready for the first day of school last year his best friend chase moved away because his mom and dad got better jobs it was a difficult time because he tried to make new friends but everyone ignored him he hoped he would have better luck this year a fantastic dinner was made complete by a dessert of homemade ice cream jake was so stuffed afterwards he cleaned up the dinner table and washed the dishes afterwards he went upstairs to his room his room wasn t all decorated like jaime s room it was more conservative he just had off white walls with the occasional artwork that jaime had drawn for him on them jaime was quite the artist he grabbed his notebook and an ink pen from his desk then he got on his bed and began writing writing was jake s passion he could write about absolutely anything he always carried his notebook and his pen in case anything that came to mind he could write down he glanced at his watch it read jake figured he d get to bed at a decent hour he put his notebook and pen under the mattress then he
