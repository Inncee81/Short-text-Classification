i really love classic british and russian literature such as austen shakespeare tolstoy am i the only one i can identify better with those characters than with those of modern literature am i stuck in a previous century or something yes love the bbc version of pride and prejudice watch persuasion and sense and sensibility all the time as well you are right about the historical connection tolstoy i haven't really read anything by yet but austen and shakespeare i love and i'll tell you why they show the whole spectrum of human emotions they can be witty and acute but also intensely emotional plus i think these writings are much more accessible especially back in shakespeare's days he had to write for average people and get and keep them interested so every plot had to be good every line had to fit it's the same with austen she didn't write for the elite at all Jane Austen Novel Pride and Prejudice William Shakespeare History of modern literature Modernism English literature Literature Pride and Prejudice (BBC) Sense and Sensibility Emma William Empson Leo Tolstoy Pacifism Bisexuality Blackadder Art Walter J.
