rate bad good say why now write ur st paragraph ur memoir a rating over the years i've tried to envision memories to fill the widening gap only one true memory lingers forever etched in my brain the day that mom died changed everything about our family it was just a few days before my third birthday and mom was working on sample cakes my sis and i couldn't wait to taste a piece yet without warning mom's head slammed against the kitchen table and gaping flesh flung across the room as mom's body pounded against the kitchen floor blood spattered across my lips and dripped onto the sample cake that had slid across the floor like a hockey puck it would be the last homeade cake ever made for me never again would our family enjoy mom's compassion wit and talent never again would i be able to remember anything else about mother other than the day she died the paramedics seemed to take forever and when they showed up they were suprised to see a black family living in a mostly white area they were cold slow and silent i give this piece a its very good and i love the content but the grammar is bad i will try to do the same for a memoir now let me think i walked into my house to find my mom with the phone to her ear and tears in her eyes i quickly became alarmed and my pulse quickened what was wrong now just kept running through my head i could hear her whispering ok ok while silencing me from the questions written on my face when she hung up the phone i could'nt get the questions out of my mouth fast enough when we got to her room she told me it was my dad they were getting a divorce i had suddenly felt my heart pace quicken my eyes were stinging and i was gulping back tears my head was swarming with disbelieve confusion and utter shock i sat there as my moms sobs filled my ears and i chocked on my own tears my world came to a hault that day happiness sounded like a foreign language it was about as real to me then as the little mermaid suddenly nothing mattered and nothing else was real just the simple truth that my parents were no longer going to be together hope you like this its my own memoir nothing like yours though im terribly sorry about your mom keep posting Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Conspiracy (TNG episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Social rule Ben Johnson (athlete) Marie Antoinette Out-of-body experience Futurama (TV series - season 4) The Fairly OddParents The Inside Book of Isaiah RuneScape quests Blood (computer game) EastEnders Futurama (TV series - season 5) Traumatic brain injury Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rose (Doctor Who) Ten Commandments Datalore (TNG episode) Kodocha Pok__mon Live!
