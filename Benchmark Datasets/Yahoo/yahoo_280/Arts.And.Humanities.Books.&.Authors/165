who wants more harry potter i have to say i think there are lots more stories to tell about harry's world even if harry wasn't the focus there are so many other characters that were introduced that would have great strores so my question do you think j k rowling should write more about the world or leave the series to stand alone as a classic rowling has said she will probably after taking a break write an encyclopedia about the potterverse she has also reconsidered her position about not writing any other stories about that world although she says it is still unlikely that she will i can't wait to see what jo's next great adventure in writing is Canon (fiction) J.
