what is the standard book royalty fee when working with a publishing company usually sometimes depending on the deal your agent cuts for you this is how it is all figured out first the publisher determines the price of the book which is based on printing and other costs x let's say they decide on then they decide what the initial print run will be is about average right now they will give you an advance of of what your total royalties for books sold less which goes directly to your agent which means your advance would be less or once you sell books you start earning royalties based on sales at the rate of per book less if the entire print run sells out the publisher may do a second run and if your agent has negotiated a good deal for you your royalties may go up a bit too however if the entire first run doesn't sell out and some of your books end up on the bargain tables at barnes and noble your royalties on those sales is zero authors never make money on bargain books there are many other factors a good agent might get you a higher advance more than one publisher might be in a bidding war for your book and you could end up with a bonus the downside is that more and more books are being sold at discounters like costco and those places are negotiating with the publisher for volume discounts which effects your royalties you will likely sell more books because of the number of stores they have selling them but get paid less royalties also some of the stores like barnes and noble are now charging publishers a premium of up to one dollar to have their books featured on the main tables inside the door part of that will come from your royalties as well this all applies to large publishers if you are dealing with a small publisher you will likely make royalties only they usually do not have the cash to lay out for advances you are entitled to see their books annually so make sure you are being paid for all the books you sold they are famous for not reporting all of your sales to you you can also check with the distributors like ingram and find out exactly what your sales were then lastly there is the self published book then you are on your own your books aren't distributed anywhere unless you market it and make deals with the bookstores yourself then you earn based on what you sell directly that's one of the reasons self publishing is not a good idea hope that helps pax c Publishing Wal-Mart Mutual fund Microeconomics Tax Self-publishing Monetary policy Life insurance Inflation Credit card Annuity Filling station Insurance Citigroup Textbook Costco Stock Vanity press Copyright Surplus value Illegal drug trade Contract Hyperinflation UK Singles Chart Bond Taxation in the United States Cable television Marvel Comics Bulk vending Salary cap Internet fraud Capitalism CPU design SCO-Linux controversies Digital photography Predatory lending United Kingdom corporation tax Supply and demand TOKYOPOP Health insurance Mergers and acquisitions Video game crash of 1983 Berkshire Hathaway Retailer CPU cache Ra (board game) Fawcett Publications Labor theory of value Video game publisher United States Postal Service RISC Poker jargon Gold as an investment Barnes & Noble Yield curve Closed-end fund Economics Value added tax Amway Oxford English Dictionary Blackjack $ale of the Century Auto insurance Real estate broker PE ratio Economy of Russia Deflation (economics) Airline Capital accumulation Screenplay Warren Buffett Diamond Debt First-sale doctrine Income trust Intellectual property Corporate finance Derivative (finance) Blockbuster Video Dividend Student loan Exchange value Productive and unproductive labour Short selling Commodore International Model (economics) Inventory Law of value Labour economics Octopus card Publicly funded medicine Software patent debate Pricing
