quote from anderson cooper i read anderson cooper's dispatches from the edge and there was a really good quote in it about how in the wake of destruction and death people still try and find some glimpse of hope or a miracle i cant seem to find it again in the book does anyone know the exact quote or how to easily find it online a lot of compelling stories in the world aren't being told and the fact that people don't know about them compounds the suffering anderson cooper anyone who has experienced a certain amount of loss in their life has empathy for those who have experienced loss anderson cooper anyone who says they're not afraid at the time of a hurricane is either a fool or a liar or a little bit of both anderson cooper i can begin to understand how anchor monsters are made if you're not careful you can become used to being treated as though you're special and begin to expect it anderson cooper i imagine a lot of people tune in simply to watch reporters get bitch slapped by mother nature and frankly who can blame them anderson cooper i suppose if you've never bitten your nails there isn't any way to explain the habit it's not enjoyable really but there is a certain satisfaction pride in a job well done anderson cooper i think it's a good thing that there are bloggers out there watching very closely and holding people accountable everyone in the news should be able to hold up to that kind of scrutiny i'm for as much transparency in the newsgathering process as possible anderson cooper i think you have to be yourself and you have to be real and you have to admit what you don't know and talk about what you do know and talk about what you don't know as long as you say you don't know it anderson cooper i've been addicted to tv since i emerged from the womb anderson cooper if someone knows me and likes me or my work they're more likely to allow me to tell their story but it also cuts the other way anderson cooper that's the thing about suicide try as you might to remember how a person lived his life you always end up thinking about how he ended it anderson cooper the thing i love about reporting is being able to blend in with any group whether that's neo nazis or pedophiles anderson cooper the whole celebrity culture thing i'm fascinated by and repelled by and yet i end up knowing about it anderson cooper the world reacts very strangely to people they see on tv and i can begin to understand how anchor monsters are made if you're not careful you can become used to being treated as though you're special and begin to expect it for a reporter that's the kiss of death anderson cooper Anderson Cooper Theory of conduct Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
