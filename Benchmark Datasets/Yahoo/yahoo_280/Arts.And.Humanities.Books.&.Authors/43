where can i download a voice recording for the book into the wild by jon krakauer anything would help somewheres that i dont have to buy anything the book is protected under copyright if you aren't willing to pay for a copy you may be able to legally borrow it as an audiobook from your library a few libraries even have systems where they have bought download rights for their patrons but you can access those files only if you have a library card for that particular library system so call your local library to see if they can help you might be able to download such an audio file using limewire but if the file were available it would be an illegal file using limewire and leaving copyrighted files on your hard drive and available for others to download in turn could leave you open to a statutory judgement of copyright piracy and a judgment against you plus court costs and attorney's fees for both sides it's definitely not worth risking not to mention that you'd be stealing from the author whose book you want to read i'm an author it's hard enough to make a living Copyright ITunes Music Store Copyright infringement Public domain Warez Copy protection Digital rights management GNU General Public License SCO-Linux controversies ITunes Publishing Intellectual property Open source culture Japanese copyright law Fair use Windows XP MAME BitTorrent Spyware IPod MGM Studios, Inc. v.
