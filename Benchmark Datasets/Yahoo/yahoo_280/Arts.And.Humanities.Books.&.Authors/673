is lord of the flies worth reading i'm going to be a junior and that's our summer reading book i've gotten mixed reviews from my non procrastination friends is this book worth the time reading or should i just spark notes or audio book it i'm going to be a junior too but i read it in english class last year it's one of those books that centers on the human condition the book has so many layers and i think you should read it if you're into analyzing there are a lot of allegories symbols woven in the book that support the theme and if you want to catch as many as you can sparknotes would definitely help lord of the flies was one of the few books we read in class that i thought was worth studying there were so many details that you had to pay attention to and it was always a pleasant surprise when someone pointed one out that no one else managed to catch if you're willing to spend time on that read the book the story itself isn't horribly long if not listen to the audio hope that helps Lord of the Flies Procrastination The Lord of the Rings Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban C.
