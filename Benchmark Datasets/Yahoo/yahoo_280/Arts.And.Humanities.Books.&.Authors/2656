how does harry potter come back to life at the end of the deathly hallows i really thought that it was because he was the master of death he had possession of all of the hallows and this was the only reason he would be able to come back even though he dropped the stone he was still the possessor of them all and henceforth master of death dumbledore explains a lot in kings cross but never explains why harry can come back and there would literally be no point of having the deathly hallows other than the fact that harry survived only because he was master of death the horcrux died and harry died yet since harry was the master of death he was able to choose his path yes or no what do we all think harry was the master of death the ring the cloak and then you find out later that he was the true owner of the wand that voldemort held in his hand due to the fact that draco had dis armed dumbledore making him owner then harry had dis armed draco though a different wand the princible is the importance the better wizard so to speak he was the owner of all three items by inheritance a will and and finally an accident it all came together for him nicely harry had the cloak with him and though he did not have the ring in his hand it was his possession for dumbledore left him the ring after his death though hidden inside the snitch it was sneakily left to harry in the will of dumbledore draco's wand that harry used was not the elder wand voldemort was correct in the identity of the elder wand what he didn't know is that it had chosen draco on the night he dis armed dumbledore voldemort assumed that since snape killed him that it was his not true they don't have to die only be beaten when harry disarmed draco of his usual wand he was no longer worthy of the elder wand he had been beaten so both wands origionaly owned by draco became harry's thus the elder wand as well Albus Dumbledore Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Death Eater Hogwarts subjects Magic (Harry Potter) Ron Weasley Harry Potter: Book Seven Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Battle of Hogwarts Severus Snape Sirius Black Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Rubeus Hagrid Sybill Trelawney Diagon Alley Ginny Weasley Horace Slughorn James and Lily Potter Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Hogwarts Blood purity (Harry Potter) Order of the Phoenix Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Bellatrix Lestrange Draco Malfoy Regulus Black Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Lucius Malfoy Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Messiahs in fiction and fantasy Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Hermione Granger Minor Hufflepuffs R.A.B.
