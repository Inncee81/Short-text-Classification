at this point would it be worth it to resume reading the harry potter series for many years i had been a fairly devout harry potter reader however i found getting through goblet of fire a little difficult by the the second chapter of order of phoenix i'd given up all together i assumed my interest in the series had just dried up and left it at that however during the build up to the release of deathly hallows i began to feel nostalgic for hogwarts and am now strongly considering picking up where i left off the problem is somewhat contradictory its been such a long time since i've read a harry potter book i feel like i might be lost but at the same time i've looked up so many details about the books who dies etc i feel like it might not be worth the time and effort to read any advice when i said i was nostalgic for hogwarts i meant the harry potter world in general i don't know i loved all the books so much that i reread them just before the th one came out it really helped me keep everything straight and remember all the little details that happen early on and come back in later books but if it really wasn't holding your interest i don't know if the second time around will be a charm i say that even if you have read a lot of details lately the books are so good you might as well give them a try i can guarantee you haven't read too much even if you have found out major plot points the books are just so packed with detail there's no way you can find out too much in the outside world so try them again and if you like them more this time you'll know right away and the reading will just fly by have fun p s i noticed you said you were nostalgic for hogwarts and i don't want to be a spoiler or anything but most of the th book isn't set in hogwarts but if you read the other ones leading up to it you'll probably be so into it you'll want to continue the story anyway and there's an awesome scene in hogwarts in the th so it's all worth it Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Hogwarts Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter (character) Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ginny Weasley Wizarding world Magical objects in Harry Potter Diagon Alley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter: Book Seven Minor Ravenclaws Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Minor Slytherins Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Rubeus Hagrid Minor Harry Potter Beasts Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) House-elf Death Eater J.
