why didn't harry potter get plastic surgery to have his scar removed then he could have died his hair and maybe combed it and voldemort would never have recognized him why didn't he do it first of all harry has no money to pay a plastic surgeon though he has plenty of money to pay a surgeon in the wizarding world and in the wizarding world there is no need of a plastic surgeon as wizarding doctors and nurses could simply use magic to remove scars madame pompfrey simply pointed her wand at hermione's teeth after they'd been struck by the engorgement charm in order to shrink them in the muggle world she'd have had to see an orthodontist to fix the problem and they'd probably have pulled her teeth secondly harry's scar wasn't a regular scar it was a magical scar meaning that he recieved it because magic had been used against him had voldemort cut him with a knife then the scar could be removed but it seems that scars or wounds caused by magic or certain magical creatures can not be removed or healed bill was mauled by greyback while he was in human form and he'll always have the wounds the werewolf gave him because george's ear was severed from his head by magic there was nothing that could be done for him to heal it harry's scar is unlikely to be removed even if he wanted it to be finally harry's tried combing his hair but it always resists being combed his aunt tried numerous times when he was younger to cut his untidy hair but it grew back to where it was within a few hours it's unlikely that if harry attemtped to dye it that it would stay dyed for more than a few hours Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Diagon Alley Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Magic (Harry Potter) Hogwarts subjects Hogwarts Magical objects in Harry Potter Wizarding world Albus Dumbledore Death Eater Blood purity (Harry Potter) Ron Weasley Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Minor Harry Potter Beasts Dates in Harry Potter Hermione Granger Weasley family Remus Lupin Ministry of Magic Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Battle of Hogwarts Scar Rubeus Hagrid Sirius Black Rita Skeeter Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Minor Hufflepuffs Characters in the Smurfs Severus Snape Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Money in Harry Potter Minor Hogwarts teachers Magical beasts (Harry Potter) Nymphadora Tonks Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Order of the Phoenix James and Lily Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) Fred and George Weasley House-elf Surgery Dementor Dursley family Textile manufacturing Ginny Weasley Plastic surgery Azkaban Wand Wound healing phases Dentistry Horace Slughorn The Inside Keloid Charmed Darken Rahl R.A.B.
