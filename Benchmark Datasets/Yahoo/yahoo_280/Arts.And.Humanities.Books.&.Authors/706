did you read lord of the rings and see the films i did not but i do have the trilogy on dvd it is absolutely fantastic but after seeing the special effects disc i now know i should have been familiar with the hobbit first i think it would be anticlimactic to read the trilogy now that i've seen the films but i will seek out the hobbit well i love to read so after all the movies came out i decided to read them they're great books they actually did the movies pretty well but there's something about books that will always be superior in my opinion they come to life more as long as you have an imagination plus there's always more in a book The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film) The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film) Tolkien fandom The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy The Lord of the Rings The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film) Weapons of Middle-earth Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Elijah Wood One Ring Canon (fiction) The Hobbit Middle-earth Trilogy Arwen The Return of the King J.
