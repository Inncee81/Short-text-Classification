deatheaters liking voldemort i don't understand the deatheaters i understand that they are all pure blood and hates people who are mudbloods and half muggle my question is why is that they so much worship lord voldemort who was half muggle and respected snape who too was half muggle voldemort never let anyone know that he was half blood you can tell that they fear him but they are drawn to him because he has the power to accomplish what they want and they want to be part of that power i think they respected snape because voldemort respected him there are times when people really question snape and his allegiance to voldemort voldemort probably knew that snape was half muggle but saw that snape wanted nothing more than to help voldemort acheive the pure blood society he wanted Blood purity (Harry Potter) Albus Dumbledore Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Horace Slughorn Death Eater Dates in Harry Potter Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Peter Pettigrew Ministry of Magic Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter: Book Seven Sirius Black Weasley family Draco Malfoy James and Lily Potter Ron Weasley Ginny Weasley Hogwarts Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Minor Hufflepuffs Order of the Phoenix Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Battle of Hogwarts Half-Blood Prince (character) Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Dark Mark R.A.B.
