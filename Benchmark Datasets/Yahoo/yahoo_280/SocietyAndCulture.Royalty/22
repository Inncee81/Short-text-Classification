king and prince i have a hypothetical question and i'm trying to prove a point to a few people a man is prince he has an illegitmate child and then get married to another woman and they have a child even if the older one's parents weren't married at the time of his birth wouldn't he be the rightful heir to the throne because his father is going to be king and he's the eldest it depends on the laws of the country some countries go with the rule of primogeniture rule by the eldest child or eldest son some countries may have rules that restrict the inheritance of the crown to legitimate children only for example i believe henry viii had an illegitimate son that was never considered an acceptable candidate for the throne only the children of his wives were candidates also keep in mind that nothing is certain the prince father may die or be killed before he can assume the throne and if his sons are too young to rule the crown may be passed to the other princes or princesses of his generation and then to their children alternately a regent may be appointed to rule temporarily until the child comes of age this delicate power blaance is rarely accepted in most modern monarchies Heir Apparent Order of succession British monarchy Line of succession to the Monegasque Throne Primogeniture Succession to the British Throne Emperor of Japan Regency Acts Christian IX of Denmark House of Bourbon Hereditary peer Monarch Edward III of England George VI of the United Kingdom Louise of Hesse Kings of Jerusalem Henry VIII of England House of Orange-Nassau Pretender Duke of Braganza British Royal Family Wars of the Roses James II of England George V of the United Kingdom Elizabeth I of England Mary I of England Succession laws Imperial Household of Japan Frederick VII of Denmark Anne of Great Britain George I of Great Britain Louis XIV of France War of the Spanish Succession __rp__ds Appanage George III of the United Kingdom Line of succession to the British Throne Mary II of England Salic law Edward VI of England Charles II of England Henry VII of England Lady Frances Brandon Matrilineal succession William IV of the United Kingdom Princess of Wales Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Richard III of England Joseon Dynasty Parliament of the United Kingdom Henry I of England Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Brienne claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem Caroline, Princess of Hanover Ruling Queens of N__menor Richard I of England Line of succession to the Spanish Throne Dutch monarchy Emperor of China George IV of the United Kingdom Margrethe II of Denmark Kingdom of Navarre Hatshepsut Danish Royal Family Hundred Years' War John of England Marriage Albert II, Prince of Monaco Monarchy in Canada Duke of Somerset Philip II of Spain Albert II of Belgium Thai royal and noble titles George II of Great Britain Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh Maria II of Portugal Haakon VII of Norway Henry VI of England Elizabeth of York Inheritance Palaeologus Prince Princes in the Tower Monarchy Emperor Xuan of Han Competitors for the Crown of Scotland Emperor Guangwu of Han Struggle for the throne of Portugal Jadwiga of Poland Romanov Ferdinand II of Aragon Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon
