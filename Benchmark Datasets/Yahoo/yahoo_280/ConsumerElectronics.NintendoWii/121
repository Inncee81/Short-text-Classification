do nintendo ds games work with a nintendo wii i've just bought a wii for my son's birthday someone told me that either ds games or xbox games will work with the wii in addition to the games made specifically for wii is this right will i need any different controls to work the games other than the wii mote thank you you can't put a ds game into the wii but there are some games like pokemon diamond and pearl that lets you upload game saves to the wii basically with pokemon battle revolution instead of using the pokemon that are included in the game you can upload pokemon that you caught and trained from the ds games pokemon diamond and pokemon pearl to do battle in pokemon battle revolution i think the person got confused with gamecube games and ds games the wii can play all gamecube games also with the gamecube it was possible to get the gamecube player which attaches to the bottom of the gamecube and from there you can play gameboy games on the tv Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Nintendo GameCube Nintendo Revolution Game Boy Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Game controller Game Boy Advance Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Nintendo Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo DS The Sims Computer and video games Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Pok__mon Colosseum Pok__mon Trading Card Game Action Replay Xbox Animal Crossing Pok__mon Emerald Bubble Bobble Pok__mon Stadium Dance Dance Revolution Console game The Legend of Zelda series Tetris Attack Resident Evil (video game) Phantasy Star Online Pok__mon Crystal Video game console Boss (video games) PlayStation 2 Pok__mon Yellow Computer role-playing game Super Nintendo Entertainment System Resident Evil 2 Modchip Nintendo 64 Missingno.
