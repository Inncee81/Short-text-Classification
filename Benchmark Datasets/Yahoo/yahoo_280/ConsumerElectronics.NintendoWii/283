nyko rechargeble batteries for wii one of the remotes is fine but the other one everytime you squeeze the remote the it turns off anyone else have this problem or did i just get a broken one yeah i had this problem the problem is the connection isnt tight enough to detect that a battery is in there it is too loose i ended up taking a small piece of cardboard and duct taping it to the top part of the battery or the top of the wiimote where the battery would go and then sticking in the battery it works fine now you could return it and get a new one but since i figured it out i decided to keep it because at the time it was almost as hard to find one of those things as the wii i dont know why it is only one battery which was the same thing that happened with me Mouse (computing) IBM PC compatible Whose Line Is It Anyway?
