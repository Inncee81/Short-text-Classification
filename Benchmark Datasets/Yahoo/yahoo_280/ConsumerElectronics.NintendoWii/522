nintendo wii owners i have a question what are some fun and realistic sports games on the wii i liked the wii sports thing but i thought golf was unrealistic and was hoping for more control over the tennis player i loved bowling does anyone else recommend a game that is very realistic or are they non existent tiger woods is much more realistic golf both in physics and swing style although putting leaves something to be desired imo madden is realistic in that it's really complicated with plays and full season modes and improving your players by doing drills the actual throwing the ball and running the ball motions are different of course because most gamers would get pretty tired running yards as their nfl player does madden is just coming out or just came out so you may be able to find madden ' at cheaper prices to try there's a new brunswick i think bowling game that's coming out that seems rather realistic there's only one baseball game out the bigs and it's sort of realistic it's more of an arcade game though and the actual hitting technique is more up and down rather than side to side so not totally representative in wii sports there's actually more tennis control than you think spin and how high the ball is hit depends upon whether you put spin on the wii mote they just don't tell you that good enough list Baseball Stars National Football League Baseball Tennis Computer and video game genres Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXXVI Cincinnati Bengals Fast bowling Cricket Sports timeline Volleyball Super Bowl XXVI American football Super Bowl XVIII Softball EA Sports Stormfront Studios Tiger Woods Glossary of American football Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXIV Mario National Football League Lore First-person shooter San Francisco 49ers Cleveland Browns Counter-Strike Donovan McNabb FIFA Series Michael Vick Nintendo DS Super Bowl XXXIII Sport Pinball New England Patriots St. Louis Rams Tag Bo Jackson Ty Cobb Nintendo Detroit Tigers Electronic Arts Super Bowl XXIII Billiards Andre Agassi Babe Ruth Pittsburgh Steelers Major League Baseball Satchel Paige Basketball Tris Speaker Super Bowl IX St. Louis Cardinals Cricket ball Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXV Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXIX Super Bowl VI Paintball Super Bowl XVI Craps World Series Beer Pong Baseball statistics Types of bowlers in cricket Pete Sampras Tennis Croquet Sudden death Beatmania IIDX Super Bowl Rounders Reggie Jackson Monday Night Football Super Bowl XXXIV Field hockey Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XII Baseball scorekeeping Ultimate (sport) Snooker Four square Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XIX Tecmo Super Bowl American Football League
