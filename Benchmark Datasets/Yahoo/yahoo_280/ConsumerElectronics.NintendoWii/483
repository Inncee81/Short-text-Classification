when do you think majora's mask will be released on the wii's virtual console i'm short on cash here and someone is offering for my legend of zelda collector's edition on the gamecube the only reason i'm holding onto it is because of majora's mask every other game on the disk i can buy to play on the wii and it allows me to play it on different controls compared to just the gamecube controller on the collector's edition what should i do here should i hold onto the collector's edition for it will go up in value over time or should i just sell it away since majora's mask is pretty much guaranteed on the virtual console actually not if majora's mask was on the virtual console it would be for being an n title so it's legend of zelda legend of zelda ii adventures of link ocarina of time majora's mask to buy all the games on the disk despite it saying collector's edition i don't see it going for much in the future if the games in the compilation are readily available on the wii and collector's editions of many games don't go for much more than their standard editions there is a reason it's called the collector's edition that means over time it will be worth more in like years it could be worth a lot of money i e more than bucks and plus it would cost more to buy all of the collector's edition's games for virtual console than the measly bucks The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask The Legend of Zelda series Nintendo 64 The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker Nintendo GameCube Legend of Zelda series songs The Legend of Zelda series characters The Legend of Zelda Koji Kondo Nintendo Nintendo Power The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters Rupee (Legend of Zelda) Octorok The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest The Legend of Zelda series enemies Princess Zelda Ganon The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters Link (Legend of Zelda) Interactive Achievement Awards Zelda II: The Adventure of Link Computer and video games that have been considered the greatest ever Nintendo Entertainment System The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Sega Rare (video game company) The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Sega Dreamcast Nintendo Revolution The Legend of Zelda series races Xbox Master Sword Zora Super Smash Bros.
