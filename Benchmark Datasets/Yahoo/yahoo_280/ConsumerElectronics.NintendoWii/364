does anyone know how long can a wii detect an internet router because i have a psp and and can detect a signal ft away but i think the wii has a better range right the detection range is not the only thing to consider the closer to the router the stronger and cleaner the signal also the range is not determined by the device but by the router itself and any interfering walls or objects in between one other thing your wii may have a better usable range than your psp because it has a better transmitter good luck Wi-Fi Radar Router IEEE 802.11 Federal Standard 1037C Antenna (radio) Sonar Radio Communications protocol Nintendo DS SETI PlayStation 3 Digital Subscriber Line History of radar Phase-locked loop Telephone Ethernet Magnetic resonance imaging Global Positioning System TV-FM DX Denial-of-service attack Sensor Cellular network Ionosphere Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects PlayStation Portable Wireless access point Multiprotocol Label Switching Microphone Non-directional beacon Passive radar Wireless LAN Code division multiple access Transmitter RFID Network address translation Vacuum Cisco Systems Galileo spacecraft Network congestion avoidance Universal Serial Bus Color Stereoscopy Paintball Routing Optical fiber Seismometer IPv6 LORAN Detection theory Dowsing Stealth aircraft Signal-to-noise ratio IPv4 Magnet Covert listening device Power line communication Repeater Amateur radio Computer networking device Radio direction finding Speed of light Piezoelectricity Traffic light Compact disc Phase-shift keying Telephone tapping Electronic amplifier Cassini-Huygens Roomba X-ray X10 (industry standard) Software-defined radio HyperTransport Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Hardware random number generator Infrared Longwave Citizens' band radio Technology in the Stargate universe Digital audio broadcasting ATLAS experiment History of radio Embedded system Internet security Phreaking MAC address Nuclear magnetic resonance LIDAR Asynchronous Transfer Mode Broadband Internet access Deep Space 1 IS-IS Lightning Fermi paradox Distributed computing Session Initiation Protocol Automatic gain control
