are doctors now lazy and don't care about patients hello doctor i've been having pain and discomfort in my entire body daily for about years now and some days it gets so bad that i can't get out of bed i have my good days but most of the time it's hard for me to function in daily life and i can't do all the things i want to do i also get headaches severe period cramps lightheadedness and fatigue i get sharp pains in my stomach and back that sometimes bring me to my knees i'm a pretty tough year old but have cried several times from the pain and feeling helpless also over the counter meds like tylenol and midol don t help me at all berry here's some paxil doc hello doctor i've had serious stomach problems for about years including sharp pains discomfort frequent gas diarrhea and constipation i eat healthy most of the time and don't eat fast food i think my stomach problems have resulted from my teenage partying phase where i drank and did drugs i have quit these bad habits but have continued to have problems berry here's some imodium ad doc i feel these doctors don t take me seriously and they just hand me a useless prescription without running tests asking me questions or even giving advice about diet and exercise or what could be causing my problems at such a young age are my problems too complicated and they don t want to deal with them do they think i m lying or imagining it where can i find good healthcare with a caring doctor who will take me seriously and actually try to help in the meantime i ve been self medicating with loritabs for over a year because it s the only thing i ve found that has eased my pain and made it so i can function and have a normal life hi berry i can tell you honestly that doctors care and are not lazy the first thing you have to realize is that doctors are not perfect that illusion about them or anyone else can be the source of much pain they are not the healer just his asistants from their end they also can't talk negative about themselves because that will break their relationship with you the second thing is your relationship with medical persons is much like that of a school teacher or any other professional the things you think and say to them can positive for your benifit or negative and push you away from them so go easy on the criticism that doesn't build relationship you need relationship with a doctor who has relationship with the healer it sounds to me like you are getting symptomatic treatment you say you have pain and they give you paxil you say you have diarriah and they give you some imodium that is because while interviewing a patient a medical person is comparing what you say with disease symptoms he has learned about sort of like a mechanic analizing an engine which you are not of course i was a navy hospital corpsman for five years and and did a tour of duty in viet nam i've worked sick calls i suggest you find that good doctor and be careful not to mention symptoms that you are not presently expirencing that will cut down on false leads and help focus the interview i resigned medicine as a career because of an incident at sick call a certain man came to sick call on a regular basis with a marid of compaints it didn't take much of this before he was labeled a hypocondriac by my fellow medics i didn't appreciate their fun at his expense what the healer reviealed to me was he is not looking for medicine he's looking for me Fecal incontinence Prostate cancer Coeliac disease Addiction Hypoglycemia Diarrhea Migraine Chronic fatigue syndrome Pneumonia Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Traumatic brain injury Osteoarthritis Psoriasis Anorexia nervosa Traditional Chinese medicine Chiropractic First aid Decompression sickness Health insurance Breastfeeding Alternative medicine Charles Darwin's illness Milton H.
