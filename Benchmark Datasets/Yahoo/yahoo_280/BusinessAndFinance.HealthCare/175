how dangerous is the radiation that radiology techs exposed to any rad tech have any info as a radiologic technologist the amount of radiation i am exposed to is minimal we are required to wear a monitoring badge called a dosimeter once evaluated an estimate of your radiation exposure is available for you to review we must abide by the code alara as low as reasonably achievable this means that we strive to use the least amount of radiation possible to make an exposure and to reduce the amount of radiation we are exposed to and yes there are some procedures where we do get exposed to radiation so we try to increase our distance from the source increase the amount of shielding between us and the source and reduce the amount of time we are exposed to the source Nuclear power Radiation poisoning Nuclear fallout Mobile phone radiation and health Chernobyl accident Fluoroscopy Radiology Welding Nuclear weapon design Depleted uranium Malignant melanoma Ionising Radiation Protection Gas metal arc welding Plutonium Ultraviolet Nuclear explosion Project Orion Food irradiation Operation Crossroads Magnetic resonance imaging Colorectal cancer Nuclear fuel cycle Nuclear reactor Radiation hardening Vacuum Radiography Dosimeter Geomagnetic storm Fallout shelter Prostate cancer Apollo 8 Lung cancer Arc welding Risk management Cathode ray tube Apollo moon landing hoax accusations X-ray Ozone depletion Loudspeaker Fusion power Incandescent light bulb Neutron bomb Mesothelioma Pebble bed reactor HIV test Sunlight Nuclear fusion Solar cell Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Terraforming Space elevator Compiler optimization Decompression sickness Computed tomography Dirty bomb Light pollution Tank Radioactive waste Sonar Cancer Ozone hole Photographic film Glossary of firefighting terms Antenna (radio) Gamma ray Radar Dioxin Galileo spacecraft Solar panel Nuclear fission Nuclear weapon Pneumonia Sewage treatment Alcohol fuel Radioactive contamination Gravitational radiation Solar variation Pulmonary alveolus Digital photography Asthma Psoriasis Color temperature Future energy development Explosive material Headlight Optical fiber Bomb disposal Barium enema STS-62 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technetium RFID Nuclear technology Radiological warfare Hydrogen economy Nuclear weapons and the United States
