california rn's hi my son recently married a girl from the ukraine she says she is a registered nurse and her name is on the california list of rn's here is my question is it possible for this person to be supervisor or director of nursing without ever having taken an anatomy class she admits this because my daughter was taking an anatomy class and she couldn't answer any questions in my daughters book and also when i asked her what my son's blood pressure was she stumbled a bit then said over my son and her have been together for less than a year and she is leaving her job to follow her boss who is moving to sacramento hours away my son will need to quit his city job she refuses to work for anyone but this one person i always thought it was very difficult to pass the rn exam in california hours of testing etc she is currently working in a convelescent hospital any input on whether it is possible to be what she says she is would be helpful thank you go to www rn ca gov and see the phone number or address of that state board of registered nursing in sacramento ca say you are going to hire and just checking on the fact that she possesses a license see what they say it sounds fishy to me they should tell you or maybe they are all listed online like doctors are if you cannot find out anything from them a private detective would be worth the money since you want to protect your son but now he might just be mad at you since he wont want to believe it but its your job as a mom so get the evidence and if you learn she is indeed a registered nurse then shut up and god help us all if we get sick Nurse Knots Landing Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Friends Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Breastfeeding Graduate school GED Psychiatry Physician Medical prescription Great Teacher Onizuka Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Roswell UFO incident Nursing Juris Doctor Stomach cancer Paralegal The Shining (film) PHP Lawyer Charmed Jaime Escalante Dead Like Me Terri Schiavo Katelyn Faber Make money fast Education in the United States National Kidney Foundation Singapore Hikikomori Expert system Urinary incontinence St. Elmo's Fire (film) A Course In Miracles Scrubs (TV show) SAT General practitioner Code: Lyoko Password The X-Files (season 1) Hikaru no Go Medicine Florida Central Voter File Education in Romania Pitaten Unemployment Phoebe Halliwell Trademark Kurt Cobain Architect Notary public Electronic Arts Ocean's Twelve Hogwarts Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Wal-Mart Shark Education in Germany Sharon Tate 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Blood Simple Ebola Neighbours Joke Plame affair Certified Nursing Assistant Clinical depression Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Domain Name System Domestic partnerships in California Health insurance House of M Good Times CPU cache Miss Saigon Professor The Inside Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Death Comes to Time Ben Johnson (athlete) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Education in Australia Teacher Final Fantasy XI Sin City Socrates Kasparov versus The World Martin J.
