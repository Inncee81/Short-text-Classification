medical assistant how do you like your medical assitant job and what do you do as a medical assistant i'm not a medical assistant but i have seen many people be mislead by medical assisting schools it breaks my heart to see the schools take k from students and the students are lucky to find jobs for an hour they lead some people to believe that the opportunities for employment are limitless more and more medical assistants are being pushed behind a desk in the same amount of time you could become an lpn and have more opportunities for employment and better pay plus you have the option of continuing your education as an rn i just completed a six week cna program and am applying for jobs when i look through the hospital job postings cna's are paid as much as medical assistants i find that so sad i paid for my cna they paid it makes me want to cry i'm sure its different in other areas i live in nebraska i understand that some people just don't like poop and the messy stuff that goes with nursing nothing wrong with that but if this is why you are looking in to medical assisting look into respiratory therapy or radiation technology if you still want to be a medical assistant go to a community college not one of the tech schools that advertise all the time on daytime tv i really hope i didn't insult you or your career plans i just hate seeing people conned Nurse Medicine Certified Nursing Assistant University of Central Florida Columbia University October 2005 in Malaysia and Singapore Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Dot-com Seneca College Health insurance Unemployment Paralegal Juris Doctor 2005 Bali bombings Childbirth Chinese University of Hong Kong Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medical Assistant Pitaten The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio Medical school Barbara Boxer Clinical depression Myocardial infarction Walt Disney World College Program July 2005 in Malaysia and Singapore Affirmative action Neighbours Kwantlen University College Student loan Scholarship University of Michigan Prostate cancer General practitioner Georgia Institute of Technology Psoriasis Stroke Poker jargon Education in Portugal Medical University of South Carolina Alpha Phi Education in Australia University of Connecticut Psychiatric hospital Patsy Mink Urinary incontinence Nursing home University of California, Los Angeles Johns Hopkins University Chiropractic Stomach cancer Pneumonia Miami-Dade County Public Schools American University Milton H.
