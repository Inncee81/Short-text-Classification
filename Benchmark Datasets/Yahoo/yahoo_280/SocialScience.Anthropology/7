do you think islamic terrorists and bombers are sexually deprived here is my theory i think it has to do with polygamy in most islamic countries originally due to infighting among tribes a sufficient no of male members used to die and polygamy was used as a way to protect women as single women were prone to rape and molestation if they were single however in the present scenario this leads to an excess of men e g this is a hypothetical situation if there are a men and women men marry women each this leaves men furthermore in the next generation there are again men and women the earlier men marry more women each leaving men without partners in most islamic countries a man is allowed to marry atleast times if not more no to these sexually depraved men the idea of virgins waiting in heaven by dying for islam must sound very tempting i think you need to re think your theory Polygamy Marriage Polygyny Monogamy Domestic violence Feminist movement Plural marriage Religion and sexuality Sexual abstinence Sharia Original sin Same-sex marriage Honor killing History of sex Bisexuality Liberal movements within Islam Women in Islam Homosexuality and Islam Polyamory Islamic view of marriage Democracy Role of women in Judaism Virgin Feminism Pornography in Japan Sexual intercourse Child sexual abuse Age of consent Sexual orientation Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Pornography Demon Concubinage History of feminism Condom Bah__'u'll__h's family Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Human sexual behavior Human sexuality Age disparity in sexual relationships Lot (Biblical) Rape Adam and Eve Five Pillars of Islam Pedophilia Birth control Group sex Artificial selection Mormonism and Judaism Sexuality in Christian demonology Andrea Dworkin Isa Interpersonal relationship Big Bang Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints Book of Mormon Christian view of marriage Sodom and Gomorrah Theodicy Consensual crime Castration Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Masturbation Gender role Orgasm Terrorism Soul The Handmaid's Tale Origin belief Anorgasmia Lawrence v.
