i was in the grocery store and i had one more item that i had to go past the checkout line to get i angled my cart to the line quickly took the needed or steps and briefly disappeared up the aisle for no more than seconds when i got back to my cart my dreaded fear had been realized as a woman standing behind her cart was now positioned rt behind the line but w a buffer space to the cart in front of her that left me unsure if she was going to recognize my position we both had a fairly equal amount of groceries not too big not too small the moment the line moved i stood motionless prepared to make eye contact and willing to cede the place in line to her but she kept her gaze away f me so i pushed my cart into the line and nothing was said my ques is this what's the protocol about my actions as they relate to position in the line certainly i would be offended if someone stuck their cart in my long line were gone for min and came back w an armload of groceries just in time to be checked out who's gonna push that cart forward when the line moves i know if i was her i would have had no problem letting me take the position that my cart represented unless the line moved and there was no one to push it that's what the protocol should be if it's not plus if there would have been someone in the line behind me i could have mentioned that i would be rt back as i had one item to get that i had forgotten i don't think this was even an issue to the woman in the line she knew i was in front of her why do some ppl think this is a big deal to me is it because i was careful to describe it in detail this is as trivial as it gets but that doesn't mean that i shouldn't be curious about the protocol since most of you have don't have any idea about this i'm gonna stick w the notion that i havn't committed a violation in ethical behavior provided i'm there to move my cart forward when the line moves if i was shopping w someone they could watch the cart if someone was behind me i could ask them to excuse me while i quickly get one more item i leave the cart at the end of the aisle when i shop instead of pushing it everywhere i go i get the items in that aisle then proceed this time i left the cart at the end of the line because there was no reason cluttering up the store unnecessarily nas i took the final sec to get the last item so there that settles it leave your cart in line if you can get back to it before the line moves lol let me ask you this what if you are in line and there is someone behind you you don't say anything dash off for sec return w one item only to discover the person behind you swapped places and the line hasn't even moved would you feel violated by this you're lying if you say no i would agree with you if you were just gone so briefly that the cashier had not gotten to your place i would have procedded as you did it seems you tried to make eye contact perhaps at your return to the cart just saying thanks if just had to grab something quickly however if the person wouldn't even look at you what's a person to do no big deal it's nice that you considered other's feelings Theory of conduct Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Friends Surveillance Theodicy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
