why is it that we use fork knife for eating and not spoon fork instead i have noticed that forks are predominantly the single most used piece when eating why not the spoon spoons are more effective in picking up food like couscous rice and of course soup and with a spoon it is possible to cut meat vegetables and other food unlike a fork it just makes more sense to use a combination of spoon and fork as opposed to the use of a knife and fork generally speaking the fork is a more versatile eating utensil then the spoon when eating most types of meat a knife is required to properly cut that meat you must use something to hold the meat in place until cut the fork is the best utensil for this job if we use the spoon it would take too long to cut through meat and we could not stab our food to pick it up the fork allows us to stab scoop and hold down our food Fork Chopsticks Chinese cuisine Spoon Spork Knife Japanese tea ceremony Kosher foods Korean cuisine Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Thailand Russian cuisine Table setting Meal Soup Breakfast Couscous Cuisine of the Philippines Japanese cuisine Sushi Food Dim sum Tofu Vegetarian cuisine Vegetarianism Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Laos Kashrut Sandwich Cuisine of Denmark French cuisine Joke Spaghetti Burger Bengali cuisine Microwave oven Pea soup Tool Ramen Foodborne illness Escherichia coli O157:H7 German cuisine Food preservation Hamburger Roman eating and drinking Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Singapore Potato Veganism Pasta Sausage Laksa Cuisine of Brazil Comanche Food storage Curry Dumpling Isan Mango Cantonese cuisine Steak Pancake RuneScape skills Tlingit Sauerkraut Cuisine of Malaysia Sea-Monkey Minestrone Cookware and bakeware Meat Fecal incontinence Drill bit Salad Fingers Mayonnaise Meat analogue Domesticated turkey Cuisine of Vietnam Barbecue Yum cha Mochi Stock (food) Toast Soul food Stir frying Mushroom hunting D__ner kebab Meatloaf Buddhist cuisine Chinese food therapy Aztec Fondue Cuisine of Ethiopia Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Chess terminology Restaurant Chicken soup Tamale Happy Tree Friends Agriculture
