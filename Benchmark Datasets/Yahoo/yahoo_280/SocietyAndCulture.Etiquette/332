best way to quit i've been working here for a little over months and i am just completely sick of it i'm only and it's my first job but it's like weeks before the biggest weekend i work in a ice cream parlour i'm sure my boss is going to be angry but i just don't want to work there anymore school's almost starting and after this big weekend they're only open days a week anyways i just completely hate the job what should i tell my boss how should i tell her with a letter or verbally and when should i tell her the best way to quit is quickly so your boss has time to replace you frankly with just three weeks left to go you would do yourself a favour to stay and see it out there are going to be many times in life you'll want to give up because you hate something and can't a little practice won't hurt and you'll be earning money at the same time if you are determined to quit approach your boss tomorrow morning before a crowd builds up and say to him her i have to let you know that i'd like to finish up on friday i'll work the weekend if you need someone but i'm afraid i won't be available after that if they ask why rather than saying i hate the job just advise personal reasons you won't be lying and it sounds a little more pressing you could also mention that you know it is the 'big weekend' coming up and that you would be able to be available for those two days if s he cannot find a replacement that would certainly earn you brownie points don't forget also to say how muh you've learned from the job and thank your boss for the opportunity best wishes EastEnders Eddie Guerrero Kodocha New England Patriots Jon Secada Ron and Fez Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Ayrton Senna Ocean's Twelve Sydney Riot of 1879 Social rule Eric Bischoff Oasis (band) Wheel of Fortune The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Pok__mon Live!
