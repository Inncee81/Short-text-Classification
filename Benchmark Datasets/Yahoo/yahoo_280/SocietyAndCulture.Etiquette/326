many of the answerers here suggest lies to solve problems what do you think i left q a for a while and upon coming back i am surprised how many people suggest lying as a solution to simple problems judging by the avators it seems most are young women who are promoting lying the most although certainly both genders do and we have no idea of their real ages this is a generalization every question that has lies suggested as a way to solve the problem also have some honest people suggesting honest solutions does this bother anyone else but the lies shouldn't be here at all with decent moral people and the quantity of suggested lies astounds me traveller i'm sure most of these young people think that the lies they are suggesting are 'harmless white lies' that will get them out of momentary trouble and smooth over hurt feelings of course it is never good to lie and in fact it almost always creates more problems than it solves in the long run but for many people it takes some maturity and experience to realise that people asking questions have a choice of answers to select from why not make yours the most honest and sensible response you can offer so at least that choice is represented you will soon find that honest answers are very often the ones people select for themselves and are recognised by others with 'thumbs up' and so on you can only offer the answers you think are helpful good luck and best wishes Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Current teachings of Prem Rawat Goodness and value theory Expert system Halting problem Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theodicy Utilitarianism Avenue Q God Emperor of Dune Sexual orientation Ethics Adjoint functors Mathematics of general relativity Transactional analysis Complexity classes P and NP The nature of God in Western theology Exact solutions in general relativity Simone Weil Interactive proof system Social rule Mathematics Abortion debate Lie Jumpstart 3rd Grade Gauge theory Alignment (role-playing games) Prices of production Keynesian economics Dynamical system Economics Ordinary differential equation The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bertrand Russell Quicksort Atomism Incarnations of Immortality The Apprentice 2 Altruism Combinatorics Margaret Mead Philosophy of language Simon Commission Microeconomics Domestic violence Swami Vivekananda Pitaten Alexander Technique IP (complexity) Plame affair French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Bernard Williams Species Diablo II: Lord of Destruction A Course In Miracles Law of value Richard Feynman Software engineering Creationism Leadership The Shining (film) Monty Hall problem Turing test One Tree Hill (TV series) Efficiency wages Genetic algorithm Philosophy of space and time Victor Cousin Infinity Algorithm Coming of Age (TNG episode) Artificial neural network Parsifal Transsexuality Cyprus dispute Mach kernel Zeno's paradoxes Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scientific method Shaggy dog story Milton H.
