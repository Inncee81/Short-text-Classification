how do you respond to a friend who is slightly negative all the time i am getting tired of a friend who just says negative things behind every little comment i love her but i really want her to just let conversation be as it is any suggestions without hurting her feelings the sky really is blue have a friend exactly the same and i love her dearly too this person was always put down as a child and so thinks of most things in the negative if she thinks something is good it opens her up to being hurt rejected i get this about her so therefore understand her personality what you do tho' is to show her the upside of her comments over time they get the message and learn to either not make negative comments around you because you dont buy into it or amazingly will start to make small but genuine attempts at being more positive be the person in her life to show her its not all bad Transactional analysis Social rule Socrates Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Internet troll Alcoholics Anonymous Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Jiddu Krishnamurti Evil Happiness Kodocha Anne Rice Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Scientology beliefs and practices Singlish 1957 World Series The Catcher in the Rye Current teachings of Prem Rawat Theory of conduct Sinfest Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism Time Out of Mind The Shining (film) Vernon Schillinger Utilitarianism Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind God Emperor of Dune Confucius Slashdot trolling phenomena Mina Mongoose About a Boy Tiger Woods Emily Dickinson Ethics Ludwig Wittgenstein Reparative therapy Henry Thrale Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Avenue Q Hiberno-English Past teachings of Prem Rawat Honey and Clover Atomic Kitten Gospel of Thomas Rich Mullins Justification (theology) Atheism The Time Machine Goodness and value theory World Championship Wrestling Incarnations of Immortality Piccolo Junior Saga Storytelling Karl Marx Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Rei Ayanami Meat Loaf God Eugenics Cyberspace Pok__mon Live!
