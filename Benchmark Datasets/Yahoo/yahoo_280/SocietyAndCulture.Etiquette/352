what is a polite way to tell people to please remove their shoes when coming in your house i love my mom in law but i am very frustrated with her forgetting to remove her shoes when she comes into our house i have a month old baby that crawls everywhere and i really don't want the extra dirt on the floor i made a point to tell her that a contractor had been at the house and got dirt all over the floor with his boots hoping that would refresh her memory that we all take our shoes off at the door it worked that time but the next few times her shoes stayed on i should also mention that she is physically capable of taking off her shoes and that she does it in her own home we both have houses less than one year old i'm pregnant and i'm sick and tired of mopping the floor after she comes over i can't seem to find a nice way to make a strong point that the shoes need to come off please help thanks we too have a no shoes policy in our household for the exact same reason as you hygiene while most respect our rule and get the hint when they see shoes by the door we still have the one or two who for whatever reason feel compelled not to remove their shoes the problem was solved when we put a please remove your shoes sign above the doorbell we had it engraved on a brass plate also we provide house slippers for those who prefer to have something on their feet once inside or those surgical booties to put over their shoes their choice you can also kindly ask her if she forgets could you please take your shoes off we're a no shoes household for the baby's sake thanks good luck Shoe Sento Qiang Customs and etiquette of Japan Horseshoe High-heeled shoe Social rule Abortion debate Japanese toilet Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sock Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jewish bereavement Jumpstart 3rd Grade Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Cindy Sheehan Poker jargon Burial The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Volleyball Humphrey Bogart Friends Paul Is Dead Scenes from a Memory Saint Nicholas CPU cache Footwear Characters in the Smurfs Expert system Tag The Death Gate Cycle 2000 Australian Grand Prix Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Sharon Tate Jon Secada Richard Chase Glossary of climbing terms Simone Weil Obstetrics My Life as a Teenage Robot Abortion Rent (musical) Vacuum cleaner Charles Goodyear The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Cliff Richard Hygiene Pitaten The Fairly OddParents Abortion in the United States Softball The Smoking Room Samuel Goldwyn Utilitarianism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Motorcycle Tupac Shakur Coming of Age (TNG episode) Sin City Drag racing The Evil Queen/Christine Slevil-Lewis-White (The 10th Kingdom) Childbirth Marching band Sex and the City Kurt Cobain Married... with Children Infantilism EastEnders The Inside Slipper Massachusetts Institute of Technology Silent Hill G-Man (Half-Life) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Glossary of partner dance terms The Marshall Mathers LP RuneScape quests Japanese tea ceremony Holes (book) The McGuire Sisters Foot Time Out of Mind Fasting Futurama (TV series - season 5) Conspiracy (TNG episode) Caving Bernard Williams Phoebe Buffay's songs Kimi Finster Combine (Half-Life 2) Series finale Bike lane debate M16 (rifle) Super Mario Bros. 3 Irish dance Charles Peace
