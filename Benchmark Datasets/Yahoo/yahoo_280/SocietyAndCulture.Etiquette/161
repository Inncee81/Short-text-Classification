when i first started dating my boyfriend which was years ago a girl called he sounded really excited said he had to go because his girlfriend was there after he called her he told me he talked about me the entire time he was open with me he hadn t heard from her in months she randomly called because her boyfriend broke up with her he went to prom with her she ditched him even though he spent on her and she was his first kiss he said that she always had a boyfriend but he liked her he said it wasn't alot he got over it and was just her friend when she needed advice it sounded like she toyed with him but he said they used to be friends she started calling everyday for a straight week and showing up randomly at his house he never did go hang out with her he said he was trying to ignore her and was happy once she stopped calling this has eaten at me for the past years he hasn't talked to her since and says he's done all he can do and he gets annoy when i bring it up now says its childish why she did what she did did he still like her it hurt they went to prom years ago now and he said he didn't matter he burned all of their pictures and told me that he never wants me to worry about it again if it didnt matter why would he call her back and why would she think she stood a chance and started randomly showing up at his house it eats at me like mad and has really caused problems in our relationship i think you need to believe him unless his actions prove otherwise if that was the last you heard of her then believe it is the last you will ruin your relationship with these worries and most likely they are in your head you have to let it go happiness doesnt come to you you create it he's with you for a year and a half not her remember that Kodocha EastEnders Neighbours Shaggy dog story Piccolo Junior Saga Pitaten Knots Landing Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Something Positive The Ashlee Simpson Show Friends Grandview, U.S.A.
