what to do about friends bo my male friend showers every few days but he smells like arse it's so gross should i say something and how i've joked with him about showering daily we have band practice in a small room and when he gets up p u he doesn't seem to get the hint my other bandmates told me not to say anything to him because that is rude and just deal with it it doesn't seem fair i don't know how his g f puts up with it hmmm well i would go one or two ways the cowardly safe route send him an anonymous email telling him he needs to shower be serious and make sure he knows that this is not a prank buy him a beer sit him down and tell him you love having him in your band you think he's a great guy but he needs to do something about the bo there is a third option the group intervention where the band talks to the guy but the guys in your band don't sound like they're ready for such a bold step b Avenue Q Ocean's Twelve Friends Married... with Children Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
