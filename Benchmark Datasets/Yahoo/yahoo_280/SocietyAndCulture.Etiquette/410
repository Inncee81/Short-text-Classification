reprimanding an office worker i work at a small school we have two staff people our accounting clerk who i supervise works two days a week the other days he does go fer kinds of jobs he's worked here for about a year i try to be flexible with his schedule and he's a hard worker and does a good job the last three months have been difficult because our company is merging and i'm working to take care of the legal stuff and the accounting clerk is doing the financial stuff with a cpa helping the last three weeks however he's called off on one of his days to work or come in to tell me he has to leave early or leave at noon etc he apologies for the late notice no show etc i need to talk to him about this and intend to but i'm giving my notice monday yes the merger was the breaking point for me should i wait until i give my notice or later today when he comes in fyi his next scheduled day to work is tuesday sure it would be easy to pawn this problem off to the next person that gets my job but i want to leave knowing that everything including staff management is in good order i'm not the kind to deliberately leave open issues because i didn't feel like dealing with it wow i hope i never inherit your job and its problems you didn't feel like fixing when i start a job if you feel you need to talk to him go ahead imo the best way to do that is to ask him if his personal issues are resolved and if so that you need him to resume his more normal schedule of a few months before as you are currently doing part of his job without sharing his pay which isn't going to be possible any longer because of your own workload Enron Corporation Plame affair Poker jargon ITV Unemployment Call centre Wal-Mart Social rule Education in the People's Republic of China Freeters EastEnders Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Coalition Provisional Authority Temasek Holdings James T.
