i need help making small talk with people i'm horrible at it i always have trouble talking to people other than my friends and family when i meet new people at school and stuff i have no idea what to talk about my mind seems to go blank and no topics worth disscussing come to mind i need help so i can actually hold a conversation so if you could help me out that would be great p s i'm bty the best way to hold a conversation is to ask questions for example where do you go to school where are you from do you play any sports ask about them and then jump in with a short story or mention your interest when you find a similar interest sometimes it is even ok to tell someone that you don't have a similar interest for example oh you play baseball i've never really been a big fan but i guess it's different when you're playing this opens up the conversation to their experience and will continue the conversation hope this helps Social rule The Catcher in the Rye The nature of God in Western theology Wheel of Fortune Fight Club Major League Baseball television contracts Game show Theory of conduct Plame affair Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Francis Crick Married... with Children G-Man (Half-Life) Turing test David Hume Jiddu Krishnamurti You Don't Know Jack Little Britain Poker jargon John Cage Garth Brooks Kodocha The writing of Principia Mathematica Discworld Social psychology C.
