how long should i wait until i ask for refund i have a toddler who goes to daycare and is currently potty training for this reason i send him to school with changes of clothes very recently he has been coming home in the change of clothes but not with the clothes he wore to school so i wrote a note to his teacher last week asking to send his clothes home daily even if they're soiled or dirty that same day he came home with a pair of shorts we hadn't seen in a week but the football jersey he wore with it is still missing i should clarify that i drop him off in the monring and my husband picks him up in the afternoon so dad doesn't always know what he wore to school and therefore doesn't ask for his items his teacher told my husband she would look for it this jersey cost and it was so big on him we figured he would get alot of wear out of it he's already had it for a year it's in excellent condition is it wrong for me to ask for a refund of my from daycare for this missing jersey i don't understand why they don't just put these soiled clothes in a bag with your sons name on it to give to you or your hub at the end of the day what on earth would she ever have to look for them i've never heard of such a thing maybe go into school and have a meeting with her and see what the situation is and at the end explain that if she can't find the jersey you'll be expecting the that it cost Social rule Shaggy dog story Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Jennifer Lopez Dog training Slow Train Coming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Extreme Programming The Inside The Fairly OddParents New York Giants About a Boy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Operation Market Garden Customs and etiquette of Japan Joke The Adventures of Pete & Pete Time Out of Mind Coming of Age (TNG episode) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Poker jargon U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Theory of conduct Hey Jude Jackass: The Movie New York Jets National Football League Kodocha Ben Johnson (athlete) Avenue Q Good Times Harrow School Animal Crossing The Jazz Singer Syphon Filter Pitaten God Emperor of Dune Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial Bowl Championship Series Calvin and Hobbes Tai Chi Chuan David Beckham Doug The Catcher in the Rye Otakon Sleeping Murder Denis Law Jon Secada Education in the People's Republic of China Kindergarten Cindy Sheehan Spidey Super Stories Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Recurring South Park characters Miss Saigon Rais massacre Mississippi John Hurt Jacksonville Jaguars Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Past teachings of Prem Rawat Little Britain CPU cache RuneScape quests Fecal incontinence Japanese tea ceremony 613 mitzvot Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Earth Girl Arjuna Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Beetle in an Anthill 1957 World Series Sin City EastEnders Recess (TV series) Logo programming language The Marriage of Figaro Conspiracy (TNG episode) WCBS-FM Diaper Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Homecoming (tradition) Port Authority Trans-Hudson Education in Germany Day care Surveillance Le Malade imaginaire Columbine High School massacre Plame affair Saint Nicholas Philosophy of language Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Dallas Cowboys
