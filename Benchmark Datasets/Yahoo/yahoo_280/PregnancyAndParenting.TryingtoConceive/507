cbe fertility monitor off on peak dates the cbe fertility monitor gave me a peak on cd and cd i'm sure that i ovulated on cd though i had spotting lots of cm and my temps were low all that day although not until a few hours after i had taken my temp that morning i think that i ovulated that night and i got my peak the following morning in the past when i have done opk's i've gotten a postive on the actual day that i ovulated and the day after maybe it did that again with the monitor and i ovulated late on cd so for some reason it didn't pick up my peak until the next day all the monitor did for me was confirm that i do ovulate late but i know it is not cd and probably not cd sigh my temp did jump up a bit on cd and then this morning it's up real high so i would think that shows that i did in fact already ovulate it is usually on average i would share my ff chart but am not sure how to do it here is a link to my chart http www fertilityfriend com home bdf i was off almost an hour on my temp this morning earlier so not sure how much that affects it if you are using fertilityfriend log into your chart over on the left point to the sharing button and then click home page setup at the top you will see your charting home page web address and it will be something like this this like is to my chart http www fertilityfriend com home c copy and paste your link to send to anyone you want to have your chart i'll check back tomorrow and if you could add additonal details with your chart link that would be great looking at your chart i'm saying you probably o'd on cd HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Phishing Menstrual cycle Billboard Hot 100 Gmail Tide Web crawler HTTP cookie Common Unix Printing System World Wide Web In vitro fertilisation GameFAQs Ovulation The Emancipation of Mimi Puberty E-mail Blonde on Blonde Emergency contraception Spice Girls Pregnancy Public-key cryptography UK Singles Chart Quarashi Domain Name System Windows XP Web server E-mail spam Plame affair MD5 Ajax (programming) 1957 World Series Backstreet Boys Temperature R.
