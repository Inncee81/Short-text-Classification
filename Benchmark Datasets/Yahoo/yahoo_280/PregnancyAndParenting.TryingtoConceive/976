is it true that when a pregnat couple have sex the semen is used to support the unborn baby is it a myth or fact and i mean semen taken in vaginaly not oraly as my question may sound like to some pregnant not pregnat sorry no there is absolutely no truth in that the only role that sperm semen plays in pregnancy is at conception once a woman has conceived the baby develops in the uterus it is within an amniotic sac within the uterus and the mucous plug seals the cervix which is also closed the sperm semen never comes into contact with the baby any sperm that is released into the vagina will drain out of the vagina the only thing that supports the baby is the placenta which is fed by the mother towards the end of pregnancy sperm semen does have the potential to aid in the onset of labor if the conditions are right as it contains prostaglandins cervadil a prostaglandolin gel that is used to induce labor is actually derived from swine aka pig sperm semen Pregnancy Childbirth Miscarriage In vitro fertilisation Artificial insemination Birth control Obstetrics Cervix Oral sex Fertility awareness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual reproduction Menstrual cycle Semen Intact dilation and extraction Breech birth Amniotic sac Premature birth Safe sex Vagina Intersexuality Fertilisation Infertility Fetus Prenatal diagnosis Puberty Human sexual behavior Condom Mammalian embryogenesis Genital wart Orgasm Anal sex Masturbation Twin Marsupial Birth weight Old wives' tale Ectopic pregnancy Spina bifida Progesterone Oral contraceptive Urinary incontinence Placenta Pornographic movie Sterilization (surgical procedure) Man Sexual abstinence Intersex surgery Diaphragm (contraceptive) Fetal development Adoption Herpes simplex virus Gynaecology Coitus interruptus Pregnancy (mammals) Sexual differentiation Ovary Cervical cancer Roe v.
