ttc do you know if taking tylenol pm wll stop me from pg i have been trying to concieve for months but i dont sleep that good unless i take either tylenol pm or a unisom i usually take it every other day could that stop me from getting pg tylenol pm has no effect on ttc this is my suggestion for you on ttc the only way is getting to truly know your cycle ok i know that sounded so cheesy don't listen to anyone telling you to count this many days or that many anything that's not how it works you have to find out when you ovulate and every cycle of your own can even be different and women with the same number of days in a cycle can ovulate several days apart you can use opks ovulation predictor kits you pee on but they are hard to tell and sometimes confusing and frusterating start charting it takes a little work but you take your morning temp everyday and chart it when you notice your thermal shift is when you ovulate try http www fertilityfriend com i've used that site for years and it's helped me get pregnant several times lol just for an idea of when you might ovulate i'd say counting back from when you are supposed to get your period is ok but this could be way off for many women especially if you have hormone troubles trust me me too and this doesn't work if your cycle is different all the time again me too i could give you sooo many tips but taking charge of your fertiltiy by toni w i have read this is the bible to the site i gave you above use this site it helps and explains a lot and you can compare a lot of other womens charts it's great for obsessing lol Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Ovulation Oral contraceptive Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Puberty Emergency contraception Friends Pregnancy test Estrus cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Electrophysiology Musical mode Ovarian cyst Niddah Social rule Entropy EastEnders Extreme Programming Solar variation Computus Progesterone R.
