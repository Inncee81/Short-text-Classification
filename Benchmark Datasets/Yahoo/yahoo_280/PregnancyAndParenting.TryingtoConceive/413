how soon can you 'feel' pregnant i have had my period every days for the past months my last period started on july th i have not been on birth control for a couple months now sunday night the th i started feeling a lot of uncomfortable pressure in my lower abdomen i brushed it off and later that night early monday morning the th my husband and i had sex and he came in me the next morning i looked at the calendar and saw that i would probably have been ovulating on the th and maybe that's why i had abdominal pressure now days later i have been having some abdominal pain not severe or anything and lower back pain similar to the way i feel when i am on my period but i am not due for my period until august th so could this be a sign of pregnancy or pms im having the same problem with the cramps and my period isnt due till the th or th i feel different also lots of ppl say its too early to tell im not sure myself ive asked a lot of friends of mine and they said they had cramping for awhile then they found out they were preg so we shall see but other ppl are right when they say the signs are very similar to pms time so you just have to wait and see but u can take a preg test days before your missed period goodluck Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Fertility awareness Endometriosis Miscarriage Abdominal pain Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ectopic pregnancy Premenstrual stress syndrome Abortion Pregnancy test Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dialysis Oral contraceptive Stomach cancer Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Charles Darwin's illness Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Group A streptococcal infection Professional wrestling holds EastEnders Fecal incontinence Abortion debate Prostate cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ovulation Equine conformation Abdomen Breastfeeding Gregorian calendar Aortic dissection Grief Knots Landing Sexual reproduction Ovarian cancer Janet Jackson Easter Coeliac disease Friends Kurt Cobain Birth control History of corsets Psoriasis Oral sex Dysmenorrhea Endometrial cancer Spider Cryptorchidism Gonorrhoea Puberty Cramp Liturgical year 2000 Australian Grand Prix Time Out of Mind Autism Polycystic ovary syndrome Big Brother UK series 6 Irish calendar Ovarian cyst Cirrhosis Hepatitis Social rule Hebrew calendar Bowel obstruction Breech birth Appendicitis Vomiting Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Chemical abortion Physical examination Eddie Guerrero Operation Market Garden Sydney Riot of 1879 Month Carpal tunnel syndrome Gynaecology Spina bifida Cephalic disorder Days of our Lives Guinea pig Turner syndrome Mattress Aortic aneurysm Intersex surgery Daylight saving time Ben Johnson (athlete) Childbirth 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Rosa Parks Computus COX-2 inhibitor Nuclear power Angina Birthday Diabetic retinopathy Decompression sickness
