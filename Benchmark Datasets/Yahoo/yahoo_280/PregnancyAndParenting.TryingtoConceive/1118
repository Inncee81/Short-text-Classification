would like to know more about norplants contraceptive and its side effects norplants are contraceptives inserted into the arm for a four to five year period it is said to be safe and can be removed when ever its no longer needed my friend had norplant years ago and she had it in for about years the first year she said it was okay the rods bugged her a lot and her arm would get extremely itchy like an internal itch that couldn't be relieved then around the middle of the second year without her noticing the norplant rods came apart from eachother and one of them drifted and burrowed between her muscle tissue in her lower arm causing extreme pain in her lower back legs and she felt very very sick for months before the doctor noticed that her norplant rods were out of place she got them removed and has horrible scars to show it and it took her almost years to concieve afterwards and yeah she'd also never ever get norplant again even for million dollars if you want a good birth control i suggest getting regular pills that you take every day either that or the shot but it can take up to a year or more to concieve after you've been on the shot for an extended period of time Birth control Fertility awareness Prostate cancer Endometriosis Emergency contraception Menstrual cup Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Acne Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Humerus Stomach cancer Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Menstrual cycle Equine conformation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling holds The Riordans Tocopherol Childbirth Oral contraceptive Condom Depo Provera Pregnancy Intrauterine device Mattress Carpal tunnel syndrome Thermoregulation Puberty Migraine Weight training Breast cancer Mosquito Combine (Half-Life 2) Eye Fox hunting Piccolo Junior Saga Muscle Myocardial infarction Radius (bone) Recumbent bicycle Chronic fatigue syndrome Itch Mandible Spina bifida Occipital bone Scar Coeliac disease Breastfeeding Action potential Androgen insensitivity syndrome Local anesthesia Conjunctivitis EastEnders Days of our Lives Professional wrestling throws Doom enemies Kodocha M16 (rifle) Tyrannosaurus rex Cirrhosis Breech birth Miscarriage Epidural Diazepam Epilepsy Darwin from Insectivorous plants to Worms Hypertension Apollo 8 Sin City Prolactinoma Fast bowling Chernobyl accident Orgasm Pain CGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 Strap-on dildo Soft tissue sarcoma Cystoscopy Insulin Group A streptococcal infection The Inside Aerial (dance move) Decompression sickness Swimming Growth hormone treatment Gonorrhoea Aikido Ectopic pregnancy Human adaptation to space Bruise Multiple sclerosis Folic acid History of intersex surgery Drill bit Scapula Charles Darwin's illness
