clomid without monitoring safe effective my doc has prescribed months of clomid to be taken on days and that's it i do not need to see him again unless i miss my period or the cycles on clomid are over i find it little odd because all this time that i have taken clomid i had follicular monitoring done from days hcg injection iui obviously it did not work those times since then i had laproscopic ovarian drilling done during the surgery both tubes were found blocked so they were repaired further tests showed the surgery successfully opened both my tubes the doc now says that since my ovaries have been drilled i will be able to ovulate on my own further more my tubes are open so i am all fixed and do not further assistance from him but prescribed months of clomid anyway that does not make sense to me especially if i have to take this horrible drug without monitoring i get severe pelvic pain on days each time i take which does not seem to concern him any thoughts hmm i agree but i understand his point of view as he already monitored u b for some months with clomid and already has an idea about how ur body is reacting to it so i believe he put u on clomid just to increase ur chances of conceiving and thinks no need to c him anyway go on the medication but if u feel anything odd u should c him or another doctor hopefully u conceive on the first month good luck Menstrual cycle In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Infertility Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ovarian cyst Ovulation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Endometriosis Ovarian cancer Bipolar disorder Urinary incontinence Stroke Radiation therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Fertility awareness Cancer Fecal incontinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Human chorionic gonadotropin Scientology beliefs and practices Medicine Pregnancy Pharmaceutical company Cryptorchidism Psoriasis Puberty Clinical depression Ectopic pregnancy Osteoarthritis Gynaecology Animal testing Oral contraceptive Myocardial infarction Breastfeeding Lethal injection Traumatic brain injury Mesothelioma Pregnancy test Epidural Pelvic inflammatory disease Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog Orgasm A Course In Miracles Buprenorphine Apollo 8 Consensus decision-making Psychosis Lung cancer Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Prolactinoma Miscarriage Childbirth Osteopathy Epilepsy Spina bifida Drug abuse Migraine Stem cell Transsexuality Ovary Baldness treatments Traditional Chinese medicine Local anesthesia Sleep Adjustable gastric band Sexual differentiation Maprotiline Clomipramine Tuberculosis Acne Growth hormone treatment Cathode ray tube Paget's disease of bone Amiodarone Physician Malaria Diazepam Alternative medicine Antidepressant Rabies Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Gastroparesis The Two Doctors Multiple sclerosis Anabolic steroid Allergy Colorectal cancer Cystoscopy Autism Doxepin Diabetic retinopathy Computed tomography Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus
