how to conceive faster i had a month baby and now i want to have another baby we are trying for month now no chance till now if any one know what to do well sorry to say there is no quick way to have a baby but i do have some good advice if you are worrying about not concieving this can cause stress and prevent it from happening if you have a day cycle then count from the first day of your period this must be a day of full flow not spotting days this brings you to a window of days of being possibly fertile the best was to test this is with an ovulation kit which arent that expensive if you really want a baby test yourself mid afternoon as the hormone that shows you are fertile isnt present first thing in the morning i found this out myself if you want to try without the ovulation kits then you should watch your body signs all woman have these signs when you are approaching your most fertile time you will notice a clear strecthy fluid in your underwear or when you wipe yourself this is the fluid sperm use to travel into the womb and up to the fallopian tubes this therefor indicates your most fertile time when you see a thick yellwy coloured fluid this shows that you are not ovulating as this is the fluid that prevents sperm from enetering your womb this clear stretchy fluid is usually present around the days around a day cycle if you cycle is longer by a few days instead of days move forward a couple of days and watch your natural body signs if your cycle is shorter minus a few days again according to your body signs the egg that is released only lives for between hours or less so i would recommend a ovulation kit to maximise your chances if you do not ovulate in any cycle dont panic a woman doesnt ovulate every month just keep trying oh and not to forget the best possible way to concieve a baby is through the missionary position and thats a fact it aids the sperm easier access to flow into the womb when the female fluid is clear and stretchy most people say egg white but i myself i think it looks like slug trail yuk In vitro fertilisation Ovulation Infertility Emergency contraception Childbirth Puberty Fertilisation Birth control Niddah Female reproductive system (human) Prostate cancer Oral contraceptive Abortion debate Sexual reproduction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) HIV test Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual intercourse Endometriosis Polycystic ovary syndrome Tide Estrus cycle Cryptorchidism Stroke Obstetrics Ovarian cyst Spermatozoon Eye Sperm Whale Abortion Spina bifida Elephant Species Rocky Mountain spotted fever Endometrium Twin Sterilization (surgical procedure) Miscarriage Month Flowering plant Ovarian cancer Time Blood pressure Coeliac disease Menstrual cup Insomnia Orgasm Gonorrhoea Human chorionic gonadotropin Ovum Infantilism Diabetes mellitus Equine conformation Pregnancy test Carpal tunnel syndrome Volleyball Drowning Penis M16 (rifle) Fetal development Sexual abstinence Intersexuality Semen Cancer Social rule Premature birth Biology and sexual orientation Solar eclipse Pneumonia Sleep Testicle Uterus Left-handed Jam (TV series) Action potential Sea-Monkey Liger Multiple birth Homosexuality and medical science Exact solutions in general relativity Chronic fatigue syndrome Earthworm Artificial insemination Mattress Weather lore Intact dilation and extraction Gregorian calendar Friends Ectopic pregnancy
