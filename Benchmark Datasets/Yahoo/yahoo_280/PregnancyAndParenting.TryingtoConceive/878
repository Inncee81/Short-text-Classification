ttc and wondering about clomid my fiancee and i are ttc andi keep hearing about clomid i am going to ask my doctor about it on august at my next doctors appoint that is if i am not already pregnant so i have a few questions what is clomid and how does it work and the other is i ovulated on the st of june and on the th of august i had a pink color in my bodily fluids could this be implantation bleeding that early on also any other tips people have for us ttc clomid tricks your body into thinking you are not producing estrogen by blocking the estrogen recepters in turn you body make more thus making you ovulate you could release more than one egg i was prescribed clomid this cycle after ttc for months it can have a lot of side effects such as vision problems that can be permanent dizziness upset stomach moodyness sore breasts bloating and the worst one of all it can dry up your cervical mucus that you really need for sperm to travel in that is the only side effect i had but it wasn't that bad i took mg dose once a day for days starting on cycle day some women take it starting on day i think it is just up to the doctors they can increase the dose but i think most doctors will only let you take it months in a row you will ovulate anywhere from to days after you take the last pill so it helps to track ovulation by taking your temperature each day and charting it my doctor recommended only having sex every other day because sperm can live up to days inside a woman plus it gives time for your mans sperm count to build back up also read the book taking charge of your fertility it is a great book your doctor probably won't just prescribe clomid without doing some blood work and having your fiancee do a sperm analysis my doctor also wanted me to chart my cycles for a couple of months first i will find out in about days if clomid was successful for us good luck to you Oral contraceptive Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency contraception Ovulation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Infertility Polycystic ovary syndrome In vitro fertilisation Pregnancy Progesterone Psoriasis Endometriosis Breast cancer Estradiol Topiramate EastEnders Estrus cycle Miscarriage Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cancer Prolactinoma Sulfasalazine Gonorrhoea Ovarian cyst Hormone replacement therapy Ovary Breastfeeding Sexual intercourse Common cold Breast Migraine Sexual reproduction Cephalexin Paroxetine Maprotiline Boom Town (Doctor Who) Radiation therapy Jam (TV series) Ovarian cancer Oral sex Yarrow Cystic fibrosis Abortion Ectopic pregnancy Anabolic steroid Endometrial cancer Volleyball Chronic fatigue syndrome Antipsychotic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chemotherapy Dietary fiber Bipolar disorder Abortion debate Friends Malaria Traumatic brain injury Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Orgasm Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Chlorpromazine Stroke Cannabis (drug) Spina bifida Cytomegalovirus Omega-3 fatty acid Semen Social rule Estrogen Diabetic retinopathy Niddah Ovum Depo Provera Fecal incontinence Gastroparesis R.
