should i get my tubes reversed if i feel this guy is the one well i got my tubes ied when i had my dauhter i left thier father after six years and i met this guy that wants to have a baby and spend the rest of his life to me but i feel so scared but i believe him he is so diffrent and want to take the chance but how would i know if he is true to me plus he want to adopt the kids i have know someone please help me decide if i should get them untied to give him a child first of all i'd get married first before you do something drastic like reversing a tubal ligation i'd also advise to stay married to this man for a few years before doing something like that if it works out and you guys still want to have a baby do it if it's not possible adopt and still have him adopt your kids if you do go through with it and you are successful conceiving awesome but have him get a vasectomy next time those are easier to reverse than a tubal ligation good luck Sterilization (surgical procedure) Laura Schlessinger Birth control EastEnders Charmed Stump v.
