still no period i am almost weeks late i was suppose to start like weeks ago yes were trying to get preggo i've taken test and all negative i've used morning pee i'm had cramps bloating some hot flashes and that's it the first day of my last period was june so what do you guys think i should do wait another week and see if my period comes and then go to the doc or go ahead and call to get an apptment i came off of birth control in may would that have anything to do with it i was on bc for years it's not stress i just have a couple of mood swings and tired sometimes ok you could very well be prego and getting false negatives there could be something wrong or i could be because you just came of bc i would make an oppointment then if you get your period cancel it or go anyway and ask question why it could be so late just for peace of mind my personal experience was i went off the pill at the start of march i had been on it for years i missed my next period all together the next came on time if i was still on the pill so did the one after that the last period i had was weeks late but was normal when it came we started trying after that period i was due for my next last monday it still hasn't come and i have done like pregnancy test and all come up neg i'm gonna wait til next monday then go to the doctor because i'll be worried by then so i think the pill can really throw your body out for a few months everyone is different so people take different amounts of time for there body to get back ohn track and for the pill to be completely out of their system c for all i know my cycle could be longer like last mounths could be my normal period and i wasn't late at all if you get me lol who knows so that would make ovulation dates change thus my period wouldn't be due til next monday anyway you are sort of in the same boat being on bc for years maybe just let your body get back to it's 'normal' state sorry for babbling on lol thought my experience my help you make an oppointment anyway for peace of mind good luck hope you are pregnant lots of baby dust to you Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive EastEnders Urinary incontinence The Chemical Brothers Birth control Social rule Time Out of Mind Psoriasis Obstetrics Abortion debate Infantilism Neighbours Pregnancy test Slow Train Coming Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Friends Endometriosis Humphrey Bogart Emergency contraception HIV test Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coeliac disease Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Contender (television series) Miscarriage 2000 Australian Grand Prix Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Oasis (band) AFI 100 Years series STS-62 Apollo 8 Tocopherol Sleep Sharon Tate Piccolo Junior Saga Maya calendar Indianapolis 500 The Inside Stomach cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Prenatal diagnosis 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Jon Secada Ovulation Prostate cancer Theory of conduct Ben Johnson (athlete) Gregorian calendar Hebrew calendar Scientology beliefs and practices Metaphysics The Ashlee Simpson Show The Marshall Mathers LP Alanis Morissette Daylight saving time Heinkel He 100 Bipolar disorder Breech birth The Emancipation of Mimi Billboard Hot 100 Poker jargon In vitro fertilisation Ovarian cancer Days of our Lives Meme English verbs The Death Gate Cycle Premenstrual stress syndrome Time Acne Philosophical skepticism Hall & Oates The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Charmed Knots Landing Roswell UFO incident Game show Milton H.
