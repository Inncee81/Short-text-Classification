im so annoyed and the test says it negative days late and went to the doctor today took a urine test which came back negative but my question is how reliable are the urine tests at the drs are they the same accuracy as hpts should i wait and go in for a blood test never been late before in my life so this is getting frustrating please help yea i am a little over anxious right now but it can be hard when you have been trying for so long and its been the first time with a glimpse of hope for me lol i will wait it out and see but some of you are just straight asses with your answers and should really think about what you are saying before you give advice the doctor's test are more effective than the test you buy at the store i know that for a fact i was three weeks late and still getting negatives on the home pregnancy test went to the doctor and it was a very faint line your only days late that is no big thing you need to wait until your at least days late before you should take a home pregnancy test with both of my kids it took weeks after my missed period before it showed up on a home pregnancy test wait another days and take another test if it's negative then wait another days and take another test if that one is negative and you still haven't started your period then go and get a blood test done i think you jumped the gun by going to the doctor so soon there are so many factors that can cause a period to be late stress is the number one cause along with change in diet or exercise just be patient and wait it out Prostate cancer HIV test Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Drug test Hypertension Stomach cancer Diabetes mellitus Pregnancy test Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Ben Johnson (athlete) Vitamin C Coeliac disease Billboard Hot 100 Shaggy dog story Abortion Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Endometriosis Cytomegalovirus Prolactinoma Miscarriage Anxiety Folic acid False negative Chronic fatigue syndrome Autism Insulin Dieting In vitro fertilisation Veganism Bayesian inference Jackass: The Movie Numerology Hypoglycemia Clinical depression Medicine Tobacco smoking Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Tocopherol Triage Jeopardy!
