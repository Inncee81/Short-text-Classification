ttc doc prescribed vicodin for getting wisdom teeth pulled i have been ttc for about months i was having bad pain im my mouth so i went to the dentist and long story short i had to get wisdom teeth pulled and the doc put me on vicodin and i have been in soo much pain that i have been taking them less then what he prescribed cause im worried that i could be pregnant my period is due today and it has not come yet should i worry about what the drugs could be doing to the baby hi sorry to hear about your pain i hate tooth pain myself i did have a toothache during one of my pregnancies and the ob told me to take only tylenol but up to mg a day which i thought was alot i ended up having a blighted ovum which is another story all together but not caused from the tylenol my neice was given vicodin at the hospital when she was pregnant and it didnt seem to hurt her baby i think if your doc says its ok then it probably is but if you personally feel you shouldn't then don't you will beat yourself up later if something happens hope this helps Pregnancy Breastfeeding Kodocha Hydrocodone Tooth Knots Landing Miscarriage EastEnders Days of our Lives Paracetamol Wisdom teeth History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Vernon Schillinger Psoriasis Mouth ulcer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abortion debate Shaggy dog story Abortion Stomach cancer Carpal tunnel syndrome The Shining (film) Milton H.
