i just want to find out my financee and i are thinking about having a baby well maybe starting next year but my only concern is in high school my doc put me on the pill because i had terrible periods pain like you wont believe that i fainted every time im worried that when i go off the pill now that i will have that back also will my body be used to the day cycle i am on now or will it go back to the cycle i had when i was a teen i dont know if i should go off my pill and see what happens and then if the problems happen then maybe go back on the pill im confused what do you suggest i think if you really want a baby since you have had this problem maybe you could talk to ur gyne about any options they recommend maybe they can give you a pain medication you can take for the days of ur period if thins get bad and then that way you can go off what u are on and get regulated so that ur ovulation is good and ur furtile and have better chances of conception best of luck and maybe let us know what's up Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Ovulation Emergency contraception Birth control Prostate cancer Pregnancy Abortion debate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infantilism Sleep Corporate governance Social rule Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Urinary incontinence Milton H.
