another question sorry ok so if i'm not ovulating how would i or my doctor know they don't like to see you until after a year of trying before running any 'real' tests do they have a test of some sort to see if you actually ovulate i'm just a little bumbed again this month and need some assistance thanks gals pk what's a u s they make you wait a year because there are many factors involved not just ovulation but the thickness of the mucus how many sperm are being ejaculated and if the sperm go the right way there are two ovaries and about the sperm go the wrong way aka to the ovary that doesnt have the egg that month then if the sperm survive all that if they can penetrate the egg or even if there is an egg there they may be too early or too late there is a study out there i forget what book but it says women get pregnant about more times then they realize but no baby or pregnancy is suspected because the body terminates it quickly because it is too damaged in some way i had problems because my cervix is tilted it took us months to conceive plus if you smoke drink what medicines your on and the stress level all effect how a pregnancy will happen so i say relax quit smoking and have fun thats how we got pregnant Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Infertility Miscarriage Birth control Oral contraceptive Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovary Sexual reproduction Ovulation Pregnancy test Childbirth Obstetrics Prostate cancer Fertilisation Female reproductive system (human) Endometriosis Ectopic pregnancy Ovarian cancer Abortion Breastfeeding Polycystic ovary syndrome Urinary incontinence Human chorionic gonadotropin Health issues and the effects of cannabis Tobacco smoking Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ovum Emergency contraception Stomach cancer Coeliac disease Jam (TV series) Premature birth Progesterone Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Endometrial cancer Sexual intercourse Tocopherol Friends Multiple birth Cancer Psoriasis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Folic acid Breech birth Sterilization (surgical procedure) Flowering plant EastEnders Oral sex Prolactinoma Orgasm Teenage pregnancy Chronic fatigue syndrome Gonorrhoea Estradiol Stroke Diabetes mellitus Days of our Lives Twin Cytomegalovirus Colorectal cancer Safe sex Multiple sclerosis Spina bifida Humphrey Bogart Gynaecology Testicle Pornographic movie Bipolar disorder Semen Knots Landing Human sexual behavior Cervix Condom Social rule Cervical cancer Schizophrenia Cystic fibrosis Prenatal diagnosis Asthma Pelvic inflammatory disease Premature ejaculation Guinea pig Edward's syndrome B-47 Stratojet Spermatozoon Hypertension Strap-on dildo Medical analysis of circumcision Niddah Acupuncture Chimera (genetics) Genital wart Episodes of Lost (Season 1)
