for anyone who has used ovulation predictor kit what sort of result did it give you we have been ttc for months now and i bought the kit just to make sure that everything is ok with me i have the strips that you put into a sample of wee for seconds and then in minutes it shows a dark line if you are going to ovulate in the next hours i started to test on day as the kit said and it is now day and nothing yet i know that the experts say that ovulation takes place around day if you have a day cycle can anyone tell me what they found out when using these kits ie what day you ovulate especially if it was not around the usual time the reason i am curious was that when my daughter was conceived years ago we started trying the day before my period i remember it well it was the day we decided to try so am wondering if it is possible that i ovulate at a peculiar time thanks for taking time to read my question i am testing mid afternoon as the tests say that anytime between am and pm is best so though i would go between the two thanks for all your answers so far hi people ovulate at different times of the month i'm currently using opks too today is cycle day and i still don't have a positive though i usually ovulate on day so it isn't unusual if you can keep testing daily until you get the positive once you've isolated that window i think you'll greatly increase your chances of conception and you'll know for the next month too good luck Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Ovulation In vitro fertilisation Polycystic ovary syndrome HIV test Pregnancy Hebrew calendar Social rule Lance Armstrong Ben Johnson (athlete) Apollo 8 Time Flowering plant Oral contraceptive Tour de France Pregnancy test Birth control Dorama $ale of the Century The nature of God in Western theology Sydney Riot of 1879 Daylight saving time Julian day Law School Admissions Test Year Jeopardy!
