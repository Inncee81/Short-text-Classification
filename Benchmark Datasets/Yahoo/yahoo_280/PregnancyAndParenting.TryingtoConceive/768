update bfn ugh a few days ago i thought i was pregnant af had not shown week late and i had symptoms i took two hpts and both were negative yesterday i went to the doctor and got another bfn with the urine test they did a blood test and what do you know another bfn so the doctor prescribed provera day pills and said i could take them as soon as i got the blood results in just to make sure i wasn't pregnant and that's when i called today to get the results anyways i go to the restroom and when i wipe there's a tinge of blood sorry if tmi so looks like af is coming on i guess i really did psyche myself out since i really wanted to be pregnant but i'm glad its coming on by itself instead of having to use the provera i really didn't want to take it so now my question does anybody know of any natural remedies to help with ovulation i looked up primrose oil is that good for ovulation by the way i'm already taking prenatal vitamins for follic acid thanks to all bfn big fat negative the doctor prescribed provera just to get me to start af i've always been regular days since i was when i started i did have a miscarriage in may and had a d c so i'm thinking that could have thrown me off even though i got a period weeks after d c and another one weeks after that this is the first one to be off i'm thinking of trying the opks has that helped anybody and how long did it take to get pregnant using that since af was late you probably ovulated later than you thought you had it happens sometimes especially if you were stressed around the time ovulation normally would have been try charting your basal body temp knowing when exactly you ovulated can help a great deal when it keeps you from wondering when your period is going to know after a few months you will be able to tell an exact date from ovulation and it will help because if you are ovulating later than you thought then you may not be trying so much on the days you should be www fertilityfriend com has more info on charting and will explain how to do it right all you really need is a basal thermometer and a place to keep track of the temps Fertility awareness Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Polycystic ovary syndrome Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obstetrics Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Folic acid Pregnancy test Vitamin C Vitamin Ovulation Stomach cancer Coeliac disease EastEnders Antidepressant The Ashlee Simpson Show Neighbours Slow Train Coming Puberty Acne Human chorionic gonadotropin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Premenstrual stress syndrome Post-traumatic stress disorder Blood on the Tracks Ovarian cyst HIV test Anorexia nervosa Insulin Group A streptococcal infection R.
