could i be prego i had unprotected sex times in a row on july th and in the morning unprotected didn't use the pull out method either my first day of my last period was on july th my period is due on the th and it doesnt really feel like it is coming my nipples feel raw they are soo sensitive to touch i have been having cramps but they don't feel like menstrual cramps like gas i have been moody and oh so forgetful i took a test an it was negative to early my stomach is starting to fell like i have been doing sit ups that tight feeling usually before my period comes i get that white creamy discharge that eventually turns red but the discharge i am getting now is still white but it seems to be thinning out not as thick i also have had a fever for the last couple of nights what do u think i am going to take a test on monday but i am scared f y i i actually went to the emergency room and they tested me cause i had a fever and dehydrated so they test you just to make sure for caution based on when you had sex and the symptoms you are having now i think pregnancy is a good possibility here is a good website with other women's very early pg symptoms www twoweekwait com and you are correct that it was too early to test and that is why you got a neg since there's no way to know exactly what day you ovulated it's hard to say when a test will be very accurate for you but waiting til monday sounds like a good plan be sure to use first morning urine and test using a very sensitive test you can see which ones are most sensitive here www peeonastick com and i know you are scared but just wait and see what the test says either way you are a woman and therefore you are strong and you will make it through either way let us know the results Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Gonorrhoea Breastfeeding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Polycystic ovary syndrome Prostate cancer Obstetrics Pregnancy test Ovulation Dehydration HIV test Endometriosis Birth control Pelvic inflammatory disease Group A streptococcal infection Shaggy dog story Stomach cancer Niddah Drug test Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Human sexual behavior Endometrial cancer AIDS Malaria Condom Menstrual cup Sexual intercourse Ben Johnson (athlete) Explosive material Social rule Ovarian cancer Cytomegalovirus Pneumonia Blonde on Blonde Ocean's Twelve EastEnders Jam (TV series) B-47 Stratojet Sydney Riot of 1879 STS-62 Haloperidol Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Diabetes mellitus Abortion Babe Ruth Milton H.
