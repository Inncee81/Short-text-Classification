pregnancy tests ok this may sound really stupid but i was thinking all of the pregnancy tests say that they are accurate from the day of your missed period but this is assuming you conceived around ovulation i know is the most fertile time but what if you didn't conceive until a couple of day before you period was actually due how long you after your official missed period would you expect to get a positive test sounds like it would be a trick question but not really you have to be ovulating to get pregnant which usually takes place at least a week before you are suppose to get your period so if you ovulated a couple days before you where suppose to get your period then your period wouldn't be late for at least days after you ovulated either way how do you know you ovulated Pregnancy Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy test In vitro fertilisation Polycystic ovary syndrome Infertility Ovulation Estrus cycle Oral contraceptive Friends Emergency contraception Birth control Ovarian cyst Human chorionic gonadotropin Miscarriage Fertilisation Niddah Multiple birth Obstetrics Neighbours Sexual abstinence Sexual reproduction Gonorrhoea Maya calendar Ovarian cancer Abortion Ovary Hormone replacement therapy (trans) HIV test Paul Is Dead Abortion debate Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Prenatal diagnosis Marriage Conifer cones Married... with Children Debugging IBM PC compatible Knots Landing Flowering plant Philosophical skepticism Twin Big Brother UK series 6 Drug test Guinea pig Ovum Breastfeeding Adoption The nature of God in Western theology Eddie Guerrero Female reproductive system (human) Social rule Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Natural family planning Billboard Hot 100 Religion and abortion Gynecologic hemorrhage Kasparov versus The World Carpel Childbirth EastEnders Prosecutor's fallacy Time Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder George W.
