im roughly weks pregnant and everyone says that your boobs will start to hurt im not feeling it is it to early or am i lucky i know with my prior baby i had that around weeks that ended up in a mc though just so you all know i am definately pregnant dr confirmed it i was just curious i just wanted to hide till it was over cause i know it hurts every pregnancy is different i've had a twin pregnancy during which my breasts were never sore and i've had singleton pregnancies during which my breasts were sore heavy tender etc before i even missed my period to clarify weeks pregnant would mean that you ovulated conceived about a week ago as pregnancies are dated in accordance with your last menstrual period or two weeks prior to ovulation if your cycles are long and or it's known when you ovulated so at three weeks pregnant as someone else said you would not yet have missed a period in fact implantation probably would not have occurred yet or would have just occurred and it would be early to have symptoms if it's been three weeks since conception ovulation that would make you five weeks pregnant you may know all this already but i just wanted to clarify a lot of women don't know it and it can create some confusion when talking about how far along you are don't worry about the lack of soreness it means exactly nothing while i worried too at the time i've got two healthy toddlers running around the house who confirm every day that the presence absence of sore breasts means squat best of luck to you Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Breastfeeding Obstetrics Ovulation Emergency contraception Oral contraceptive In vitro fertilisation Cytomegalovirus Abortion Estrus cycle Progesterone Pregnancy test Birth control Twin Polycystic ovary syndrome Puberty EastEnders Ovarian cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Childbirth Folic acid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breast Endometriosis Ovarian cyst Friends One Life to Live Melanie Wilkes Maya calendar Infertility Cephalic disorder Psoriasis Gregorian calendar Human chorionic gonadotropin Ectopic pregnancy Radiation therapy Premenstrual stress syndrome Big Brother UK series 6 Herpes simplex virus Fertilisation Sexual abstinence Niddah Rape Sharon Tate Knots Landing Ovary Breast implant Stomach cancer Breast cancer Prostate cancer Brassiere AIDS Equine conformation Abortion in the United States Gonorrhoea Spina bifida Androgen insensitivity syndrome Stroke Billboard Hot 100 Sexual intercourse Jon Secada Endometrial cancer Britney Spears Pregnancy fetishism Roe v.
