social media is it just hype or is it the real thing the direct marketing association thinks it's the real thing they're even promoting their annual conference on myspace myspace com dma chicago i'm not sure what to think what about you i've been an online networker at a business networking site for just over four years now www ryze com and i get about half of my business clients through that one site but don't be fooled it's not like you throw up a myspace page and suddenly you're swamped with sales there's a lot more to it than that political candidates who use social networking sites remember that they are doing all kinds of things offline to drive traffic online to their page network blog whatever the fact that there was a democratic presidential debate through youtube is a very good sign that this way of getting exposure is for real but it wasn't youtube alone it was youtube in concert with cnn that brought it tons of attention online strategies work better when they are dovetailed with offline strategies if you are just trying to use online strategies because you're trying to do it all on a shoestring budget you should also be doing things like article marketing affiliate programs and more oh and you need to be building relationships with people who will come to trust you over time and then maybe they'll do business with you it works but it's not instant the way i get clients is that people get to know me at my online network i've had for over three years and i've worked very hard to build a sterling reputation and about members once in awhile someone asks me about my services and i refer her to my site the site contains a lot of information about what working with me is like and ends with a questionnaire in which they are told that if they answer i will connect with them by email to schedule a one on one phone or skype meeting to answer their questions tell them my rates etc i'm very clear about that so i don't get a lot of leads but usually by the time i do get leads they are pretty well qualified due to the way that i've written the copy on my site to draw in people who are more likely to be serious about working with me and filter out those who are not all the best denise michaels author testosterone free marketing http www mentoringwithdenise com Skype Social software Internet America Online Plame affair Google MySpace Internet fraud E-mail spam Enterprise content management MoveOn Windows XP Denial-of-service attack Jeff Gannon Voice over IP Electronic commerce Spam (electronic) Phishing Theory of conduct BitTorrent Downing Street memo Live 8 Spyware CompuServe 2005 Philippine electoral crisis Arianne Usenet Social network Instant messaging Web crawler Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus EGovernment AOL Instant Messenger Microsoft Ex-gay BBC Pretty Good Privacy U.S. presidential election, 2008 Legal research Economics Computer-supported collaboration Internet troll Major League Baseball television contracts Customer relationship management LiveJournal Karl Rove Password Extreme Programming The Best Page in the Universe Trillian (instant messenger) The Daily Show Computer virus Cross site scripting Surveillance Limp Bizkit MSN Messenger Privatization National Football League Consensus decision-making Web traffic MTV American Broadcasting Company Online marketing 2000 Australian Grand Prix Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act 2005 Kashmir earthquake Libertarian Party (United States) Donald Rumsfeld Clear Channel Communications Streaming media Independent Media Center Wget Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Proxy server Internet Relay Chat Steam (content delivery) ICQ Software engineering Internet censorship in mainland China HTTP cookie File sharing Peer-to-peer Microeconomics Viral marketing Ann Coulter Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Domain Name System Cindy Sheehan Ultima Online Fox News Strategic management
