hi i am on a l visa could you tell me if it is legal to generate revenue using yahoo or google adsense hi imisidro thanks for the reply i heard that with l we can work only for the employer who sponsored it in that case would it be legal to use my spouse for adsense if you have an l visa and you have ead employment authorization and ssn then you can start a business in the us with adsense or yahoo but if you don't have an ead then you are in a precarious position i suggest you consult your immigration lawyer as to the best possible course of action what you don't want down the road is to have any impediments when you start the process of getting your permanent residency or green card both adsense and ypn gives out tax forms at the end of the year and reports to the irs their publishers income if uscis sees irs record that you have an income from starting a business with your l visa without ead then that may have adverse consequences on your green card application otherwise you can apply to google adsense but not to ypn giving your home country address and information not as someone living here in the us that way google adsense will not send any tax information about your income from adsense to the irs otherwise you can have your spouse who is on l visa to apply for adsense and use their account info instead of you H-1B visa Visa (document) Taxation in the United States Mail-order bride United Kingdom corporation tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tax protester Credit card 401(k) Identity theft Indian nationality law U.S. Internal Revenue Service U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services REAL ID Act Divorce Search engine optimization Plame affair AdSense FairTax Social Security (United States) Internet fraud Marriage Illegal immigration Identity document Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Social Security number (United States) Tax avoidance/evasion Tax Schengen treaty Google search Life insurance Flat tax Home Return Permit National Insurance Income tax Network effect United States Postal Service Passport British nationality law David Blunkett Notary public Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Civil unions in the United Kingdom Consensus decision-making Right of return British national identity card British National (Overseas) - Hong Kong Employer identification number Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks BAE Systems Offshore bank Bank fraud Right of abode Copyleft Appeal Expert system Driver's license Domain Name System Debit card Irish nationality law Progressive tax National identification number George W.
