what is the best way to obtain business partners and customers i am a consultant for a nationally know cosmetics company its the party plan kind of business i am looking for ways to grow my business with new loyal customers and business partners any suggestions p s please don't regard this as spam since i have not included the company name or any further contact information thanks i won't repeat the excellent answer you've already been given above but i've been a speaker at large meetings for consultants of several major party plan companies who offer cosmetics so i totally understand the challenges you face the reason why imho many women keep looking for new new new ways to grow their business and get customers and partners is because they're uncomfortable with what they've been told by their upline they need to do why are they uncomfortable because getting out there and approaching people feels totally foreign and uncomfortable to many women who were raised to wait for people to come to them the result is that we wait for customers to call us the same way we waited for the cute boy in high school history class to call us for a date so if the thought of marketing and selling in your business practically drives you to chocolate read on the truth is in your business there are many ways you can meet new customers in your day to day life but none of them will work if you just feel too uncomfortable or you love meeting and talking with people about your products and your opportunity but you hate asking them for anything a sale to have a party at their home etc marketing and selling is never about us it's about doing something that will appeal to our customers so that they will take the next step and buy from us so if you keep looking for ways to market and sell that are comfortable to you you are making it about you it's not it's about the customer the minute we try to make it about us it fails i'm the author of a popular myth shattering book that's all about the mars venus reasons why women have so many challenges when it comes to marketing and selling now that we are starting businesses at double the rate of men it all boils down to making different conscious choices and coming out of your comfort zone because your business growth won't happen any faster than your personal growth what does this mean it means that every time you say ooh i couldn't do that you are slowing down the potential growth of your business my experience after mentoring over women and men in marketing is that women keep looking for new ways to get customers not because the way they were told didn't work but because it made them uncomfortable i'm not suggesting anything out of integrity here for many women just walking up and initiating a conversation is mortifying to them when i get a new client for my marketing mentoring practise i ask my prospective clients about their business and what they want to achieve i also answer all their questions about what the process of marketing mentoring is like my fees etc towards the end of the conversation i ask them five questions they are always the same five questions and those five questions result in a yes and a new client about percent of the time that's an closing rate which anyone experienced in sales will tell you is amazingly good especially for an expensive service because those five questions are so effective i've never changed them do i like those questions the first three i like i love hearing people's answers i've grown a little bored with the questions but it's not about me my client hasn't heard those questions before and that's all that matters the last two questions i have to take a deep breath and pull up my courage a bit before i ask because i'm asking for a yes i know i have about an probability of a yes but still a possibility of a no and nobody wants to hear a no so does it make me a little uncomfortable sure would my business practise go down in the number of clients and hence revenues if i didn't ask those last two questions you bet so increasing your confidence level especially as a woman is one of the very best ways to increase your number of customers because all the things you've been told to do will work become effortless and you start saying wow this really works it was just me who wasn't working it all the best denise michaels author testosterone free marketing get the book at http www tfmbook com http www mentoringwithdenise com Milton H.
