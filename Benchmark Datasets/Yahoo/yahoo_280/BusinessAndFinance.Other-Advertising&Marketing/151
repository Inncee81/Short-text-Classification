make any difference what kind of business you have or want to have every business is a people business the exact same qs each of my mentors asked me i m going to ask you in return you must be honest with yourself who knows you better than you no one except y o u you who knows your habits better than you no one except y o u you who knows what your wants needs dreams and desires are better than you no one except y o u you who knows what you like and dislike better than you no one except y o u you as you can see i took the liberty of answering the questions for you am i right i would like to inform you what possibly not to do then what you should do then you should be able to make your decisions and proceed from there don't fax every person you know or met about your services its not necessary many people know who you are and what you do don t they don t be a pest or don t make a pest of yourself don't text message folks for the same reasons don't use direct mail to promote your service some time ago i read a statistic which may or may not be true today for every piece of direct mail a company or an individual sends only in will respond to that direct mail promotion at today's postal rates st class that's you could use for other purposes that's the cost just for postage for the response this does not include the cost of buying the stationery and envelopes toner etc just to get the appointment is in about your costs are accelerating aren't they and you still don't have a sale it takes about piece of direct mail to generate appointment it takes about to direct mail pieces to get just one appointment all the way to writing the oreer that's about to before you see one dollar not to mention your time spinning your wheels wasting your time you haven't made the sale yet don't lease or spend notice i didn't write invest your hard earned money for a piece of equipment with automatic phone dialing and recording speaking features telling folks about your specials and services do you like getting those telemarketing calls do you like or mind getting any telemarketing calls if i haven't discouraged you we'll move on to the grey area cold canvassing its a terrific way to meet people face to face one on one it requires going to the same places and offices about once every two weeks or even more frequently to save yourself some time you may have to make a presentation in front of a nice group of folks just for them to see you're a real live breathing cooperative knowledgeable individual you know your product you know how to solve various situations problems which arise on a regular basis when you don't know how to solve those problems you know what hoops and hurdles you have to jump over under around and through to speak with the right person to get the answers and solutions to make your sales the above are the don'ts here are a couple dos a very long time ago probably over years ago my dad went to a seminar presented by elmer wheeler when my dad came home he took a plain piece of white paper and a black crayon and wrote in big letters don t sell the steak sell the sizzle when i sell the sizzle the steak will sell itself he put it on the night table on his side of the bed he looked at it day and evening he did the same with other sayings he discovered or created he put them on either side of the medicine chest in the office in his cars and other places btw dad the old man as my three younger brothers and i affectionately refer to him is years young still works almost every day not because he has to but because he wants to he loves his work working with young people helping them become successful in many aspects of the real estate business and so do his sons with the work and careers each aspired to your product is the sizzle you are the steak you have to be able to effectively and enthusiastically tell folks what is so terrific about your product and why they should buy it from y o u and what about the cost of your business cards do you think you can cut corners and make a good impression with those thin flat lifeless computer generated cards please do yourself a huge favor invest your time to sit down and properly design your business cards if you aren't sure please go to a professional printer or graphic arts store and ask for help and guidance those folks should amaze you with ideas and concepts in the long run good professionally printed business cards with raised lettering and features go a long way to show others you care about yourself about your business and about your clients when you leave a client customer all your contacts customers and clients have left are two things good bad or indifferent the impression you left your business card don't you think it makes good sense to invest your money in a good quality business card have your cards professionally printed invest you time and money joining local groups with the same interests you have be active examples do you like to watch birds join and be active in a bird watching group club society etc do you like to quilt do the same bake do the same love going to church temple or mosque do the same get on committees get to be known as a can do type of person you should have fun and yes some aggravation too you should make some friends and begin building your client base you should get leads and look how much time money and aggravation you'll save lots as the saying goes build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door what the saying doesn't tell anyone or even mention is you must get out there and let the world know about that better mousetrap you must do it tactfully and tastefully i wish you well vty ron b Surveillance Extreme Programming Internet fraud Enterprise content management
