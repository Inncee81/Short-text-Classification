does anyone have experience with agloco i just came across this website www agloco com has anyone been with them for more then a month any experience i should i know about before even considering a trial looks like a 'advertising driven' web browsing 'tracker' with some element of pyramid selling 'referrals' basically it claims to only monitor your browsing activity and only reports that it's like having some one look over you shoulder as you browse i guess some people are comfortable with that however it seems the term 'toolbar' is intended to put users at ease in reality it's a full blown application that has full access to your system and has direct access to the internet i e bypasses the browser to report home so if you are ok with installing something that might be a little more aggressive at monitoring your pc's use for example it might be logging your every keystroke go ahead see link looks like the initial 'toolbar' app was a bit flaky Spyware Mozilla Firefox Windows XP Internet Explorer Mozilla Application Suite Kazaa Emacs Opera (web browser) World Wide Web Search engine optimization BitTorrent Phishing Web traffic Comparison of web browsers Browser Helper Object Netscape Browser Gmail Windows 2000 Web browser Tabbed document interface Website Malware Google Pop-up ad Internet privacy Cascading Style Sheets Wireless Application Protocol Web accessibility Web application Mac OS X America Online Internet Explorer for Mac Web crawler Uniform Resource Locator Timeline of computing 1990-forward User interface HTTP cookie Broadband Internet access Ajax (programming) Proxy server Internet Explorer shell Domain Name System Object Desktop Password Neopets Python programming language E-mail spam Atari ST AOL Instant Messenger Google search Macintosh Finder Microsoft Web design Enterprise content management History of the Internet PlayStation Portable TikiWiki Steam (content delivery) Damn Small Linux Macromedia Flash Netscape Communications Corporation Wiki Microsoft Windows Server XML United States v.
