what types of advertising have i not tapped i am a salesman at a car dealership in a small town we sell high end cars and have alot of different brands and models so it's hard to keep a huge selection in stock it's a blue collar town and we sell the most expensive gm vehicles available so we end up selling alot of used cars vs new we are also right on a major interstate so we get lots of highway traffic my question is assuming that i have all the basics in place longstanding dealership good salespeople good prices etc what type of advertising have we not thought of we have done all the silly mailers and the huge purple gorilla on the roof approach but we are looking for more reality based advertising i was thinking of crazy ideas but wanted to know if anyone had any suggestions assuming that i can't control what the factory offers i e special financing like zero percent that i can't give away thousands of dollars to every customer i e free gas for three years jeez and assuming that nothing is really free free ipod with every car dealers are happy to try and fool you into thinking that but it's never free then what do i do other than start selling junk hyundais thank you for the responses but if you can't answer the question don't just take the opportunity to tout your exploding korean junk in my american made general motors face thank you on with the answers i am looking for something unique and of course my advertising strategy is direct and honest i established that this is what our business has been founded on in the small town for the past years i need something unique that we could maybe do semi anually that has nothing to do with selling cars something that the people of a small town will look forward to every year that would be perfect keep in touch with current customers if someone bought a car years ago go ahead and give them a call see if they are in the market again since most people have cars you may hit them at the right time or maybe just before they realize they want a new car do the mailers you may not want to do this but i thought is was a good idea once before a car lot gives a customer who buys a new car a few coupons with their name on it if they give these out to their friends and they come and test drive a car you send them if they buy a car you send them they could give the cards to friends who just come buy to test drive a car so they can get the money but isn't much and it gives you chance to talk to them put them on a mailing or call list i hate big gimmick's myself makes a company look worse then it is like you just want to get the money while selling junk if you're selling higher end cars huge purple gorillas just don't tell me your high end you have to look and advertise on the higher market if you want their business if the cars and trucks are pricey higher class then you need to up promotion to be higher class target those who did buy the cars and ask those people what sold them to your dealership and use that approach to sell more Ford Motor Company Wayne Corporation Mutual fund Microeconomics Advertising Insurance Marketing Illegal drug trade Yugo Sport utility vehicle IPod Bond Internet fraud Direct marketing Chrysler Corporation Edsel Asian financial crisis Citigroup Poker jargon Hyundai Motor Company Toyota Prius Audi Sales promotion Best Buy Sears Holdings Corporation Daewoo Tesco Taxicab Hybrid vehicle Automobile BMW Filling station Inflation Neopets Price discrimination Arbitrage Sales Mercedes-Benz Economics Tariff Chevrolet Camaro Toyota Camry Commodore International $ale of the Century Manual transmission Rules of the road Credit card 2000 Australian Grand Prix Apple Computer Make money fast Monopoly (game) Anonymous remailer AvtoVAZ Bank Wal-Mart Vehicle registration plate Capital accumulation Dodge Charger PE ratio Berkshire Hathaway The Apprentice 2 Volkswagen Honda Apple Macintosh Public transport Game show Google Major League Baseball television contracts Life insurance IBM PC compatible Floppy disk Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Stock E-mail spam Gross domestic product Enron Corporation Studebaker Privatization Hyundai Motor Group Mad Money Truck Monetary policy Keynesian economics John De Lorean George Costanza Predatory lending Amway Craps Mazda
