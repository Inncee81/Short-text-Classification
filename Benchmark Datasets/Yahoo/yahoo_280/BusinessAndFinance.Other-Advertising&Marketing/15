how can i get a list of a lot of e mails from anywhere preferred us i need to advertise personal products so are any databases available for leads as they call it there are several 'prospect' or lead companies however be very careful many of these companies recycle the same lists over and over again also because of the spam laws etc emailing people that did not originally request your information can bring you some trouble as well if you want to sell products to a group try a website or advertise on an already established site if you want to get your message out to the masses i do not think spamming is the best way to do it beware of leads for sale market your product and generate sales from that interest i wish you well E-mail spam Direct marketing CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 Spam (electronic) Advertising Viral marketing E-mail Google Telemarketing Stopping e-mail abuse Advance fee fraud Gmail Search engine optimization Spam Prevention Early Warning System Messaging spam Internet forum Customer relationship management Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Usenet Web traffic Electronic mailing list Blog Video game publisher Marketing Spamdexing Google search Database marketing Make money fast Facebook (website) SpamAssassin Mozilla Application Suite Internet pornography Trademark Bulk mail Pharmaceutical company 2channel Intranet Sender Policy Framework Neopets Network effect Management Spyware The Internet Movie Database LiveJournal Commodore International Webmail DNSBL Canter & Siegel Mozilla Thunderbird Spam (food) Political campaign Privacy Spam (Monty Python) SINA.com Sanford Wallace Open mail relay Genealogy Opera (web browser) Phishing Email authentication Anonymous remailer Mobile phone spam Microsoft Outlook New Coke Surveillance Illegal drug trade IBM The Cluetrain Manifesto HTTP cookie America Online Sales force management system Coca-Cola Ford Motor Company Link spam Hashcash Alternate reality game Real estate broker Boca Raton, Florida Citigroup Life insurance American Motors Bayesian filtering Computer virus Quackery Web bug Electronic Frontier Foundation Affiliate marketing Xerox RKO Pictures Tobacco advertising Wal-Mart Pyramid scheme Marketing research Chrysler Corporation Best Buy UK Singles Chart Mydoom
