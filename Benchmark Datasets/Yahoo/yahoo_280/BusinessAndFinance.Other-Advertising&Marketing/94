why has advertising become so boring excellent question in short blame the colleges that are churning out marketing executives who end up working on the client side of things it used to be that there was a kind of mystique to advertising a skill that only some could do well in the same way that only some people can write great songs or tell a joke well now every marketing grad thinks not only that they can do it but that they know what works best so instead of letting the really talented people at the agencies get on it with it they end up putting themselves in the process directing the ideas along and most often ruining them in the process don't even get me started on the reliance on consumer insight focus groups those rooms full of ordinary folk who are given some sandwiches to snack on and asked to evaluate the ads before they go on the air it's an unreal environment we don't sit at home thinking hmm that typography could be different and i would like this ad more or perhaps a dog in this commercial would make it more likeable it's all contributed to ruining the good ideas that are out there The Apprentice 2 Advertising Advertising agency Citigroup Philosophy of language Theory of conduct Leadership Star Trek: Enterprise Milton H.
