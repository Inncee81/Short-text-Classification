how do i pre populate a dating site i want set up a dating site for london singles between the ages of to i need to pre populate the site as i would imagine people will only join the site if there are people already on it hi again john yes you have a very valid point because people will not keep returning to an empty site look at the age groups and male female needs etc you will then need to give away membership to promote this i would also offer lifetime membership as you find people will put more in if you say a free year then people lose interest whereas with lifetime membership they will promote the group etc and if they meet up with people then you obviously wouldn't have to replace them then if you was active guess you will need at least to make the website interesting and searchable also not sure why you are concentrating on london you should be looking for assoc people throughout the uk Democratic Party (United States) John Birch Society Commonwealth of Nations Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Copyright Athenian democracy Theory of conduct Wheel of Fortune Enlargement of the European Union Sudoku Annuity Oyster card Church of Scientology Doomsday argument Constitution of India Demographics of the United States Courtship Independence Party (Iceland) International Freedom of Expression Exchange John Coltrane Slot machine Suharto History of the European Union Indian nationality law Facebook (website) International Olympic Committee The Pet Sounds Sessions Autograph Religion Euro Referendum Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Swinging Transgender Kasparov versus The World Jon Secada European Union MetaFilter Second Life Star Alliance Condom Corporation Lucio Guti__rrez Indigenous peoples George W.
