what is the best approach when presenting a product or service to a potential client face to face direct mail or something else please explain why it is best thanks for instance let's say a person owns a business and wants to get their business noticed by their target customer client would it likely be better to try to call and contact potential clients by phone or send them information through the mail every option has its plus and minus point in effectiveness and cost consideration there is no single best approach generally it all depends on what type of product or services you want to sell here's what you should identify first who is your market is it end consumer or businesses how many are they millions hundreds what type of product do you sell technical or non technical what is the pricing level high in thousands couple of dollars what is the margin very high or very thin face to face is very effective but it is very inefficient to do face to face sales for a non technical product with a thin margin that costs only a couple of bucks to thousands of consumer in one week e mail is better in this case generally face to face is the best but with a heavy cost mail is less effective but is the most cheapest and can reach a higher number of prospects any other methods are in between hope this helps Microeconomics Customer relationship management Monopoly Tax E-mail spam Marketing Management Citigroup Internet fraud Direct marketing Labour economics United States Postal Service Gross domestic product Mergers and acquisitions Value added tax Illegal drug trade Privatization Monetary policy Advertising FairTax Public good Pharmaceutical company Information Services Procurement Library Wal-Mart Insurance Call centre Tesco Broadband Internet access Business process reengineering Economics Bulk vending Inflation Price discrimination Marketing research Investment bank ITunes Music Store Relationship marketing Outsourcing Welfare economics Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Transformer Identity theft Computer and video game industry CompuServe Profit maximization Network effect Financial services Sales Voice over IP Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Phishing Progressive tax Stopping e-mail abuse Tariff Subscription business model Digital photography Verizon Wireless Primerica Financial Services MMORPG Amway Enterprise resource planning Rational Unified Process Microsoft Office Principal-agent problem Solar cell Telemarketing United Kingdom corporation tax Airline Strategic management Law of value Monopsony Dot-com Denial-of-service attack Gmail Database marketing Intellectual property Enterprise content management Loyalty business model Credit card Sales force management system Pyramid scheme Stock market CPU design Marketing mix Nuclear weapon design Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Short selling Real estate broker Productive and unproductive labour Hydrogen economy FidoNet Capitalism Future energy development Measures of national income and output
