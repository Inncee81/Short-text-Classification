i am opening an advertising company and i need to know something would small to medium sized companies want to advertise their logo in a very large mall their logo would be seen by tens of thousands of people per week if so what would be a good price to charge them the value is very low in my opinion while my logo would be seen by potentially hundreds a day the attention factor is missing they may not know what i do or why they should do business with me i can only presume anyway as i do not know fully how you are implementing this idea i place a higher value on advertising that is response oriented rather than awareness because it generates far greater results if you could find a way to integrate that element into what you are doing placing a small caption under logo ask for our brochure inside and take advantage of this months special you will be able to justify a higher fee if someone were walking by and saw my logo and had a moment of curiosity about it i would want some way for them to act on it right then Logo Apple Computer Quebec general election, 2003 Advertising ITV Intel CPU design Airline CPU cache Marketing Management MMORPG Broadband Internet access Sexual orientation Unemployment Montreal London Congestion Charge Gas metal arc welding Inflation Nuclear fusion Management information system Home Box Office Chernobyl accident Insurance Strategic management Action potential Am730 Fusion power Internet fraud Hash table Extreme Programming UK Singles Chart Normal distribution Blockbuster Video Wal-Mart Monopoly Eaton's Joseph Louis Lagrange Network effect Central processing unit Cable television Urban sprawl Sears Holdings Corporation Digital Equipment Corporation Google Welding Supply and demand RKO Pictures Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Resident Evil: Apocalypse Filling station Tesco RISC Micropayment FedEx Corporation Short selling Digital photography Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Best Buy Predatory lending Education in the People's Republic of China Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Compiler optimization Tennessee State Constitution North American Numbering Plan Publicly funded medicine Amiga Power Corporate governance DVD Pebble bed reactor Philo Spacecraft propulsion Scientology beliefs and practices Pretty Good Privacy Television in the United States Mutual fund Web traffic BBC Tesco Ireland Pharmaceutical company Person Education in Portugal Food and Drug Administration Integrated circuit Laserdisc Cascading Style Sheets Arbitrage Freedom of speech Transformer Taxation in the United States Trademark Dot-com Democracy Tobacco advertising Mercedes-Benz __lectricit__ de France Credit card Economic inequality Open source culture Keynesian economics
