is it worth making a spreadsheet for my ebay stock i was thinking of making a spreadsheet with colour size price of purchase rrp selling price etc to keep track of my ebay items even before i put them up for sale do you think it would be worth it or would it just be a waste of time i already keep a written book but that is only for items taht have sold and only includes a short description of the item and the rest is just to keep track if the buyer has paid etc i think it's a great idea and one that you should implement as a backup to your written log it is very easy to do and you can edit on the fly as needed it is also an easier way to track your profits and something you can utilize in the event of an irs audit Auction Microeconomics Arbitrage IBM PC compatible Day trading Supply and demand Tax Amazon.com Internet fraud FairTax Wal-Mart Dot-com Put option Enron Corporation Ashton-Tate Monopoly (game) Islamic banking Electronic commerce Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Taxation in the United States Economics Lotus Improv Oil-for-Food Programme Option Enterprise content management Option style Microsoft The Apprentice 2 Call option Price discrimination Abebooks RuneScape economy Bulk vending Short selling Keynesian economics Apple Macintosh Topps Commodity markets Borland Live 8 Commodity BC Rail Suggested retail price MMORPG Neopets Textbook Stock Illegal drug trade World of Warcraft Network effect Mutual fund Atari ST Ayumi Hamasaki Spreadsheet Inflation Investment bank First-sale doctrine Privatization Political economy Comiket Berkshire Hathaway Xerox Star Apple II family Konfabulator Lionel Corporation Philatelic investment Halliburton The Wealth of Nations Use case Employee stock option Free market Argos (retailer) Great Depression Vending machine Tesco Hyperinflation OpenDocument RuneScape skills Virtual economy My Little Pony ITunes Music Store Warren Buffett Stock market Security (finance) The Long Tail American individualist anarchism Derivative (finance) Windows Server 2003 Online auction business model J Sainsbury Costco Quattro Pro Citigroup Futures contract Management information system Visual Basic Monetary policy Loss leader Deflation (economics)
