what job would u preffer me to have i want to make a big amount of money by doing little work n don wanna hav a lot of stress don't we all but good luck finding that job to get something like that you'd have to be extremely talented or lucky or work real hard for a few years to save off for the dream job just can't help you don't think you are being reasonable in what you want instead of going about looking for something this way i'd suggest thinking instead about what you truly love doing and looking to somehow find a job along those lines ie doing what you love if you succeed you probably won't be so stressed you eventually will make alot of money if you keep at it and while you will have to do alot of work you won't really mind since this is something you love doniig best luck Game show Jon Secada Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Pitaten Avenue Q Luck Unemployment Baseball Stars Craps Care Bears Social rule The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Phoebe Buffay's songs Characters in the Smurfs Spice Girls Inflation Max Martin Press Your Luck Hip hop collaborations Oh My Goddess!
