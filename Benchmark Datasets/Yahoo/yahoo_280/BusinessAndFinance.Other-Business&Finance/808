any info on the switch from uk accounting standards to international accounting standards i'm doing an essay on the change from uk gaap to ifrs and was wondering if anyone had any info on this regarding intangible assets and goodwill as far as i can see both standards are the same and its really annoying me that i cant find any differences if anyone's got company examples that'd really help ifrs uk main differences indicator pls click on the link below goodwill is not amortised under ifrs instead ias requires an annual impairment review which should take place at the same time each year not necessarily the year end although if there is a trigger event subsequent to an impairment test being performed on goodwill then the impairment test must be updated uk gaap requires a review of goodwill at the end of the first full year after acquisition but then only requires such reviews when there has been a trigger event or where goodwill is amortised over more than years or carried indefinitely without being amortised where acquired entities are merged with existing operations frs requires calculation of the internally generated goodwill of the pre existing operation to facilitate a more accurate assessment of whether acquired goodwill has been subsequently impaired there is no similar requirement in ias a wider range of intangible assets are recognised under ifrs particularly in respect of business combinations see ifrs page under both ifrs and uk gaap an intangible asset is an identifiable non monetary asset without physical substance under ias an asset is identifiable when it is separable that is capable of being sold separate from the entity or arises from contractual or other legal rights under frs the assets have to be capable of being disposed of separately from the business frs requires an internally generated intangible to have a readily ascertainable market value before it can be recognised ias allows internally generated assets to be recognised provided they meet criteria similar to those contained within ssap for development costs internally generated brands mastheads publishing titles customer lists and similar items cannot be recognised as they cannot be distinguished from the development of the business as a whole ias does not contain a rebuttable presumption that the useful economic life of an intangible asset is years or less whereas frs does although both standards state that an intangible asset can have an indefinite life and if this is the case they need not be amortised both ifrs and uk gaap require annual impairment reviews for intangible assets with an indefinite life the requirements differ for intangible assets with a finite life ias only requires an impairment review if there is an indication of impairment whereas frs additionally requires an annual impairment review where the year useful life presumption is rebutted ias also requires an annual impairment review for an intangible asset that is not yet ready for use under ias research costs must be written off as incurred whereas development costs should be capitalised where particular criteria are met this contrasts with ssap where an entity may choose to capitalise development costs International Financial Reporting Standards Intellectual property Asset United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Trademark Inventory Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Vodafone Security (finance) Corporation Financial audit Corporate governance Insurance Microsoft Divorce Goodwill Contract Copyright law of the United Kingdom Windows 2000 Nuclear power Leasing Strategic management Mortgage Capitalism Corporate finance Capital asset Warner Music Group Depreciation Finance Mutual fund Tax Asperger syndrome Service Productive and unproductive labour Mergers and acquisitions Institutional fund management Islamic banking Manitoba Hydro Opportunity cost Intellectual capital Capital accumulation FairTax Political economy Intelligent design Trust (Law) USA Information Technology Infrastructure Library UK Singles Chart General aviation Monetary policy Publicly funded medicine Air traffic control Information Services Procurement Library Reliability engineering Xerox Income statement Law of value British nationality law Bank Clinical depression Surplus value Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Monopoly Geographic information system Autism Hypoglycemia PDP-11 Lloyd's of London Growth hormone deficiency Gold standard Information warfare Trade union Indigenous peoples Albert Medal Instrument flight rules CPU cache Constitution BAE Systems Accountancy Life insurance Digital photography Plame affair Drug test Sun Microsystems
