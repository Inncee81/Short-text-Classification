how does a wholesale auto dealer make money how do they make money by only selling to other dealers also is there anyway to sell to a retail buyer in or out of state can a wholesale dealer export cars out of the country thanks for any info a wholesale auto dealer makes money the same way as everyone else they are buying the vehicles cheaper than they are selling them for instance they may be buying cars in bulk from a supplier such as a rental car company and then fixing all of the scratches dents and dings and selling them on to small dealerships which don't have the buying power and only buy used cars at a time a car dealership can sell to retail buyers out of state but it can be a bit tricky sometimes as the license title and finance laws can vary from state to state if you are near the state line it probably makes sense to find out the details and obtain the paperwork to sell in a nearby state but that is allot of work for a state across the country where you may only sell cars not much experience in exporting but i don't see why it couldn't be done i know some countries are allot more restrictive than others for imports Illegal drug trade Price discrimination Wayne Corporation Arbitrage Auto insurance Bulk vending GM Daewoo Inventory Tax Wal-Mart Trade Grey import vehicles Microeconomics Toyota Prius American Motors Cerritos, California Value added tax De Lorean Motor Company Internet fraud Studebaker Automobile Real estate broker Security (finance) US and Canadian license plates Sport utility vehicle Schwinn Bicycle Company Islamic banking Hybrid vehicle First-sale doctrine Daewoo Supply and demand Grey market Leasing Predatory lending Stock Yugo Capitalism Berkshire Hathaway Filling station Studebaker Lark Cadillac Bretton Woods system Carl G.
