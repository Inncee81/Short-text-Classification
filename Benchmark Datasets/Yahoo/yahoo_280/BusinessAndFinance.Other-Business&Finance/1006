in an accepted draft for documents against acceptance what are the collecting bank's responsilities this question is related to the different modes of payment in the international trade transaction the question is raised since most banks claim that the collecting bank's role being an agent bank is just to relay the message of the importer and to remit funds when payment is made by the importer collecting agent banks have no obligation to force the importer to pay or settle its obligation to the exporter even if the importer has already claimed the goods imported it sounds like you may be refering to terms in a letter of credit most companies that do business on letters of credit require a confirmed irrevocable l c the importer does not get his merchandise until all the terms of the l c are satisfied the short version is the importer opens the l c in favor of his vendor the vendor ships the merchandise and presents the confirming read as collecting bank with all the documents necessary to fulfill the l c these documents include a bank draft payable at sight of the documents the confirming bank examines the documents to insure they comply with the l c and then advises the opening bank the importer's bank whether or not the documents are clean or discrepant the opening bank wires funds to the confirming bank provided the documents are clean and the confirming bank pays your draft while all this is going on the confirming bank has forwarded the original documents to the opening bank the most important document is the transportation bill of lading as that is legal title to the cargo once the importer has paid the opening bank he receives the bill of lading and he can then calim his merchandise from the carrier a letter of credit is a method of financing and is not a guarantee of payment to anyone a l c does not deal with the actual goods materials or services they deal with the paperwork and documents called for in an international transaction Insurance Letter of credit Bank Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Contract Life insurance Annuity Mortgage Bretton Woods system Economy of Russia Article One of the United States Constitution Bond Tax United Kingdom corporation tax Credit card Trust (Law) USA Security (finance) Internet fraud Advance fee fraud Islamic banking Microeconomics Mail SCO-Linux controversies Money Legal tender Monetary policy United States Postal Service Gross domestic product Bill of lading Derivative (finance) Financial markets Economy of India Health insurance Credit card fraud Collateralized debt obligation Corporate governance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair E-mail spam Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Gold standard Balance of payments Investment bank Fractional-reserve banking Bank fraud Primerica Financial Services Finance GNU General Public License Economics Copyleft Quarantine OpenDocument Octopus card Corporation Value added tax Financial audit Offshore company Financial services Constitution of Ireland Government debt Automated Clearing House Student loan Surveillance Corporate finance Accounts payable Banknote Great Depression Air New Zealand Public domain Institutional fund management Leasing Debt Mutual fund Economic relations of Japan Anarchism and capitalism Publicly funded medicine Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Futures contract History of the United States Constitution Tax protester Stock Nuclear proliferation Capital accumulation Trade Electronic commerce Notary public Bank of China (Hong Kong) United Parcel Service Personal finance Data retention William Wakefield FairTax Social Security (United States) Oil-for-Food Programme
