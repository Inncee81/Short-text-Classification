cash advance how much will it cost me i am currently in oxford england for one month and am down to like pounds cash i also need euros for my trips to france etc the option i see is using either my mastercard or visa each have about annual interest rate to withdraw cash roughly dollars canadian or pounds or euros my parents will deposit what i withdraw into my credit card so i am really just interested in how much interest i would accumulate at like a week period can i also tell my credit card company not to use the money that my parents deposit towards purchases made but instead only towards the cash advance are there any other options that i have actually i just read that my visa gold has a cash advance rate but i am unsure if that is daily weekly annually etc a solid number would be very helpful oops sorry cash advance for visa gold and for mastercard yes i know annually means yearly but i got confused when reading the explanation visa gives for their calculations of interest we calculate interest daily however we only add it to your visa account monthly the amount of interest we charge is calculated as follows we multiply the amount you owe each day by the applicable daily interest rate or rates that is the applicable annual interest rate or rates divided by the number of days in the year and for each month we add together the interest charges for each day the total is the interest we charge you http www rbcroyalbank com cards documentation ch agreements ch agreement html no you can't tell the credit card company to use the money your parents deposit towards the cash advance only the credit card companies will charge you that cash advance interest as long as they possibly can so until you pay off all charges up to and including the cash advance fee you're still going to be charged that horrible cash advance interest rate it might be cheaper to just have your parents wire you the money directly Debit card Octopus card Interest Euro Bank Money Life insurance Bond Student loan Mortgage EFTPOS Taxation in the United States Internet fraud Social Security (United States) Insurance Personal finance United States dollar United Kingdom corporation tax Currency Mutual fund Deflation (economics) Hyperinflation MasterCard Auto insurance Derivative (finance) Tax Pound sterling Electronic money Virgin Mobile Poker jargon Citigroup Credit card fraud The Amazing Race Visa (document) Microeconomics Legal tender Futures contract Certificate of deposit United States Postal Service Inflation 401(k) Variable universal life insurance Automatic teller machine Dividend Money supply Economy of Russia Fractional-reserve banking Predatory lending Smart card Money creation Slot machine Corporate finance Wheel of Fortune Advance fee fraud Exponential growth Wal-Mart Actuarial notation Food Stamp Program Finance Margin (finance) Short selling National Insurance E-ZPass Arbitrage No Child Left Behind Act Annual percentage rate Social Security debate (United States) Oyster card SCO-Linux controversies VISA (credit card) Welding Individual Savings Account Stock Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Liberty Dollar Computer Bretton Woods system Taxation in the Republic of Ireland $ale of the Century Monopoly (game) Corporation Capital accumulation Universal life insurance Enron Corporation Television licence Immigration to the United States Salary cap Aldi Security (finance)
