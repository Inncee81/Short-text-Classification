finance calculation lease vs purchase hi i'm reading this finance book and as an exercise they have this question about purchasing vs leasing somehow i'm confused with the pv concept here's the question you're considering buying an asset that has a three year life and costs as an alternative to buying the asset you can lease it for year four annual payments first due on the day you sign the lease if you can borrow from your bank at should you buy or lease the answer is lease the pv of the lease option is pv for excel readers but what i don't understand is the concept behind the pv in this case the purchase will cost you while the lease will cost you at least how come the answer is lease if you have to borrow the at then the buying will cost you more this is kind of a ridiculous scenario what has a three year life that would be that expensive let's look at a real life scenario where you buy a car at versus leasing something at a year even if you pay more during the lease time the lessor is left with nothing at the end of the lease while the buyer actually has a car that's worth probably around my advice if you're in the market for something that costs and is not going to be worth anything in years i have some nice swamp land in florida that you should have a look at cheers Microeconomics Islamic banking Futures contract Personal finance Stock Intermediate consumption Mutual fund Deflation (economics) Tax Debt Annuity Student loan Cost of capital Option Inflation Supply and demand Rational pricing Consumption of fixed capital Hyperinflation Insurance Corporate finance Finance Surplus value Gross domestic product Derivative (finance) Leasehold estate Interest Hire purchase Mergers and acquisitions Economics Monetary policy Call option Arbitrage Contract Operating surplus Intellectual property Bond Asset Economy of the United States Gold standard PE ratio Labor theory of value Predatory lending Credit card Margin (finance) Food Stamp Program Capital accumulation Productive and unproductive labour Housing cooperative Citigroup Option style Capitalism Black-Scholes Commodore International Credit derivative Money FairTax Berkshire Hathaway BC Rail Delta Air Lines Put option Real estate Enron Corporation Estoppel Auto insurance Air New Zealand Corporation Warren Buffett Institutional fund management Pension Model (economics) Donald Trump Federal Reserve Internet fraud United Kingdom corporation tax 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Wheel of Fortune Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Social Credit Money supply Health insurance Wal-Mart Arrangements between railroads Timeline of the Enron scandal Oakland Athletics Interest rate Social Security (United States) Monty Hall problem Opportunity cost Depreciation Trademark
