i received a bad check and bank charged me everything on it my business neighbor recently wrote me a check to pay for the water bill we share the water bill but my bank returned a copy of the check to me nsf and charged the amount on the check and additional fee so i lost from my account plus not receiving the thats owed it's my first time receiving a bad check is the bank supposed to do that they also attached a substitute check policy along with the bounced check copy how do i get the money back and what actions should i take if my neighbor doesnt pay the amount he's owed i dont want to pursue legal actions right away but its just difficult to contact him because he never answers his cell phone when i call him and he rarely calls me back even if i leave a lot of messages thank you for helping no the bank shouldn't charge you for anything as long as you only deposited the check into your account if that is what you did his bank should should be sending him a letter saying that his check did not clear you shouldn't have had to pay anything at all if i were you i would call your bank and find out why they charged you instead of him if they refuse to refund you the money they owe you i would change banks if you can not get a hold of him leave him a message of some sort and tell him that it is very important for him to call you i would hate to see it have to go any further you definitely need to talk to him about it Bank Internet fraud Advance fee fraud Cheque GSM services Bank fraud Mutual fund United States Postal Service Insurance Automatic teller machine Taxation in the United States Annuity Money creation Money FairTax Poker jargon Mortgage Plame affair Skype Bond Tom DeLay Octopus card Gold standard Student loan EFTPOS Security (finance) SCO-Linux controversies Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Islamic banking Schabir Shaik Trial Microeconomics Password PE ratio Child support Credit card fraud Money supply GNU General Public License Tax resistance Debit card Enron Corporation Computer virus Short selling Gmail Self programming language Mail fraud E-mail spam Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Wheel of Fortune Liability Theory of conduct Euro Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Oil-for-Food Programme Citigroup The Amazing Race Money laundering Public good Prolog Trust (Law) USA Altruism Spam (electronic) Digital signature Primerica Financial Services Stomach cancer Deflation (economics) Marshall Plan Roswell UFO incident Betting (poker) Mach kernel Virgin Mobile Corporation Surveillance Automated Clearing House Riggs Bank Usury Software patent debate Contract Life insurance Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Make money fast Identity theft New Deal Derivative (finance) Ann Coulter Neopets Banknote Ocean's Twelve Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Inflation Blackjack Air America Radio National Kidney Foundation Singapore Open access Baccarat E-ZPass
