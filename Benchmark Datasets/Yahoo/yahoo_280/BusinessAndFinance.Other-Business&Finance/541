how can one be paid directly into her debit card is it possible someone wants to make a payment and i was wondering if that payment can be made right into the payee's debit card what is needed for the transaction thanks thanks michael the bank is barclays bank and the payee is in kenya the person making payments is in the usa it all depends on who issued the debit card if it's a paypal debit card then you could make the deposit into paypal if it's a bank debit card you could go to the bank and make a deposit into the person's account assuming that you knew the account number my bank allows me to make an electronic deposit into another bank account if i know the aba the account number so if you have a bank account it's possible that you could make the transfer online to the other person's bank account and then they would have the money to use on their debit card it all depends on who issued the debit card Credit card Electronic money Debit card Internet fraud PayPal Cheque Automated Clearing House Credit card fraud Automatic teller machine Interac Bank fraud VISA (credit card) Electronic toll collection Octopus card Legal tender SmartRider Surveillance Online shop E-gold Personal finance Financial services Oyster card Liberty Dollar Electronic commerce Chip and PIN Annuity Euro Monetary policy Identity theft Schabir Shaik Trial Money supply Loyalty program Ulster Bank Scrip Mail fraud Stored-value card Gold standard Student loan MetroCard Payroll Security (finance) E-ZPass Balance of payments Bank of China (Hong Kong) Letter of credit Online gambling Leasing Micropayment BancNet Accountancy Bond Insurance Advance fee fraud London Underground Wachovia Finance Mutual fund Credit score Tax Reserve Bank of New Zealand United Kingdom corporation tax Something Awful Payphone Citigroup Bretton Woods system Currency Money creation Economy of Russia Expressnet Investment bank Password Riggs Bank Baccarat Toll road Financial markets Collateralized debt obligation Economy of India Life insurance Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Mergers and acquisitions Islamic banking Toronto Computer Leasing Inquiry Identity document Fractional-reserve banking Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Traveler's cheque American Express Economy of Chile Social Security (United States) Clearstream Reserve requirements Western Union
