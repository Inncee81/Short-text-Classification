what do you believe are unethical banking practices i believe it is wrong for a bank to automatically withdraw funds from a person's account for a transaction but then wait days for a deposit on ths person's account to clear before usage of such funds can occur does this practice seem a bit unbalanced what other banking practices do you think are unfair some of the overdraft fees and low balance fees are rediculously high for example my friend says he had a low balance fee gimme a break i'm not even earning that much interest in one year they take it out when your balance drops and for each month it remains under the minimum balance but honestly if you keep enough money in your account you should be fine also all you have to do is read the account agreement or you can call customer service and just ask them it is boring but you should be able to find out what you need to know if however something isn't mentioned in that book or by the call center rep then yes that policy or fee is unethical Bank Credit card Mutual fund Automatic teller machine Annuity Monetary policy Insurance Citigroup Short selling Keynesian economics Ethics Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Octopus card Student loan Internet fraud Islamic banking Economy of India Mortgage Variable universal life insurance Hedge fund Bank of China (Hong Kong) Corporate finance Schabir Shaik Trial Certificate of deposit Bretton Woods system Say's law Leasing Enron Corporation Poker jargon MMORPG Taxation in the United States Economy of Russia Gold standard EFTPOS Advance fee fraud Investment bank Social Security debate (United States) Password Graduate school Neopets FairTax Bank fraud Credit card fraud Comorian franc SmartRider Mergers and acquisitions Business ethics Bond Euro Salary cap Theory of conduct Trust (Law) USA Call centre Divorce Economy of Nigeria Contract Derivative (finance) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Economy of Iceland Balance of payments Life insurance Finance Monetary and fiscal policy of Japan Gold as an investment Eliot Spitzer Microeconomics Cheque Creative accounting Predatory lending Asian financial crisis Double-entry book-keeping Deflation (economics) SCO-Linux controversies Coutts Primerica Financial Services Wells Fargo Offshore bank Fractional-reserve banking World Bank Group Toronto-Dominion Bank Lloyd's of London New Deal Financial services Wal-Mart Financial audit Stock Privatization Microcredit Corporate governance Arbitrage CPU cache Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gross domestic product Hong Kong Monetary Authority Central bank President's Choice Financial Futures contract
