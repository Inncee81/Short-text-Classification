explain the difference between price earnings multiples and cash flow multiples it is different in two key ways one is accounting basis and the other is levered versus levered paradigm first accounting basis accounting is done on accrual basis while cash flow is done on cash basis in the accrual basis you account for revenues when they are earned not when cash is received and match expenses to revenues even if no cash goes out the door e g you accrue wages payable for paying your employees every day that they work not just a big lump sum when you pay them pe is often seen as a good ratio for normalized earnings while cash flow multiples are seen as a reality check to make sure that the company actually generates cash rather than have it flow elsewhere via accruals or only come via non cash sources as warren buffet says cash flow is king second leverage paradigm this is my fancy way of saying you are looking at how it looks to owners versus all financing sources not just equity holders this is important because sometimes earnings to equity holders can be different simply based on how the company is financed for example companies are often looked on ev ebitda ratios unlevered company divided by how much cash flows to see how much the entity is worth vis a vis its pre financing and pre tax cash flows this method takes into account the balance sheet and cash flows rather than just looking at equity earnings and earnings that may or may not have cash to back it up Accounting methods Corporate finance Microeconomics EBITDA Tax Bond Life insurance Mutual fund Pension Double-entry book-keeping Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Mergers and acquisitions Debt Finance Insurance Income statement Compensation of employees Derivative (finance) PE ratio Deflation (economics) Stock Credit card Margin (finance) Social Security (United States) Capital accumulation Personal finance FairTax Security (finance) Cash flow statement Financial audit Inflation Gold standard Income Collateralized debt obligation Valuation (finance) U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Warren Buffett Surplus value Asset Institutional fund management Retirement plan Liability U.S. public debt Social Security debate (United States) Berkshire Hathaway Income trust Monetary policy Treasury security 401(k) Federal National Mortgage Association Supply-side economics Cost of capital Mortgage Flat tax Employee stock option Productive and unproductive labour National Insurance Profit Ford Motor Company Leverage (finance) Risk management Futures contract Economics Labour economics Trust (Law) USA Gross domestic product Google Bank Management information system Investment bank Value added tax Keynesian economics Dividend Poker jargon Debt levels and flows Money supply Payroll Financial markets Enron Corporation Cheque Taxation in the United States Free trade Financial statements Airline Model (economics) Economy of India Leveraged buyout Primerica Financial Services Economy of Russia Municipal bond Weighted average cost of capital Financial services Database
