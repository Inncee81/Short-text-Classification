what to do if i sent out email telling all clients of price increase but they keep quiet i told them that they have to pay us per month for maintenance fees its like a retainer fee they get hours of website maintenance i sent the email out this morning but no one has responded or asked any questions what do i do are they pretending that they did'nt get my email maybe they will only respond after i bill them this is something new and i need to see their reaction call up a few and ask them some that you get along well with you may find they are not willing to pay this but gotta call to find out hey maybe this is a really good price i know nothing about the costs for this i suggest you not bill them for this until you have talked to them just to make sure everything is ok and see if they are willing to pay this Advance fee fraud Plame affair SCO-Linux controversies Internet fraud National Kidney Foundation Singapore Gmail E-mail spam Wal-Mart Phishing Credit card Fark.com Timeline of the Enron scandal E-mail Hyperinflation Outsourcing Spam (electronic) Health insurance America Online Broadband Internet access Citigroup Good Morning, Vietnam Karl Rove MMORPG Publicly funded medicine Stopping e-mail abuse Best Buy Short selling RuneScape cheats Blonde on Blonde Direct marketing Live 8 Futures contract Fox News Bond Sampling (music) Food and Drug Administration Call centre Supply and demand Microeconomics Labor theory of value BitTorrent London Congestion Charge Neopets Public good Hutton Inquiry Unemployment David Blunkett Opera (web browser) Confidence trick Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Anonymous remailer Hotmail Micropayment The Apprentice 2 Health care in the United States Home Box Office James T.
