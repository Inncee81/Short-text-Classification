do you hang out with your boss after work off the clock and does it effect everyone else at work i don't but it's interesting you should ask a couple of years ago hr was asked to give our department some suggestions on building moral it was pretty low they suggested the boss occasionally takes the employees out to lunch or even a business lunch to show they are not above the average employee as far as importance my supervisor said she wouldn't do that it's too personal and it would allow the employee to feel to comfortable around her that was the point for the boss to be more approachable but now a couple of years later things have changed she's going to lunch every day with the same employees she not buying the lunch but they are still together everyday but it's only these couple of people nobody else i personally feel it's favoritism why was she so adamantly against it at first but now she does it every day i don t like it i ve noticed other favors being given to these employees to they get to be the exceptions to the rules policies and procedures Theory of conduct Milton H.
