where do our income taxes go when we pay them i know there are several different taxes the taxes on gas go to build roads and bridges etc the tax on corporate gains goes to funding our wars and etc but what about federal income taxes we americans altogether pay out out trillions each week and yet we have a national debt and today central banks all around the world put money into their monetary systems to prevent a credit crunch why intelligent answers only please and any sites you can show me for more information would be helpful firstly taxes exist for several reasons to control the economy high taxes to reduce spending and prevent inflation and vice versa to redistribute income high earners see their income taxed which is transferred to low income earners through food stamps and other credits as you said to pay for roads and in the case of america to finance the war why america has a national debt is primarily becaue of the war trillions and trillions are spent and this expenditure far exceeds the income received through various taxes hence the debt and then of course the consumer themselves are guzzilng imports the money crunch comes about because of the huge deficit in america just imagine who's giving all this money to amercica to spend other countries are especially china and japan who finance amercia's deficit by buying amercia's bonds and bills now can america pay all this just what is going to haapen if amercai defaults on this debt a credit crunch that's what's going to happen banks in china and other lender countries will see all their loans unpaid and as a result savers in those countries will see their money lost becasue of the defaulted loans this is the reason everyone is freaked about the credit crunch if america defaults you might see your savings wiped out sorry i really have no websites to give you but i can give some books but i don't know whether they are avalible firstly j k galbraith the crash the debt crisis by darrell delamaide cheers elin Hyperinflation Economy of Russia Debt Inflation U.S. public debt Economy of the United States Money Mortgage Deflation (economics) FairTax Credit card Bank Money supply Tax Taxation in the United States Bond Deficit spending Monetary policy Economy of Pakistan Great Depression Economy of India Gold standard Bretton Woods system Asian financial crisis Supply-side economics Arthur Laffer Capital accumulation Social Security debate (United States) Social Security (United States) History of the United States (1918-1945) Microeconomics Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Finance Economy of Chile Economy of Argentina Gross domestic product Tax cut Economy of Ghana Keynesian economics Security (finance) Capitalism Economic history of the United States Privatization History of the United States (1980-1988) Deficit Economy of South Africa Economy of Romania Economy of the People's Republic of China Social Credit Reaganomics Economy of Nigeria Central bank Personal finance Marshall Plan Flat tax Economy of El Salvador Student loan Euro Federal Reserve Canadian federal election, 1993 Tariff Bank fraud Financial markets Free trade Economy of Papua New Guinea Interest Monetary and fiscal policy of Japan Corporation Developing countries' debt Annuity Monetarism Measures of national income and output Productive and unproductive labour Economy of Mexico History of post-Soviet Russia International Monetary Fund United Kingdom corporation tax New Deal Fiat money Surplus value Economy of Greece Life insurance Economy of Senegal Derivative (finance) Insurance Canadian and American economies compared Balanced Budget Amendment Publicly funded medicine Economy of Africa Economic history of Spain World economy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Kazakhstan Economy of Brazil Fractional-reserve banking Microcredit
