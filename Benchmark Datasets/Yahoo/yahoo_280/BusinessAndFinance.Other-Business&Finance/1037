what does this mean mixing ration for fuel and oil for new sets after running approx km i really dont know ratios so could you tell me what is means yes the mixing ratio says that you should put in a mixture of part oil to parts fuel for the first km of operation in other words if you have l of oil you would mix that with l of fuel after you've run the machine for approximately km you put in less oil with the fuel l oil mixed with l fuel if you are mixing up smaller batches you just change the amounts i e with l of fuel mix l oil at the beginning and put in l of fuel with l oil after km of use i hope this helps E85 Internal combustion engine Diesel engine Gasoline Carburetor Two-stroke cycle Diesel cycle Turbocharger Hydrogen economy Rocket fuel Alcohol fuel Liquid fuels Fuel injection Turbofan Engine displacement Jet engine Hybrid vehicle Carbon dioxide Biodiesel Transformer Sewage treatment Aircraft engine controls Olive oil Supercharger Motor oil Diesel Liquified petroleum gas Gas turbine Spacecraft propulsion Rotary engine Fire fighting Alternative fuel Radio controlled airplane Coal Energy development Space shuttle main engine Heinkel He 100 Fuel cell Steel French fries Petroleum High-speed rail Brewery Drag racing Cracking (chemistry) Spark plug Oil depletion Standard Oil Catalytic converter Thermal power station Turbojet Moonshine Power station Automobile Filling station Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Thermal depolymerization Alkane Stratified charge engine Gas turbine-electric locomotive Golden ratio Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Portable stove Fire extinguisher Locomotive Plastic Town gas Nuclear fuel cycle Oil refinery Uranium Automatic transmission Rum Continuously variable transmission Nuclear thermal rocket Halliburton Manifold vacuum Concrete Economy of the People's Republic of China Omega-3 fatty acid Oil shale Standard deviation Inertial confinement fusion Hubbert peak theory Specific impulse Mainframe computer Axial compressor Nuclear fusion Idli Stirling engine USS Tripoli (CVE-64) Motorcycle TGV Pebble bed reactor De Havilland DH.88 Transmission (mechanics) Chainsaw Pulse jet engine Nuclear power Implications of peak oil
