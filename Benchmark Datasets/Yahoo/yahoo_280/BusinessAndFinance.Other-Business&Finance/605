impairment test at fiscal year end for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets including fcc licenses and trademarks as required by statement of financial accounting standards no goodwill and other intangible assets sfas goodwill is allocated to various reporting units which are generally one level below our operating segments to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount on an annual basis if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its goodwill to determine the fair value of our reporting units we generally use a present value technique discounted cash flow corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate except for the abc television network a business within the media networks operating segment for which we used a revenue multiple we did not use a present value technique or a market multiple approach to value the abc television network as a present value technique would not capture its full fair value and there is little comparable market data available due to the scarcity of television networks we applied what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies the impairment test results could differ sfas requires the company to compare the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized fair values for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows market multiples or appraised values as appropriate we
