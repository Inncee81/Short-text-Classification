does anyone know where i could find a graph chart that shows the correlation between income and credit scores i am well aware that income is not factored into one's credit score what i am asking about if someone knows of a graph that shows correlation between income and credit score while there are certainly rich people with poor credit scores and poor people with good credit scores i think it is pretty obvious that there is at least a little positive correlation between income and credit score as people with lots of money can pay their bills much more easily than people with little money there should not be any chart like this income has virtually nothing to do with you credit score edit makeup of the credit score the approximate makeup of the fico score fair isaac discloses to consumerscredit scores are designed to measure the risk of default by taking into account various factors in a person's financial history although the exact formulas for calculating credit scores are closely guarded secrets the fair isaac corporation has disclosed the following components and the approximate weighted contribution of each punctuality of payment in the past only includes payments later than days past due the amount of debt expressed as the ratio of current revolving debt credit card balances etc to total available revolving credit credit limits length of credit history types of credit used installment revolving consumer finance recent search for credit and or amount of credit obtained recently the above percentages provide very limited guidance in understanding a credit score for example the of the score allocated to types of credit used is undefined leaving consumers unaware what type of credit mix to pursue length of credit history is also a murky concept it consists of multiple factors two being the oldest account open and the average length of time an account has been open although only is attributed to punctuality if a consumer is substantially late on numerous accounts his score will fall far more than bankruptcies foreclosures and judgments affect scores substantially but are not included in the somewhat simplistic pie chart provided by fair isaac Credit card Bank Gross domestic product Microeconomics Bond FairTax United Kingdom corporation tax Money Supply and demand Economic inequality Taxation in the United States Deflation (economics) Solar variation Interest Inflation Capital accumulation Capitalism Debt Government debt Personal finance Sea level rise Economy of Russia Surveillance Intelligence quotient Normal distribution Student loan Health insurance Predatory lending Insurance Corporate finance Gold standard Life insurance Derivative (finance) Finance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Credit history Economy of Pakistan Tax Money supply Publicly funded medicine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Compensation of employees Free trade U.S. public debt Productive and unproductive labour Mainframe computer Electronic commerce Bank fraud Internet fraud PE ratio 401(k) Divorce GED Surplus value Monetary policy Economy of the United States Unemployment Tide Economics Credit derivative Cost of capital Trigonometric function Great Depression Extreme Programming Microcredit Fair use Fair Isaac Corporation Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Pi Corporation Social Security debate (United States) Law of value Second language acquisition Mutual fund Mortgage-backed security Polynomial Financial audit Intellectual property Derivative Welfare economics Graduate school Economy of India Yield curve Credit card fraud SAT Software patent debate Baseball
