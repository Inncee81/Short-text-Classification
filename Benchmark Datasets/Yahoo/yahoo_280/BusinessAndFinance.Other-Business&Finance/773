why should accountants still be employed even if there are accounting softwares in the market sources are very welcomed in your answers opinions are well accepted i want to prove although accounting softwares are made to help in the accounting system businesses should still employ accountants to ensure the quality and assurance of their financial statements thank you very much the accounting software is only as good as the information entered into it you need a qualified accountant to enter the information and to properly review financial statements otherwise if there was an error an unqualified person will not catch it any accountant at a month end close will tell you the hardest part of their jobs is figuring out why the numbers are off and to find the system human errors you also need an accountant that can write the reports so they are customized and have the proper information since not all companies want to see the same information the same way plus a programmer that doesn t understand accounting doesn t know if the report they wrote is really pulling the correct information as an accountant i was so frustrated with the programmers getting the information wrong or pulling a number from a field that looked the same but really wasn t and thinking it was good enough that i learned sql so i could write my own reports it saved me a ton of time and the company a ton of money Extreme Programming Software testing Corporate governance United Kingdom corporation tax Debugging Software engineering Database management system Password Plame affair Outsourcing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annuity Management information system Financial audit Object-SQL mapping Information Technology Infrastructure Library Database Contract Pretty Good Privacy Year 2000 problem Microsoft Enron Corporation Electronic commerce Biblical inerrancy Gross domestic product Open-source software Customer relationship management Embedded system Economics Requirements analysis Call centre SAP R/3 Life insurance Reliability engineering ISO 9000 Perl Credit card SAS System National Kidney Foundation Singapore Financial statements Game programmer Quality control Sarbanes-Oxley Act Insurance Computer virus Accountancy Speech recognition Scientific method Business performance management TransUnion Bank Theory of conduct Appeal Killian documents Philosophy of mathematics Strategic management SQL EastEnders Enterprise resource planning DVD Epistemology Database normalization Expert system Offshoring SCO-Linux controversies MDAC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Floppy disk Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Money supply Sola fide Philosophy of language XML Information technology audit Game programming Btrieve Oil-for-Food Programme Oracle Corporation IBM PC compatible Risk management Dynamic Systems Development Method Rational Unified Process 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Information Services Procurement Library Microsoft Jet Database Engine Enterprise content management Science Software bug Search engine optimization Computer software Coming of Age (TNG episode) Graduate school Buffer overflow PL/SQL Creative accounting OpenDocument
