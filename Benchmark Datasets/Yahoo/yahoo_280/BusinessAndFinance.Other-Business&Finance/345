whats the average income for somone who never graduated college i never graduated and i only make a year with bonuses about a year i have friends that have their bachelors degrees that cannot get jobs it seems like even a bachelors doesnt really do it anymore i'm reading alot of people getting masters degrees to get jobs what is minimum wage looking like im yrs old and live in the northeast region ugh i got a masters of public administration but government and non profit will underpay you until you have a lot of years under your belt unless you have some major support behind you from someone with power and influence a lot of jobs will require a few years experience and will underpay you for a year or two as part of a training program took me years after getting my degree just to make it to k but once i get enough experience in i can move to the front of the line for some bigger and better positions and then your salary can really take off i'm interviewing for a budget analyst job that's k and i could advance to over k after years if i'm promoted so basically the degree gives you the potential to earn a lot of money and it gives you the chance to get jobs that could lead to much higher salaries but you still have to start at the bottom usually and it can be a slow road people without degrees can still make decent money and they often make more than their college grad counterparts in their mid to late s because they simply have more years of work experience in but then you get into the s and that's when the successful college grads surpass the non grads because they're eligible for those professional managerial and executive jobs that the non grads are not eligible for but the college grad can't just jump right into one of those jobs right out of school of course they need to work their way up just like everyone else and prove their worth that is why you might notice you're making more than some college folks in career terms it makes a lot more sense to get a degree later in life after you're established in a company number one you know exactly what you're shooting for number two you'll already have your experience in so you can see immediate returns and number three the company may help you pay for it but people tend not to do this because college is easier when you don't have a house and kids and a full time job and you can spend all day just going to classes and doing homework in reality a lot of people spend all day goofing off and those are the people who don't see the benefits of the degree right away if ever going to school does not develop your career working does some fields are tied in directly with college such as science medicine engineering etc but you still don't earn the money until you put in some work either as an intern or what have you the people who really do take off are the ones who are working on their careers while attending college and are taking classes directly related to what they're doing and who have a specific and attainable goal in mind that necessitates that college degree if you go to college for the sake of going to college the degree is not going to be worth much you're obviously way above minimum wage so that doesn't affect you but you may reach a point where your salary is capped and you can't go any further without the degree if you know that will end up being the case it might be a good idea to start working on that degree so that you can break through that barrier Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Professor Constitution of the
