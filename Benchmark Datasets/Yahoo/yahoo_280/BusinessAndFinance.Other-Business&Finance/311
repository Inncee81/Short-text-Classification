is there much fraud involved with electronic checks i am being offered an e check as payment for a vehicle i know it can be verified before product is delivered but is the fraudulent risk worth paying the or so for the proper paper hard to tell if you are a business or an individual who is offering the e check a business or an individual and what kind of arrangment you are really looking at but overall the process cuts down on fraud electronic checking legitimate is a service offered to businesses by check processing companies the like where a paper check presented by a consumer is converted to electronic format it's scanned and translated into a banking file the banking file can be processed by computers faster than paper checks by people and the conversion software can keep track of and reject accounts and ids used in fraud the service must be subscribed to by the business not the consumer so the business would offer to accept your check electronically not pay you it's different than eft electronic funds transfer like direct deposit which is how businesses would typically pay electronically but they would need your banking info to do it so most companies issue paper checks for payments two things do concern me a business that takes checks electronically has a device to do the conversion similar to a credit card machine you do not so how will you handle the e check with a paper check which any business converting check to electronic files will still have you get a signature along with acount number name address phone etc what will this e check give you just an account i would call my bank and ask them about the arrangement and the e check business not the person paying you but who they want to pay through also ask the person paying you what they need from you to do this e check there are scams where individuals gather banking information so they can later rob people Internet fraud Credit card Mail fraud Advance fee fraud Enterprise content management Electronic money Credit card fraud Surveillance Identity theft RFID Octopus card Security (finance) United States Postal Service Medical prescription E-mail spam CPU cache Password Computer Spyware Phishing Tax British national identity card Cheque Telephone exchange Public transport Credit repair 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Money Musical Instrument Digital Interface Fraud Insurance Spam (electronic) Annuity E-mail 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Bluetooth Gmail Financial services Bank of China (Hong Kong) Open access Phone fraud Bond Digital photography Windows 2000 XML Slot machine Citigroup Capital accumulation Digital rights management Digital circuit Computer insecurity Investment bank Online shop Information Technology Infrastructure Library Mutual fund Computer virus Xerox Money supply Embedded system Personal finance Commodity markets C programming language TransUnion Best Buy Database Stopping e-mail abuse Reverse engineering Finance Redundant array of independent disks Mach kernel Confidence trick Privatization Sound recording Windows XP Road-rule enforcement camera Pyramid scheme Digital signature Peer review Universal Serial Bus Smart card Mail Data retention File Allocation Table Copyleft Life insurance Killian documents 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio Software patent debate Trusted computing Voice over IP
