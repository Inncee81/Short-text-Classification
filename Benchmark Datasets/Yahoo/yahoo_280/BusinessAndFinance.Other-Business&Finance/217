costco careers hi i recently applied for a position a few days ago at my local costco i applied for the front end assistant position i was wondering how long does it take for a answer back from them also what do they ask in the interview process does the interview take place inside a office or something thanks for your time and help it just depends on the season but it took me about a week to get a call and schedule an interview and a week after that to get a call back for the position they ask the normal interview questions best bet is to relax and let them know your skills Jeopardy!
