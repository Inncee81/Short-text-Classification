can you help me with this business case thanks the dressing corp was a manufacturer of high quality undershirts this company started up by copying popular styles and designs from u k the st years was quite profitable in the market for undershirts suddenly took a downturn it was no longer fashionable to wear undershirts more and more factories sprouted up and willing to compromise on price and payment the company was astounded a year later the dressing corp started feel the pinch the introduced bubbles which was a new brand of exactly the same product quality but priced lower to match competing products having failed to improve the marketability of its traditional product lines the company added a couple of lines like jeans and printed shirts whch also failed at this point managements thought that one way to save the dwindling profitability ws to infuse more capital to modernize its factory and produced btter qualty product q should the owners of dressing corp infuse additional funds to the company y q how dressing corp could have avoided its losses this is way too complex a question to expect a comprehensive answer here properly done it could take many a pages and would need dozens if not hundreds more questions being asked of you first however in a globule it sounds as though a company originally based on high quality and presumably a decent price tag started to try and compete on price with an outdated product not good if the company has something of a quality reputation than dropping the price to cheapo levels just starts to kill of the brand value look what happened to pierre cardin years ago his brand was worth something if you owned something with that name on it was a special creation which many people were happy to pay good money for now it is as exclusive as an aldi woolworths special pierre cardin no thanks i'll save up and buy something better from argos so bubble was just heh look dressing corp is no longer exclusive we have introcuded a budget range of stuff for the poverty stricken to buy the fact that the quality was the same would not be belived or understood by most people so price cutting is not the answer never is in the long run unless you can afford to produce vast quantity and work on the basis of p a garment profit multiplied by garments a week will keep the creditors at bay adding additional funds may be an idea but only if this is being done with some decent marketing not sales strategies in place first the jeans and printed shirts are not the sort of thing than you might normally associate with high quality manufacture more a cheap n cheerful rag shifter perhaps finding what the original customers were now buying instead quality shirts as opposed to undershirts perhaps other quality products geared at the customers that already are familiar with the product you used to sell as i say this is not a comprehensive answer but this question cannot simply be answered mark Keynesian economics Trademark Microeconomics Undergarment Sears Holdings Corporation Gross domestic product Deflation (economics) Privatization Aldi Commodore International Clothing Insurance Economics AMD Monetary policy Capital accumulation Inflation Ford Motor Company CPU cache Strategic management PE ratio Mutual fund CPU design United Kingdom corporation tax Intellectual property Free trade Law of value Publishing Short selling Supply and demand Price discrimination Commodity Natural monopoly Illegal drug trade Tax Dot-com Tariff Citigroup BMW Airline Bond Great Depression Extreme Programming Productive and unproductive labour Surplus value Tesco Supply-side economics Topps Say's law Capitalism Bretton Woods system Bulk vending American individualist anarchism Islamic banking Economy of Africa Prices of production First-sale doctrine Pricing Life insurance Hyperinflation Lionel Corporation Xerox Marketing Nortel Networks Manual transmission Labor theory of value Mattress Daewoo Plastic Monopoly Enron Corporation Exchange value Gramophone record FairTax Public good Mergers and acquisitions Digital photography Internet fraud Publicly funded medicine Atari ST Ashton-Tate Laserdisc Health insurance Schwinn Bicycle Company Temasek Holdings Fair use History of the United States (1918-1945) ITV Apple Computer SCO-Linux controversies Bank Data General
