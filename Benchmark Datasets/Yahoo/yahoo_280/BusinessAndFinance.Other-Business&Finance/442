why don't accounting departments like it when you use your purchasing card for travel expenses some companies offer a separate purchasing card and t e card if you don't have a t e card they want you to use your personal purchasing card for travel expenses and they will reimburse you after the trip what is the logic behind this why do they not want you to use the purchasing card for your travel expenses directly related to work it creates a lot of work for the accounting department to sort out the charges and expense them to the correct accounts it also allows them to keep your travel expenses under control some people would go crazy with a purchasing card with a high limit but would not make the same purchases with their own card i have also seen companies that restrict their cards to certain merchants types of purchases for example a purchasing card can be set up so that purchases at a clothing store or restaurant will automatically be denied at the register i would hate to have to use my personal card for work related travel expenses and hope they reimburse me if you are carrying a balance on your personal card you will end up paying interest on the work purchases while you wait for them to reimburse you i'd push them to issue you a travel card if they are requiring you to travel for work Credit card Octopus card Insurance Bank Publicly funded medicine Value added tax Automatic teller machine Student loan Mutual fund Surveillance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Debit card Internet fraud Oyster card Transport in Hong Kong CPU design Life insurance Passport Compensation of employees 401(k) Security (finance) Teletext Sears Holdings Corporation Corporation Identity document Public policy United States Postal Service Citigroup Bulk vending Web hosting Poker jargon Neopets Annuity SmartRider Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Credit card fraud Digital photography Wal-Mart Supply and demand Animal Crossing MetroCard Mergers and acquisitions Blackjack Identity theft MAME Child support Legal tender Punch card Auto insurance Estoppel The Amazing Race Community card poker EFTPOS Loyalty program Magic: The Gathering British national identity card Atari 8-bit family Price discrimination Plame affair Electronic toll collection Health savings account Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission RFID PE ratio Copy protection Computer Tom DeLay Taxicab Yu-Gi-Oh!
