how do you make a mirror how do people make mirrors in factories or other buildings a mirror is essentially a sheet of glass back coated with aluminium tain as you already know aluminium and pretty any metal is highly reflective the problem is that the surface is usually to rough or tarnished to reflect a proper picture aluminium foil for example generated a passable reflection but as it gets more wrinkled the reflection becomes more an more distorted until it gets a point that a reflection is entirely unrecognizable it is possible to flatten and polish aluminium or other metals to point that they would reflect perfectly this is how mirrors were often made in the past without glass the problem is that metal is expensive to flatten and shine and then the shine is difficult to maintain metal is quite heavy as well it's much easier to produce a perflectly flat and smooth surface of glass once the metal is applied to the glass it becomes and remains flat and smooth you can replicate this in a lab by placing a piece of glass on some mercury don't forget that mercury is toxic though Aluminium Mirror Glass Casting Amateur telescope making Welding Optical coating Microphone Drill bit Solar cell Nuclear weapon design Sunglasses Drawing Gas metal arc welding Tin Plastic Laser Float glass Ultraviolet Loudspeaker Silver Stereoscopy Corrosion Boat building Cookware and bakeware Friction Mercury (element) Mars Exploration Rover Inertial confinement fusion Sand casting Gramophone record Vacuum tube Lathe Manifold Diamond simulant Eyepiece Lapping Pearl Laserdisc Diamond cut Diamond enhancement Mylar Stained glass Sewage treatment Powder metallurgy Mouse (computing) Point groups in three dimensions Terminal ballistics Screw Brazing View camera Waste management Hydrogen Chromium Gilding Beryllium Laser engraving Electrophysiology Pottery Arc welding Mithril Vitreous enamel Fluorescent lamp Aberration in optical systems Crown glass Manicure Computer representation of surfaces Mattress Radar cross section Sandpaper Solar system Printed circuit board Transistor Cross-country skiing Indium Action potential Textile manufacturing terminology Telescope Caesium Glasses Sheet metal Table tennis Technicolor Microwave oven Violin Mercury 4 Titan (moon) Plane (tool) Sterling silver Bong Motorcycle Hubble Space Telescope Gold Compact disc Radio controlled airplane Fast bowling Sulfuric acid
