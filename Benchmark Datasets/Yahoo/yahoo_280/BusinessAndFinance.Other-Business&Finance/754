how long would it take to receive a usps priority mail package if it came from ma to nj it is typically business days but its only about hrs away so i was wondering is it possible to get it in a day it is possible but highly unlikely to receive it overnight it is possible if you are dropping the package off at a post office that is also the processing center early in the day however it will probably be at least two days even if it was just going across town you should be aware that priority mail is not guaranteed to be delivered even in the day time frame if you need next day delivery you will have to use express mail United States Postal Service Post office United Parcel Service ZIP Code Mail Private Express Statutes Rocket mail FedEx Corporation Railway post office Royal Mail USS Barbero (SS-317) Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Postmark Call centre Canada Post Post Office box Postcode Mail carrier Mail order Postage stamp E-mail spam Canadian postal code E-mail Brewery Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Mail fraud Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping 1925 serum run to Nome Internet fraud Television in the United States Apple Open Collaboration Environment Animal Crossing Short message service Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Stopping e-mail abuse Teletext National Weather Service Railway Mail Service Glossary of American football General Post Office (United Kingdom) MX record Explosive material FidoNet Short selling Dynamic Systems Development Method Air traffic controller Information Technology Infrastructure Library Real-time operating system Bicycle PRINCE2 Battle of the Bulge Spam Prevention Early Warning System Copyright The Globe and Mail Direct marketing Transmission Control Protocol Postal authority Maildir Quality of service Actor model Heckler & Koch USP Stamp collecting James Farley Post Office Domain Name System Internet forum Vertical service code OpenDocument Spam (electronic) Hour Local post Student Congress Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina U.S. government role in civil aviation DragonFly BSD Newspaper Illegal drug trade Postal marking Combine (Half-Life 2) Mortgage Xerox Pregnancy United Airlines Political campaign SAS System Service Mail art Usenet London 2012 Olympic bid Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, 1968 Federal Standard 1037C Independent agencies of the United States government Sears Holdings Corporation Inverted Jenny Debian Cancellation ICalendar Second Battle of the Atlantic Information Services Procurement Library Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Delivery (commerce)
