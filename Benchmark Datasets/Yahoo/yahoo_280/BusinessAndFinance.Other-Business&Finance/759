is it possible for me to find out who picked up my money that has been transferred by my friend via moneygram my friend in the us transferred a fund to me im in malaysia via moneygram weeks ago and she did it online through the moneygram website few days after she received a confirmation email that the money had been successfully picked up the problem is her email had been messing up for a few days on the day she sent me the transfer's reference number which i will use to pick the money over here i didnt received any email from her she cant receive or send email and some email she sent was sent to someone else etc so we suspect the email went to someone else's inbox not mine but we dont know who what can i do call moneygram and ask who took the money is it possible plus if we find out who took the money what will we do next how can i get my money back p s the amount is us thanks since the email went crazy yes it is very possible that the reference number be sent to another person's email but before anyone collects a moneygram they will be required a valid id the moneygram indicates your name and your country of residence the remmiter can even chose a moneygram pick up location most convenient to you referrence numbers are not really much of a requirement when claiming money it is given to you for mere facilitation and easy look up of the transaction knowledge of the referrence number alone will not enable anyone to claim money that is not his so if there is anyone who have claimed money supposed to be for you he she must have had a fake id info about you and who sent the money and the referrence number and knows the location chosen by the sender if there is any but like western union you can always claim the money transfer anywhere else anyways so long as you have the docs and the info check with money gram if the email really is going retarded it may be a possibility that it is also a mis sent message you can claim your money or file a complaint with money gram but again as long as the claimer was able to furnish moneygram with proper identification and correct information and there was no negligence in the part of moneygram you cannot hold them responsible E-mail Internet fraud E-mail spam Stopping e-mail abuse Pretty Good Privacy Spam (electronic) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Plame affair Gmail Anonymous remailer Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Viral marketing Email authentication Surveillance United States Postal Service Credit card Password Transmission Control Protocol Phishing Error correction and detection SCO-Linux controversies Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Whois Computer virus Bank fraud Customer relationship management Mail fraud British national identity card Killian documents Driver's license Insurance Make money fast Digital signature Public domain Hashcash Identity theft Appeal Neopets Spam Prevention Early Warning System Bayesian inference RuneScape cheats XML Internet forum Medicine International Criminal Court Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Debit card Annuity BitTorrent E-gold Cross site scripting Health insurance Enterprise content management Pump It Up Vivian Solon The Standard Steam (content delivery) Usenet HTML Able Danger Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Estoppel Something Awful Public key infrastructure United States dollar Mail-order bride CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 Facebook (website) Common criticisms of Microsoft File Transfer Protocol Tax Medical prescription John Lott Anonymous P2P Debugging Public-key cryptography Aspect-oriented programming Internet troll USA PATRIOT Act Mozilla Firefox Mutual fund Google The Best Page in the Universe Mafia (game) MoveOn United Kingdom corporation tax Opie and Anthony GSM services Internet pornography Computer Call centre Anonymity Live 8 E-mail address MDAC Domestic violence
