anybody currently working for live ops about how much do you make is it worth to pay for background check i just checked out live ops looks pretty legit just wanted some info from someone currently working for them it's probably worth the for the background check however i would think twice about the opportunity as a whole if you were to apply for a position in a real call center you would never be asked to provide money for their background check so although a startup cost is acceptable the reasoning behind it doesn't make you all warm and fuzzy about the company as a whole and that won't be your only upfront expense keep in mind that live ops requires you to subscribe to a separate landline phone through your phone company voip like vonage internet phones through your cable company and cell phones are not allowed this dedicated line is going to have an upfront charge for installation and will probably cost you month this is negligable if you plan on working hours a week making the estimated hr that a decent rep makes but if you plan on working less than that you should probably look towards a different opportunity Voice over IP Telephone numbering plan Telephone 9-1-1 Broadband Internet access North American Numbering Plan GSM services Cable television Mutual fund Virgin Mobile Phreaking Blackjack Public transport Internet fraud Internet Private branch exchange Modem Bluetooth Surveillance Microeconomics The Amazing Race Advance fee fraud Verizon Wireless Ocean's Twelve Telkom UK telephone numbering plan Global System for Mobile Communications Student loan Credit card Payphone Teletext BlackBerry IP Multimedia Subsystem Digital Subscriber Line Telephone tapping Software patent debate Sprint Nextel Corporation WiMAX United Kingdom corporation tax Mobile phone Session Initiation Protocol Taxicab E-mail spam Estoppel Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks $ale of the Century Eircom Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Octopus card Home Box Office Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Walt Disney World College Program MMORPG IiNet MSN Messenger Light rail Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Education in Australia Short message service Enhanced 911 Tertiary education fees in Australia FairTax Wal-Mart Graduate school Web hosting Corporate finance Food and Drug Administration Video game developer America Online Battery (electricity) Telephone directory Health insurance Telephone exchange Pretty Good Privacy Rogers Telecom Solar power satellite Federal Communications Commission Solar power Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Opportunity cost Chess strategy and tactics T-Mobile Toll-free telephone number Ra (board game) USA PATRIOT Act Winning Streak 7 July 2005 London bombings Open access Hard disk Subscription business model Acorn Computers Nuclear power Flat tax Optus XML
