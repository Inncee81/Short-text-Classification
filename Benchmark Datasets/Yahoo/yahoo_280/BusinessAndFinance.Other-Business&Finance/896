how do you deal with a leader that refuses to part with information at my job we are working on a project that will span abot years the project manager who is the director of ops refuses to have regular meetings and provide information i think of it as a death march setting us up for failure we all scramble for bits of info to complete our part and without the whole integrated picture this can cause delays frustration and misinformation any attempts to help the pm are brusquely ignored or waved away i think that he does this to make the rest of us look like idiots and he is the savior in any case going to hr does no good i would like to deal with this in an open and honest fashion trying to make him look bad will only backfire and not improve the situation would appreciate you feedback on working with info hoarders and people with power who are insecure in their role i was a project manager for over years and you are in a no win situation you are most likely correct in your assumption of why the pm is not sharing information when you are dealing with this type of personality anything you do will be met with resistance because the pm doe's not want to share power and glory for a job well done if your hr department refuses to deal with this you really cant do a whole lot but set back do the best you can and cover your butt Extreme Programming Corporate governance Strategic management Pretty Good Privacy Poker jargon Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Ethics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Atari 8-bit family Supply and demand Dynamic Systems Development Method The Apprentice 2 Graduate school Product Lifecycle Management Plame affair Management Alex Ferguson PRINCE2 Rational Unified Process Computer Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Internet troll Baseball Twelve leverage points Charmed Project FUBELT A Course In Miracles Central processing unit Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Advance fee fraud Project management software Microphone Asynchronous Transfer Mode Files-11 Information Services Procurement Library Abraham Lincoln CPU cache Stanley Kubrick Public-key cryptography Telephone exchange Software testing Scientology beliefs and practices Great Depression Theory of conduct Quality control Aikido Operational amplifier Green Day Protoss Consensus decision-making Justification (theology) Monty Hall problem X Window System New York Giants Seinfeld Universal Studios Knots Landing Mahendra Chaudhry PaX Mental Health Act 1983 AMD Software engineering Pitaten Internet Group Management Protocol Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Karla Homolka Pittsburgh Steelers Honesty Data Encryption Standard David Bohm Redundant array of independent disks Baseball statistics Lord's Resistance Army Computer security Electronic Arts RISC Enterprise resource planning Martin Scorsese Hardware random number generator Pixar AmigaOS Nicomachean Ethics MS-06 Zaku II United States Strategic Command Religious Society of Friends Paul Martin Grid computing Reputation Rachel Corrie Oakland Athletics Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Mafia (game) Test plan Ethel and Julius Rosenberg Contract 2000 Australian Grand Prix Workplace democracy Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Construction Secret sharing
