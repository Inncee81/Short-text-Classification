where can i find a sticker machine it is not for photo just for text for eg i want to stick it on my jewellery packaging and it reads stainless steel necklace for eg to put text like glow in the dark pendant or the word bracelet or earring etc i think it would be cheaper if you just went to a label manufacturer and order a few hundred or thousand stickers saying stainless steel necklace in the size you want than to buy the machine they come in large sheets containing lots of stickers on each sheet and you just peel them off and stick them on your packaging Bulk vending Brewery Rave party Pearl Stainless steel Dairy Drill bit Filigree Cookware and bakeware Screw Jewellery My Little Pony Steel Laptop Topps USB flash drive Violin Gramophone record Integrated circuit Welding Knife Computer Money Wire Passenger car Laser engraving Postage stamp Magical objects in Harry Potter Turquoise Post office CPU design Phonograph cylinder Dishwasher Autograph Tattoo Floppy disk Where's Wally?
