how long is a billing cycle please help i returned a pair of shoes that i didn't like and the company sent an email saying the credit would be put back on my card but please allow billing cycles what does this mean thanks if we are guessing it may be days times if not then it can be any number of days that they choose to make their standard billing cycle i would call and ask the question i have had some strange experiences with utility companies that issue an invoice and then by the time we get the bill it is due or we have days to pay it it won't even get there in today's snail mail before it will be counted late then there are the late fees so now we pay online which may be exactly why they operate this way they get their money faster and that makes their business better because the faster or more often that you turn your money the wealthier your company gets think about it if you could buy a product sell it immediately restock and sell it again in the same month you have doubled your money in the same month not a bad idea eh my example of the utility company isn't that bad they are just able to probably get one extra month of income by their billing cycle system hmmmm and they all claim to be lowering the rates i guess we need to ask better questions before we buy into that one good luck Credit card Hyperinflation Ashton-Tate Internet fraud Bond SCO-Linux controversies Deflation (economics) Poker jargon Neopets CPU cache Economics United Kingdom corporation tax Mutual fund Mail Mail fraud Craps Contract bridge Money Short selling Wealth Wheel of Fortune Insurance Gross domestic product United States Postal Service Health insurance Citigroup 3dfx GSM services Taxation in the United States Betting (poker) E-mail spam Monetary policy Publicly funded medicine Confidence trick Microeconomics Sears Holdings Corporation Electronic commerce Corporation $ale of the Century Keynesian economics Capitalism Wal-Mart America Online Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Cable television PE ratio Economic growth NVIDIA EFTPOS Enron Corporation Blockbuster Video Password Denis Law Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Student loan Monopoly (game) Toyota Prius Primerica Financial Services 1957 World Series Bank Press Your Luck Live 8 The Joker's Wild Timeline of the Enron scandal Baccarat 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Scrabble (game show) Pentium 4 Card Sharks Pump It Up Eric Bischoff Security (finance) Overclocking Anarchism and capitalism Phishing Dog agility Mortgage Political economy Airline Supply-side economics Microsoft Dividend Punisher Credit card fraud Islamic banking Microsoft Windows Best Buy Topps Numerology Privatization Flat tax 2003 California recall Amway Fiat money Surveillance
