my new shoes are very tight from the side any sugestions hi i buy this pear of shoes it is my size but for some reason it is tight on the side they didn t feel that tight before i buy them i got a very good deal therefore i don t want to return them also it was at a discounted store is there something i can buy that will help stretch it a little or is there anything i can do i appreciate the help thanks well i think that you should return the shoes and get a pair that is your size only it says wide because i think the problem that you are having is that you are getting the right size but they are not wide enough make sure that when you go to the shoe store ask for assistanc and tell them your problems and they will be able to help you another thing is that you want to go shoe shopping at the end of the day because if you do that then your feet will be stressed out and tired from being on them all day and that is the size shoe you will want to get they may be loose when you wear then early in the day but but by the end of the day they wont the problem with getting a shoe that is tigh on the sides is that they can cause a thing called a corn that really hurts good luck High-heeled shoe Sock Horseshoe 1957 World Series Shoe Mattress Diving Upholstery Equine conformation Poker jargon Fecal incontinence Badminton Sears Holdings Corporation Dairy Social aspects of clothing Shoelaces Charles Goodyear About a Boy Retailer Customs and etiquette of Japan Eaton's Curling Drag racing The Beatles discography Escalator Pointe shoes Dr. Martens 2000 Australian Grand Prix Target Corporation Car handling Marilyn Monroe Indian English Quicksort Minor characters in Morrowind Tight end Fast bowling Sento Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Callus Glossary of American football Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters F.W.
