can anyone help me in getting the detailed technical information on the working operation principles protoc can anyone help me in getting the detailed technical information on the working operation principles protocols of standard digital epabx pabx private automatic branch exchange is a telephone exchange operated within an organisation used for switching calls between internal lines and between internal and pstn lines a pabx can route calls without manual intervention based entirely on the number dialed epabx is a pabx built using electronics epabx technology can be divided roughly into four parts a trunk interface that connects the system to the telephone service provider usually t e isdn etc can be also a set of analogue lines in some old systems a station interface that telephone handsets plug into the switching fabric that connects the trunk to the outside line a call control database that handles all the normal features such as call forwarding do not disturb functions and other call control rules the operation principle how this thign works when someone is calling from line out goes on and on from if everythign is successful wait until someone picks up the phone send dial to tone to user wait for the user to dial the number if number was or other dial out code then connect the user line to a free outside line if there is any or try to make a connection to a line indicated by number or send error tones if operation is not possible no such lines system if full with existing calls number not allowed etc making connection controls the switch fabric in epabx detect that call has been connected and store the time when call has been made to epabx information storage possibly print information to printer terminal wait for the call to end disconnect the phone line connection control switch fabric update the stored information on the epabx information storage that call has ended print information on the call to printer terminal send call has ended tone to user wait that the user puts the phone on hook go to state to wait for a new call in addition to those basic steps errors and special situations needs to be take into account all internal lines wait for somedody to make a connection to this line in the following way wait that somebody wants to connect to this line ring the phone line activate ring generator for this line wait that the user picks up the phone stop the ring generator complete the connection to this line connect this line physically to switch fabric signal other parts that connection is made wait for the phone to go back to on hook state discomnect the line disconnect from switch fabric signal that call has ended to rest of the system go back to state there would be one this kind of task running per line in the system which combines those described functions or there one very clever which can handle multiple lines and multiple calls in it this is just basic quicly written down simplified description how those things work can and epabx be desinged using microcontroller c maybe if you don't need very many lines or most fancy features if yes kinldy suggest some idea for the same here are some links to some pbx and telephone information which coudl be useful how a pbx works http www soho telecom com phone systems tutorial how a pbx works html how ip pbx works http techupdate zdnet com techupdate stories main html business telephone systems links http www epanorama net links telephone html business telephone circuits links Toll-free telephone number Federal Standard 1037C Windows XP Blue box Central processing unit Domain Name System Embedded system Common Unix Printing System Redundant array of independent disks Telephone tapping Network Switching Subsystem Gmail Digital circuit Telegraphy Musical Instrument Digital Interface Dual-tone multi-frequency Apollo Guidance Computer Oscilloscope Wireless Application Protocol World Wide Web Transistor Ethernet CPU design Cellular network Digital Subscriber Line Telephone number Universal Serial Bus X.25 Teletext IS-95 Asynchronous Transfer Mode North American Numbering Plan Automatic number identification FidoNet Asterisk PBX ISDN User Part System/36 Ajax (programming) Internet XML TransUnion AppleTalk Web crawler Global System for Mobile Communications Emergency telephone number RISC Konica Minolta JADE programming language Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Time-division multiplexing Markup language System/34 Atari ST Crossbar switch Visual Basic Emacs Mozilla Firefox Wi-Fi Frame relay Communications protocol PHP JavaServer Pages MDAC Global Positioning System Mobile phone Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Rotary dial Cross site scripting NEC Corporation
