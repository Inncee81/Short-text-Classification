i was thinking of starting a non profit business that does it work for local public charity type places it would just be my labor when parts are needed i would sell at cost i'm wondering what kind of tax benefits i could get from it i live in a small area where everyone knows me and calls me for all things involving computers i am the it manager for a local factory i get calls all the time from charity's library museums ect i would like to do a service to the community but i would like to get something out of it as well anybody have any experiences with no profs or tax right offs it's possible of setting up a non profit for this but that takes quite a while for the approval process i've worked for non profits the non profit company wouldn't have to pay taxes but if you're taking money as income from the non profit you would have to for you personally you could set up an llc or s corporation and simply make sure it pays everything it receives to you if the company keeps no money it wouldn't have to pay taxes but you personally would have to pay regardless Tax Corporation Flat tax Anarchism and capitalism United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Insurance Surplus value Life insurance Capitalism Gross domestic product Finance Mutual fund Non-profit organization Capital accumulation Trust (Law) USA Dividend Labor theory of value Economics Productive and unproductive labour Deflation (economics) 401(k) Illegal drug trade Taxation in the United States Wal-Mart United States Postal Service Limited liability company Sweatshop Citigroup Compensation of employees Measures of national income and output Personal finance Variable universal life insurance Health insurance Warren Buffett American individualist anarchism Labor-power FairTax Progressive tax Bulk vending Privatization Economic rent Minimum wage Keynesian economics Mergers and acquisitions Public good Value added tax Prices of production Trade union Price discrimination Offshoring Public policy Income Profit Business Inflation Corporate finance Monetary policy Supply and demand Externality Enron Corporation Property (ownership right) Political subdivisions of New York State Tax bracket Accountancy Islamic banking Andrew Carnegie Cooperative Capital gains tax Unemployment benefit Private highway Financial services Publicly funded medicine Depreciation Commodity Public education Economic inequality Investment bank Leasing Ponzi scheme Expert system Guild Ethical consumerism Bank Credit card Economy of the United States Tesco Airline Income trust Law of value Construction Debt Unemployment types Tax deduction Microcredit Ashton-Tate Employee stock option
