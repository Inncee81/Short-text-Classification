how much do companies usually pay in dividens is it alot or very little i just need to know because i'm trying to figure out how much because i want to know how much its worth it and how it can help you with income no one seems to be giving a price idea is it between dollars or less just a rough guess here but typically to of the stock price there are exceptions with some industries paying up to or so but the amount varies you can't count on per year but will get this is some years in others years maybe alot less but these are special cases like closed ended funds and reits look this up if you aren't sure what i'm talking about also for my money this is a lousy way to get paid the dividends are taxed as profit by the company and taxed on you by the irs so essentially they are taxed twice sure the money only comes out of your pocket once but the extra tax still reduces what the company pays out so it does still hurt you Mutual fund Dividend Tax Taxation in the United States Income trust Microeconomics Insurance United Kingdom corporation tax Warren Buffett Progressive tax Bond 401(k) Corporation PE ratio Inflation Corporate finance Income Hyperinflation Annuity Trust (Law) USA Health insurance Employee stock option FairTax Capital accumulation Capital gains tax Capitalism Publicly funded medicine Tax avoidance/evasion Keynesian economics Supply-side economics Lloyd's of London Economy of Russia Stock Variable universal life insurance Wal-Mart Deflation (economics) Short selling Money Illegal drug trade Credit card NASDAQ Donald Trump Enron Corporation Gold as an investment Sears Holdings Corporation Supply and demand Mikhail Khodorkovsky Public good Economic rent U.S. public debt Education in the United States Minimum wage Retirement plan Dividend imputation Mergers and acquisitions Non-profit organization Cost of capital Guaranteed minimum income Social Security debate (United States) Tariff Income tax Betting (poker) Privatization Monopoly (game) Bank Value added tax Gross domestic product Monetary policy Temasek Holdings Hedge fund American International Group Social Security (United States) Life insurance Gold standard Blackjack Price discrimination One.Tel Canadian and American economies compared Preferred stock Earned income tax credit Investment bank Stock market Federal Reserve Labor theory of value National Insurance Tax bracket Arbitrage Tax protester Rational pricing Surplus value Ponzi scheme Wheel of Fortune Arthur Laffer Software patent debate U.S. Internal Revenue Service Limited liability company Wealth condensation Tax resistance
