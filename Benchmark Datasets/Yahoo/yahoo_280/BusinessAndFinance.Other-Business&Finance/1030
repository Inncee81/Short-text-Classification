i happened to see an accounting question on 'debit what comes in credit what goes out etc' my question is what would be the original explanation that made this rule of 'debit what comes in credit what goes out credit the giver debit the receiver debit expense credit incomde ' was this all by dumb chance or are there any good acceptable explanation behind at least one thing what i can't find an answer for as an engineer is when you receive cash your accounting books increase the cash account by debitting it the word debit comes from latin debt which means to owe so how would money received for sales become a 'debit' or are the accountants just use the terminology debit credit instead of saying enter on left hand side lhs right hand side rhs saying lhs rhs for me would be more sensible and less confusing any explanation to this please help me understand actually the words debit and credit come from the latin words debere and credere meaning left and right that's what they mean nothing else debit means left and credit means right assets are on the left side of the balance sheet they are increased with debits liabilities and equity accounts are on the right they are increased with credits income is increased with a credit because it is ultimately adding to equity expenses are increased with debits because they ultimately decrease equity when you make a journal entry the debits are always on the left and credits on the right this is not by accident debits on the left credits on the right here's a link for you to check out http learning swc hccs edu members paul brady overview html Double-entry book-keeping Debit card Credit card Bank Personal finance Financial audit United Kingdom corporation tax Finance Asset Monetary policy Money Bond Accounting methods Liability Corporate finance Microeconomics Government debt Tax Financial statements Mortgage Mergers and acquisitions Contract Financial services Collateralized debt obligation Accountancy Money supply Debt levels and flows Internet fraud Deflation (economics) Income statement FairTax Warner Music Group Stock Security (finance) Schabir Shaik Trial Automated Clearing House Capital accumulation Depreciation Payroll Slot machine Automatic teller machine Cheque Bank fraud Model (economics) Life insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Gross domestic product Poker jargon Supply-side economics Derivative (finance) Money creation Surplus value Economy of Russia Article One of the United States Constitution Merit Credit card fraud Science Law of value Cost of capital Taxation in the United States SmartRider Electronic money Primerica Financial Services Betting (poker) Insurance Euro Interac Inventory Arthur Laffer Short selling Economy of India EBITDA Ford Motor Company Annuity Causality MetroCard Inflation Capitalism Balance of payments Hyperinflation Real estate developer Pension Federal National Mortgage Association Income trust History of the English Bible PE ratio Fractional-reserve banking E-ZPass Stored-value card Divorce Mutual fund Estoppel Left-handed Oral sex Small business $ale of the Century
