do u think dinar iraq currency is getting better any time soon my friend is buying dinar he's hopping soon that dinar is getting better that time he going sell his dinar and he offering me to do the same thing that's why i asking because i see at central bank of iraq website dinar is getting worse everyday but i know eventually dinar going to be better but is it going to happen soon well it has been on a good trend upward for a while now if it adjusts just pip every day the dinar will be equal to the dollar in short years is that likely no so probably more like seven years if the government makes the right decisions once iraq starts pulling in foriegn investment and produicing its abundant reserves it will continue an upward course and until it is on par with other oil producing countries in the region the country has a long way to go changing the infrastructure and the hearts minds and corruption of the residents is going to be equally difficult but essential in restoring iraq to it's former glory so yes it will go up but it will take a long time good things are worth the wait i hope for the people of iraq it does not take too long hopefully the country can do something like alaska does and give back portions of the oil profits to the citizens not just the greedy politicians and businessmen the easiest way to do that would be to revalue the currency placing more money in their pockets Iraqi dinar Hyperinflation Inflation Monetary policy Gold standard United States dollar Money Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Kuwaiti dinar Privatization Currency Free trade Bretton Woods system Iraq Deflation (economics) Euro Microeconomics Gold as an investment Capitalism Exchange rate Asian financial crisis Gross domestic product Kuwait Economy of Russia Short selling Economy of Nigeria Economy of Kuwait Economy of the United States ISO 4217 Jordan Capital accumulation Hong Kong dollar Coalition Provisional Authority U.S. public debt Money supply Economy of Romania Marshall Plan Economy of Europe Serbia and Montenegro International Monetary Fund Foreign exchange market Gold Bank Bechtel Corporation Wealth Gay rights in Iraq Bond Political corruption Devaluation Economy of Serbia and Montenegro Romanian leu Iraq War Economy of Africa Economy of Iraq Economy of Pakistan Eurozone Say's law Economy of Tunisia Fiat money Liberty Dollar Supply-side economics Globalization Temasek Holdings Renminbi Economy of the Republic of Ireland Economy of Ghana Serbian dinar Federal Reserve Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 George W.
