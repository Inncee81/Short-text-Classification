anyone find it odd that the u s unemployment rate is at almost all the time o k today i get the report that the unemployment rate has reached percent but for the most part of this year and last year the unemployment rate has been at i mean for every single month it was percent do you think they way they are calculating these numbers are suspect it hasn't reached or it is almost always well the economy added jobs for the month of july and i don't think that is good news that is mighty weak how can the economy be in such great shape when it has added such weak numbers doesn't make sense who was it that said lies damn lies and statistics unemployment is a government manufactured statistic that undergoes mucho manipulation first the dol estimates that some percentage of americans is always out of work or chronically unemployed so they're not counted at all second unemployment insurance runs out after months so people who continue to search for jobs or give up looking for jobs are not counted as unemployed finally we count americans currently drawing benefits vs those jobs added the ones dropping off prior to months come up with some reasonable number and go with it some years back i believe it was greenspan who said the unemployment rate for a healthy economy should be at least so the workforce stays nicely pliable some people thought that was rather draconian so in recent years the statistic conveniently stays under to answer your question yes the number is a load of s Unemployment Labour economics Social Security (United States) Unemployment benefit Economy of the United States Gross domestic product Inflation Economic inequality Capitalism Economy of Russia Economy of Fiji Wal-Mart Reaganomics Doomsday argument George W.
