why are there still labor unions in america would we be better or worse off without them in states where labor unions are heavy the cost of living is much higher and taxes usually too in those open shop states with few if any labor unions the cost of living is lower along with taxes of course the wages in open shop states are less too what is the answer here are labor unions a big player in why jobs are being shipped overseas or is that just massive corporate greed is everyone with a k a contributor to jobs being shipped overseas if you want your returns higher than you work to get the company to cut costs and labor is a huge cost especially when you add in benefits it is solely because of the advent of unions that we have standards that must be adhered to by all employers unions paved the way for better working conditions as a whole for everyone in this country not just unions unions are the great equalizer to the tyranical ceo who if they could would pay everyone pennies on the dollar and do away with all benefits we see this happening even today in the airline industry the heads of the comapny are slowly breaking the unions and now have been able to get out of paying pensions to retired pilots who depend on that money unions tend to get the brunt of negative media especially when there is some strike happening don't be fooled it takes a a huge sacrifice and enormous leap of faith to go out on strike union members are often made out to be greedy in wanting more but i assure you it is a micro fraction of the money that the companies and ceo' s are putting in their pockets in the case of the airlines strikes of the 's it was union members getting fed up with having to take concessions over the years for the good of the company only to have promises broken by management when it was time to make good on those promises if unions die off in this country we are in for serious trouble you think outsourcing jobs to india is bad pfffft in my opinion people who talk down about unions are living in severe ignorance and aught not open their mouth until they get un ignered Trade union Outsourcing Microeconomics Airline Sweatshop Wal-Mart Inflation Free trade Tariff Life insurance Capitalism Offshoring Unemployment Social Security (United States) Labor theory of value Capital accumulation Tax Enron Corporation Progressive tax Privatization Deflation (economics) United Kingdom corporation tax Pension 401(k) Social Security debate (United States) Anarchism and capitalism Mutual fund Taxation in the United States Insurance Flat tax Keynesian economics Natural monopoly Economic inequality Salary cap Economy of India 2004-05 NHL lockout Health insurance History of the United States (1918-1945) Graduate school Economy of the United States Publicly funded medicine Transport Workers Union of America Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bretton Woods system U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 History of the United States (1865-1918) Labour economics Northwest Airlines Subsidy Ryanair Ponzi scheme Industrial Revolution Hyperinflation United States labor law Great Depression in the United Kingdom Apple Computer Economy of Norway Annuity United States Postal Service Kyoto Protocol United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America British Airways Frank Lorenzo Economy of Russia Economic history of Britain Price discrimination Surplus value Great Depression Wayne Corporation Australian labour movement Value added tax Labor-power United States dollar Gold standard Welding Supply and demand Monetary policy Diseconomies of scale Economy of France Freeters Unemployment benefit Economy of Africa FairTax Working time Canadian and American economies compared Blackjack International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union Politics of the United States Trickle down effect Criticism of libertarianism Culture of the United States Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards
