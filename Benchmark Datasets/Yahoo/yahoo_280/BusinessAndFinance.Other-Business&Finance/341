how to send a money order okay im ordering e l f makeup from eyeslipsface com and paying with a money order and i was wondering who do i make the money order out to and i know i can go to the currency exchange to get money orders but do they send it out or can they give it to me and i can send it out if they send it out then do i have to give them my order form for the makeup i've never ever send a money order so i don't know how this work so can anyone please explain this to me i was also wondering how much it would cost if the money order was about dollars please and thank you well i will start with the last part of this question first based on what we have here in ohio about the cost of money orders when you get the money order not only do you hand the clerk the dollars to cover the money order but the processing fee as well usually cent to dollar as the processing fee depening on store where the money order is issued at and company the money order is drawn on like moneygram or western union the list goes on and on as to companies who issue money orders what they do after that is print up a check looking item which you make out to the company listed on eyeslipface com's website as to who to make it out to the money order itself will have a perforated edge along the bottom border and you tear off that perforation because what is actualy between them is a small flimsy layer of a carbon paper like material you keep this and the bottom copy as your reciept also that way if the company does not mail out your products through the postal mail or a delivery service like fed ex depending on who they use because they did not get payment you can put what is called a tracer on the money order which will track down where the money order is who has it and if it was cashed who endorsed it to get the money for it what happens next after you make it out is put it into a mail envelope with a stamp on it and put the money order's top copy in it with a printed out copy of the order form and drop it in your local postal mail drop box meaning a mailbox for the mail carrier to pick up or a post office mailbox somewhere nearby after that you put the copy you kept when you made out the money order and wait on delivery of the makeup oh you include a printed out copy of the order form so the company knows what you ordered to send you otherwise you will never get your makeup as they will just think you are sending them money without knowing what you ordered and will probly not deliver your makeup oh and also print another copy of your makeup order form also for your records untill the makeup is delivered that way if something gets goofed up which it sometimes does you have proof of what you ordered and payment you got and mailed them so you still have a chance of getting your makeup that you ordered but that is just good common sense because goofs do happen occaisionally and if ordering something from anywhere it's always best to keep all records of what was ordered how much it was and things like that till the item is directly in your hands or delivered to your home or wherever you are having it delivered to so that if a goof does happen you can still have a chance of getting what you ordered and paid for hope that helped Postage stamp Mail fraud Post office Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Internet fraud Direct marketing E-mail Surveillance United States dollar Hyperinflation Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Royal Mail Money Currency Credit card E-mail spam Envelope Make money fast Poker jargon Stamp collecting Mac OS X Gold standard Apple Open Collaboration Environment Inflation Banknote Short selling Deflation (economics) Philatelic literature Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Monetary policy Insurance GSM services Domain Name System Security (finance) Private Express Statutes Open access Wal-Mart FairTax Public-key cryptography Mail art Bond Spam (electronic) Euro Gross domestic product Microeconomics Money supply Public domain Liberty Dollar Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Brit - British) United Parcel Service Screenplay Postmark Animal Crossing Cable television Postcode Automatic teller machine Xerox Flat tax Royal Assent Commodity markets Canada Health Act Monopoly (game) Fiat money Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Ce - Ch) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Postal authority Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Newspaper Casting Gramophone record SCO-Linux controversies Bank fraud Legal research Let's Make a Deal Arbitrage Solar cell Online shop Penny Black Notary public Copyright 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Government debt Enterprise content management Canadian dollar Charles Ponzi Taxation in the United States Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Ma - Md) Tax
