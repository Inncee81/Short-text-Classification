is the country headed for a recession with the sub prime mess and the mortgage companies going broke and the stock market falling is this leading to a recession or just a industry slow down for housing related jobs what are you doing to prepare and how long till recession gets bad leave out the politic crap that does nothing for the answer i really don't think so the sub prime mess has to do entirely with bad mortgage loans i hate to say it but frankly if those mortgage companies made bad loans and someone invested their money in them by buying the loans then i have no simpathy for either the lendor or the investor if they fail so be it i'm tired of my tax dollar being used to bail out everyone out who makes stupid investments that having been said no i don't think it's serious enough to cause a recession however i am one who would like to see interest rates increase marginally remember whenever someone is helped by low rates there is an equal or greater number of people who are hurt by low rates consider all the retired folks on fixed incomes who now have so little income from their savings they are eating dog food guess that's another topic eh Deflation (economics) Mortgage Bank Inflation Economy of the United States Mutual fund Supply-side economics FairTax 401(k) Recession Life insurance Asian financial crisis Personal finance Saving (economics) History of the United States (1918-1945) Say's law Primerica Financial Services Federal National Mortgage Association Keynesian economics Deficit spending Progressive tax Debt Free trade Bretton Woods system Annuity Economy of Russia Taxation in the United States Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Mergers and acquisitions Security (finance) Privatization Economy of Argentina Toronto-Dominion Bank Financial markets Economy of Pakistan Great Depression Interest Economy of Chile United Kingdom corporation tax Capital accumulation PE ratio Reaganomics Real estate bubble Stock Government National Mortgage Association Insurance Donald Trump Surplus value Student loan Microcredit Economy of India Arbitrage Euro Margaret Thatcher Islamic banking Derivative (finance) Stock market Gold standard Federal Reserve Business cycle Fixed income Economy of Venezuela Finance Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Dividend Arthur Laffer Labour economics Economy of the Philippines Warren Buffett Municipal bond Citigroup Money supply Pound sterling Margin (finance) Microeconomics Short selling U.S. public debt Gross domestic product Late 1980s recession Hedge fund Capitalism Savings and loan association Conglomerate (company) Subsidy Tax Reform Act of 1986 Charles Ponzi Corporate finance Trickle down effect Corporation Tax cut Economic relations of Japan Yield curve
