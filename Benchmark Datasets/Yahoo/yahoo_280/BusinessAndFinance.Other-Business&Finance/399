wich one would you pick ok there are schools that i m interested the first one is minutes walking from my home and the second one is minutes driving the first one is months long and the second one is months the first one starts at am and finishes at pm but the second one starts at pm and finishes around the first one is more expansive than the second one witch one would you pick well i wouldn't choose because of those categories for my top reasons i'd choose because if it was a good school or not if it got a good reputation with the businesses in that area or in the state you live in you can call and find out if they are accredited which will put you in good standing with businesses if they are then it all depends on how you are going to get to school from there are you going to drive take the bus factor in your expenses and if you think gas is going to come up to or about the same as the for that year then i would say go for the st one because the hours are more reasonable you can get off early have more time to do homework and not have to worry about rush hour in the afternoon good luck with your decision i know they are tough New York Giants Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers Social rule Shaggy dog story Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March 2000 Australian Grand Prix Humphrey Bogart Hard disk Indianapolis 500 Time Out of Mind Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Norway national football team Dorama Education in the United States 2004 American League Championship Series Education in Romania Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Ben Johnson (athlete) Mutual fund Carolina Panthers Juris Doctor Sydney Riot of 1879 The Amazing Race New England Patriots Yao Ming Iron Bowl Gameplay of StarCraft Softball The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe GED Taxicab Penske Racing Hitchhiking Education in Germany History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) 2004 World Series Transportation of Los Angeles James Hanratty 2005 World Series About a Boy Nuclear power Mattress President (game) San Francisco 49ers Iditarod West Side Highway Insurance Drag racing Daylight saving time Driver's license Toronto Raptors Lake Speed Hiawatha Line 1957 World Series Hendrick Motorsports New York Jets Baseball 24 Hours of Le Mans Mies Grade (education) The Midnight Sun Scuba set Theory of conduct Bond 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Gliding STS-61 Washington Monument Troms__ I.L.
