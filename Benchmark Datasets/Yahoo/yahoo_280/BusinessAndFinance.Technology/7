how many jobs have you gone through before you found one that was meant for you i'm in my mid twenties and am having a hard time finding a job i enjoy the longest job i've had was for years about years ago i've done all different kinds of work and probably had about jobs in the past years is this normal to not know what you want to do yet i already graduated from college please share your experiences i am now and was like you at that age i still seek to find the work that pleases me most i think that some of us were born to be discontent with working for others in general maybe you need to find something that interests you and pursue a way to make it profitable for you personally for instance if you are into make up and are a social creature maybe mary kay is a way to go they have a good plan and it pays of sales revenue plus bonuses and downline sales residuals or maybe you have just had bad luck finding a nurturing environment for your skills and motivations i am yo and have had over jobs in my working career since age plus side work for myself the longest job i have had has been about months most were months i found a great job in broadcasting that i really enjoyed the work was easy and i loved it the people and the work place was advanced and caring everything was rosy until my father got cancer and died through family issues selling the house and moving away from the area i gave up that job but i didn't realize how good it was until i had other experience to reflect upon later now i am floundering trying to find my place again part of my problem has been poor compensation it was hand to mouth wages for exhausting or demeaning work or conditions it makes it hard when your boss is driving a mercedes lives in a new house paid for buys a limited edition harley and then complains that you are poorly motivated but won't give a lousy dollar hour raise yeah spread the wealth at least let me make enough to pay my bills and eat more than beans and rice this is why i am trying to work for myself the people that prosper usually have something of their own that makes them money besides their 'day job' this creates wealth aside from the bread and butter job that pays the bills the sideline should be something that you enjoy something that you excel at or have had success doing and can be done profitably on a part time basis at first you might try counseling from professional career counselors at your state employment agency local university or your alma mater probably has placement assistance that provide skill assessment testing employment outlook information or at least a jobs board that can help you find something suitable if you can't find that one thing that inspires you do like i did start trying things even on a whim to see if you enjoy it get inside the industry even at entry level and research the people in the organization to see how they advanced or how they enjoy what they do what do you have to lose ask pry if you dont' like it find a new job and move on no love lost no broken dreams just good solid learning and experience eliminate the things you can't do won't do or have no interest in then see what is left then reassess your willingness number one thing to remember is that your satisfaction is priority one you will never be satisfied with anything nor successful with anything you do if you are not involved and invested mind body soul and spirit find your true passion like working with children or the sick or finance or music or travel then find a way to make that passion earn 'some' money it doesn't have to be great pay or even good pay but something coming in as you grow in the field it will grow to fit your needs i would rather work my entire life for free doing something i love than to be wealthy and do something i can't look myself in the face for doing god has a special plan for your life and he is calling you to it be still be true to your self and who god made you to be and dive deeply into that with trust in god and with a hope that goes beyond what you can see or even understand god will do the rest have faith your waiting and struggles will be rewarded manifold world peace
