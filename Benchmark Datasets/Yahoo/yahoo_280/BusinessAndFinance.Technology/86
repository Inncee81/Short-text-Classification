when writing a thank you letter after an interview should it be typed or handwritten i know that handwritten seems more personable but to me it doesn't look very professional zoo b cool i can sincerely appreciate what you expressed on the comparison of hand written vs typed on the thank you note given the fact that these professionals interviewed you in person and may or may not be aware of other interviews you may or may not be attempting your typed thank you note may give the impression that it was generated automatically with countless others that you have interviewed with my suggestion i recommend the hand written note and thanks expressed to each of the individuals in the room if you can recall their names use first names only if you feel confident you scored high during the round of discussion if you are uncertain how your answers were interpreted then use mr ms etc i hope this helps and best of luck on the outcome sincerely gerry A Course In Miracles Killian documents Social rule Charles Darwin's views on religion Tactical voting United States Postal Service Slow Train Coming Contract Quizbowl Autism Sharon Tate Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Polymorphism (computer science) Free will Mediation Scientology beliefs and practices Breastfeeding 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, exit polls Ra (board game) Professional wrestling Simon Commission Reparative therapy Plame affair Causality The Contender (television series) Transsexuality English grammar Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs XML Internet troll Milton H.
