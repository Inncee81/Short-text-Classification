how can you tell if a newborn has an upset tummy my four week old is breastfed and we supplement with formula at night last night i nursed her for an hour then she ate more than oz of formula she was crying and rooting and refusing her paci so figured she was hungry overnight she grunted a lot more than usual and she didn't sleep very well til she filled her diaper yellow and seedy around am she then snacked a bit and she's been snacking all day not eally eating much at all and seemingly getting the sleep she didn't get last night lately she has been starving before bed and we can't seem to fill her up but last night made me wonder if either my milk or formula is giving her a belly ache i guess i can't tell by her cries she doesn't have a fever she might have had a little upset tummy because she needed to poop since she did that this morning she's now probably tired from last night and just needs to sleep she's growing and will go through cycles where she eats like a pig some days and snacks on others she may be wanting more to eat at night because she's starting to get ready to sleep through the night for you so needs a fuller belly if she seems content today just a little tired just let her be as long as she is eating some and going pee pee she should be fine sounds like her poop is normal for a newborn so i wouldn't worry too much if you've just recently started supplementing formula she could be reacting to that she could also be reacting to something you ate spicy food gassy foods remember if it makes you fart it will make her fart too good luck Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Guinea pig Pitaten Cat Infant Care Bears Toilet humour Ron and Fez Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cuisine of the Philippines Elephant Flatulence The Contender (television series) Breakfast Insomnia Social rule Fecal incontinence EastEnders Childbirth Humphrey Bogart Garfield Comanche Urinary incontinence Indianapolis 500 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Super Milk-chan Show The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sleep Pok__mon Live!
