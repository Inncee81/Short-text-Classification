year old and newborn i have a year old son and am expecting a new baby at the end of december they are going to share a room but my mother in law has me nervous about them being alone together at night my room is right next door and i have become a very light sleeper my son is very good at following the rules and is very caring i know he would never purposely hurt the baby but like i said my mother in law has me worried anyone else had to put a young child new born in the same room any advice i don't know about sharing a room that quickly only because the year old is going to have lots of adjustments to go through with the new baby anyway maybe you should ease him into sharing his room too i would get a bassinet and keep the newborn in your room for the first months letting baby nap in older child's room during the day this way he gets used to the crying schedule and sharing in moderation also i would be afraid of the baby waking up the year old constantly at night Breastfeeding Childbirth Melanie Wilkes Jon Secada Infant EastEnders Heart of Gold (Firefly) Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Cliff Richard Ayyavazhi mythology Jam (TV series) Pregnancy Social rule Sleep Premature birth What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
