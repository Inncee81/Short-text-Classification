i'm so scared i may have to raise him by myself my fiance and i have been having problems ever since our son was born he's now months i try to make things work but he won't talk to me about our relationship he doesnt help out with the baby and is always angry at something we fight over littlest things he says i always b tch but how can i not when i'm the only one getting up at night he works hours a week and thinks he doesnt have to do anything else it's just a mess so last night i packed a few things and left took the baby to my mothers house and we're currently there i called him last night and he was out with his friend i tried talking again nothing he said he didn't feel like talking and he'd call back never did havent heard from him he left money for baby stuff as i asked i pray every night that things get better and we can be a family i'm scared that i have to raise this baby myself i will have to have jobs my son won't even know who his mommy is if i filed for child support it wouldnt even cover all of baby's daycare for a week i know everything happens for a reason but i think i made a big mistake i love my son more than anything and want him to have a good life and happy mom and i feel i will be alone for the rest of my life i cannot imagine myself with someone else and i don't want my baby to have a step farther you just hang in there and god will take care of you he gave you a wonderful blessing and he will not let you down as far as dad he is the dad so he has a right to see his child but if he's going to do his own thing anyway like hang out with his friends and not return phone calls it's probably best that you take care of your son yourself a child doesn't need to live in a house with angry unhappy parents good luck to you and god bless EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Grandview, U.S.A.
