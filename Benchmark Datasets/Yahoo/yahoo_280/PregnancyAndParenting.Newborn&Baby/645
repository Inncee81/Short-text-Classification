my son refuses to eat what to do my son is mnths old and he hate to eat vegetables he only want sweet stuff like cereals in the morning and fruits in the afternoon he drinks the bottle but when it comes to vegtables he cried like i am killing him i tried to force him he vomits the food sometimes he prefers to sleep than to eat until i gave up the plan and give him his bottle months is a little too young to be forcing foods on if he doesn't want them at this age he should be just experimenting with new tastes and textures and it can take a number of tries before a baby accepts a new food so continue to offer small tastes of different foods provided that they're age appropriate but don't worry if he doesn't eat them for now give him what he will eat he should still be relying primarily on formula or breastmilk for nourishment anyway solids should be just a supplement and not a major portion of his diet until closer to or months do make sure that the things you are giving him are nutritious though he shouldn't be eating any sugary cereals at this point oatmeal or cheerios are good options it sounds like he's eating fruit okay so that's good enough for now you might try to introduce some of the sweeter veggies such as sweet potatoes or creamed corn and see if he likes those but if not don't worry about it too much just yet Breakfast Breastfeeding Breakfast cereal Vegetarianism Cuisine of Denmark Food Cuisine of the Philippines Hamster Jewish cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Veganism Fecal incontinence Bread Potato New Coke Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Trailer Park Boys Organic food Roman eating and drinking Plantain Sweetcorn Snack food Mountain Dew Cuisine of Malaysia Peruvian cuisine Bengali cuisine Little Britain Wine Tea Soup Tofu Fancy rat Healthy eating Chocolate Domestic rabbit Cuisine of the Southern United States Porridge Cuisine of Africa Folic acid Barbecue Cat McDonald's Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Argentina 613 mitzvot Hamburger Vegetarianism and religion Cha chaan teng Shaggy dog story French cuisine Soft drink Carnivore Pizza Coca-Cola Sugar substitute Fast food Russian cuisine Dumpling Cheese Dieting Singlish Fasting Knots Landing Guinea pig Fish and chips Cuisine of Singapore FoxTrot Beer Adjustable gastric band Hot dog Soybean Ramen Atkins Nutritional Approach Full English breakfast Fruits Basket Domesticated turkey Oreo The Coca-Cola Company Peanut butter Maize Chili con carne John the Baptist The Wack Pack Famine Characters in the Smurfs Tooth Polish cuisine
