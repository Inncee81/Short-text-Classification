how do i stop my twin girls from hitting each other my month old twins hit each other alot lately it could be over anything we have so many toys and then if raji takes it first then maahi wants it too is it common for twins to copy each other how do i get them to stop hitting each other sorry no solution for you but i am happy to see that it is not only my twins and i don't think getting of the same would help since they seem to want what the other one has no matter what it is what i do is give back the toy to the one who originally had it and say to the other to wait for his turn like he understands lol but i figure i might as well start teaching them now Kodocha Kim Possible: So the Drama Dog training Journey (band) 1987 World Series Exact solutions in general relativity Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Isley Brothers Hilary Duff The Shining (film) Torii Hunter Jon Secada 10cc Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Charles Lee Ray Weezer Faye Wong Umphrey's McGee Tenshinhan The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Knots Landing The Jazz Singer It's Walky!
