just had a baby am i healing correctly i had a baby three weeks ago and i had an episiotomy with him i am no longer still leaking blood but i am still leaking some kind of brown liquid with a real bad odor i'm not sure if it's from my episiotomy or something with my uterus i know for a fact i don't have an infection but i don't know if its normal to be leaking this or if i need to call my doctor i thought i might have had an infection two weeks so i called the dr and they put me on an antibiotic to clear it up so i'm pretty sure its not infected i finished up my medicine last thursday also the liquid is real thin and doesn't look to me like brown blood not saying its not just that it seems like it might be something else dear brand new mommy that is still just residual fluids from your uterus and most likely perfectly normal blood will turn brown and get a foul odor after an extended time you will probably be leaking fluids for up to weeks as everything is contracting back into shape if you begin to run a fever or show other signs of infection certainly do call your doctor and go back for a check up prior to your week visit don't do things like douching right now as you could actually upset the natural balance of things and cause an infection just shower normally and maybe use a scented powder to feel more fresh of course any questions you have can be directed to the nurses at your doctor's office they are there to help and should have no problem answering them don't be afraid to ask Childbirth Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Fecal incontinence Pneumonia Miscarriage Traumatic brain injury Dialysis Breech birth Guinea pig Malaria Suture Psoriasis Intravenous therapy Obstetrics Cystoscopy Birth control Cat Eczema Marburg virus Theory of conduct Chronic fatigue syndrome Diarrhea Pregnancy Cirrhosis First aid Carburetor Cancer Stroke Diabetic retinopathy Humphrey Bogart The Ashlee Simpson Show Philosophy of language Time Out of Mind Puberty Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Medicine Endocarditis Abortion Tuberculosis Liquid breathing Bone marrow transplant Downing Street memo Babe Ruth Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Common cold Traditional Chinese medicine Quarantine In vitro fertilisation Gastroparesis Carbon dioxide Scientology beliefs and practices 2001 anthrax attacks Billboard Hot 100 Friends Shock Social rule Blood Prenatal diagnosis Metroid (video game species) Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Milton H.
