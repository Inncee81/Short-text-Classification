would you leave your baby over night so my husband just sprung on me this morning that he has been saving money for a cruise and wants to go on one for our th anniversary i was shocked and excited but then reality set in our youngest will only be months old i have never left any of my other children overnight until they were a year old the cruise is going to be for nights so it will actually be because we would have to fly to florida first not only that but i excusivelly breastfeed i am touched he went through so much to surprise me but i am really nervous leaving for that long what would you do how do i tell him my concerns without sounding ungrateful thank you for all of your advice i too exclusively breastfeed and i understand your hesitancy you just need to sit down and talk it through maybe have a year anniversary cruise when the baby is old enough or maybe bring the baby along and go now although that wouldn't be much of a vacation for you how very nice of your husband to do this for you but i would really suggest putting it off to when you wouldn't feel bad about leaving overnight aren't breastfeeding and have some real time together to relax and celebrate Breastfeeding Childbirth Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avenue Q Pet Sounds Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ron and Fez Blood on the Tracks 2005 trial of Michael Jackson EastEnders Days of our Lives Neighbours Fertility awareness Theory of conduct The Pet Sounds Sessions USS Yorktown (CV-10) USS Toledo (CA-133) Fiddler on the Roof Disneyland Pregnancy Humphrey Bogart Stewie Griffin Stuttering Oasis (band) Al Gore AFI 100 Years series Blonde on Blonde Beetle in an Anthill USS Forrestal (CVA-59) The Beach Boys Jon Secada Emperor Xuan of Han Kodocha Lauren Bacall USS Texas (BB-35) Boston Public Satchel Paige Characters in the Smurfs Rais massacre Co-sleeping Bon Jovi USS America (CV-66) Ocean's Twelve USS Wasp (CV-18) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Teen Girl Squad Germaine Greer Cliff Richard USS Turner Joy (DD-951) Late Night with Conan O'Brien Marilyn Monroe Montreal Screwjob Bringing It All Back Home Brian Lenihan Major League Baseball television contracts Rosa Parks Too Short a Season (TNG episode) The Ashlee Simpson Show Slow Train Coming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Time Out of Mind First Battle of the Atlantic Charmed Music radio USS Waters (DD-115) Phil Hendrie Spice Girls Babe Ruth Saturday Night Live Cruising (maritime) About a Boy USS Ticonderoga (CV-14) The Shining (film) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Melanie Wilkes The Masters Apprentices Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Taxi Driver Social rule Reservoir Dogs Mojave people Urinary incontinence Professional wrestling slang A Series of Unfortunate Events Sharon Tate Infant Heart of Gold (Firefly) Cyberspace Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina History of As the World Turns (1990-1999) Love You Baby Blues Indianapolis 500 Phoebe Halliwell The Subtle Knife John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Robert Schumann
