what do i do if i cant sleep at night because i cant get comfortable i hate it why cant you sleep on your stomach finding a good sleeping position early in your pregnancy try to get into the habit of sleeping on your side lying on your side with your knees bent is likely to be the most comfortable position as your pregnancy progresses it also makes your heart's job easier because it keeps the baby's weight from applying pressure to the large vein called the inferior vena cava that carries blood back to the heart from your feet and legs some doctors specifically recommend that pregnant women sleep on the left side because your liver is on the right side of your abdomen lying on your left side helps keep the uterus off that large organ ask what your doctor recommends in most cases lying on either side should do the trick and help take some pressure off your back but don't drive yourself crazy worrying that you might roll over onto your back during the night shifting positions is a natural part of sleeping that you can't control most likely during the third trimester of your pregnancy your body won't shift into the back sleeping position anyway because it will be too uncomfortable if you do shift onto your back and the baby's weight presses on your inferior vena cava the discomfort will probably wake you up see what your doctor recommends about this he or she may suggest that you use a pillow to keep yourself propped up on one side try experimenting with pillows to discover a comfortable sleeping position some women find that it helps to place a pillow under their abdomen or between their legs also using a bunched up pillow or rolled up blanket at the small of your back may help to relieve some pressure in fact you'll find that there are many pregnancy pillows on the market if you're thinking about purchasing one talk with your doctor first about which one might work for you Inferior vena cava Mattress Obstetrics Professional wrestling holds Childbirth Liver Urinary incontinence Breech birth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pregnancy Stomach cancer Abdomen Friends Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fetus Abortion Miscarriage Intravenous therapy Atrial septal defect Skateboarding trick Aerial (dance move) Recovery position Heart Kidney Prostate cancer Knots Landing Spina bifida Vein EastEnders Equine conformation Professional wrestling attacks Anal sex Chair Strap-on dildo Oral contraceptive Renal cell carcinoma Pulmonary embolism Hypertension Chest Deep vein thrombosis Fertility awareness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Autonomic nervous system Spanking Sleeping Murder Sudden infant death syndrome Turner syndrome Professional wrestling aerial techniques History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Aorta Diabetic retinopathy Sexual intercourse Liver transplantation Varicocele Weight training Endometriosis Myocardial infarction Menstrual cup Jam (TV series) Kurt Cobain Insomnia Swingout Upholstery Menstrual cycle Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cirrhosis Suplex Masturbation Intact dilation and extraction Backstroke Days of our Lives Fight Club Birth weight Sleep apnea Humphrey Bogart Cancer Cowboy Horizontal bar Tocopherol Suicide methods Massage Abortion in the United States Prolactinoma Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Birth control One Tree Hill (TV series) First aid Heart valve
