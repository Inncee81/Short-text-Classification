when should i ween my month old off her pacifier i want to get rid of it before she starts crawling and walking ive seen too many year olds walking around sucking away and i dont like that idea i want it to be as painless as possible for my daughter and me she doesnt use it unless we are putting her to sleep and i am not a fan of the 'cry it out' method any tips you seem to be aware of breaking the habit so i don't think you will let it go too far there are people who do not give their children a pacifier at all and others who let it go past two years which is a problem months old may be too young to take her off of it you are not overusing it in fact you are already using it sparingly so my thought would be to continue to use it at bedtime and as you have until you really feel it's time to let it go probably between months or as you discern but the common thought is it should be done before potty training she will put up a fuss but that is to be expected just tell her she is a big girl and doesn't need it she'll fuss anyway but a toy or other positive reinforcement is ok like in potty training maybe a stuffed toy at bedtime would help if she misses the pacifier remember they have a sucking reflex that must develop as part of their growth and it is important that they do that but not too far past what would be the normal weaning stage or it can become a different problem i would google pacifiers or something similar and see what experts say Breastfeeding Cat Fecal incontinence Atomic Kitten Stuttering Infantilism Housebreaking Autism Childbirth The Shining (film) Ferret Kodocha Procrastination Elimination communication Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fertility awareness Hypnosis Social rule EastEnders Sleep Shaggy dog story Maggie Simpson Strap-on dildo Milton H.
