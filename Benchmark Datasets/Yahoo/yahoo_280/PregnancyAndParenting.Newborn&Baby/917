what do you do when ok so i have been breastfeeding my baby for two months now very successfully until last week i got a virus and had to be put on meds that i couldn't nurse her with i had to go out of town to stay with my parents because i couldn't be around her with fever i took my pump to keep up with it but forgot the bottle to pump into it does not work without it i was out of pumping for two days and out of nursing for a week needless to say my milk dropped alot when i try to nurse her now she does for a min and then screams for more food i can't pump during the day because she doesn't sleep much and requires a lot of attention how can i get my milk back up without starving her to death and with little pumping time by the way i didn't find out there were meds you could take while nursing until after the fact i did tell my doc i was nursing he should have given me the right ones and failed to do so also i drink a ton of water and i eat oatmeal almost every morning breastmilk is supply and demand the more you make your little one nurse the more your milk will come back you are doing the right thing by trying to keep up the nursing everytime she needs to eat put her to each breast to nurse first then supplement before long your milk will be back in full swing it happened to me too i got sick and my milk started to lull once i got back to par i made my son nurse like crazy and the milk started flowing once again good luck Breastfeeding Nestl__ Milk Infant Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Infant formula Breast milk Dialysis Humphrey Bogart Ron and Fez Knots Landing Chronic fatigue syndrome Indianapolis 500 Shaggy dog story International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Breast pump Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Breast Breakfast Porridge Drawn Together Fertility awareness Garfield Carburetor 28 Days Later Cat Diarrhea Conker's Bad Fur Day The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Kosher foods Infusion pump RuneScape quests Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hiberno-English Dieting Chernobyl accident Folic acid Nipple piercing Elephant Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pitaten Vitamin D Ebola Piccolo Junior Saga Goldfish International response to Hurricane Katrina Baby bottle Herpes simplex virus Second Battle of the Atlantic Insulin Rais massacre Little Britain Time Out of Mind The Catcher in the Rye FoxTrot Earless seal Characters in the Smurfs Guinea pig Kodocha Pump It Up Nestl__ boycott Bodybuilding Tooth Veganism B-47 Stratojet Fecal incontinence Vegetarianism Siphon Nipple Nurse Nursing Social rule AFI 100 Years series Urinary incontinence Obstetrics HIV 2003 North America blackout Tofu Matt Hardy Charles Darwin's illness Operation Market Garden Pneumonia Common cold Fasting Sharon Tate Great Teacher Onizuka Everwood Coeliac disease The Super Milk-chan Show Panama Canal Ron Weasley Tea Heinkel He 100 Jaundice
