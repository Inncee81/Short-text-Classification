baby question i'm helping to take care of my sister's boyfriend's month nephew jj cause his mom is locked up for years grandma's working outta town for a minute and his dad won't claim him i don't have kids so i'm concerned about how much he should eat a day why when he gets something in his hand it goes straight to his mouth how early should we start gum and teeth care cause he has teeth so far and any other parenting advice i love having him here and just wanna make sure we're taking good care of him god bless as far as feeding goes he should be getting formula for the first year no milk until then however that should not be all he gets some people still have them on baby food by this point both of my children were eating soft grown up food by now at months he's probably somewhere in between the two so i would have both on hand just in case if you can take him to a doctor for a checkup as soon as you can the doctor will be able to tell you more specific information based on his size you should probably start working on getting him to use a sippy cup instead of a bottle if he isn't already it's recommended that they stop using a bottle by year and sometimes it takes a little bit to get them used to it at that age my kids both loved steamed vegetables very soft crackers and chicken cut up very small but you may want to check with the baby's mother to see what he likes as far as putting things in his mouth that's how babies explore try to vacuum every day if possible and keep small objects that may be swallowed out of his reach also if you haven't already get plug covers for your outlets my daughter is months older and she tries her best to find holes to stick things in you should probably get him a soft baby toothbrush and some fluorine free toothpaste they sell all kinds of baby toothpastes at any store try to get in the habit of brushing at least once a day preferably twice but as long as you don't give him tons of junk food it won't hurt too much if you forget occasionally i don't know how much time you have with him but give him as much attention as possible read to him frequently and don't use baby talk with him i spoke to my son like an adult as much as possible and was really surprised at how fast he learned to talk back the most important thing i have learned about being a parent is don't assume there is anything they can't do and don't assume until you've seen it that they can do anything either encourage him but don't push him give him the opportunity to try things that he should not be able to do until he's older but don't force him to do so that's how my son learned to read at and loves it good luck and i admire you for being willing to take on such a huge responsibility Tooth Breastfeeding Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Milton H.
