cloth diapers are any of you ladies using cloth diapers i am considering it because i try my best to help the enviroment in anyway i can is it a hassle using cloth diapers and did you buy them or make them i'm considering making my own diapers because they can cost each or more will it be worth my time trying to figure out how to make them i have seen patterns to do this my baby is not due for another months so i have a little time to prepare yeah i believe you on them being gross i have seen there are disposable liner also that you can just toss into the toilet and flush so you don't have to deal with all the mess it seems ridiculous that people would use wasting water etc as an excuse to fill dumps w trash instead i didn't know this was an argument if this was the case we better not flush wash hands brush teeth wash dishes etc too often i'm a working mother also or will be currently on bedrest for remainder of pregnancy i know it is a bit more responsibility but i want to do my part to leave a planet worth living on for my daughters and their children i want to clear up some misinformation given in some of the answers cloth diapers cause less diaper rash than disposable diapers problems with diaper rash in cloth diapers are often caused by the wet diaper staying on the baby too long disposable users often take advantage of the absorbancy and the fact that the baby feels dry and will keep a diaper on the baby for hours longer than it should be in of american babies wore cotton diapers only experienced diaper rash in only of american babies wore cotton diapers but of american babies experienced diaper rash ask nearly any disposable diaper advocate the environmental question and they will most likely say that while they are loading up the landfills in our world cloth diaper users are wasting the planet s water certainly gallons of water seems like a lot to wash some diapers but let s put that into perspective if we spent gallons on our diapers per month that s units of water at gallons unit in my household of adults and children we use anywhere from units a month depending on the time of year if we averaged units of water a month our units of water would constitute about of our typical monthly water usage in the summer we use more water to keep our lawn green than we do to wash our diapers that s just the numbers i think it s interesting that disposable diaper lovers including the companies that make them can make quite a fuss about the water used to wash cloth diapers nobody seems to get up in arms about the amount of water used to wash and sanitize bottles if parents feed their babies formula or pumped breastmilk for that matter in the event that a baby s parents find the time for a minute shower each day they will each use over gallons of water to keep themselves clean for that year period of diapering their baby that s almost gallons for two adults but gallons to wash their baby s diapers is supposed to be an environmental problem if disposable diaper users really think it s a better choice to pollute landfills with long lasting bacteria laden trash rather than use water to wash and flush our children s waste then shouldn t all of us adults quit taking showers wear disposable diapers and probably disposable clothing altogether and quit flushing our waste down the toilet that hardly makes sense we have wise environmentally safe and inexpensive ways to treat our sewage water remember it only costs about for the total water of laundering one child s diapers for years further water is a naturally renewing resource remember the water cycle diagrams we all came to know and love in our th grade science courses cloth diapers gross i think what's gross is all of those chemicals in disposable diapers and what they can do to babies changing cloth diapers is almost identical to changing disposable diapers the main difference between using cloth and using disposables is that yes you have to wash cloth diapers after a day or so of diaper changes now it's not as if we have to go down to the river and slap our cloth diapers against the rocks anymore modern washing machines are designed to handle a few messy diapers if a baby is exclusively breastfed for the first months baby's poop is completely water soluble so no extra work is done at all older babies poop is solid and will generally roll right off the diaper when held over the toilet no toilet dunking is required sorry to get on my soapbox mama but people slinging myths around drive me crazy anyway yes it is so worth your time i wish i could sew i'm having to buy them even though they are spendy i hear the resale value is great so i figure i'll get a lot of money back if you get pretty good at making them maybe you can start selling them Urinary incontinence Menstrual cycle Toilet Toilet paper Microeconomics Fecal incontinence Nuclear power Energy development Clothing Hard water CPU cache Thermal power station Japanese
