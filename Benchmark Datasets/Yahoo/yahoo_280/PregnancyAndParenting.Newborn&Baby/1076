medela breast pump i had originally bought pump from walmart but when the lady at hospital found out i was going to be going back to work full time she said she highly recommended getting a medela so i did the pump in style used it for the first time this morning and only got ounce on left side and i could tell my breast was full what gives when i used my other pump before i always got more than that anyone else had this problem it worries me because i go back to work on the th and im worried i wont be able to pump enough milk for him he's weeks old and likes to eat alot pumps don't work like baby so you won't get as much pumping as baby might eat nursing but babies seem to adjust i learned fast not to buy the pumps from the store because they don't really work at first but once i got my milk supply going with the medela double pump i was able to get oz sometimes more at a time then the hand pump worked ok once i had the milk supply in it is hard to get the pumps to latch on properly to get the milk supply out i would feel so full and pump and get only oz at first and was so worried and upset but the dr said that i may just need to adjust how the pump is suctioning and massage my breasts before and during the pumping it seemed to really help when i did the preparation before hand i always had extra milk in the freezer when using the medela double pump they are so expensive though that i know most woman can't afford the good ones i couldn't have it if wasn't for family donations to get it Breastfeeding Breast pump Childbirth Dairy Abortion Hypoglycemia Insulin Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Carburetor Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans EastEnders Wal-Mart Prostate cancer Glossary of firefighting equipment Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Cytomegalovirus Pump It Up Cheese Yoko Ono Japanese tea ceremony Suction Infant Mattress Friends Tofu Thermal power station Kodocha Coffee Marilyn Monroe Premature birth Sento Breast The Beatles discography Shaggy dog story Unemployment Polychlorinated biphenyl Fecal incontinence Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Atomic Kitten Conker's Bad Fur Day Dialysis Kosher foods International response to Hurricane Katrina Tooth Breast milk Nestl__ Leeds United F.C.
