what are you favorite diapers and why i've found that pampers baby dry work wonders for my son who pees a lot i love luvs in my opinion they are the best diaper ever here is what i listed in another post for why i love luvs vs the other brands we tried huggies for about weeks when my son was born he had a really bad reaction to them and got a really bad rash anyway not all kids have problems with them just giving you my personal experience my sister in law uses pampers for my nephew and i hate them i babysit him days out of the week and it is just miserable when it comes to diapers it is not that they leak much only rarely the problem i have found is that they have this netting on the inside that sticks to his skin when he pees more than once in them he always gets rashes it is crazy they don't change his diapers because they don't believe the diapers could cause it trust me i've tried to get them to change the brand anyway i use luvs my son is a few days shy of months and has not had diaper rash since the first one at weeks old i believe that he has been rash free because of using a d ointment not the zinc oxide and using the luvs diapers every child is different so it all is up to trial and error but i have only heard of allergy rash problems with huggies pampers never with luvs but i guess there is a first for everything good luck Diaper Kimberly-Clark Corporation Infantilism Zinc Urinary incontinence Rash Kimi Finster We Belong Together Fecal incontinence Crazy in Love Spina bifida Rocko's Modern Life The Fairly OddParents Rooibos The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Humphrey Bogart Ron and Fez Ashanti (singer) Group A streptococcal infection Jon Secada Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Candidiasis Psoriasis Scott Storch Cytomegalovirus Social rule Mercury (element) EastEnders Huggy Bear Theory of conduct Genericized trademark Phoebe Buffay's songs The Ashlee Simpson Show Hard water 613 mitzvot Mnemonic Latex allergy Electrophysiology Tupac Shakur Jennifer Lopez Plame affair Remix Eczema Hay fever Care Bears Tianeptine Sharon Tate Radiohead Allergy Order of succession Shen Gong Wu Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Rugrats Lyme disease Situation comedy W.I.T.C.H.
