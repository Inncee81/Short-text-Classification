what can i do for my sunburned month old daddy meant well when he took our fair skinned month old son out to the swap meet today while i stayed at home he bought him a hat and covered his legs but didn't realize that his arm was sticking out in the sun and he ended up with a sunburn it's not terrible just red no blisters it doesn't seem to be bothering him i am curious though if i might be able to put something on it he is still pretty young so i am not sure what is safe i am probably going to give him some tylenol in case it is painful has anyone had this experience that can advise me i plan to call my doctor tomorrow thank you by now i'm sure you've found something to ease babies pain what i suggest is don't use aloe unless you own a plant at home if you own a plant at home go ahead and use it warm the aloe in your hands before applying it is sticky and can sting a little so put on a long sleeved shirt and send him off to sleep with lots of extra fluids after the sunburn has calmed a little more i'd suggest pure olive oil and one capsule of vitamin e mix them together and apply liberally all over his arms and why not the rest of his body too little massage might distract him start with the legs and move up the olive oil and vitamin e will help repair his skin the best thing to do if you suspect it is stinging or burning is cool wash cloths once they warm up waves them in the air until they cool about seconds and reapply don't bath him for the next few days as warm water will really hurt keep the fluids moving like white water rapids if he is breastfeeding he will most likely find comply comfort at the breast and forget all about the burn love that drunk baby look anyways don't stress too much until it is bad sunburns happen Psoriasis Breastfeeding Sunburn Aloe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sunscreen Childbirth Swimming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Massage Aerial (dance move) Humphrey Bogart Futurama (TV series - season 5) Hyperthermia Tattoo Comanche Vitamin D The Shining (film) Carpal tunnel syndrome Kodocha First aid Fecal incontinence Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Hiking Eczema Marilyn Monroe Carbon dioxide Milton H.
