did parents choice formula cause your baby to be constipated or is it normal when you change formulas i have a healthy week old baby she's been on formula only for about the past weeks her bowel movements have been every other day since she was born but the doctor said that was fine as long as the stool wasnt firm which they havent been until yesterday i changed from nestle good start formula to parents choice gentle formula about a week ago it is cheaper and i hear a lot of babies do just as good if not better on it i notice it doesnt dissolve well though unlike the other formulas it leaves a gritty type residue then yesterday she had a poopy diaper and the stool was hard as a rock i called the doc and she said give prune juice etc but shes had more hard poopy diapers since then this coming from a baby who usually only goes poop every other day do you think the formula isnt digesting well or is it just the transition to a new kind thanks with my first daughter i also used the nestle goodstart until she was about months old and then switched to the parent's choice brand for the money reason ans she did just fine but with my month old i tried the parent's choice and as you noticed i also noticed the grit to it and the not dissolving all the way and like your daughter my month old started having very hard stool as well all babies are very different as i'm sure you know so while it may be great for one it might be terrible for another i'm sure that part of it is just b c you changed formulas but i'm also fairly confident that it could very well be the formula i've noticed that similac is a much thinner formula than parent's choice and is a little cheaper than the nestle enfamil is the thinnest of the formulas that i have found and parent's choice is by far the thickest i am going to be switching off of the parent's choice for that very reason and for the hard stool i would rather pay a few dollars more and have a happy baby than save a few bucks and have her tummy in knots all the time lol Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Infantilism Diaper Stomach cancer EastEnders Dietary fiber Escherichia coli O157:H7 The Beatles discography Diarrhea Mattress Microeconomics Irritable bowel syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome Infant formula Prostate cancer Care Bears Kodocha Nestl__ Laxative Toilet humour Nestl__ boycott Coeliac disease Boyz II Men 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kimberly-Clark Corporation Yesterday's Enterprise (TNG episode) Hirschsprung's disease Brewery Elimination communication Opportunity rover Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Childbirth Poker jargon Baby Blues Abortion in the United States Diverticulosis Wheel of Fortune Sharon Tate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Humphrey Bogart Tooth enamel Dorama Tobacco Feces Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Glycogen storage disease type I Royal Assent Sento Unemployment Koala Adjustable gastric band Inflation Education in Germany Knife Capercaillie Rod Stewart Dairy Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Rooibos Computer Ulcerative colitis Cliff Richard Infant Tooth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Crohn's disease Timekeeping on Mars Procter & Gamble Gastroparesis Rent (musical) Sant Thakar Singh Glacier Characters in the Smurfs Terri Schiavo Divorce Marty McFly Shaggy dog story Daylight saving time ALGOL 68 Characters of Lost Confidence trick Gross domestic product Leaf Spina bifida Charmed Bulk vending Prolog Canadian dollar Jon Secada Thermal power station Shit Labour economics Abortion debate Neighbours Botulism
