its my baby i got pregnant accidently when i was and because we used a condom i didnt realise untill the th month of my prgenancy and by then it was too late to anything about it i didn't no what to do i knew that i didnt want it and i was planing on giving it up for adoption but during the last month of my pregnancy i fell in love with the baby i felt it move and hiccup it was amazing so when the time came months ago and i gave birth to a little boy called mali i couldnt bare to part from him the promlem is that i live with my mum dad and sister but my mum wont let me do anything with my baby she insists on feeding him changing him playing with him she wont even let me hold him for to long or breast feed him i am perfectly capable of looking after him i no i need family help and i appreciate that but i want to be able to hold my baby i have tryed talking to my mum but she just calls me stupid saying that i cant look after him i just want my baby to myself i know what some of you think im too young and yes i know that but i love my boyfirend and he has stuck by me it's not like one day we just decided to have sex we planed it for ages we when to clinics to get checked over we love each other i know im lucky to have a mum who cares but she wont let me hold him or olay with him or bath him even my dad has realised and trys to get my mum out of the house so i can have just one day with my baby my boyfirend comes round everyday to see mali and my mum is rude to him and acts like he is not part of his life ut he is i know im too young but whats done is done and i will get through it i just want my baby to know who i am i love him i was even thinking about moving in with my boyfirend his parents are lovely and they understand me i wish my parents were more like his they understand and wouldnt treat me like i dont exists you dont understand im now and i am grreatful i get help form my dad and sister and my boyfreinds parents and i am so greatful i love having them around cos i no i cant do it on my own but my mum wont let my hold my own baby my mum wont let me put him to bed they only thing i get to do is look at him when he is sleeping and prepear his dinner he sleeps in my mums room even though i first of all made room in my room i buy loads of outfits and tos for him but my mum hardly outs him in any of them he is going to start thing she is his mum i just want my baby and i love the extra help but my mums just gone to far i suggest moving out as soon as possible if she is that controlling and tells you constantly that you are stupid then what will she be telling your baby verbal abuse is just as dangerous as physical just make sure you stay with his parents or another family member you are still only and that is not a child but a young adult even young adults need help from older adults if you have no other alternative than to stay stay for three years and enjoy the free childcare then when you are get out and take your little one with you no child needs to be told he or she is stupid when your mom can act like an adult and be civil then accept her apologies for acting like a tyrant everything will work itself out you sound like a sweet girl and i have all faith that you will raise a wonderful little boy it may be hard to be a young single mom but many of mothers have done it and nothing is impossible and p s just because the government and society tell us that your have to be to be considered an adult doesn't mean that it is always true with everyone i know many young adults who act and are more mature than their older counterparts good luck EastEnders Friends Little Britain Abortion debate Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Shaggy dog story Infantilism Recurring South Park characters Laura Schlessinger One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Married... with Children Rocko's Modern Life Teenage pregnancy Milton H.
