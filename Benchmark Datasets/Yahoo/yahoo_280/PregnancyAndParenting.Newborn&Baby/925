letting my baby cry ok so i am starting this let my baby cry thing when she wakes up in the middle of the night what do i do go in there and give her her paci and lay her back down or don't go in at all this is the first night so i need lots of help please she is months old i guess the reason i am starting so late at this is because of my mom she says i shouldn't let her cry till she is huffing and puffing first off consider what this is going to do to you your family and your neighbors if you are living close to others i tried this out of the mistaken belief that some doctor who didn't even know my son's name without looking at a chart can tell me how to raise him well we tried for a month and all i got for it was an irate husband and neighbors calling cps for neglecting my son he would cry and scream some nights so badly he would puke everywhere i did the every minute thing and sit by the crib and everything they say to soothe and walk away and it didn't work he is now sleeps perfectly fine and despite what the critics of attachment parenting he is not a whiny needy clingy child he is head strong independant and spirited if he had his way i wouldn't get any cuddles or kisses at all but then he is a boy after all kudos for you if it works but don't be surprised if it doesn't babies need their mothers Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders The Shining (film) Jon Secada Friends The Marshall Mathers LP Theory of conduct The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Cindy Sheehan Time Out of Mind Pitaten Milton H.
