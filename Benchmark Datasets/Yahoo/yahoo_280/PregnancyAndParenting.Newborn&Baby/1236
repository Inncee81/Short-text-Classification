why can't babies be born year olds i hate the whole infant stage anyways hi how are you i've got to say 'don't have 'em' answers are a little silly firstly it's clearly too late and secondly the asker has never said she wishes she hadn't had her baby or that it is all horrible i happen to agree with her i have a year old and a month old i love them both to bits and wouldn't change them for the world but i have realised i so don't do babies i think it was the novelty that carried me through the first but then she just got interesting and along came another baby and it's all gone backwards i love my baby to bits she is really a good baby and i love all the smiles and giggles and wriggles when she enjoys something and when she learns something new like reaching out for something etc etc but i do not like days like today when i just tried to have lunch with some friends but she wouldn't stop screaming or when i can't cook dinner without her crying and crying or when i have to plan what i'm doing around her feeds and naps and when i can't go out in the evening coz i need to be here to feed her because she won't take bottles etc etc in the grand scheme of things i know this won't last long and i was more than prepared to do it in order to have the family we wanted and i wouldn't really change a thing but i do not like the first year really or rather i struggle to find things i like and roll on walking talking eating normally etc etc my toddler has been enormous fun since she was about months and i loved every minute of it and almost feel i can't enjoy her so much becase there's a baby to look after as soon as this one is months or so i anticipate all the fun again but being born year old has its disadvantages ouch Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada The Beach Boys About a Boy Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe EastEnders Little Britain The Amber Spyglass Phoebe Buffay's songs Breastfeeding Friends Knots Landing Freddy Fender Mojave people Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kasparov versus The World Sharon Tate Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Father's Day (Doctor Who) The Star Wars Holiday Special Days of our Lives Oasis (band) Ron and Fez Rod Stewart Spice Girls Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an YuYu Hakusho Charmed Infant Scenes from a Memory Cliff Richard Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Salad Fingers Hall & Oates Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Piccolo Junior Saga The Rutles Happy Tree Friends Childbirth Shen Gong Wu She Loves You Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Ayyavazhi mythology Social rule Trailer Park Boys Pitaten Kimi Finster Jennifer Lopez Time Out of Mind Tom Jones (singer) Frankie Laine IBM PC compatible Le Malade imaginaire Ron Weasley Theodicy 10 Things I Hate About You The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy FoxTrot The Smoking Room Jam (TV series) George Costanza The Contender (television series) Journey (band) Avenue Q The Beatles Neighbours Pet Sounds Pok__mon Live!
