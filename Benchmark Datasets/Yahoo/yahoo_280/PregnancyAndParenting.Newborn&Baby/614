some questions about breastfed babies preferably from breastfeeding moms or ones who have breastfed my month old is strictly breastfed we have tried rice cereal mixed with breastmilk times and i think we are going to wait until months to start a food ritual his doctor told me at months i could start him on solids but i don't feel as if it is time yet when is a good time to introduce a sippy cup what to put in the sippy cup when should i give him water first foods other than cereal right now all he gets is my milk and the occasional milkshake i just shake my chest before he nurses i plan on nursing past a year hopefully if all goes well yeah i am serious about the milkshake it just came to me one day so it is a household joke now a good time to introduce a sippy cup is when your child can sit up unassisted and grip a toy and bring it to his mouth you can put expressed breast milk in the cup at first because it is familiar to him i wouldn't give him water until he's eating more solid foods until then he doesn't need water watch out for the juices they can cause diarrhea and then a diaper rash if your son is sensitive to the sugar and acid most of my kids weren't able to tolerate juice until they were potty trained they just ate fruit instead other than cereal you can feed your baby anything that is the right consistency my kids all ate bananas squash sweet potatoes green beans peas potatoes anything you can either throw in the blender raw or cooked after they got used to those single foods i started introducing mixtures love the comment about the milkshake once my older kids were putting on a theater production for me in the living room to amuse me while i was nursing the baby and i was laughing so hard at my little dramatists that the baby lost her latch and started crying my son years old at the time told me mom no fair she didn't order a milkshake Breakfast Food Cuisine of the Philippines Milkshake Milk Peruvian cuisine Ice cream Jewish cuisine Diarrhea Vegetarianism Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Africa Tofu Folic acid Cuisine of the Southern United States Kosher foods Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Singapore Chocolate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cheese Japanese cuisine Bread Rice pudding Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Brazil Banana Bengali cuisine The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Veganism Tea Food preservation Chili con carne Pancake Roman eating and drinking Infant Russian cuisine Dairy In-N-Out Burger Porridge Single certification Breakfast cereal German cuisine Comanche Humphrey Bogart Soul food Cereal Toilet humour Piccolo Junior Saga Potato Maize Krusty the Clown Childbirth Kodocha Muesli Infant formula RuneScape quests Tomato Soup Tooth Cuisine of Laos Common Agricultural Policy Soy milk Dietary fiber Joke Mnemonic Little Britain Nestl__ boycott Ron and Fez Japanese tea ceremony Recurring South Park characters Nestl__ The Ashlee Simpson Show Rice Korean cuisine Breast milk Rum Bubble tea Agriculture Agriculture in Australia McDonald's Brassiere Elimination communication Bart chalkboard gags Mojave people The dozens Maple syrup Coffee Hamster Fertility awareness Vinegar Coeliac disease Care Bears Escherichia coli O157:H7
