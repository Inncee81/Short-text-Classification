what do you think about moms who forget their babies are in the car i've read too many times that a mom forgets to drop her baby off at daycare and the baby is left in the car i'm not trying to be judgemental and i can see forgetting to drop off the baby and then getting to work but to actually go work an hour day and never give a thought to your child how do you do that i agree it seems completely absurd the only thing i think of is pure exhaustion and mental fatigue i've heard of it happening with fathers too and i think it's because it's not their usual routine to take the baby to daycare and they are just on auto pilot alot of babies fall asleep while riding as well i've seen recommendations that you put your pocket book or briefcase in the back seat with the baby when you leave for work Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Day care Rais massacre Childbirth Friends Father's Day (Doctor Who) Jon Secada Knots Landing Daylight saving time Blankets (graphic novel) The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (film) Pulp Fiction The Amber Spyglass Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Combat stress reaction Escape from New York Humphrey Bogart Scenes from a Memory Ayyavazhi mythology Laura Schlessinger Futurama (TV series - season 5) Charmed Hypnosis Kodocha Rugrats Weight training Car safety Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
