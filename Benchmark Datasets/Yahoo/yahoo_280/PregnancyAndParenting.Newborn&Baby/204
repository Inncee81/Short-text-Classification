why does a rear facing child safety seat need to be positioned at a degree angle i consider myself well informed about child safety seats and their installation but i am curious as to why a rear facing seat needs to be at a degree angle i'm not disputing this i'm just curious what would happen if it was installed tightly but at a degree angle with the child lying flat on his back thanks a child safety seat should be installed at a degree angle actually closer to degrees is safer in an accident but if the baby's head flops forward when they sleep it can compromise oxygen supply in addition to just plain being uncomfortable if a child seat is reclined too far it increases the chances that in an accident their head will slide up higher than the seat back thus defeating the whole purpose of the infant seat they explain it better here http www carseat org technical tech update htm anglerf Car safety Professional wrestling holds Sailing Motorcycle Knife Manual transmission Airbag Bicycle Recumbent bicycle Equine conformation Skateboarding trick Seat belt Car handling Helicopter Gas metal arc welding Crash test dummy Avalanche Drill bit Mattress Baby transport Space Shuttle program HyperText Transfer Protocol Wind turbine Chair Traumatic brain injury Automobile Strap-on dildo Japanese toilet School bus View camera XML Tank Poker jargon Air navigation Ford Crown Victoria John Stapp Drowning Airport Dale Earnhardt Internal ballistics Artillery Nuclear power Table saw Aerial (dance move) Seat belt legislation The Ark in Space Breastfeeding Automotive lighting Softball Microphone Naval architecture Diamond 2005 United States Grand Prix P-61 Black Widow Stroke Violin Backstroke Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Suplex OC-135B Open Skies Eddie Guerrero Fire Chernobyl accident Lung Gerrymandering Pole vault Sundial Messerschmitt Bf 109 Seismic retrofit Breaststroke Diving Elevator Autogyro Stereoscopy Golf club (equipment) Breech birth Sleep apnea Mercedes-Benz A-Class Ski Road traffic accident Slide rule Childbirth Glossary of ballet terms Swingout Infant Professional wrestling aerial techniques Glossary of American football Professional wrestling throws Dodge Neon F-104 Starfighter Dam Anatomical terms of location Sport rowing Daylight saving time Oral sex Shawn Michaels Microsoft Windows Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Glossary of climbing terms Mooney M20
