my baby is month old and i am breastfeed her my question is how will my breast look like after well actually it depends on a lot of stuff like how long you plan to nurse her your type of skin your figure etc i personally think that the longer you breastfeed the more adverse effects it may have on the shape of your breasts your type of skin and muscles are very important in being able to help you get your breasts back in shape if you have loose muscles or do not excercise enough well it's hard for them to get back in shape if you have a coordinated figure that is you have fat distributed evenly throughout your body or if you have a bigger bust than abdomen legs you are more likely to get back in shape i breastfed my daughter for years and really got into horrible shape because i had loose muscles and an uncoordinated figure i e thinner bust than abdomen but don't worry we have a miracle called plastic surgery and it's really a good thing i've done my share of research and i think implants are quite safe if you don't plan to breastfeed any more Breastfeeding Breast Breast implant Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breast cancer Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Childbirth Stomach cancer Plastic surgery Equine conformation Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fertility awareness History of corsets Breast reduction Swimming Cancer Radiation therapy Tocopherol Breast reconstruction Nipple Medicine Stuttering Undergarment Tightlacing Local anesthesia Traumatic brain injury Vitamin D Spina bifida Abdomen Nipple piercing Protein Skin Soft tissue sarcoma Strap-on dildo Weight training Fecal incontinence Secondary sex characteristic Baldness treatments Body modification Terminal ballistics Mattress Cerebellum Aikido Jaundice EastEnders Emergency contraception Insulin Infant Epilepsy Protein-energy malnutrition Morphogenesis Dog Infant formula Lymphatic system Psoriasis Physical attractiveness Stroke Breast fetishism Muscle Pneumonia Hand grenade Folic acid Obesity Charles Darwin's illness Sexual differentiation Ultimates Head Orgasm Drill bit Naruto jutsu Prolactinoma Gastroparesis Indecent exposure Diving suit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cruising (maritime) Sin City Nestl__ boycott Sperm Whale Acupuncture Tutankhamun Stem cell Dialysis Cephalic disorder Adjustable gastric band Bodybuilding Multiple sclerosis Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Animal testing Aerial (dance move) Tai Chi Chuan
