what are side effects of jaundice in newborn jaundice is the yellowish staining of the skin and the whites of the eyes that is caused by high levels in blood of the chemical bilirubin the color of the skin and sclerae vary depending on the level of bilirubin when the bilirubin level is mildly elevated they are yellowish when the bilirubin level is high they tend to be brown bilirubin comes from red blood cells when red blood cells get old they are destroyed hemoglobin the iron containing chemical in red blood cells that carries oxygen is released from the destroyed red blood cells after the iron it contains is removed the chemical that remains in the blood after the iron is removed becomes bilirubin jaundice occurs when there is too much bilirubin being produced for the liver to remove from the blood for example patients with hemolytic anemia have an abnormally rapid rate of destruction of their red blood cells that releases large amounts of bilirubin into the blood a defect in the liver that prevents bilirubin from being removed from the blood converted to bilirubin glucuronic acid conjugated or secreted in bile or blockage of the bile ducts that decreases the flow of bile and bilirubin from the liver into the intestines for example the bile ducts can be blocked by cancers gallstones or inflammation of the bile ducts the decreased conjugation secretion or flow of bile that can result in jaundice is referred to as cholestasis however cholestasis does not always result in jaundice jaundice or cholestasis by themselves causes few problems except in the newborn and jaundice in the newborn is different than most other types of jaundice as discussed later jaundice can turn the skin and sclerae yellow in addition stool can become light in color even clay colored because of the absence of bilirubin that normally gives stool its brown color the urine may turn dark or brownish in color this occurs when the bilirubin that is building up in the blood begins to be excreted from the body in the urine just as in feces the bilirubin turns the urine brown both my children had jaundice only my daughter requried she be on a bili blanket my son it was suggested i just expose him to as much natural sunlight as possible and it worked both were premature my daughter was a micropremature infant and her's was caused because her liver was to inmature to break down the blood cells my sons was caused by basically the same thing and it was expected due to the bruising caused during birth Cholesterol Gallstone Insulin Folic acid Hepatitis Blood Cancer Pneumonia Primary sclerosing cholangitis Stomach cancer Carbon monoxide poisoning Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Prostate cancer Hemolytic anemia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Psoriasis Bone marrow transplant Acne Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Pulmonary alveolus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Colorectal cancer Cytomegalovirus Autoimmune diseases Thalassemia Bile Hereditary spherocytosis Nutrition Kidney Stroke Obstetrics Carbon dioxide Glycogen storage disease type I Tocopherol Protein-energy malnutrition Eye Cephalic disorder Diarrhea Cyanide DNA repair Urinary incontinence Wilson's disease Porphyria Lupus erythematosus Atherosclerosis Cholecystitis Breastfeeding Human skin color Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Alkaline phosphatase Vitamin C Radical (chemistry) Malaria Gilbert's syndrome Vitamin D Puberty Cystic fibrosis Schistosomiasis Biochemistry Herpes simplex virus Ozone depletion Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Chemotherapy Ultraviolet Lung cancer Chlorpromazine Digestion Tobacco smoking Gout Intracranial pressure Thyroid Diabetic ketoacidosis Foodborne illness Medical analysis of circumcision Intravenous therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Asthma Iris (anatomy)
