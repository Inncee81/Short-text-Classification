where do you get the carseat installed for the st time i heard you should get your carseat installed so you know how to correctly do it where do you go do they do it at the hospital when u bring the baby home i live in va if that means anything they are strict about carseat laws i have a door car i want to make sure its installed safely for a newborn to all the ppl who think they know it all some jurisdictions require you to have the car seat installed so it meets the state standards before they let you leave the hospital i have it installed i need to make sure it meets standards go give someone else your ignorant answers and let the educated ppl answer my question we installed the car seats ourselves and then went to a car seat safety check run by the local police officers trained in car seat installation check to see whether you did it properly show you what you did right and what you did wrong remove the seats from the car review the proper installation with you and then essentially supervise you while you install it as the previous person indicated the hospital staff will not install car seat although they will ensure that you have a car seat installed before your baby is allowed to leave the hospital usually you can contact the local police department about installation inspection they usually have at least one permanent location at which you can schedule an appointment in addition to mobile safety checks that they may do a couple of times a year e g twice annually they may set up an all day installation inspection site at a local school these are free of charge and may or may not require an appointment in addition the national highway traffic safety administration has a search function so you can find who where such installations inspections are conducted near you you can find this at http www nhtsa dot gov people injury childps contacts index cfm and you can search by state or by zip code there is also a web site where you can look up carseat car compatability the information posted on that site is posted by users themselves and can be very helpful in determining whether a particular car seat works well in a particular car if you haven't purchased your carseat yet i recommend you look at this site and even if you have it can be found at http www carseatdata org the vast majority of car seats are improperly installed and i urge everyone to get them checked installed by someone who is specifically trained for that we have twins and we did the installation inspection for both the infant car seats they started out with and then for the convertible car seats they now use while many of the newer cars are equipped with the latch system and installation is in those vehicles easier than ever before we still found that our initial installation efforts were less than perfect and i'm very happy to have had the professionals correct my mistakes hope that helps best of luck and enjoy your newborn Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Airbag PHP United States Postal Service Domain Name System Speed limit Police system of Japan Automobile Breastfeeding STS-61 Plame affair Windows 2000 Car safety Toyota Camry Scientology beliefs and practices Elevator Common Unix Printing System Uniform Resource Locator Appeal OpenDocument Road-rule enforcement camera Condom Hong Kong Police Force 2005 United States Grand Prix Domestic AC power plugs and sockets OpenBSD Spyware Trademark Drunk driving (United States) Windows Vista XML Wi-Fi Daylight saving time Probation officer Linux distribution Floppy disk Traffic light Automatic number plate recognition Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Mozilla Firefox Wget Light rail Rules of the road Police Handloading Parachuting Pretty Good Privacy GameFAQs Childbirth Halting problem XHTML Mental Health Act 1983 Passenger car Mac OS X United States House of Representatives Gmail Linux Quantum computer National Kidney Foundation Singapore Education in the People's Republic of China Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Password GSM services TGV Annuity Web crawler Usenet Politics of Russia Drag racing MSN Messenger DVD HTTP cookie Unicode Burglar alarm Legal research Wayne Corporation MTR Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Airport Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina CPAN Segregated cycle facilities Government of Maryland Software testing Enterprise content management Cross site scripting Software engineering G__del's incompleteness theorem RFID
