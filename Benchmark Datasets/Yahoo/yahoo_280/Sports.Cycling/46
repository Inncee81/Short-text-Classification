have you ever taught an adult to ride a pedal bike do you have any tips or advice no i haven't but here's my cents use a smaller comfortable bike that's easy to ride use a quiet street or parking lot for room and smooth surface no spectators to intimidate patience and encouragement competent teacher that is trusted stress staying centered on the bike sounds obvious but its not to a beginner get the student up to mph or so asap the faster you go the easier to balance beginners want to go slow but that in itself makes balance difficult good luck Bicycle Bicycle frame Mountain bike Equine conformation Honda CX series Motorcycle Mountain biking Radio controlled airplane Irish dance Tai Chi Chuan Oh My Goddess!
