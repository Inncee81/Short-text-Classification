numb fingers over the weekend i rode close to miles during the ride i noticed that my left ring and pinky fingers were beginning to get a little numb i tried shaking it off but the feeling persisted now two days later these fingers still feel a little weak and slightly numb could it be that my gloves are too tight or something else fairly common try to change hand positions frequently so you're not putting weight on the same pressure points the whole ride if you have a road bike change from hoods to drops and back i have aerobars so that is another option for me if you have a mountain bike get the short bar extensions for a change of position it looks a little odd but you could even put aerobars on an mtb if you wanted another position Professional wrestling holds Recumbent bicycle Equine conformation Skateboarding trick Mountain bike Double bass Car handling Bicycle Carpal tunnel syndrome Mountain biking Internal ballistics Valentino Rossi Poker jargon The Hitch-Hiker (The Twilight Zone) Hand Harp Glossary of American football Tenshinhan Horizontal bar Anchor Glossary of partner dance terms Motorcycle Traumatic brain injury Vehicular cycling Triathlon Strap-on dildo Gesture Milton H.
