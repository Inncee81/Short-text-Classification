how would you go about figuring out a gear ratio i mean yes if it were a circle all i'd have to do is find the circumfrence of the back gear on a bike and divide the bigger front gear's circumfrence by that but the thing is the number of teeth vary from one set to another and i want to make sure i'm putting my money in a new set of gears with a good enough difference also some gear sets have slightly elliptical gears to make pedaling easier mine are too but very very slightly i'll need to know how to figure in the number of teeth and the tooth size if possible thanks hi adeel don't get too involved my friend it's simplicity itself no of teeth on the chainwheel divided by no of teeth on the sprocket times the diameter of the wheel in inches and that's it for example if you have a tooth chainwheel a tooth cog and a wheel it's divided by times a gear of inches sure tables are handy but why bother it's a little more difficult if you have hard numbers like but never mind that gives you something to think about on a long ride Mountain bike Bicycle Gear Motorcycle Transmission (mechanics) Manual transmission Penny-farthing Fixed-gear bicycle Single-speed bicycle Recumbent bicycle Automatic transmission Drill bit Textile manufacturing Continuously variable transmission Bicycle frame Table tennis Derailleur gears Bicycle brake systems Roller chain Racing bicycle Time Out of Mind Drag racing Mazda Miata Car handling Acura Integra (North America) Anchor Triathlon Dodge Neon Skateboarding trick Saw Honda CX series Enigma machine Nine Inch Nails Diamond cut Equine conformation Craps Tooth Motocross Bicycle lighting Bike trials riding Tooth enamel RuneScape quests Wire Epicyclic gearing Dog training Mountain biking Dragon Booster Worm gear Escapement Freewheel Hybrid Synergy Drive Movie projector Caterpillar track Snooker Speed of light Shimano Softball Normal distribution M-209 Dog agility Cog railway Internal ballistics Mouse (computing) Sega Game Gear Kitesurfing Phonograph cylinder Volleyball Undercarriage Grade (climbing) Lionel Corporation Maxilla O scale Tractor Carding Pachypodium bicolor Ecco the Dolphin Heinkel He 100 Spinning (cycling) Anamorphic widescreen Mandible Unicycle Trigonometric function Explosive material Preferred number Citro__n 2CV Wind turbine Cyclo-cross Mark I (tank) Amateur telescope making Scale model Milling cutter Happy Tree Friends Spacecraft propulsion Social rule Hipparchus (astronomer) Lincoln LS
