looking to buy a touring bike i am looking to buy a bicycle for touring i would like ot be able to put on some luggage bags and racks and do some overnighters and multiple day tours and i plan on riding daily for fitness my local dealer recommended a trek i rode it and it felt nice but i think its more for amature racing than long distance touring i would prefer an american made bike but european would be ok nothing made in china does anyone know about tommaso bikes lastly i am trying to stay around or under any suggestions would be appreciated when i say american or euro i know its a given that shimano is going to be some place on there as for the price limit i just speaking of the bike not the accessories which i plan to add over time i am looking for an aluminum frame maybe with carbon fiber forks basically i am looking for something similar to the trek but more for touring you're right about the the geometry is just too tight for long range touring in addition to rack and fender mounts a real touring bike is going to have a slacker head tube and longer chainstays both of which make for more stable low speed handling and the long chainstays also allow more room for rear panniers touring bikes also have room for bigger tires than road bikes which will have a much bigger impact on ride comfort than frame or fork material the trek and cannondale t might be close to your price range Bicycle Bicycle frame Mountain bike Recumbent bicycle Cycling Racing bicycle Motorcycle Cannondale Bicycle Corporation Bicycle brake systems Touring bicycle Utility cycling Mountain biking Chopper (motorcycle) Cyclo-cross Triathlon Car handling Carbon fiber Schwinn Bicycle Company Bicycle wheel Honda CX series Bicycle touring Knife Tire Mattress B-47 Stratojet Euro Track bicycle Dodge Charger Equine conformation Penny-farthing Cyfac Bicycle commuting Ford Ranger EV Motocross View camera M16 (rifle) Horse gait Timpani Shifter (bicycle part) Tour de France Mercedes-Benz A-Class Bike lane debate Trek Bicycle Corporation Kayak Junkers Ju 188 Textile manufacturing Derailleur gears Windsurfing Aluminium Space elevator Plastic BMW Bike trials riding Shimano Vehicular cycling Segregated cycle facilities Bicycle helmet NASCAR Motorcycle helmet Inline speed skating Road bicycle racing Passenger car De Lorean DMC-12 Transportation of Los Angeles Welding Golf club (equipment) Fixed-gear bicycle Automobile Yosemite National Park Heinkel He 112 Hiking Toyota Camry Single-speed bicycle Radio controlled airplane Valentino Rossi Harley-Davidson Rockers Expanded Universe (Star Wars) BMX Shimano Total Integration All-terrain vehicle Volkswagen Jetta Badminton Mitsubishi 3000GT STS-62 Sport utility vehicle 24 Hours of Le Mans TGV Jan Ullrich Dodge Neon
