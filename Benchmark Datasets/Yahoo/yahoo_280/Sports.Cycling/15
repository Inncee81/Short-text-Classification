what do i need to know about when and where to ride a road bike i am hopefully purchasing a road bike very soon and im not sure what kinds of streets to ride them on i live in a decent sized city with about k people and i dont know what other roads i can ride my bike on other than neigherborhood roads and such i want to go up to and higher miles a day bt i cant ride that in a neighborhood just would be too boring any suggestions good suggestions by the previous two posters here is a link that you can use to map out your rides www gmap pedometer com just keep in mind that most states give bikes the same rights as an automobile when riding on the street but that also means you must obey the same traffic laws ride as far to the right as you can and do your best to keep traffic flowing when you are forced to ride on a busier street you will find out soon enough that most motorist don't appreciate us slowing them down and always use hand signals when turning have fun and be safe Bike lane debate Motorcycle Critical Mass Bicycle Transportation of Los Angeles Segregated cycle facilities Traffic light Speed limit Recumbent bicycle Automobile Honda CX series Light rail Pedestrian crossing West Side Highway Bus rapid transit Ocean Beach, New York Bicycle helmet Traffic Public transport Freeway Street Interstate Highway Cycling Road safety Road traffic accident Traffic calming Valentino Rossi Kirby Air Ride Bicycle lighting BMX Curb extension Mountain bike Anchor Cycle path debate Hiawatha Line Toyota Prius Rules of the road Urban sprawl Air traffic control Highway Lechaina Transport in Hong Kong California State Route 1 Drag racing Auto-free zone Expanded Universe (Star Wars) All-terrain vehicle Hitchhiking Road transport MetroCard Utility cycling Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railroad Sport utility vehicle Bicycle brake systems Effective Cycling Railway signalling Indianapolis, Indiana Mountain biking Roundabout Driving Milpitas, California Boston and Lowell Railroad California State Route 85 Yosemite National Park King City, Ontario Traffic sign Lane Snowboarding Miami-Dade Transit U.S. Highway 66 Road Long Island Rail Road Motorway Trail TGV Milton H.
