best bicycle for the street i want a bike for short distances within a mile or so and won't need to carry anything i am petite just shy of five feet so it needs to be adjustable to a low height good suggestions so far also my price limit is hopefully i can get something good from your description it sounds like you are not doing any serious riding but using the bike for transportation i definitely agree with the suggestions you have received to go to a good local bike shop talk with them about what you want and what type of riding you will be doing based on the information you gave i would suggest a bicycle something like the townie by electra it is a bit like a cruiser with an upright seat position which will give you more comfort and ability to see around you they have also what they call flat foot design you can sit on the seat and your feet can be flat on the ground minimal worries about tipping over etc they are not real expensive and are reliable my wife has one she is just about your height there are other manufacturers that make similar bikes your bike shop should be able to help below is the website for electra's townie bike Bicycle Recumbent bicycle Bicycle frame Motorcycle Bicycle brake systems Bicycle lighting Mountain biking Equine conformation Cycling Utility cycling Anchor Single-speed bicycle Bike lane debate BMX Drill bit Racing bicycle Segregated cycle facilities Dog agility Tire Bicycle helmet Honda CX series Cyclo-cross Vancouver B-47 Stratojet Wind turbine Skateboarding trick Public transport Snowboarding Tricycle Car handling Vehicular cycling Personal rapid transit Mattress Space elevator Bicycle touring Disney's California Adventure Trail Yacht Bike trials riding Teletext Chopper (motorcycle) Double bass Law of value Harley-Davidson Transportation of Los Angeles Bass guitar Triathlon Cruising (maritime) Volleyball BMW Windsurfing Tour de France Adventure racing Triumph Motorcycles Washington Monument Hubert Opperman Cambridge, Massachusetts Bottom bracket Schwinn Bicycle Company Oscilloscope Radar Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Airsoft Toyota Land Cruiser Gross domestic product Douglas DC-8 Whistler-Blackcomb Horse Strap-on dildo Fixed-gear bicycle Sport rowing TGV Stereoscopy Chair Urban sprawl Touring bicycle Pole vault Cannondale Bicycle Corporation Sport utility vehicle Welding Fast bowling Motorcycle helmet All-terrain vehicle British Columbia Air New Zealand Gas metal arc welding Binoculars Snowboard Land Rover (Series/Defender) Poker jargon View camera Headlight Delaware, Ohio Wright brothers Star Destroyer Royal Enfield Bicycle commuting
