nery castillo in fc shakhtar donetsk at first i was realy pissed of because i realy wanted to see nery in manchester city or even valencia but after taking time to look at the club i came to a conclusion that its not that bad they just got a new owner who spend millons of dollars on renovations buying better players nery castillo they also purchased ilsinho for million euros these two player will make shakhtar unstopable and what i'm hopeing is that the club shines in the champions leage and in the home leage so that nery can then make a move to a big club arsenal or chelsea for example what do yall think and when will he make his debut yeah thas what i was thinking all along and some great players have come out of shakhtar donetsk so its not really that bad and the million dollar pacheck isn't that bad for him either FC Shakhtar Donetsk February 2005 in sports Andriy Shevchenko Chelsea F.C.
