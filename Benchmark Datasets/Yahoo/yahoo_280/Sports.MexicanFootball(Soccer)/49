why do most americans say soccer is boring when they cover golf so much i was watching espn and they seriously spent like half an hour on tiger woods winning the pga really soccer is a million time more exciting than golf because they haven't grown up on soccer basically you can say any sport is boring if you don't like it its just dumb opinions anyway people in the usa watch baseball golf tennis and nascar and those are all popular sports in america but how someone can call soccer boring in comparison to those sports is beyond me its just really favortism to there sport everyone wants there sport to be the best so the best way to make there sport better is to knock down the other sport its all childish and dumb just watch what you like and shut up lol April 2005 in sports Baseball Associated Press Athlete of the Year Major professional sports league May 2005 in sports PGA Tour Sports timeline PGA Championship Tiger Woods Stormfront Studios June 2005 in sports Golf September 2004 in sports March 2005 in sports Football (soccer) September 2005 in sports June 2004 in sports Ty Cobb August 2005 in sports Vin Scully The Jim Rome Show Professional golf tours PGA European Tour National pastime October 2005 in sports Jack Nicklaus Major League Baseball television contracts Sudden death December 2004 in sports EA Sports July 2004 in sports Sports in Puerto Rico Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable Indian sport Electronic Arts United States August 2004 in sports Official World Golf Rankings The Open Championship The Sporting News November 2004 in sports Arnold Palmer PGA Grand Slam of Golf Tiger Woods PGA Tour Gary Player Sport in the United Kingdom Tennis Ernie Els Lee Trevino Texas Longhorn Athletics Sports Illustrated Sports in Canada Playoff format Indianapolis Motor Speedway Florida State University Vijay Singh Lamar Hunt USA Network October 2004 in sports Nike, Inc.
