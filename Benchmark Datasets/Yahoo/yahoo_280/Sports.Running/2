getting fast so i have this friend and he runs miles in minutes i'm relatively new and the last time i ran miles it was min it was around my time running it but the first time that i timed myself is there any way to get as fast or faster in a relatively short amount of time one year also keeping in mind that he will also get faster in the year if so how should i go around doing it like i said i'm new at running so i'm not sure what good workout strategies are you can not get fast in a short period of time but year is not a short period of time for distance running you know what you have done so begin a program to improve if you are going to run miles or k then you must train for that race run easy days per week that is run at least to miles days per week run harder do tempo or fartlek runs you can also do intervals where you will run from meters up to mile repeats you can run these at race pace or faster so your body will get used to running faster since you have run at about minutes per mile you will need to do the work outs at or per mile when you are able to do that pace in a race then you can adjust your training for your next goal of running faster practice your pace so you do not go out too fast at the beginning of a race it is better to run even if possible you can run a little faster at the end but if you go out too fast you will slow down Weight training Triathlon Fast bowling Drag racing Marathon (sport) Tempo Dog agility Bubble Bobble Running 24 Hours of Le Mans Seabiscuit Bowling strategy (cricket) Speed of light Bicycling terminology 2005 Iditarod Middle distance track event Cardiac arrhythmia Beatmatching Tank classification Haile Gebrselassie RISC Auto racing Deflation (economics) Butterfly stroke Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 400 metres Web crawler Sea level rise Cricket Baseball Action potential Swimming Electrophysiology High-speed rail Equine conformation CPU design Fell running Rallying Indianapolis 500 Decompression sickness Paintball Recumbent bicycle TGV Athletics Eventing AIM-120 AMRAAM CPU cache Native American music The Amazing Race Compiler optimization USS Tunny (SS-282) Toyota Prius Hebrew calendar Bay Area Rapid Transit Space Shuttle program 2000 Australian Grand Prix 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Formula One regulations Speed limit Age of Mythology E85 Quantum computer Tai Chi Chuan Backstroke Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 West Indian cricket team Swingout Harness racing Goldberg Variations Extreme Programming Fuel injection Aviation history Year American football strategy Fielding (cricket) NASCAR USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Equation of time Hypoglycemia Gamma ray burst Mount St. Helens USS Wasp (CV-18) Computer National Weather Service March (music) Economy of Russia Exponential growth Unemployment Spectacular Bid Norway national football team Quicksort Sailing Bethalto, Illinois Oscilloscope The Book of Five Rings Gliding Marching band Game programming Railway signalling
