if you jog mile how many calories would you burn i am lbs ' calories burned while running for the most part depends on weight and distance ran not speed it's simple physics energy is the ability to do work and work is distance traveled by mass calories energy and no matter what speed you're going you're still moving the same mass the same distance the only slight advantage running at a higher intensity would give is a tiny bit more calories burned after the workout and even though walking the distance moves your body the same amount the mechanics of running and walking are so different that calorie burned aren't the same speed would be work over a period of time so a higher speed for the same amount of time would burn more calories but for a set distance speed doesn't matter for when you factor in the time for the distance it cancels out work mass distance moved power work period of time work period of time period of time work this is fact don't listen to anyone who tells you otherwise just because the human body is involved it doesn't mean the laws of physics are negated for someone who's lbs a single mile ran will burn calories good luck Energy Spacecraft propulsion Gravity Explosive material Speed of light Faster-than-light Special relativity Tide Dieting Mass Internal ballistics Escape velocity Temperature Equine conformation Planetary orbit Mercury (planet) Carburetor Action potential Pound Bicycle Jet engine Potential energy Radar Dualism (philosophy of mind) Fermi paradox Kinetic energy Wind turbine Black body General relativity Black hole Planck units Orbital speed Nuclear fusion Triathlon Speed limit Social rule Zeno's paradoxes Astrodynamics Photon Terminal ballistics Bicycle lighting Heat Power (physics) Resonance Torque Central processing unit Obesity Galactic Civilizations Dimensional analysis Neutrino Units of measurement Center of mass Scramjet Floppy disk Super Size Me Classical mechanics Bodybuilding Swimming Hybrid vehicle Terran (StarCraft) Marathon (sport) TGV Renormalization Light E85 Dietary fiber Velocity Gravitational slingshot Two-body problem Dark energy Tests of general relativity Theory of conduct Bird migration Electron Solar system Electric motor Nuclear fission Milk Welding Ethernet Force Sun Stopping power Energy development Luminiferous aether Electrophysiology Bullet Vacuum Particle physics
