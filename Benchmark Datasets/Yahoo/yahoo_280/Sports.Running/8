wtf why is my time down so much ok so i've been focusing on sprints for the last month ok my baseball team went to the world series for about weeks then i had a baseball camp as well for the last month so i have'nt been able to run distance like i used to i was just able to run and yd dashes after the camps and world series so yesterday i go to get back in my routine when i find i'm down to a mile a month ago i was at mile how can i get back to my old time when soccer and track are approaching ohh yeah but i've been jogging in place for mins each day with lbs of weight did that slow me down or hurt me i really need to get back in shape for soccer your frustration tells me you have high expectations of yourself that's good but such a huge loss in performance is obviously from a lack of rest you need a few days off from any hard exercise to start running is about fluid motion strength and energy over training robs your energy and i personally guarantee no loss of strength in three days of rest running in place with weights on develops the wrong muscles and robs you of excercising muscles which control your dynamic motion it's great to have strong quads and calves but there are dozens of other muscles that don't get any attention because they have long latin names and have only small contributions to your performance running for real develops those in the right balance with the major muscles many injuries come from mismatches in muscle strength sprints are always a heavy workout and you need a rest day afterward or a light training day which is running at a speed that would allow you to talk very long distance and hilly runs are also heavy workouts they do a lot of good but you need to recover for a day or two before more heavy workouts take a few days off let your body heal then ease into your training with a couple of hard workouts a week instead of six i'm guessing on that one and dump the weights serious runners don't do that unless they have a strength training coach telling them exactly how to do it Weight training Equine conformation Triathlon Running Marathon (sport) Bodybuilding Exercise Ben Johnson (athlete) Swimming Muscle Urinary incontinence Aikido Middle distance track event Athletics Tyrannosaurus rex Toronto Blue Jays Piccolo Junior Saga Baseball Gliding Sprint (race) Tai Chi Chuan Terminal ballistics Chinese martial arts American football Stress fracture Dieting New York Giants Clinical depression Glossary of climbing terms Sport rowing Pittsburgh Steelers Aerial (dance move) Childbirth Babe Ruth Andr__s Galarraga Toronto Raptors Poker jargon Creatine STS-62 Milton H.
