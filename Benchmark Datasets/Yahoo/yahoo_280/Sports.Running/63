marathon or not we have a marothon coming up in september we can run or walk and it is miles if i start training now would i be able to do it there are tropies awarded for your age groups by the quickest time will it be better for me if i had a friend to do it with me it is k run and walk if you are healthy you should have no problem completing five miles i think it is always better to run or walk with a friend even if you ended up not being together during the race it is just fun to experience it together and you can share notes afterwords it sounds like you do not run now if that is the case i suggest that you and your friend start jogging together just to build up your strength if you have a local track you can run on or a park with good trails these might be places you might consider running jogging also make sure you have good shoes whether you are walking or running having good comfortable shoes is important it is not necessary to get expensive running shoes if you plan on going at a fairly easy pace but if you get serious about running then you will want to invest in better shoes good luck and have fun Running Marathon (sport) Eugene, Oregon Social rule 1957 World Series Horse gait Walking Triathlon Drag racing Horseshoe Mid-levels Crash Nitro Kart (PS2) Alcoholics Anonymous Hiking Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics Horse Trail running Appalachian Trail Light rail Equine conformation About a Boy Peachtree Road Race Boston Marathon Sprint (race) Tennessee Walker Connecticut Inflation Charles Goodyear Athletics at the 2004 Summer Olympics - Men's 400 metres Shoe Bay Area Rapid Transit Kokoda Track High-heeled shoe 2000 Australian Grand Prix Parachuting Glossary of climbing terms Bubble Bobble IBM PC compatible Athletics Washington Metro Segregated cycle facilities Sailing 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain London Marathon Communication skill Punt (boat) Mountain bike Cruising (maritime) Mach kernel The Amazing Race Edgware, Highgate and London Railway Damon Hill Urban sprawl Community emergency response team Guadalupe Mountains National Park Utility cycling Smile (album) 24 Hours of Le Mans Long Path Economic relations of Japan Compiler optimization Indianapolis 500 Barefoot Iditarod Marching band Random walk Badminton Lake Speed Crash Team Racing Ra (board game) Dressage Fast bowling TGV 2005 United States Grand Prix The Beach Boys Nike, Inc.
