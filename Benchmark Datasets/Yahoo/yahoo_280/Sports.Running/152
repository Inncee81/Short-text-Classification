what drills and stuff should i practice to be a better runner i mean to raise endurance and run faster i gues increasing my stride to intervals these are workouts that kill but trust me they work it all depends on what you are trianing for sprinting intervals will work on holding you top speed for a longer tme however you cannot run for a long time one day do a pyramid of m this is considered your endurance work out run these distances at approx then try to jog back if you can't don't worry just walk you'll be able to jog soon as you get better you ca increase the distance but don't go higher than m you can do the pyramid times as you get stronger for your speed work out is run m at appox to full start at times and then do't excede x then run m at full on a slightly up hill x up to x then run slightly down hill for m at full for the same amount of time the down hill will get you to be able to control your self at higher speed but do not go so fast that you go out of control for mid distance m m this will get you to hold a very fast pase for longer but not quite as fast run a pyramid do not excede m you could also do a and do that or times same walk or jog the equal distance for speed run m at x to x you can get up to m but do not excede x then m up hill at full and then m down hill at full x then for long distance training endurance day is m you can get up to m or you could run m x all at and walk or jog back an equal distance for speed you can do m at time then m up hill full x then m slightly down hill full speed x thesework outs will allow you to run longer distances with some speed but not as much as the previous then there is cros country intervas these are the worst but they help your endurance you ned to find a place that has a couple hills ands that you can figre out the distances you can start these on the track but they cannot be all on the track find a lap that is m small m med m large and then m extra largemake syre there is a sizable hill in atleast the extralarge and a small one at least in all the others when i say small i mean fairly small then do different combinations with these curcuits ex sm med lg xlg or sm lg xlg sm or med lg sm xlg you can figure out what is best for you i recomend walking the first couple of weks of doig this after completeing circuit approx m you can jog once you get used to it then for speed you can do the long distance speed work out these work out wil allow you to go on very long runs and your endurace will be very good but your speed may not be just choose the program that you want the results from before any of these work outs do a proper warm uo tis is crutal becuase these work outs are very hard on you bady and injuring your self will happen if you do not warm up and streych properly a good warm up would be finding a m bit and doing the following exersies with a jog or skip back do each execise x front skip with fowrard arm circles same with back arm circles skip with arms at degrees and swinging arms at degrees and coming across you cest to your back grape vine facing ne side one pass and then facing the other side the next time kareoka front leg comes high across the other leg higher than grapevine both sides front kick lunges a march a skip a run your arms at and you kee come up so that your thight is parrallel with the ground but kickers b skip a skip but you leg extends side shuffle both sides backward skip it is akward then front skip you can add different excersises just ake sure that your entire body is moving wen stretchig ensre that you stretch at the very least your calves to prevent shin splints hamstrings and quads i would recomend more stretching it really helps after endurance work outs no matter what speed ou choose run hills find a long steep hill run that sprint x mid dis x long x and then xcountry these numbers can all be changed to what suts you then start half way up and sprint them sprinting mid long xc again umbers can al be changed and increase these are base numberbecuase these are for base and strength it will not afect your speed the long hil should be between m and the little hil should be steep but actually only m sorry that i said half way for a god challange and hard work out run sand hills and if you are in a large building run stairs to increase you stride length skip stairs other drill that you can do to in crease speed and stride length are stright leg bounds bounding and acceleation make a starting line then make a line m from ther and be at full speed by that make and hold it for another m or so i
