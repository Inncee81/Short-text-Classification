manny pacquioa vs marco antonio barrera who will win and why is this on ppv my prediction i would give the odds to pacquioa cause hes a beast and he did win the last fight but im giving this fight to barrera it wasnt even the same barrera who showed up to fight manny the last fight and barrera was robbed i think of his last fight at least i felt he won it barrera has been hungry for this rematch for several years now and if he shows up ready to fight i gotta go with my man marco odds should definitely go to manny though i think it will go the distance based on barrera's style pacquiao will be the one doing the pressing barrera boxing and countering barrera has a lot more left than morales and this will be a far tougher proposition for manny than morales iii pacquiao may hurt barrera at points in the fight but barrera is wily enough to survive stay out of rouble for the most part and work with his jab i think manny wins and then should go on to fight jmm Marco Antonio Barrera Manuel Pacquiao Erik Morales Johnny Tapia Muhammad Ali Paulie Ayala Naseem Hamed Manny Ram__rez Boxing Stone Cold Steve Austin The Contender (television series) Black Books World Boxing Organization Def Jam Vendetta Joe Louis Roy Jones Jr. Tenshinhan The Great American Bash Marco Pantani December 2004 in sports 2004 World Series Shane Mosley Archie Moore Sonny Liston June 2004 in sports Extreme Championship Wrestling New York Giants Azumah Nelson FC Rostov Waking the Dragons Platoon (film) Run Lola Run November 2004 in sports The Emancipation of Mimi Shawn Michaels Carlos Cruz Texas Revolution Star Trek Mega Man III Poker jargon World Championship Wrestling Sugar Ray Robinson Springfield Falcons Evander Holyfield Free will Mike Tyson 2004 American League Championship Series Italy at the 2004 Summer Olympics Archery at the 2004 Summer Olympics Virgil Runnels, Jr. Mega Man IV Winky Wright Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns StarrCade Chris Jericho Home run Wilfredo G__mez Joe Frazier Kevin Nash San Marcos Pass Manny Legace Pay-per-view Joey Maxim September 2005 in sports War of the Worlds (2005 film) Carnival of Champions Matthew Saad Muhammad Craps Doctor Wily Michael Watson Scott Hall U.S. House election, 2006 Mega Man VII Frankie Randall Gambling Amy Dumas 2002 Tour de France The Curse of Peladon Counter-Strike Antonio Tarver Bernard Hopkins NBA Finals Truth Mega Man Ricardo Mayorga Alexis Arg__ello Antonio L__pez de Santa Anna EastEnders Probability Miami Dolphins Carlos Ortiz Battle of Cambrai Stanley Ketchel Micky Ward Professional wrestling match types 2005 NBA Finals Nicolino Locche Juan Laporte Royal Governor of Chile Clash of Champions
