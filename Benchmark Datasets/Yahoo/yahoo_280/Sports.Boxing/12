who is best boxer that would fit to match the boxer of the year awardee his name pacman pacquiao i heard this filipino is the best pound for pound boxer of this year is marquez or barrera ready for this guy l saw him fight fast and furious fact pacquiao tko'd barrera in the th corner threw towel fact marquez draw opinion pacquiao is a great fighter and like everyone else barrera and marquez in my opinion are the best match for him now i there were several distractions leading up to the barrera fight and he did not look sharp come fight time i am a fighter and if you are not fully focus it can matter so until they fight again later this year i won't know for sure marquez on the other hand in my opinion won the fight against pacman i watch all major fights with the tv muted to avoid being influenced by the crowd and commentators i later watch it with sound however based on his last with barrera i believe he can win a rematch i wish i had better facts and not opinions but that is all i can give at this time anything can happen in boxing and that makes it hard to predict matchups and winners Manuel Pacquiao Marco Antonio Barrera Boxing Erik Morales Muhammad Ali Mixed martial arts Shane Mosley Sugar Ray Robinson Evander Holyfield Roy Jones Jr. The Contender (television series) Jack Dempsey Johnny Tapia Betulio Gonz__lez World Boxing Organization Sonny Liston December 2004 in sports Henry Armstrong Archie Moore Shoot boxing Royce Gracie Joe Louis Joe Frazier Azumah Nelson Lennox Lewis Chris Byrd Rub__n Olivares Naseem Hamed Gameplay of StarCraft November 2004 in sports Professional wrestling match types Mickey Walker Willie Pep The Rumble in the Jungle Martial art Antonio Cervantes Jermain Taylor Meldrick Taylor Esteban De Jesus Paulie Ayala Pascual P__rez (boxing) Santos Laciar V__ctor Gal__ndez Seabiscuit Muay Thai Jack Johnson (boxer) George Foreman Amir Khan (boxer) Chuck Liddell Tenshinhan John Ruiz Sumo Bob Fitzsimmons The Malice at The Palace Jersey Joe Walcott Carmen Basilio Playoff Yori Boy Campas Shawn Michaels Lionel Rose Ivan Calder__n (boxer) Detroit Tigers Max Schmeling Whose Line Is It Anyway?
