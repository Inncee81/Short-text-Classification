i'm challenging the legitimacy of the linear tag to be the man you have to beat the man not necessarily when recognized champion james jeffries retired after defeating jack monroe in he took the title into retirement with him a new title was manufactured and given to the winner of the marvin hart jack root hart won in joe louis relinquished the heavyweight title and again interrupted the linear chain and another title had to be created in the great rocky marciano retired and a new championship was manufactured etc webster's dictionary definition of linear lineal an unbroken line of events or relativity relationship from beginning to end in order to be the man you have to beat the man so according to definition the so called linear heavyweight title doesn't really exist of course there are arguments for it but they cannot hold any weight due to the definition i don't believe in the linear title but i do believe in recognized champions and i think the fans and the media get to make that judgement not the alphabet boys please educated and intelligent responses only stupid foolish responses will be not be taken seriously actually they will be laughed and the author will be called a random female's name fill lewis' shoes excuse me lennox lewis was a joke not a champion he ducked more than a ball collector at a driving range lewis retired out of fear not age or legacy i agree with bryghtendeavors the linear title is fraudulent Boxing Rocky Marciano Lennox Lewis Professional wrestling match types Hulk Hogan Shawn Michaels Greg Valentine Archie Moore Joe Louis In Your House Leon White Bret Hart Survivor Series James J.
