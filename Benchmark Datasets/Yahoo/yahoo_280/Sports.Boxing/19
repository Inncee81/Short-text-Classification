sleep boxing i've been boxing for close to a month now and the other night i woke up to the sound of my window fan slamming against the room i had no idea how it happened but then last night i had the same thing happen and i was still throwing punches this is no joke i'm kind of worried about it it could be a problem if the ladies are over any idea why this happens or a way to stop it lol wow this seriously sounds like you are really into your boxing nothing more than your mind seriously staying in focus mode they say most thoughts that you dream up or conjure up yourself in your sleep are of some strong interest to what you really want in life basically you must really want to succeed in boxing and probably have been training pretty good i know what the feeling is because i have been through it thinking about a coming up fight or about perfecting a new maneuver i had just learned to greater my boxing skill you think about it so much that when you sleep you'll in fact dream it into a reality in your mind your body starts to move as if you are interacting with it when awake if this is a problem to you bro just try not to think about boxing so much but i honestly think it is a good think it shows how much you are dedicated and focused how much your body and mind really want it you should let the ladies know before they go to bed with you lol if you in fact end up hitting one of the girls you are with in bed just tell them you thought she was being harmed and because of natural instinct you started to box to protect ha ha then she will feel all good inside knowing her man is there to protect her when in fact you didn't know what the hell was going on lol focus your mind with other things in life slow down take a breath and relax Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story Milton H.
