a prime marciano versus a prime holyfield marciano undefeated with a lions heart iron jaw a young george forman punch both hands holyfield best built boxer in history bar none strong jaw fast counter puncher great endurence can tie up even an octopus marciano no known weakness short of arm reach holyfield best of class when his heart is into it marciano fits nicely into the dempsey class but more powerful in punch than jack holyfield supurb boxer that many feel was infinitly better than the young cassius clay if thats possible who would win what round first let me correct you with a few mistakes that you happen to jot down as your fictional opinions on marciano sense i am a boxing historian as well as ex boxer marciano had one hand his right nothing more and nothing less not both hands pal also his power was not even remotely close to a young george foreman let alone compared to dempsey sorry but no way in hell did marciano move like dempsey let alone punch like him two different styles partner although marciano was more powerful than dempsey he sure in the hell did not move like him if you try to argue with me about these stating you are only making yourself look foolish trying to outwit me in my own game won't possibly work for you now back to the question at hand holyfield at true weight would be cruiser weight and marciano would fit right into the category if he gained the few pounds necessary to compete he wouldn't be ranked as a heavyweight let alone a light heavy is middleweight as much as marciano likes to rely on his powerful right i am afraid that he would have to utilize a little more skill with it to actually hurt holyfield holyfield moves efficiently and he does tie you up effectively also with the headbutting i wouldn't be surprised if marciano starts to cut and bleed in saying that if marciano doesn't knock holyfield out within the early rounds don't expect him to do it later holyfield only gets better later into the fights and he starts to headbutt more expect marciano to show definite signs of cuts and bleeding amongst his face i see marciano landing one right and then literally eating a flurry of counter punches thrown by holyfield as you know marciano has a tendency to drop his left hand very low and with a skilled fighter like holyfield he would see the opening and take advantage besides that marciano has no real leverage as he needs his left dropped completely down to throw a massive bomb with is right basically like i said if marciano doesn't land that one bomb don't expect him to take holyfield out later i think holyfield if the fight ended up lasting for long round would end up cutting marciano bad which would result in a stoppage of the fight i don't think holyfield can knockout marciano but i do believe he can cut him bad because marciano did cut very easily either marciano by ko or holyfield by stoppage this is my final answer and i can't say what round because it can go either way and there is no telling how long it will take the much slower lack of general defense marciano to land his right p s not only do i believe you will be unsatisfied with my answer only because you are a delusional marciano fan who doesn't know the science behind boxing but it's alright because many will see and read and understand that fact is marciano had limited skill compared to the fighters of later years specifically the 's and up believe what you want buddy but the fact remains that i haven't spent most of my life in the boxing world for nothing and not even a few thumbs down will stop the fact that my answer in general will be better than all who can answer this question with fine detail fact is i am not a top contributor to these boxing questions for nothing and i am getting tired of these absurd marciano questions coming from fans who first judge him by the color of his skin and not the fact that he was just an average boxer with great power and chin plus heart everything else has to definitely fall into the average category whatever though just read and take into consideration that i mean what i say and what i say is fact not fiction thank you Jack Dempsey George Foreman
