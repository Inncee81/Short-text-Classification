hopkins vs dawson i know it wont happen but lets say all the planets align and it does happen who wins hopkins is my favorite boxer i have a ton of respect for him but i think dawson would beat him with little trouble thats just my opinion what do you guys think dawson will beat anyone in that weight class imo including hopkins hopkins is one of my favorite fighters but dawson will use his speed and youth and outwork outpoint hopkins i dont even think hopkins should be in the ring with calzaghe at this point of his career hopkins has done it all he should be able to retire with pride the thing is that boxing is in his blood and he doesnt show any signs that he really wants to retire boxing is all he knows Boxing Bernard Hopkins Joe Calzaghe Roy Jones Jr. Willie Pep Sugar Ray Robinson Joe Louis Muhammad Ali Sugar Ray Leonard The Contender (television series) Archie Moore George Foreman F__lix Trinidad Fighting Harada Marco Antonio Barrera Julio C__sar Ch__vez Rocky Marciano Jos__ Napoles Oscar de la Hoya Chris Eubank Jennifer Lopez Lupe Pintor Steve Collins Humphrey Bogart Lionel Rose Atomic Kitten Erik Morales Billy Conn Mike Tyson Juan Martin Coggi Mickey Walker Kid Chocolate Eder Jofre Shane Mosley World Boxing Organization Michael Carbajal Carmen Basilio Alex Ramos Jesse James Leija Gregorio Peralta Andre Dawson Jack Johnson (boxer) Arturo Gatti Humberto Gonzalez Evander Holyfield Mixed martial arts Livingstone Bramble Theresa Arnold Miguel Canto Johns Hopkins University Henry Armstrong Danny Lopez Barry McGuigan Jack Dempsey Carlos Zarate Emile Griffith Family Feud Brenda Burnside Julio C__sar Ch__vez, Jr. Kid Gavilan Yasutsune Uehara Alexis Arg__ello Sonny Liston Frank Bruno Kansas City Chiefs Bobby Chacon Isra Girgrah Santos Laciar Jermain Taylor New England Patriots Boxing training H__ctor Camacho Gerry Cooney PRIDE Muay Thai Jimmy McLarnin Julian Solis Nino Benvenuti Middleweight Michael Moorer Winky Wright Wilfred Benitez Quicksilver Messenger Service Yvonne Trevino Jeff Fenech 24 Hours of Le Mans The Battle of the Little Giants Antonio Tarver Floyd Patterson Nottingham Forest F.C.
