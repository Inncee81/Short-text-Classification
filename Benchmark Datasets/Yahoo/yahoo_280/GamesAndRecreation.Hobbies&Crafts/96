hi i just built a model rocket and if i launch it how will i find it just incase it went into the woods what i used to do with my estes rockets was to add a tablespoon of colored chalk from marking string when the ejection charge went off that would provide clear marking of the apogee i then added a small streamer to the top of the parachute in neon color to increase the visibility and painted the rocket itself in neown colors or white to contrast with the ground or trees of course the simplest thing is to launch in a very large field to avoid the trees good luck and be safe Model rocket Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Lightning Spacecraft propulsion Rocket Ejector seat Tag STS-51-L Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Galileo spacecraft Wood Solar eclipse Tesla coil Saturn V Colours, standards and guidons Solid rocket Vostok 1 Naval mine Avalanche Freedom 7 Model aircraft Marching band Hash table Mars Exploration Rover USS Tunny (SS-282) Space disaster Moonraker F-104 Starfighter Firework Apollo 15 Gliding Paragliding Objective-C Pikmin Robert Goddard (scientist) P-51 Mustang Campfire Plasma (physics) Billiards Black Trail blazing Edwards Air Force Base Space elevator Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Helium Advance Wars: Dual Strike M16 (rifle) Shell (projectile) Deep Impact (space mission) Floppy disk MS-06 Zaku II Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Gemini 9A V-2 rocket Laser Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Anti-submarine weapon Mushroom hunting Voskhod spacecraft Sputnik 1 Christmas tree Team Fortress Classic Quake III Arena Starsiege: Tribes Cheating in Counter-Strike Apollo 8 Tank CPU cache Aurora (astronomy) Rocket experiments in the area of Cuxhaven Piet Mondrian Neon Coffee Sundial Drill bit Artillery Drag racing Bachem Ba 349 Second Battle of the Atlantic Jupiter Apollo spacecraft Avro Arrow Drawing Rise of Nations Fluorescent lamp Estes Industries Half-Life Hang gliding B-47 Stratojet Color theory P-38 Lightning Combine (Half-Life 2) Gemini 6A Radio controlled airplane Scale model Occam's Razor Land mine Color Space Shuttle program STS-60
