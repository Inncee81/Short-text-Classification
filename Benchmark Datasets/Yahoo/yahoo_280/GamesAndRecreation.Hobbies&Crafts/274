i am looking for a strong glue so i can glue crystals beads etc to leather that will not turn rubbery i have tried alot of glues and i really want a glue that will bond and really hold and is not easy to pull off the problem with sewing them on is that perhaps they will need an industrial strength needle that is depending on the thickness of the leather have you tried plastic modelling glue the stuff dries instantly and is incredibly strong i'm sure you could get it from many art craft hardware stores around the type i have is bostik who specialise in glues and that type of stuff the glue container is small with a cone like lid if you want to look out for it good luck Knife Bookbinding Leather Pottery Radio controlled airplane Comanche Polypropylene Knitting Floppy disk Upholstery Adhesive Hamster Atari ST Strap-on dildo Textile manufacturing Carnivorous plant Welding Textile manufacturing terminology Climbing equipment Tofu Violin Glass Earring Gag (BDSM) Sewing Manifold Box Screw Inhalant Piano Applique Concrete Fishing Carpet Tin can Wood Piccolo Junior Saga Gramophone record Dairy Gas metal arc welding Guitar Epoxy Pine Cyanoacrylate Semiconductor device Glossary of climbing terms Tanning IPod Japanese toilet Papier-m__ch__ Wood carving Ramen Shotgun Dialysis Model aircraft Polyethylene Inventory Organic peroxide Jute Solar cell Masonry Solvent Turquoise Lightning Carbon nanotube Tank Solar sail Bicycle frame Clothing Rigging Cross-country skiing Horseshoe Ice cream Fire extinguisher Ship model Aggregate (composite) Bong Computer Sheaf (mathematics) Table tennis Energy development Irrigation Japanese tea ceremony Tack Boat building Mattress Casting Castle of the Winds Printed circuit board Vermicompost Skateboard Cartridge (firearms) Singapore Police Force Mouse (computing) Bonsai Revolver Naruto jutsu
