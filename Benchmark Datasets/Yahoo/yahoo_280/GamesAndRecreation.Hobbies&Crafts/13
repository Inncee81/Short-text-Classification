how can i attatch feathers to cloth right then my sister and i are making a masquerade type dress months in advance as it will take quite a bit of time for me for our halloween dance we've decided that i will be a phoenix but we're not sure how to attatch the feathers to the cloth of the skirt or even really what type of cloth to use for this project also any extra advice on what kind of feathers to use or whatever you think up would be lovely thanks in adance i think you should glue a small loop of fabric to the quill of each feather then sew these to the fabric in rows do the bottom row first so all the rows will cover each other then cover the last row with a pretty ribbon or trim Comanche Textile manufacturing terminology Textile manufacturing Mattress Knitting Sewing machine Clothing Undergarment Upholstery Skirt and dress Carpet Kimono Bookbinding Kilt Fan (implement) Headgear Han Chinese clothing Order of the Garter Suit (clothes) Feather Gothic Lolita Sewing Kayak Typewriter Trousers Victorian fashion Culture of Ethiopia Hat Christmas tree Quilting Pattern (sewing) Puyo Pop Fever Japanese tea ceremony Jennifer Lopez Roxette Sarong Manifold Cloth RuneScape economy Dinghy Shoe Climbing equipment Diving suit Hakama Culture of Korea Coat (clothing) Barbie Hijab Diaper Poker jargon Figure skating Wound Crinoline Piano Professional wrestling match types Academic dress of Oxford University Tailor RuneScape quests Swimsuit Animal Crossing Punk rock Harry Potter (character) Clothing terminology Domesticated turkey My Parents are Aliens Car body style Social aspects of clothing Nakoruru (Samurai Shodown) Haute couture Pen Applique Shorts Madhuri Guin Tire Harp Solar cell Chair Yohoho!
