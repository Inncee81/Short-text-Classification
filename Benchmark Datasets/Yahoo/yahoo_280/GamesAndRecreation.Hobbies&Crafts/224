is there anyone out there who can make a pattern for a rug if i give the design that i want i want to raise money for the charity part of my local football team and i know what design i want i just need for someone to make a pattern to follow so that i can make it i want it to be about metres long the easiest way to do this is to get a piece of rug hooking canvas and cut it to size with extra rows on all sides then count the number of squares in the area that you want the pattern to cover next get some graph paper and create one that is the same number of grids as the canvas by taping pages together if needed the size of the piece of graph paper needs to have enough grids to equal square of the canvas next draw the design that you want to create on the graph paper and colour it in using the colours you will use for the rug itself then hook the rug following the pattern you drew on the graph paper good luck i am sure that your football team will appreciate all your hard work Textile manufacturing terminology Sudoku Glossary of graph theory Cross-stitch Carpet Minesweeper (computer game) Cellular automaton Bingo Piet Mondrian Tai shogi Graph theory CPU cache Oscilloscope Surrealist techniques British national grid reference system Diamond cut Tessellation Extreme Programming Drawing Random walk Fischer Random Chess Casting Knitting Spreadsheet Dai dai shogi Halting problem Pottery Racetrack (game) Woodworking Paper size Maka dai dai shogi Betting (poker) Spline (mathematics) Polyomino Taikyoku shogi Graphics Dominoes Mattress Florida State Roads Solar cell Floppy disk Dinghy Shogi Ramsey's theorem Softball Tenjiku shogi Normal distribution Redundant array of independent disks Book Crossword Chess terminology Rigging Glossary of American football Vacuum tube Compiler optimization Conway's Game of Life Clothing Berlin wool work United States dollar Reversi Volleyball Colours, standards and guidons Hat Sail-plan Cartesian coordinate system Signed graph Pascal's triangle Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace American football strategy Drew Struzan Combinatorial species Symmetry Gramophone record Playoff Copy protection Heraldry Football (soccer) Reference counting Aerial (dance move) Domain-specific programming language Poker jargon Mahjong Atari 8-bit family Flag Flag of the United States Solar variation Transformer On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Kasparov versus The World Scene graph Tetris Dai shogi Hasse diagram Judkins shogi Tori shogi Autostereogram Chu shogi Tariff Wallpaper group Robert Hooke
