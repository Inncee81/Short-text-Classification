how do you make thank you cards seem personal i'm writing out thank you cards for people who came to my birthday party i was wondering how i could make them seem more real and personal all the answers so far have helped first you're actually writing them out so they will already be personal try to mention the item they gave how you are so glad to have it or how when you will use it if they gave a gift card mention that name of the store that you love shopping there or love books cds shoes whatever particular item the store has Negima Santa Claus Surveillance Supermarket Sears Holdings Corporation Birthday Convenience store Animal Crossing MapleStory Compact disc Customs and etiquette of Japan Neopets Retailer Goldenrod City Christmas The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy St. Valentine's Day The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Library catalog Nordstrom $ale of the Century Shanghai Metro Gaia Online Ages of Uru Property (ownership right) Online shop Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Epcot ITunes Music Store Loyalty program Let's Make a Deal The Jazz Singer Wal-Mart Electronic commerce Consensus decision-making Anne Rice The Ashlee Simpson Show Internet fraud Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Gerina Dunwich 7-Eleven The Inside Justification (theology) Paul Is Dead Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Fight Club Library reference desk Hello Kitty Autograph Sento Honey and Clover Whose Line Is It Anyway?
