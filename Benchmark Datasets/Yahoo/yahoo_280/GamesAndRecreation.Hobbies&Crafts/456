simple quilt ideas i'm trying to think of ideas for my next quilt i'm a beginner and have only made a crazy quilt before i would like to do something a little more challenging then a crazy quilt but haven't found anything does anyone have any ideas thanks if you're not quite ready for pieced blocks yet you might want to try something like a trip around the world quilt that's just a bunch of squares all the same size which are sewed together in a pattern that's concentric it ends up being a sort of diamond shape actually a square on point in other words a row of yellow squares then a row of blue squares then a row of purple squares or any color combination you want to make that pattern even more interesting you can also use various shades and tints of each color for the squares rather than just the same fabric and color for them all in other words for blue squares you could use a number of different fabrics each of which reads mainly blue but may have any kind of pattern on it or some other colors they'll usually all go together quite nicely and still be seen mostly as blue when that technique for choosing fabrics is used the quilt is often called a scrap quilt though the concept could be used for almost any type of pieced quilt another easier thing to do is something like you've already done maybe sewing strips of different fabrics together on their long sides to create a long enough unit to go all the way down the length of a quilt do at least or of those long pieced units then sew them to each other on their long sides with a single long strip of fabric in between many of the african or strip quilts are made that way and can look really cool the next thing to do in complexity would be to begin making some of the simpler blocks then joining them together in a quilt with or without lattices between simpler blocks are those which have only rectangles in them like basketweave or rail fence or that have only squares in them like nine patch and some which have squares along with a few half triangles half triangles are a lot easier to do than quarter square triangles or long skinny triangles you can look up quilt examples of any of those names i capitalized above using google's image search to see loads of examples and probably even get specific instructions so start on this page http images google com imghp tab wi then just fill in the window with something like trip around the world quilt or rail fence quilt be sure to use quotation marks around any words that must appear in a certain order then click search images hth and have fun diane b Wallpaper group Symmetry Quilt Textile manufacturing terminology Mattress Quilting Pascal's triangle CPU cache Lattice (group) Billiards Knitting Flag RISC Applique CPU design Minesweeper (computer game) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Fischer Random Chess Kimono Undergarment Colours, standards and guidons Sudoku Compiler optimization Cellular automaton Triangle Transposition cipher Antenna (radio) Casting Yohoho!
