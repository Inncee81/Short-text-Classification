maker of unique glass jewlery vials my friend's th birthday is comming up and i figured it'd be really neat if i did something unique for her she's a huge naruto fan and her favorite character is gaara so what i wanted to do was possibly have a glass necklace of gaara's gourd made and fill it with sand so she could wear it does anyone know someone who could do this or a shop where i could buy an item similar to it or if no one knows either of those things could someone tell me how much it could end up running me if i ended up having it custom made i figured the vial would be an inch inch and a half long max any help would be much appreciated look around anime store sites and see if you can find some cos play pieces that would be the easiest try www animenation com or www animecastle com to start with next try looking at bottles for sand art crafting stores carry these and you never know when you might just find what you need the last and most expensive option would be to find an artisan who specializes in glass blowing bring lots of pictures and an open mind you need to get close not exact any fan will identify close enough quickly Akatsuki (Naruto) Gaara Gaia Online Characters of Naruto Uzumaki Naruto Naruto jutsu Rock Lee Hamster RuneScape skills Bong RuneScape weapons RuneScape quests Turquoise Violin Naval mine Trigonometric function Drill bit Opportunity rover Glass G.I.
