any tips for picking the right pack to pull from a box of sports cards when i buy baseball or football cards from a store like wal mart or target how do i figure out which pack in a box has a card that's actually worth something my advise is to never buy packs from an open box the reason is there are actually people that make their living going from store to store to search those pack for the inserts high value card i am speaking from experience as i personally know someone who does this for a living he would search packs at walmart and target and then sell the cards online or to a card store he actually goes to about stores a day he even have a deal with a few card shop owner to search packs at their shop also the way he does it is by feeling the packs and also weighing the packs inserts jersey card etc usually are thicker or have a different texture of course i am not saying that you would never get anything of value if you buy packs from an open box because there are some high value card that just could not be differentiated with the regular card simply by feeling the packs or weighing them autograph for example but your odds are just worse another reason not to is that most serious collector would keep on buying from the box until they got the high value card insert and then stop buying so usually card shop owner or retailer would combine a few searched box into one box to make it look like a full box to conclude save your money until you could afford a full box buy the box and keep opening packs until you get the high value insert use the odds listed on the box you are suppose to get then sell the rest of the packs online and let someone else be the fool Wal-Mart Surveillance Tesco Sears Holdings Corporation Poker jargon Retailer IPod Sega Saturn Gramophone record Internet fraud IBM PC compatible Vending machine Nintendo DS Textile manufacturing Yu-Gi-Oh!
