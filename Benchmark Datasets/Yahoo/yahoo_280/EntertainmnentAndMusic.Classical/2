liebestraum no by liszt i'm learning to play this song and i need a good performer to listen to for guidance i don't want the song to be played as fast as lang lang does i want it to be slower and more dream like you wouldn't expect a love dream to just fly by without making an impression it's impressive how lang lang plays it but i don't think that is how it was originally intended anyhow i prefer a free link to just the song but if that's not possible suggest a cd to cubcur would you recommend that i try the cadenzas and other difficult spots first before taking the song step by step chronologically my teacher says that he usually does it step by step a few notes a day in the case of cadenzas but tackling the hard parts first is also a wise strategy i'm just finishing the first phase of the song so i would have to at least do one cadenza now anyway also since i won't see my teacher until two weeks could you tell me what exactly is meant by each of the statements in the piece i know poco allegro con afetto means a little fast with emotion but i do not know what any other sayings mean language translators don't help me much either beyond agreeing with the advice already given that copying others' views of any work is about the last thing one should do i'm concerned that you haven't mentioned the arrows liszt has already put in your quiver with which to tackle these three nocturnes so let's go there first the dreamlike quality you mentioned you will find in the first of the three 'hohe liebe' prefaced with a motto by uhland this third and final one however addresses quite a different aspect of love hence the conflict of climate between your imagined one and the one that's being asked for here some editions neglect to provide the motto for each of the pieces which does the performer no service at all so here it is for this third one 'o lieb' by freiligrath in a quick prose translation oh love love for as long as you are able to love for as long as you like to love the hour will come when you stand at gravesides and lament ensure that your heart glows and fosters and nurtures love for as long as another heart beats warmly with love towards you and when that other closes the breast towards you do what you can towards the other to love and make the other happy every hour and for no moment make the other sad and guard your tongue well all too soon a harsh word can escape from it o god it was not meant in malice but the other departs and weeps as you can see where 'love's sweet dream' is concerned this lisztian 'toto' is definitely not in 'kansas' anymore to support his understanding of this poetic motto liszt asks for 'poco allegro con affetto' incremented after one page by 'poco agitato' after another by 'piu animato' to drive it 'sempre stringendo' to an 'appassionato assai' that explodes into an inescapable cadenza of pyrotechnical glitter to try and diffuse the tension and prepare for the return were you a student of mine i'd certainly not play it for you the 'model cd' equivalent s as you shaping your own views is much more important but a stepping stone to provide a reference framework could be two metronome marks one for the baseline 'clock' and one for the heart of the stringendo episode at its most clamorous and declamatory 'poco allegro' dotted note 'sempre stringendo' pg 'ff' dotted note notating the mm figures as though there's an alla breve in force here gives more useful numbers to work accurately with everything's negotiable within and beyond this framework but it's worth bearing in mind that the central cadenza requires a clock much in range with the second one i have given for it to work at all it needs a minimum speed level to 'speak' edit you'll need to get yourself a good musical dictionary for the terminology in the long term but in the meantime flip what terms you need clarifying into my mailbox and i'll do them for you that way this reply doesn't become truly ridiculously longer than necessary g meanwhile you'll need to number the bars in your score if they're not already numbered so we don't end up at cross purposes referencing things thinking of which though i normally try to keep out of this one gg it would be really helpful to lose the term 'song' here and substitute 'piece' or 'work' as these three nocturnes were originally songs for voice and piano first and both versions still exist side by side in the repertoire edit it wouldn't be proper for me to comment directly on your teacher's suggestions you mention however you may find some general observations on performing liszt useful on his ornamental cadenzas in particular for which those in this specific work can serve as examples as well as any other busoni in one of many of his highly astute comments on liszt provides an insight of great value to performers the secret of liszt's ornamentation he said is its symmetry frequently such symmetry is immediately visible from the outset this can be at the level of gesture or literal text or a combination of both yet equally often you need to step back and widen the scope of your view of the material before the overall balance becomes clear the second cadenza here is a case in point in many performances it is rendered as though the cadenza as a whole consists of bars in which case a sense of symmetry is not immediate take a step back and include the lh part of bar and multiple symmetries are immediately visible a lh only opening and rh only close form the bookends to two blocks of gesture material in between they in their turn being each made up of two parts in the first case bar the second part is repeating the substance of the first an octave lower in the second case bar an overarching compound arpeggio gesture is made up of two one up one down quite distinctly differently contoured building blocks in bars the lh leads in the extended bar the rh does liszt assumes a player with a complete technique from the outset in all his works therefore learn the entire work as a single span architecture beginning to end if you encounter a major new technical feature for instance bar of the second cadenza don't deconstruct the work itself by practising fragments of it in isolation it will ultimately fragment your performance of it too instead deconstruct for instance bar technically and deal with the elements it's made up from instead it being a combination of broken major rds rh and minor rds lh descending chromatically in contrary motion to form a chain of chromatically descending broken v chords you now have all the elements from which to make up your own exercises severally and in any combination you care to dream up once the technical principles have become second nature to you practised in the abstract like this you will be able to apply them at will whenever the occasion arises all you will need to do is check the score in question for the starting and ending points of such a figuration and your hands will obligingly do the rest in bar you're dealing with arpeggios and chromatic passing notes in alternating hands the patterns are regular and repeating work out their 'formulas' and practise them in the abstract in all possible keys again until they have become second nature to you then apply the technique just acquired to where you need it in the piece in hand finally specifically between bar and there is an insistent use of tenths in the lh only one of which is marked as broken and it is the only one that needs to be broken all the others must be played as actual tenths 'in one' for they lay the foundation for the startling sound effect of the broken lh th in bar to make its mark if you 'dilute' the tenths in the preceding page bar and the rest of your closing sequence depending on it will flop without a trace not good as with most things lisztian enjoy the ride above all and good luck Logic Philosophy of language Franz Liszt Chess terminology
