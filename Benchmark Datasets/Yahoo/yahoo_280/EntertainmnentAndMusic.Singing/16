can someone help me so i love singing and my music teacher told me i have a beautiful voice but i never show it off the only time i sing out loud is when im alone or the music is really loud i really want to get a record deal or be on disney channel what some ways to get used to singing when people can hear me omg a blast from the past when i was in high school i was told the same thing i joined the chorus and was singled out to try for a state wide competition i agreed to do it simply because i wanted to sing and had to get over this nervousness the try outs were in a room of judges with their backs to you this helped as nobody had to actually look at me i got in the competition and that rose my confidence a bit however as i got older i was still afraid to sing in front of people by your statement disney channel i'm guessing you're kind of young to be going out to karaoke bars but that's where i shook off the nervousness i picked a song i knew real well and although the microphone was shaking from my hand i did a great job now i sing in a band solo all the time with no nerves at all the thing is when you've got a great voice and you get complimented on it you should go with it and trust it if they don't like your voice they wouldn't say anything at all swallow the nerves because you won't get anywhere if you let them take over join a chorus group if you have friends that like to sing maybe start your own little vocal group in school with the aid of a teacher and see if you can get a quartet song during chorus concerts make sure each person has a small solo in the song but standing up with friends will help get the nerves down a bit because you'll have a support team don't forget your parents and siblings they will support you too that's important don't ever let go of a dream pursue it to the end Shaggy dog story Jon Secada The Ashlee Simpson Show Blonde on Blonde Quarashi Journey (band) The Isley Brothers Blood on the Tracks The Band We Belong Together Carpenters The Wall Time Out of Mind Avenue Q She Loves You Therion (band) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Rich Mullins Karaoke Freddie Mercury Spice Girls Sly & the Family Stone Garth Brooks Highway 61 Revisited Bohemian Rhapsody Girls Aloud Liam Gallagher 10cc Yoko Ono Peter Gabriel Great Teacher Onizuka Friends Pointer Sisters The Supremes Patti LaBelle Milton H.
