oxycontin mg is that the same as taking mg of oxycodone ir every hours im trying to figure out why my cousin got prescribed oxy's instead of her usual percocet she was fine with mg of percocet every hours and now was switched to oxy mg im nervous for her because she is opiate naive and was flying from just the mg i made sure to tell her not to ever split or crush the pills since she was about to break it in half to see how she would react thank god i was there thanks everyone so far thats what i though that the doctor upped the dose he should have prescribed her the mg oxy since she was fine taking mg every hours since the oxy only lasts hours you know and no she dosn't crush pills she just wanted to split one thanks again the mg ir is immediate release and the effects only last hours for pain relief the mg is sustained relief and the effects last for hours it is a longer acting medication so she should be taking fewer doses this is probably what the doctor was thinking when he changed the meds he must have thought she was taking them to often he upped the dose a bit but she can take half a tablet if it will suit her needs if she is crushing them or cutting them in half she is doing so to get a buzz or high from the pills she may be addicted and need to seek help to break the habit Oxycodone Paracetamol Buprenorphine Migraine Drug addiction Diazepam Opioid Analgesic Antidepressant Medical prescription Methylphenidate Methadone Methamphetamine Addiction Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Barbiturate Narcotic Cannabis (drug) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Asthma Maprotiline Cocaine Psoriasis Chronic fatigue syndrome Local anesthesia LSD Medical cannabis Medicine Sedative Drug abuse Tocopherol Radiation therapy Apollo 8 Sulfasalazine Folic acid Emergency contraception Menstrual cycle Ketamine St John's wort Coffee Gamma-hydroxybutyrate Hydrocodone Malaria Illegal drug trade COX-2 inhibitor Cephalexin Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Physician Antipsychotic Rabies Diabetes mellitus Osteoarthritis Clomipramine Extreme Programming Propranolol Sildenafil Animal testing Decompression sickness Zolpidem Venlafaxine Lamotrigine Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prohibition (drugs) Herpes simplex virus Amiodarone Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Radiation poisoning Alternative medicine Howard Hughes Homeopathy Ionizing radiation Elvis Presley Aspirin Fasting Flunitrazepam Kurt Cobain Pharmaceutical company Doxepin Insulin Hypnosis Multiple sclerosis Withdrawal Opium Benzodiazepine Paroxetine Alanis Morissette Chemical abortion Codeine Baldness treatments Urinary incontinence Paget's disease of bone
