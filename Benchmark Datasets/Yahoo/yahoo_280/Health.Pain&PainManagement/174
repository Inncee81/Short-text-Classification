i'm having a great deal of pain in my upper left back the pain will also extend to my left arm i notice that every time i turn my head to the left the pain is definitely increased i have been taking some bayer pain reliever and it has helped a little bit i have no idea how i developed this little problem but it is driving me nuts any ideas on what this can be i hope that i have provided enough information thanks for your help sounds to me like you may have strained a muscle in your neck there are many muscles in your neck that also attach down in your shoulder blade region you may have slept funny which caused the irritation the irritation in your neck may be causing referred pain down into your arm i would get a good massage to your neck and shoulder blade area and see if that helps to relieve your pain problems with your heart can also be referred into your left shoulder and down the arm if you have any history of heart problems i would seek medical attention the fact that your symptoms occur with movement of your head makes me think this is not the case if the massage does not help i would consider having your doctor take a look and possibly refer you to a physical therapist who will be able to evaluate your symptoms and get a better idea of what is going on Repetitive strain injury Equine conformation Massage Urinary incontinence Traumatic brain injury Myocardial infarction Medicine Pneumonia First aid Angina Professional wrestling holds Chronic fatigue syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Carpal tunnel syndrome Prostate cancer Fibromyalgia Physical examination Duchenne muscular dystrophy Cephalic disorder Fecal incontinence Chiropractic Decompression sickness Professional wrestling throws Childbirth Humerus Iliotibial band syndrome Weight training Syringomyelia Milton H.
