burning lip i just got some grapes out of the fridge and ate them maybe they had chile on them or something suddenly they started burning so much it hurts i put ice but it still hurts any ideas well grapes contain acid and sometimes my throat hurts when i eat them maybe instead of your throat it was your lips this time try just drinking some water because it might be the inside and not the outside just feeling different you might just have to wait until it finishes another theory is that you may be allergic to them or if you had lip gloss or lipstick on that might have affected it too Acid The Shining (film) Tattoo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Champagne (beverage) Hot sauce Lipstick Wine Tofu Cocaine Lip balm 613 mitzvot Kosher foods Pisco Tooth Cosmetics Gatorade Marathon (sport) The X-Files (season 1) Allergy Refrigerator Hangul Conjunctivitis Grape Nine Inch Nails Wine making Roman eating and drinking Food preservation Psoriasis Korban Oral sex Embouchure Cancer of the larynx Piccolo Junior Saga Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards Wine degustation Trumpet Common cold Fanta Carbon dioxide Diarrhea Gray Wolf Fecal incontinence Crohn's disease Salad Fingers Secobarbital Lycanthropy Shaggy dog story Book of Isaiah Urinary incontinence Hay fever Chile pepper Hypoglycemia Jonestown Body piercing Genericized trademark The Curse of Fenric Throat singing Grape seed oil Hitler's death Carburetor Raisin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Food Jackass: The Movie The Marshall Mathers LP Fasting Marilyn Monroe Professional wrestling holds Chili con carne Professional wrestling throws Rodney McKay Paget's disease of bone Stuttering Theory of conduct Chocolate Richard Chase Peanut Cabernet Sauvignon Insulin Great Depression Alcoholics Anonymous Sherbet Ice wine Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Hi-Fi Murders Maison Ikkoku Tooth enamel Fatality Mouthpiece Hansel und Gretel Treehouse of Horror V Sento Fire eater Cheese Atomic Kitten Juggernaut (comics)
