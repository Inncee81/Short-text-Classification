significance of tattoo on ladies lower backs personally i think they are nice i had a friend over the weekend refer to them as 'tramp stamps' i thought that was pretty discriminatory but a funny way of looking at it but there is some truth in it you know when ever a guy sees a lady with one they are not staring specifically at their tattoos lol so what is your opinion of them do they signify these women are tramps just innocent art or seriously i could give a rats azz where the woman gets a tattoo however some women do flat out say yeah its a tramp stamp hehe usually they're playboy model wanna bes or just ditsy as hell when they act like that me personally i too would look at a lower back tattoo as a target its like all these women getting tongue piercings its so common that nobody really believes that they were originally done to women for the pleasure of the man and vice versa anyways the term tramp stamp doesnt mean that a lady is a tramp for getting in put right there like the other million women that get them right there but in this perverted day in age something like that is just a target for the guy to jizz on kind of like a tattoo right above the womans vagina its a target for the guys to jizz on why else would a woman get a tattoo right there to make it look better hell if you have a vagina it looks perfect the way it is its not a christmas tree you have to put a bunch of decorations on to make it look presentable sorry got off track what bothers me about tattoos on womens lower backs is that when you look at them because they are showing very easily because they are wearing painted on hip hugger pants and a skin tight boob showing shirt on they get pizzed off at you for looking wtf thats why when a woman says the whole i wanted a tattoo i could cover up if i needed to bs i laugh because if they really wanted a tattoo they could cover up theyd get it elsewhere like the ankle shoulder or some other bullsh t hidding spot if you get a tattoo dont cover it up and if its a tattoo for you then youd get it in a place where you could see it simply by looking down at it i just dont understand why a woman would get a tattoo there its more like a trend now a days more than anything and the only thing that makes sense out of it all is that a woman gets a tattoo there is so that she can be more sexy and playful in bed hence the term tramp stamp so if your daughter gets one dont trust her if you have one be honest with yourself and everyone else youre not a tramp but you wanted to be a little more exciting for your man if thats not the case then you fell deeply into the biggest tattoo trend since the sailor tattoos congrats Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Tattoo Undergarment AFI 100 Years series Avenue Q Professional wrestling holds Angelina Jolie Kimono EastEnders The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie SpongeBob SquarePants Nudity Recurring South Park characters Oral sex Cliff Richard Sin City Spice Girls Marilyn Monroe Professional wrestling slang Jon Secada Body piercing Kenny McCormick Strap-on dildo Aerial (dance move) Social rule Hiking The Catcher in the Rye Social aspects of clothing The Ashlee Simpson Show Human Kurt Angle Professional wrestling throws Earring Sinfest Joan Crawford Nine Inch Nails Avril Lavigne Anal sex Comanche Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Human sexual behavior Clothing Barbie Anne Boleyn Bob Jones University The Amber Spyglass One Tree Hill (TV series) Time Out of Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ren and Stimpy Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Ranma __ characters Great Teacher Onizuka Trousers Memento (film) Violin Lady and the Tramp American Psycho Shaggy dog story Trailer Park Boys Eastern Orthodox Church Undergrads Shorts Jackass: The Movie Hellsing Joke Irezumi Ion Davidov Shawn Michaels Good Charlotte Late Night with Conan O'Brien Political correctness God Emperor of Dune Blood on the Tracks Married... with Children Free will Gaia Online Internet slang Stewie Griffin About a Boy Ashlee Simpson Sex toy Wood carving Britney Spears Moral Politics Frankie Laine
