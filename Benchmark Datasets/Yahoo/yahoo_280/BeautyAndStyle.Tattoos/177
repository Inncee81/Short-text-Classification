is it possible to get a temporary semi permanent tattoo that will last no longer than years i want to get a tattoo down the back of my neck but don't want to stuck with the commitment of a permanent one on the other hand although the henna tattoos look great for about a week they start to wash out afterwards so it's not an option i saw a tattooist who told me there's no such thing as a semipermanent tattoo if i get one done by any of those who claim to be able to do it there's no guarantee of how long it'll last or if it'll even come off at all he also said they come out looking funny 'cos a different type of dye is used i don't know if this is all true but i want to know people's take is on semi permanent tattoos i really want to get one or a couple but like i said i don't want to go permanent for a number of reasons including the possibility that i may not want it in the future plus i hate it when i see older people with tattoos which probably looked great when they were younger and had firmer skin but looks nasty on sagging skin any answers i dont think i believe in semi permenent tattoos ink from a tattoo is injected into your second layer of skin it will stay forever ive never seen temp tattoos except for when i was a kid and got them out of the little cent machines i think anyone claiming that they would have a semi permenent tattoo would be lying you have three layers of skin medically you cant put a tattoo on the top layer of skin thats just painting it on your skin basically if it stays it will start to fade out and peel off basically due to the fact that your top layer regenerates itself and sheds a temp tattoo is basically not real unless youre getting it from a store placing it on your skin holding a damp towel over it for seconds and pulling back the paper slowly i personally think that if you cant handle the comitment of getting one and you want one that will wash off then you shouldnt get one at all but if you seriously cant handle staying with one for the rest of your life but is still dying to get one then here read this http www technologyreview com nanotech even though the headline says semi permanent now scientists at harvard medical school brown university and duke university have engineered safe permanent and easily removable tattoo inks made from tiny microcapsules of natural pigments its permanent just has an easier removal process than the usual laser but still theres this he hopes to bring the first generation of microencapsulated inks to market in the next year youd have to wait awhile and im betting that most artists arent going to be so big on the ink at first so it will take a lot to find a shop that will do that and im guessing it will also cost more and that laser treatment still probably costs thousands like the rest of them Scarification Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Skin Casting Social rule Henna Sento Manicure Textile manufacturing Floppy disk M16 (rifle) Ben Johnson (athlete) Scar Theory of conduct Menstrual cup Dairy Upholstery Poker jargon Craps Life insurance Prostate cancer Body painting Diving suit Drawing Avril Lavigne Laserdisc Printed circuit board IPod Earring Baldness treatments Memento (film) CPU cache CPU design Hair coloring Unreal Mach kernel Software engineering Customs and etiquette of Japan Heinkel He 112 Massage Tag Body modification Jackass: The Movie Fecal incontinence Make money fast The Death Gate Cycle Hip hop collaborations Nuclear power Wound Electrophysiology Tattoo gun Solar cell GunBound Nanotechnology Photography Aerial (dance move) Naruto jutsu Paint Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Stomach cancer Alcoholics Anonymous Muslim ibn Aqeel Irezumi EastEnders Micro-encapsulation Side Characters (Xenosaga) Insurance Knife Gaia Online Hip hop rivalries Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Keloid Ethernet Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hand grenade The Amber Spyglass Billboard Hot 100 Expert system Flood geology Compact disc Inkjet printer Enterprise content management Spice Girls Vegeta World War Three (Doctor Who) Embedded system Wheel of Fortune Theodicy Blood Simple
