anyone who has a foot tattoo and a lower back tattoo i generally have a very low pain tolerance but i have one on my lower back and it barely hurt at all so i was wondering what is the pain comparison for the two i have both a lower back and foot tattoo by far the lower back hurt the least the pain with a foot tattoo in my opinion is very different that the lower back with my foot the pain was more of a sore type pain where it hurt to put pressure on it for around days after getting it done either way if you really want a tattoo on your foot i would say go for it just know that for about days you will probably limp a bit but its all worth it in the end Chester Bennington Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Breastfeeding Massage Tattoo Mattress Weight training Cape Feare COX-2 inhibitor Decompression sickness Jackass: The Movie Hip fracture Horse tack Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Memento (film) Doom enemies Rayden Motorcycle High-heeled shoe Wal-Mart Back pain Dallas, Texas Diving Chronic pain Embedded system Psoriasis Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Carpal tunnel syndrome Spanking Pain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sideshow Bob Aerial (dance move) Gout First aid Quebec general election, 2003 Domestic rabbit Pitcher Self-harm Broadband Internet access Earring Dialysis Tide Local anesthesia Smallville (Season 4) Professional wrestling attacks Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Acupuncture Drill bit Sound Scarification LSD Herpes simplex virus Hepatitis C Limp Bizkit Pazyryk Nuclear power phase-out Archery Body modification Customs and etiquette of Japan Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 Ra (board game) Skateboarding trick The Shining (film) Internal ballistics Hurt (song) Chronic fatigue syndrome Stress fracture Sense Vegetarianism Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cricket Montgomery Burns Hiking Prostate cancer Paintball Nine Inch Nails Inflation Namie Amuro Analgesic Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Milton H.
