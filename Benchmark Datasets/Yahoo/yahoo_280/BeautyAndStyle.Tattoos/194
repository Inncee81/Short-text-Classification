what do you think of tatoos i always wanted a tatoo but my family is so anti tatoos i am older now and married and my husband wants a tatoo and thinks i should get one to i have not had children yet and one of my main concerns is that when i get pregnant your body stretches do you think that if your skin stretches it will ruin the tatoo as far as stretching it depends where you put it and remember if you're having kids soon if you have a visible tattoo you won't be able to tell your kids they can't have one without them throwing it in your face i've seen women with tattoos on the back of their neck under their hair when it's down the small of their back shoulder blades those spots won't stretch from giving birth or being pregnant especially if you're family is against tattoos you may want to choose a spot that only your husband can see that'll be a sexy secret for you two just remember to think long and hard about what you get tattooed on your body it really is permanant Tattoo Professional wrestling holds Amy Dumas Angelina Jolie Irezumi Humphrey Bogart Acne Body modification Aerial (dance move) Timucua EastEnders Comanche Pregnancy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ouroboros Chris Benoit Professional wrestling throws Suplex Rayden Avril Lavigne Leopard Naruto jutsu Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Shawn Michaels Meryl Silverburgh Charmed Earring Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Ninja Scroll Friends Sexual attraction Ayyavazhi mythology Scarification Guinea pig Equine conformation Diving suit Rais massacre Professional wrestling slang Puberty Mystique (comics) Body painting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fecal incontinence Def Jam Fight for New York 613 mitzvot Depilation Pittsburgh Steelers Side Characters (Xenosaga) Samurai Deeper Kyo Sub-Zero Massage Professional wrestling aerial techniques Abortion debate Piccolo Junior Saga Kurt Angle Eddie Guerrero Mark Calaway Nocte Waterworld Sara Sidle Jackass: The Movie Swingout Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Hair Dana Scully Marilyn Monroe Married... with Children Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Katharine Hepburn Cheetah Human Car safety The Rock (entertainer) New York Giants Manhunt (video game) Neckbreaker Scapula Kodocha Panthera hybrid Kain (Legacy of Kain) Crazy Horse Body piercing John F.
