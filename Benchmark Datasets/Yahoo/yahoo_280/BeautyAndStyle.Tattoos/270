tattoo for commitment but what about my job hello well my boyfriend and i are getting married and we were thinking of getting small tattoos on our wrists that say each other's name ex on his it would be my name and a tiny heart of course we would still have a ring anyways but since we both love tattoos and have none so far we were thinking of getting a tattoo as for our job goes i am planning on going to school to become a doctor and i already am a emt paramedic and often work as a lifeguard too do you think that my work and jobs would have a problem and not hire me no rude answers please thanks sounds like a good idea most likely you wouldnt have a problem but i would recommend getting them somewhere where you can hide them when you need them or show them when you want base of the neck shoulder blades even on the top of your foot would work best of luck to you edited to say dont listen to everyone who says not to tattoo the name of your loved one on you only you know how strong your relationship is i have my husbands name on me and we've been married almost years so i say if thats what you want do it you can always get a cover up if you changed your mind or something did happen but like i said only you know how good your relationship is as far as it being bad luck hasnt been bad luck for me Angelina Jolie Tattoo Luck One Tree Hill (TV series) Bondage (BDSM) Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Halliwell Ashlee Simpson Amy Dumas Dial M for Murder The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Shining (film) Glen Jacobs Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Strong Medicine Fable (video game) Extreme Programming Jennifer Lopez Social rule EastEnders Avenue Q Great Teacher Onizuka Badly Drawn Kitties Care Bears Professional wrestling holds Adam Copeland Bad Wolf Equine conformation Memento (film) Rayden Harp Numerology Emergency Medical Services Sex and the City Charmed Ariel (Firefly episode) Theory of conduct Oz (TV series) Hey Jude World Championship Wrestling Freddie Mercury 21st Century Fox Avril Lavigne About a Boy Knots Landing Ultimate X-Men Time Out of Mind The O.C.
