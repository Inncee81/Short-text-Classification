tattoo peeling okay so my tattoo is in it's peeling phase and i noticed that the skin under looks smeared my tattoo is a hibuscus flower and it's mostly just outline with shading defing the flower the coloring is mostly black but my skin under the peeled spot looks like a smeared grey it's weird it's my first tattoo i'm freaking out is this normal yes that's normal the top layer of flexible epidermis has been shed off due to damage the tattooing process much how like the skin sheds after getting a sunburn what's below is skin that would eventually be the top layer but it's been pressed into service a tad early this generally happens anywhere from to days after getting a new tattoo and marks the dullest period for a new tattoo as the skin settles in the tattoo will slowly brighten and the normal skin appearance will come back anywhere from to months after you got the tattoo the skin should look pretty normal i've had this happen with pretty much all of my work and it's all worked out fine in the end Tattoo Skin Leaf Irezumi Psoriasis Hair Sunburn Sunlight Skin cancer Color Ultraviolet Menstrual cycle Ozone depletion Human skin color British Rail Class 86 Avril Lavigne Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Leopard Ozone layer Essential oil Human papillomavirus The Legend of Zelda series enemies Drawing Malignant melanoma Tofu Ozone hole Moisturizer Pottery Puberty Opportunity rover Casting Wolverine (comics) Orchidaceae Tattoo You Rosacea Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Scar Wound healing phases Hair color Keloid Moult Tag Sunscreen Color blindness Tuatara Mango Cheetah Sento Jaundice Cleveland Torso Murderer Stoma Keratin Cancer Sun Manicure Melanin Memento (film) Mammal Earring Aloe The Avengers (TV series) Pulp (band) Game Boy Perfume Snake Polychrotidae Traffic light Unreal Black-and-white Body modification The Velvet Underground Cat coat genetics Radiation therapy Cloud Transformer Bizarro Ammolite Thermoregulation Geology of the Grand Canyon area Iris (anatomy) Dave Grohl Phase (matter) Glacier Skinny Puppy Bruce Dickinson Corrosion Harlequin type ichthyosis Fancy rat Flower Gramophone record T-800 Chester Bennington John Peel Potato Tattoo gun Burn (injury) Alien races from the Godzilla films Apple
