i need some ideas for a tattoo design if you're going to say don't get a tattoo don't answer this question because i already have one i'm wanting to get one for my grandpa who passed away in i saw one design that was a heart shaped apple with wings and you could put a banner across it i can't seem to find that design i was wanting an apple like design because his last name was appel any ideas would be great when i got my favourite tattoo i shopped around at lots of tattoo artists because i wanted something special and original don't forget that people that get into doing tattoos are artists they don't just transfer little pre made designs onto your skin a good tattoo artist will want to design you a great tattoo and will feel that it is important to get it right you can just describe what you want and usually in a few days they will have a few designs for you to pick from if they can't be bothered don't let them draw something indelible on your skin my favourite tattoo was inspired from a drawing in a tattoo artist's shop the tattooist had a habit of buying sketch books from local artists to get a range of different ideas and we just modified a design from one of those good luck Tattoo Don Rosa The Adventures of Pete & Pete Irezumi Social rule Customs and etiquette of Japan Vanilla Ninja The Emancipation of Mimi Avril Lavigne Singlish Memento (film) Body modification Philosophy of language Supply and demand Clothing One Piece minor characters Current teachings of Prem Rawat Surveillance Discordianism Hiberno-English Kurt Cobain Amulet The Ashlee Simpson Show Little Britain Scarification Picts Kender Ontological argument Theory of conduct Extreme Programming IBM PC compatible Art Michelle Branch Leonardo da Vinci Alice's Adventures in Wonderland United Artists Economics Milton H.
