do you know any good drinking social games i will be having a group of people for a party who hardly now each other as a host i would like to suggest a few good games to brake the ice i know a good drinking game i dont know what its called but you can make up your own name you take it in turn to say something you have never done so for example you start by saying ' i have never kissed a girl' this is just an example then everyone else in the group the has kissed a girl then has to take a drink the next person will then go on to say ' i have never and they should reveal somthing that the have never done then every who has done that particular thing should take a drink no one is allowed to drink at any other time its a good way to get to know each other also alot of fun particularly if you are saying somthing rude or you can play tactfully by saying something that you know someone else has done just so they have to admit it in front of the group take a drink and get drunk quicker haha have fun President (game) Alcoholics Anonymous Garfield Social rule Friends Whose Line Is It Anyway?
