okay i got a problem in pokemon diamond i defeat the elite four and now i want the national pokedex but i need to see or have riolu i know he she from iron island but the problem is when i went to iron island there was no egg i wasnt playin this pokemon game in the begining i started playing when im in the victory road my sister was playin this game before me but she dont know if she saw or had riolu egg so what do i do now serious answers please thanks when you go to iron island you have to help a boy called riley or something once you help him get to the end of the cave room etc he thanks you with an egg which is riolu but he doesn't give you the egg if you have a full pokemon party so to see if he is still there with the egg you have to leave a space in your party and go back to iron island or trade a riolu with a friend if they have one on pearl or diamond hope this helps Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon Emerald Missingno.
