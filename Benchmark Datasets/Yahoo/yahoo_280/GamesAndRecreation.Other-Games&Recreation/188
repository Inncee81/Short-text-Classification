does anyone know if there is such thing as a red gyrados if so how do i catch in pokemon diamond yes it's a particularly rare variety of gyarados while gyarados are normally blue in color there are some rare red scaled gyarados though no more powerful than their more common blue counterparts red gyarados are valued for their rarity and individuality this is caused in gold silver and crystal and the anime by a radio frequency transmitted by team rocket to force the magikarp to evolve the red coloration comes from the magikarp evolving prematurely and not undergoing the conversion from red to blue scale pigment thus they retain the same color they had as a magikarp but unfortunately i'm not sure how to catch one hope this helps Gyarados Team Rocket Magikarp Pok__mon (video games) Ditto (Pok__mon) Pok__mon Pok__mon Yellow Color Pok__mon Emerald Pok__mon Crystal Giovanni (Pok__mon) Celebi Pok__mon Trading Card Game Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pikachu Pok__mon Abilities Misty (Pok__mon) Diamond color Diamond Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen Pok__mon Red and Blue Pok__mon evolution Missingno.
