giratina is a powerful dragon ghost type that can be found deep in turnback cave a place that is said to overlap a different darker dimension anyway giratina can only be found and fought once in the game be sure to save also giratina can only be found after obtaining the national dex and beating the elite four be sure that is done turnback cave is found in a previously secluded place called sendback springs make sure you have rock climb and preferably defog because turnback cave is very foggy bring many dusk balls ultra balls or a master ball if you were saving it to get a very strong pokemon also if you don't want to fight lvl pokemon grab some repels fly to veilstone city if you aren't already there then travel down the fence maze area until you see a long empty path stretching out to the right go and travel that path until you come to a rocky wall by two trees standing together use rock climb and after the hm is done you'll be at a large clear lake very much like uxie azelf

entrance go inside congratulations you have now entered turnback cave now for the trickiest part there will be a rock wall ahead of you read the inscription there apparently no set ways to get to

take notice of these things giratina's moveset is heal block shadow force earth power slash giratina is level so have a strong pokemon in your roster after you catch it which will most likely be a grueling experience you can leave the cave not that you couldn't before if you want you can train on some powerful pokemon wild lvl range gets boosted by ten after each pillar is passed collect a rare item an infinite amount of items will appear in giratina's place after you either have caught it or fainted it rare bones stardust or you can take time to read this slightly ominous messsage engraves
