what to do about dungeons dragons inter player conflict a few friends and i just started learning to play d d and when choosing alignments three of us chose neutral chaotic neutral lawful neutral and the fourth chose lawful evil we anticipated some problems with teamwork during gameplay but decided to continue even though the handbook states that players aren't really meant to be evil things went pretty smoothly until we spoke with a friendly halfling that our dm created our lawful evil party member decided to intimidate the halfling with a severed half orc head that he'd been carrying around this was a dangerous idea for two reasons one of our other party members is a half orc and she also didn't want the halfling to be harmed in any way so all of a sudden the group was at odds with itself and the frustration definitely extended to real life i want everyone to be able to work together but i don't know how to suggest teamwork when there is this difference in alignments and gameplay styles what should i do first lawful evil characters would be like the corporate tycoon willing to be self serving and power hungry but still operates with rules a guy carring a head around might be a more chaotic act second player character can and should be of any alighnment if the newer book presuaded you that good was better then thats just marketing to get the zealots from picketing them third if a character knowly acts out his alignment there are consequences first as soon as the guy carried the head around the party should have disbanded and in the case of the lawful neutral guy turned him into the magistrate fourth its a game if the lawful evil guy gets killed to bad re roll a new guy and if your pc's cant die or be imprisoned then why play fifth i had a lawful good paladin and he liked his coin and was abit treasure hungry i picked up every iron drab welll at least until i picked up a curse item that forced a dramatic alignment change bummer for him he went insane and essentialy beacame an anti paladin Alignment (role-playing games) Dungeons & Dragons Computer role-playing game Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Final Fantasy XI Differences between editions of Dungeons & Dragons World of Warcraft Theory of conduct Sub-Zero Eberron Kender Double Dragon Warcraft III Diablo II The Order of the Stick EverQuest Zones of EverQuest Gary Gygax Resident Evil 4 EverQuest II Galactic Civilizations Resident Evil (video game) Super Mario Bros. 2 Drizzt Do'Urden Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Greyhawk Halfling Poker jargon Quest for Glory Seiken Densetsu 3 RuneScape quests Boss (video games) MMORPG Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Age of Wonders Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Final Fantasy magic The Death Gate Cycle Ravenloft domains Gamemaster Curse of the Azure Bonds Humphrey Bogart MapleStory Zerg Super Mario 64 Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem Orc Races in the Warcraft universe Ragnarok Online Jade Empire Star Trek Customizable Card Game Final Fantasy Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura Dungeons & Dragons manuals Warcraft II Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Discworld MUD Pools of Darkness Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Utopia (online game) Chrono Trigger Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Charmed Lineage II Evil Ultima Online Final Fantasy IV Elemental spirits (Seiken Densetsu) IBM PC compatible Betting (poker) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Legend of Mana Neopets Fiend (Dungeons & Dragons) Trade union Red Hot Chili Peppers Theodicy Computer and video game genres Yu-Gi-Oh!
