how to catch uxie and azelf in pokemon diamond i used alot of pokeballs great balls ultre balls and i still cant catch them as with catching any pokemon in the games unless you use a masterball each pokemon catching is based on luck the higher the catch rate the easier the pokemon to catch most of the time the more common the pokemon the more easier it is to catch it take caterpies as an example caterpies are one of the most common pokemon in the frlg games unless its a version exclusive therefore it has a catch rate of the highest catch rate ever meaning that a single ball toss is likely to catch it regardless unless it wasn't weakened but then its still very likely the lowest catch rates though are normally legendary pokemon most having a catch rate of uxie mesprit and azelf have a catch rate of dialga in comparison has a catch rate of and shaymin a catch rate of as we all know status ailments particularly sleep and freeze aid in catching the pokemon as is weakening it close to hp and using balls with different effects the formulae for calculating the catch rate is very complex so i won't explain it but the best methods of catching them are use a sneasel crawdaunt or a drapion to false swipe them use a yanma to use hynosis with compundeyes as an ability get your highest level pokemon out and continually throw dusk balls at them i don't suggest using weavile or absol because of the probability that they will have pressure as an ability absol's okay as long as it has super luck instead of pressure with pressure they might use struggle if left out too long and you do not want it to use struggle when you just successfully false swiped it i suggest dark types because of their immunity against psychic types so they stay out for longer especially against uxie yanma is the only user of hypnosis that also sports compoundeyes as an ability so an accuracy of becomes out of a possible of accuracy for hypnosis which is actually more likely to hit than dark void base accuracy if you even have darkrai you can try out dark void but be wary of yuxie mesprit azelf's health which drops every turn because of bad dreams as for the balls you are using use dusk balls they have the highest catch rate of all balls excluding masterball but only if its night time or its in a dark area like a cave they have a x catch rate in comparison pokeballs have a x greatballs x and ultraballs x toxinxii Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pok__mon types Pok__mon Colosseum Pok__mon (video games) Pok__mon Trading Card Game Fast bowling Baseball Stars Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Pump It Up Pok__mon ELO rating system Volleyball Tag American football Mewtwo Poker jargon Pok__mon (anime) GunBound Cincinnati Bengals Snooker Final Fantasy magic Softball Scyther Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Blood (computer game) RuneScape weapons Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Pok__mon Emerald Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Canadian football Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bayesian inference Pok__mon FireRed and LeafGreen English cricket team Items in the Metroid series Wild ARMs 2 Hypnosis Paintball Tennis Boss (video games) Celebi Cricket New York Giants Final Fantasy XI Shedinja Cheating in Counter-Strike Psychokinesis Groudon Ravi Shastri Ragnarok Online Team Fortress Classic Super Bowl XI Sandy Koufax Four square Diablo II Urinary incontinence Gameplay of StarCraft Baseball statistics Rugby union Missingno.
