should i start playing wow i really enjoy the atmosphere of the game but i hate the time you need to put into it i have a level character and with the new exp coming out i want to get to the fun parts at the end i am in my junior year poly sci major with credits i have an active lifestyle also being in a fraternity and a job that starts at am but only takes like total hours out of my week is it going to kill my life you think or are there ways to compromise that i have not thought of yet wow unlike what most people say can be a very casual game putting or hours every few days into the game can make the experience very fun and if you have a group with you you can do most instances and dungeons in a small amount of time it won't kill your life to play a couple of hours here and there just take the game in moderation World of Warcraft MMORPG Pure Pwnage The Sims MapleStory Mafia (game) Alignment (role-playing games) Final Fantasy magic Blackjack Chrono Trigger Gamemaster Ragnarok Online National Football League Playoff Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Pittsburgh Steelers Polyamory ELO rating system Mount Pinatubo International League Newgrounds Babe Ruth Tales of Symphonia Kurt Cobain Betting (poker) Dead Like Me Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Soap opera Wheel of Fortune The Wizard of Id Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Final Fantasy XI EverQuest 1957 World Series Green Day Craps Blood (computer game) Pyramid (game show) Castle of the Winds Final Fantasy VI Lineage II $ale of the Century President (game) Video game controversy Norway national football team Social rule Bondage (BDSM) Infantilism Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
