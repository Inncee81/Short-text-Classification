what items do i need to hack my pokemon pearl game i am pretty sure i dont have any thing required for it so i need a list of the items i need please help if you want to do minor hacking making pokemon appear when they should not getting unlimited master balls getting all tm's all pokemon shiny and such you only need a cheat device like action replay or xploder if you want to do serious hacking as in changing the layout of the game making different pokemon appear wherever you want adding new or different pokemon basically rewriting the code you will need to put the game onto a pc then get a hex editor and basically go through the code changing what you want and saving a lot of times in different places so you can go back and try again if you seriously mess up something you were trying to do i seriously suggest you avoid the second option if you do not know what is required or the items you need then you are really not likely to be able to read the coding or do much else to it just buy yourself a cheat device and have fun ROM hacking Pok__mon (video games) Missingno.
