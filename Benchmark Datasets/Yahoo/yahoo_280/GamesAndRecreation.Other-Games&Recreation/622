better stats for pokemon i have an elekid but when its with my other pokemon its stats are way lower how do i raise its stats elekid has quite low base stats when compared to other pokemon particularly those that have already evolved the best way to do it would be to evolve it into an electrobuzz and then electovire or whatever it's called giving it vitamins drugs will only take it's stats up a little because they raise hidden stats which influence the main stats Pok__mon Abilities Elekid Pok__mon types Pok__mon evolution Pok__mon Gold and Silver Pok__mon Trading Card Game Smoochum Raichu Missingno.
