in dungeons and dragons how do you prepare spells how do you player's handbook says for an example that wizards must rest for hours does that mean that you as a player actually have to sleep for eight hours i know that that's not right but it also seems pretty lame for you or the dm to just be able to say and your character goes to sleep then wakes up eight hours later fully ready to prepare spells plus if it was like that then there would be no point in mentioning the benefit that sorcerers and bards don't have to prepare spells because all you'd have to do to prepare spells would be to say that your character rested for hours and then took an hour to prepare them out in a cornfield and now you and your group are ready to to go battle it's pretty obvious that i just started playing d d but this question is really burning me please help me it's that the character not you has to rest yeah you can pretty much say that you rest for eight hours but the downside to this is that not all situations will let your wizard just take a nice nap like in the middle of combat or a dungeon crawling with dreaded kobolds Dungeons & Dragons Differences between editions of Dungeons & Dragons Spells of Dungeons & Dragons Computer role-playing game EverQuest Wizard Yu-Gi-Oh!
