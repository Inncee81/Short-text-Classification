where or how can i find a shiny pokemon in sapphire if you dont have action replay or those other hacking devices i dont have any then they appear at random in my entire life i can never recal ever seeing a wild shiny pokemon other than the red gyarados from the older games they appear once ever times or some other huge number like that if you just walk around in a patch of grass for about a year chances are you might see a shiny and that is why they are so rare and special oh and if you do see one it will have a littel ring of stars around it so dont freak if you think you ran from one they are quite noticable Gyarados Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Pok__mon Abilities Missingno.
