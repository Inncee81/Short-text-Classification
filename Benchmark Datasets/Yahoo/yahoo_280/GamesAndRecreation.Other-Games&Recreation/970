any suggestions for games our youth group can play like for example we'd see who could go without saying a word with the letter s in it every week at youth group we play a game does anyone have any suggestions of fun games we could play they can be as crazy as you can think of like one of the games we are going to play is where you have to have groups and each group gets into a car and has a list of diferent resturaunts and each group has to go to those resturaunts and get a signature by the resturaunt it will have the manager or someone who works there at the resturaunt and we'll have to get the manager to sign or it could be anyone who works there just any crazy game like that would be good please give us suggestions we're runny out of games thanks im just gonna tell u some of the games that i used to play at my youth group where everyone sits on seats in a circle except one who stands in the middle that one person says 'i have never ' for example dyed my hair and then everyone who has dyed thier hair swaps places whilst the one in the middle trys to steal their seat again everyone in a circle with one in the middle but there is an extra seat everyone keeps moving around to sit on the empty seat whilst the person in the middle runs about trying to get onto that seat again everyone in a cirle but this time there is a caller and they say things like everyone who had breakfast mover to seats to the left and if there is someone on that seat they have to sit on their knee it can get interesting when there is like or more people on one seat you would be suprised how much the youth still love games like duck duck goose or british bulldogs pm me if you dont know what these are empires everyone writes down a persona on a peice of paper for example britney spears fred flinstone the pink panther something like that and these are not shown to anyone and folded up and put in a hat one person the leader reads out all the names once at the start of the game and one person starts and guesses who a person is the person who was guessed then gets a chance to ask who someone else is if they were wrong you have to be honest or the game doesnt work if your guess is correct that person becomes part of your empire and the work as a team to guess the rest of the people the aim of the game is to get everyone in your empire wink murder is a good one if these are not enough i have a million more in my head message me if you can i think i must change that option on my profile lol but yes goodluck in ur youth group hunt the dressed up leader is always a good one no set rules like the restaurant one but more interesting as the leaders can be characters Wheel of Fortune Tag Professional wrestling throws Whose Line Is It Anyway?
