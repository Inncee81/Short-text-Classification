is it normal for teens to go through an activist phase i swear i am i get all worked up about something but do little except research and preach to my friends would that even be considered activism activism is when you feel so strongly about a cause that you go out of your way to take part in changing what you feel is wrong with the world talking to people is activism because you are trying to teach what you have learned and plant that seed within others and i think it's normal for you as a teen to start to see that the way things are done isn't always the way things should be done and feel that you want to change it up until now you've learned to trust those around you and now you can see that there is wrong in the world and you want to right it Theory of conduct Milton H.
