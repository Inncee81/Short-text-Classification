okay do i ask do i not here's this gal that i like and have told her how i felt last year but she said she just wanna be friends however now i feel that some things have changed recently she showed more interests and especially today there were more conversations between us and often she asked me about things she seemed more interested she also teased me more but there's this guy who likes her too this guy's friend started it first by asking her and her friends to play bowling next week on the government election day i think he s been planning it so far should i be worried if they agree does it mean that she likes that guy this is the first time though and in my case i've hanged out with her together in groups a couple of times we're involved in more activities though when he asked her about that she seemed rather clueless she did not seem to really look for him though they re in different class what should i do it shattered my heart into pieces i'm planning to ask her friend about it not about asking her out about asking what that guy told em should i do it how to begin hmm if you focus on the other boy that likes this girl more than the girl you don't really have too much of a chance forget the boy focus on the girl i know it seems a scary thought to talk to her about your crush but at this point what do you have to lose simply call her up meet her or text her and bring it up do you think that the two of us could ever be more than friends this way if she says no you can move on if she says yes you're on your way good luck Friends Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show About a Boy Cliff Richard Avenue Q Jon Secada Good Morning, Vietnam Phoebe Buffay's songs Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Extreme Programming Teen Girl Squad Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Viterbi algorithm Little Britain The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan The Chemical Brothers Full Metal Panic?
