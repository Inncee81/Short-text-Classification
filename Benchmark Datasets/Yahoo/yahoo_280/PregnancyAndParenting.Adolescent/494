when i try to make people happy i want to help other people and do nice stuff for them but i always end up getting hurt or feel unappreciated my friend asked me i would make him a cd and download like songs for him i did it and brought my laptop to school i didn't even get a thank you i spent hours yesterday doing health homework for the rest of my class and today i found out that i did the wrong part lack of communication and the rest of the class just yelled at me and the hours i spent was wasted i tried to do some nice things for my bf as well and he didn't even say thank you i can't help but help other people and do nice things i've tried to stop but i can't i said something about not feeling appreciated to my bf and now he wont talk to me and he's gone off in a sh tty what do i do i feel like i can't win gussie i live in new zealand we start school in jan and finish in november i am at school currently i go to university in feb next year i don't tell people my friends about my past they know nothing and i want it to stay that way first and foremost you cannot make everyone happy no matter what you do dear you should understand that you are not unique to be in this dilemma millions of people are i was exactly like you at young age but now i have become wiser though sometime even now i fall into this trap of helping others basically persons are good natured and they remain so for a long time but the systems circumstances make a few of them just the opposite however people are also selfish the selfishness comes basically from inertia not willing to do things unless forced but grooming also plays a large part in it if most people don't even say 'thanks' it is more likely that they are lazy in saying so the irony that people like you and me face is that most of the time we are taken for granted the reason for this lies in the fact that the thing which is available free or cheap does not carry any value why diamond and gold are costlier than other things because you and also me are easily available to others for the help they do not value our help and take us for granted by readily agreeing to help others we set up a standard for us and any time we fall short of that standard we are frowned upon the reactions of your class in health homework case and your b f are the results of this both of them didn't expect you to act the way you did and now both are angry with you i know it is not easy to change your helping nature and i am not advocating for it but i suggest is to change the perspective also use a little discretion continue helping others not because you can't help it but because it is the right thing to do you are a fine person who has compassion for others just stop expecting anything from others even a 'thank you' if any cost is involved tell them in advance that they would have to bear the cost if you can gather some courage then put a little cost on your efforts time also you will see most of them would back off use a bit of discretion while helping others first find out whether they can do it without your help or not help only when they can't do it any other way you can site shortage of time as the excuse for denying them your help if you must help go ahead and do it and then forget about it in any case stop considering your position as a 'no win' situation a good samaritan is never a loser losers are those who are ungrateful hopefully it will put some smile back on your face Theory of conduct Prisoner's dilemma Poker jargon Social rule Objectivist philosophy Microeconomics Avenue Q Altruism Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Rich Mullins Dog training The Amber Spyglass Singlish Kodocha Economic inequality Bernard Williams Vegeta Goodness and value theory Sydney Riot of 1879 Daylight saving time Current teachings of Prem Rawat Supply and demand Scientology beliefs and practices Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ben Johnson (athlete) Fathers' rights Education in the People's Republic of China The Apprentice 2 Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Extreme Programming Strategic management Evil Sant Thakar Singh Socrates Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cliff Richard Jon Secada Transactional analysis Inflation Pitaten Milton H.
