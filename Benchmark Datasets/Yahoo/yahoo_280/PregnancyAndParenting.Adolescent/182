who would you give everything up for just to be with them i would give everything i had just to be with my bf what about you thanx absolutely not my parents matter to me more than anyone can imagine for that reason i refused to be in a relationship with anyone who didn't respect them and whom my parents didn't respect well i set that standard when i was years old after marrying the wrong person but here's the point the right person won't require you to give up everything if you love your parents and they're good people then you shouldn't have to give up everything to be with them the right person should add to not subtract from it admittedly my parents wouldn't condemn someone in my life on the grounds of racism religious intolerance or other issues that would make me consider my loved one before them however if a person has good parents than a good boyfriend shouldn't require this sort of decision when you commit to someone this deeply you find yourself committed to their family imagine that you would demand your boyfriend cut ties from his family for some reason regardless they would be an issue for the rest of your lives together signing up for that makes very little sense instead work on resolving the issues by keeping what you love together if you can't what you love may not be what it seems Theodicy Theory of conduct Polyamory Appeal Plame affair Summa Theologiae Fathers' rights Justification (theology) Ethics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Love One Tree Hill (TV series) Capital punishment Abortion debate Infant baptism Transsexuality Sex and the City Marriage Homosexuality and Christianity Evil Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Excommunication Ten Commandments Consensus decision-making Deconstruction Abortion in the United States Friends Same-sex marriage Avenue Q Knots Landing Royal Assent Freedom of speech Who is a Jew?
