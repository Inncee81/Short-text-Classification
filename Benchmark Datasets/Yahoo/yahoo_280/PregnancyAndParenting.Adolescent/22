my niece won't leave me alone i really really love her but i am tired ok she keeps telling me that she wants me to read her a story but i don't want to read it because i have a headache and i am tired how do i get her to understand and before you say it it's not that i don't like her i just want her to let me relax if i don't read the story she will go tell on me and then i will get in more trouble help tell her that you really want to read to her but you are so tired you are worried you won't do a good job ask if you can read to her at a certain time later in the day and write down what the clock will look like if she can't tell time yet tell her that you need to rest alone until that time so you are sure you will feel up to it but make sure to keep your promise even if you don't feel better Social rule The Catcher in the Rye Knots Landing The Austere Academy Anne Rice I Want to Hold Your Hand Humphrey Bogart Scenes from a Memory Singlish Paul Is Dead The Amazing Race Transactional analysis Jon Secada StarCraft Episode VI Vladimir Peter Tytla 1957 World Series Avenue Q The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Neil Gaiman Ben Johnson (athlete) The Contender (television series) Kodocha Cluster headache Scrooge McDuck Oasis (band) Novel Cigarette Smoking Man Saga (band) Sleep Hal Trosky Rosa Parks Ravi Shastri Sydney Riot of 1879 Night (book) Love and Theft The Apprentice 2 Maurine Dallas Watkins Apollo 8 Time Reflexology Famous last words History of the Beatles The Times They Are A-Changin' Baseball Don Rosa Fancy Crane Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Paige Matthews Don Quixote Socrates Parade (military) Time Crisis 3 Pok__mon Live!
