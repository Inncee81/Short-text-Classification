ok lot of people joke about being pregnant but what about those who do and are just looking for answers cause when we look y a answers for answers and all we get is comments on oh this age or that age is too young to be doing this or this its the fact that we are teens and yes i myself messed up i made a mistake i had a baby at who now i am the sole person that cares for him and people say you cant give a child a good future if you are this young yes you can all you have to do it try and talk to your parents when you find out oh yeah i am so fat let me tell ya sorry i aint on welfare never have been never will i work i live at my parents house i pay them to watch him and i pay rent i am trying to make it to where teen mothers can say hey look someone did it why cant i and yes i am online you can just im me when you want ok just because i use the word aint i get made fun of so great i have been called much worse by a lot more people k and second i never said it was something to celebrate its just that crap does happen ok and second at least i am trying to better myself and my sons its like people feel the need to say oh look their is a teen mother or father they must be on welfare or whatever then don't stop to think that just cause it happened does not mean that some of us are not going to take responsibility for our actions in our current western culture becoming a parent while a teenager is hardly recommendable and this is because our society has no real system in place by which a teenager can support himself or herself much less a child a teenager in the usa normally cannot find living wage employment nor can a teenager in most states get married if he or she is younger than aside from those two very daunting facts most of our families are ill equipped to handle a teenager bringing another child into the home typical american family finances are usually tight and both parents are most likely working then of course there's our victorian attitude that children are to be children and thus cannot be expected to be responsible for anything which is adult this victorian attitude incredibly effects our society because adults and parents take a half hearted approach in educating and mentoring our teenagers in america we have a tendency to grant a gross moratorium to adolescence sometimes to the age of we do a disservice to our teens and ourselves when we don't provide our adolescents the knowledge and skills to mature and also when we choose to avoid the sometimes uncomfortable tasks of teaching our boys and girls important moral lessons about love respect of self and others courtship relating to the opposite sex choosing a mate sexuality commitment to self and others how to be an adult how to work how to be married and care for a family etc yet the hard cold truth is this yes a teenage parent can handle the tasks of properly raising a child but not by himself or herself the teenager is going to require the support and dedication of his parents and others in his or her family as long as there is a supportive family a teenager can begin on the path of properly providing for his or her child working towards a day when he or she can become independent through personal financial means or marriage i truly recommend marriage over single parenthood as it is good for a child to grow up in a home which has both a loving mother and father i hope i've been able to help or at least given you a thought provoking answer i am glad to hear you have taken such a proactive attitude in caring for and learning to care for your child i am sure it has been difficult i am also happy to hear you have a family which supports you even if it's just moral support your life did not end because you had a child so young nor should you think your life has been permanently knocked off its rails you are perfectly capable of raising your child working and even earning a high school diploma and a college degree let no one say you can't better yet
