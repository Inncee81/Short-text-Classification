do you think this is good do you think that having two faces is good in my case like at school i'm serious hard working intelligent determined and i do work at break times and read my dictionary when i'm bored and then at home and with friends i'm loud crazy funny and outgoing should i be both or just one coz some people are like to me after i said i'm getting an ipod why would you want an ipod you're a worker girl what type of music would you put on it mozart or something that's okay most people are like that no one is the same at school as they are at home like for example an unshy talkative person at school who interrupts the teacher for every little thing at home they would most likely be polite to their parents and not so show offy that's the same for shy people but it's good that you're so determined with your marks those loud people who don't try might appear as thought they have a great life confident and outgoing but think of they're future they're screwing up their marks for their future careers you'll be rich with a successful career and they'll be stuck with a minimum wage job Humphrey Bogart Social rule The Catcher in the Rye Friends Kodocha Labour economics IPod Hearing impairment Joseph Haydn Trade union Economic inequality One Tree Hill (TV series) Good Times Garfield Pitaten Teen Girl Squad Squidward Tentacles Jennifer Lopez EastEnders Freeters Avenue Q Undergrads Shaggy dog story Steve Jobs The Giver Baseball Charmed Apple Computer Our Gang ITunes Music Store Trailer Park Boys John Cage Milton H.
