oops i dropped my hamster it looks fine what will happen next ok on the first day i got my hamster it crawled out of my hands and i dropped it well it was about feet then i put it in its cage and now it looks fine i mean its walking eating drinking and running in its wheel so what will happen oh another thing is is that i dont know it fluffy knows where his water bottle is how do i teach him without picking him up help if it is fine looking that means he is ok but make sure you don't drop it too often it could actually die don't worry about teaching it to drink from the bottle because it is their instinct that would tell them where to drink from if you are still worried give him a sand box to roll in and if you find that the sand is wet the next day that means your hamster has been drinking but don't forget to clean its cage at least once a week and change the sand in the sand box once it is wet Hamster Social rule Casting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Opportunity rover Hazing RuneScape quests The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Shaggy dog story Blonde on Blonde Water Indianapolis 500 Textile manufacturing Breastfeeding Spanish verbs Brush Yoko Ono Domestic rabbit Chinchilla Father's Day (Doctor Who) Pet skunk Ron Weasley Champagne (beverage) About a Boy Fiddler on the Roof Pottery Ron and Fez Customs and etiquette of Japan Hiberno-English Skateboarding trick Coconut crab Devil Fruit Humphrey Bogart Max Martin Professional wrestling match types RuneScape Random Events Mattress Water purification Diving Fire fighting Ayyavazhi religious practices Fancy rat Salad Fingers Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
