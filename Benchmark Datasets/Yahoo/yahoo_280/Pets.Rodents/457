are their any experts on russian dwarf hamsters and their babies i got to russian dwarf hamsters three days ago and one had babies days ago how can i tell if she is taking good care of them any good websites hi i would suggest you to remove the male hamster if you find him disturbing the babies dont worry about the babies just give them privacy cover the cage with a cloth for xtra privacy give her plenty of water and food and do not touch the babies til they about weeks the reason why mothers eat their babies is that they feelthat the babies will not live long so instead of prolonging their suffering they eat them and why i suggest not to touch the babies is that the mother can pick up new smells and may think the baby will not be healthy try not to change the hamster's bedding only till the babies are older good luck sabby Golden Hamster Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion debate Elephant Surveillance Jon Secada Guinea pig Comanche American Black Bear Melanie Wilkes Childbirth Domestic rabbit Social rule Internet phenomenon Insulin Pet skunk Kurt Cobain Hygiene Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Roy Meadow The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Urinary incontinence Rammstein Egg (food) Giant Panda The Family from One End Street Androgen insensitivity syndrome RuneScape quests Stomach cancer Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Customs and etiquette of Japan Abortion in the United States Hyperthermia Joke Platypus Hypoglycemia Characters in the Smurfs Common cold Animal testing RuneScape Mini-Games The Hobbit Shark Mattress Escherichia coli O157:H7 Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars Kakapo Le Malade imaginaire Menstrual cycle Breech birth AFI 100 Years series Jam (TV series) Cytomegalovirus Fecal incontinence Sin City Nile crocodile Dieting Health insurance Fancy rat Dog Discworld gods Tofu Dead Like Me Pig (zodiac) Fasting The Wack Pack Father's Day (Doctor Who) Domestic goat The Ashlee Simpson Show Sauna Tooth Khatushyamji Hemp Felis sapiens Garter snake Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Diarrhea Saint Nicholas Snowball Earth Migraine The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Caesarean section Apple Vegetarianism Situation comedy Macbeth Crohn's disease Mary Jane Kelly Great White Shark Sudden infant death syndrome Mario Two Treatises of Government Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Satanic ritual abuse
