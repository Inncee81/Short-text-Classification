my hamster had a fall last night i picked him up from his cage and he got a bit of a fright he is quite a jumpy hamster anyway he fell from my hand onto the top of the cage not a huge gap from my hand to the cage then fell onto the couch i let him sit on the couch for a minute to get his breath back then picked him up and put him in his ball he ran around like a crazy thing for ten minutes and when i picked him out he seemed ok i think he may be ok but what do i need to look out for all limbs seemed intact and his legs were fine not that i am a vet but nothing was floppy i was just wondering if he will be ok and may have escaped injury or could something pop up later on is there anything i need to keep an eye on cannot believe i dropped him feel so awful no silly answers please any advice would be appreciated he is a syrian albino hamster if this helps i've had tonnes of hamsters and mine have had a fall every now and again all of them seem fine a couple minutes later and act just as nothing had happened there is nothing to worry about your hamster will be just fine though of course if they start to walk funny or something which is unlikely by the sounds of things just make sure you take him to the vets good luck and best wishes to your hamster Hamster Shaggy dog story Equine conformation Social rule 1957 World Series Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Aerial (dance move) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Piccolo Junior Saga Socrate 2000 Australian Grand Prix Jon Secada Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Treehouse of Horror V Fast bowling I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Second Battle of the Atlantic Cleveland Browns Avenue Q The Contender (television series) Professional wrestling match types Babe Ruth Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 AFI 100 Years series Quarashi Kirby's Dream Land 2 2004 American League Championship Series Boxing Alanis Morissette The Curse of Fenric Norway national football team Salad Fingers Rod Stewart Futurama (TV series - season 5) Wood carving Good Morning, Vietnam Milton H.
