rats can gnaw their top teeth but can they gnaw their bottom reason is this i try and try to check my rats teeth but you know how hard it is to keep hold onto a protesting squiggle so i'm wondering i can see the top teeth are fine i have a chew toy in there for them but how can i know the bottom teeth aren't too long is there anything that can be done about it if they are what should i do my rats are clean and domesticated people need to show more respect i adress this question to fellow rat lovers or vets who know the ins and outs of rat health care rats are a part of our ecosystem if you can't love them respect their existence and please refrain from being rude to those of us who do rats top and bottom teeth slide naturally over each other as they eat gnaw this process naturally keeps their teeth i trim the only problems occur when malaclusion occurs and then either top or bottom can over grow the first sign of obvious malaclusion would be drooling and off the food malaclusion is a vet only job as the teeth need to be burred never nipped off as splitting will occur on a reguilar basis if your rats are eating well and maintaining gaining weight then i would imagine there is absolutely nothing to worry about instead of wooden chew toys try them with baked beef bones often available in butchers for dogs or cooked thigh wing of chicken with the meat still on chop bones with meat scraps attached large dog biscuits its the sign of a good owner that your worried though just a note rats teeth move slightly apart and within their jaws naturally so if you notice a slight wobble dont panic Hamster Tooth Domestic rabbit Equine conformation Dog Cat Taboo food and drink Guinea pig Tooth enamel Trapping Barbecue Hamburger Gray Wolf Pet skunk Garfield Kosher foods Livestock Ferret Olduwan Domesticated turkey Veganism Sugar substitute Cannibalism Raw food diet Snake Japanese cuisine Happy Tree Friends Hot dog Vegetarianism Woodworking Tyrannosaurus rex Dental caries Foodborne illness Strap-on dildo Chocolate Jewish cuisine Comanche Meat Tofu Rodent Cuisine of Denmark Homer Simpson Sin City Kangaroo Escherichia coli O157:H7 Blood (computer game) Chili con carne French cuisine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Maxilla Domestication Hun-Apu Japanese tea ceremony Tetrapod Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Soul food Dentures Chinese astrology Menstrual cup Unclean animals 613 mitzvot Dog training Cocaine Carnivore Philosophical skepticism Tasmanian Devil Aztec Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an German Shepherd Dog Fried chicken Vitamin C Sperm Whale Havanese McDonald's Mandible Kodocha Anorexia nervosa Korean cuisine Fugu Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Professional wrestling throws Insulin Aspartame French fries Tobacco Cuisine of Africa Oral sex Poker jargon Physical attractiveness Plastic Evidence of evolution
