my new rabbit whats wrong with her my boyfriend broke up with me so in revenge i took some of his money and bought myself my own bunny which i've been dying to do for years i bought her and recently realized that she has small bumps on her back i looked closely at them and they looked like dry skin or maybe that her hair just got tangles some people said mites but i'm not sure on what mites are do they go under the skin or do they stay on top also i noticed that my rabbit doesn't have much fur on her chin is this natural maybe from her chin being so close to her body or should i be worried please help also do vets charge if i would bring her in just to check for mites skin mites this causes the rabbit to possible appear to have red skin and have missing and thin fur with scabs to test for mites put a white towel over top of your rabbit s cage leave it there in overnight then in the morning pick it up if you see red or black little dots all over the towel your rabbit has mites if you still think that your rabbit has mites after reading this then go to your vet and ask what type of miticide you need to get for your rabbit you can also use oil to smother mites but make sure that you are applying it right just apply it to her skin and rub on if the mites are in your rabbits ears i suggest having someone with experience handle the job rabbit s ears are very sensitive and you don t want to hurt her or him make sure that you are brushing your rabbit you can buy a good brush for the job in the pet section at the grocery store brush your rabbit she sounds like her last home wasn t a good one so fix her up if you notice that she is losing a lot of hair she could be molting rabbits may molt more than two times a year another good thing for your rabbit would be to give it a bath hold the rabbit and wash it with mild soap and then dry well with a towel if it is cold in your area then dry with a hand hair dryer on medium heat also make sure that your rabbit isn t pregnant doe s will pull out their fur before they have babies next time you buy a rabbit make sure that it is health first if you think the heat may be causing her to loose her fur then put frozen water bottles in her cage during the heat of the day rabbits suffer from heat stroke very easily good luck and yes a vet will cost your for your visit Guinea pig Poker jargon Fancy rat Diseases of the honeybee Tattoo Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scabies EastEnders Dog Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Sento Skin Upholstery Chinchilla Pitaten Social rule Rabbit Thermoregulation Cat Hair Psoriasis Customs and etiquette of Japan 2000 Australian Grand Prix Violin Textile manufacturing Menstrual cup Ferret Characters in the Smurfs Sin City Breastfeeding Towel Acne Strap-on dildo Manicure Meriones unguiculatus Happy Tree Friends Professional wrestling match types Gaia Online Car washing techniques Kodocha Blood on the Tracks Friends Comanche Knife One Tree Hill (TV series) Canary Honeybee Rosacea Equine conformation Humphrey Bogart Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Japanese toilet Sauna Massage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Neighbours Tea Eczema Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Animal testing Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Trapping Fecal incontinence Brush Professional wrestling holds Dandruff One Piece minor characters Professional wrestling throws RuneScape quests Shawn Michaels Urinary incontinence Kevin and Kell Meat Loaf The Inside Phoebe Buffay's songs Days of our Lives Shaving Pottery Hypothermia Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Neopets Common cold W.I.T.C.H.
