how do i care for a wild baby bunny my german sheppard rescued this fury little thing and has come to believe it is hers i'm afraid that being taken care and handled by humans is wrong however i can't just let this baby go back out to the woods my son would be devasted and i don't believe that this bunny could make it on it's own any help would be greatly appreciated if the baby has it's eyes open and is moving on it's own it's best to set it free it's a known phenomenon that wild rabbits kept in captivity often fail to thrive for no apparent reason wildlife rehabbers often comment that the rabbits seem to pine for freedom grow listless then die the absolute kindest thing for a wild rabbit is to let it be wild if it's eyes are not open or it appears sick or injured search for your nearest wildlife rehab who can take it and they will care for it until it's ready to be released Dog Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Bugs Bunny The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Care Bears Pet skunk Gray Wolf Characters of Lost Guinea pig Cat Piney Woods Wood Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sluggy Freelance European Rabbit Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Mickey Mouse Falconry Theory of conduct Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Anthropomorphism Rabbits in Australia Rabbit Who Framed Roger Rabbit Fox hunting Comanche John Sheppard (Stargate) Myxomatosis Tiger FLCL Frankie Laine Ferret Poker jargon Mario Kevin and Kell Theodicy The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Religion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hamster Bunnie Rabbot Fictional crossover Extinction Feral cat Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Cindy Sheehan Shaggy dog story Elephant Anarcho-primitivism Livestock Miss Saigon Wile E.
