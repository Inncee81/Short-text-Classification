how can i get my rat more handle able they are pretty young right now but when ever i try to pick them up they always squirm out of my hand even before i can get them out of the cage what do i do try just placing your hand in their cage and letting them sniff you and get used to your smell also if the cage top is able to come off take it off and scoop up the rats with two hands it's easier then let them run around on a sofa bed etc and sit near them with a blanket thrown over you and the rats if you wish they tend to like dark places gradually they'll start to like you try giving them treats like cheerios too so they associate you with yummy food animal girl you clearly aren't an animal girl if you're so prejudiced against rats Hamster Fancy rat Guinea pig Sin City Rat Domestic rabbit Aerial (dance move) Dog training Cat Japanese tea ceremony Theory of conduct Trapping Ferret Professional wrestling throws Cheerios Upholstery The Visitation Joke RuneScape quests Anime Rat Park Fear Factor Salad Fingers Gambian pouch rat Professional wrestling match types Comanche Milton H.
