ferret cage for a rat i'm going to buy female rats and i want them to have the best cage possible there's a nicely priced one a petco and it looks like the rats would love it but it's a ferret cage the wires are properly spaced and it has levels what i'm worried about is this tunnel thing that the rat would have to climb through to get to the second level would a rat be able to use this it's not very tall so the rat won't have to really climb much but it sorta bends upwards at a near degree angle obviously a ferret could use it so could a rat it will be big enough i don't want anything that would hurt the rat's back or something it would refuse to use thus defeating the whole purpose of the level cage also it comes with one of those hammock things for ferrets will the rat use this mrs phas it is the second cage you posted do you have a link to look at and then i could say pretty much for sure is it this one http www petco com product super pet deluxe multi floor ferret home with stand aspx or this http www petco com product super pet multi floor ferret home aspx details i keep mine in this http www zooplus co uk shop rodents cages ferret cage which is a ferret cage but i have big squishy bucks the one worry i have from the description is the bar spacing for fully grown girls it really needs to be cm inch or less remember if the head can fit through the body will follow you could however slightly adapt it and cover the bars with chicken wireas well for kitten hood then removing it when full grown if they cant fit through your totally right by the way for girls height is an absolute necessity and both those cages are excellent for that the tunnel thing and the hammock are no prob the rats well done for a same sex pair by the way will love them and i would suggest fitting as many as you can especially as your getting girlies look here for ideas http www goosemoose com component option com smf itemid forum rat board hope that helps link please if its not either of those edit thanks for the update this is what i found the black epoxy coated wire is psaced apart sic and by the way its cheaper here but check the shipping http www dog com itemdy asp t srccode dnextag so its less than inch but having asked others and got a resounding thumbs up as a great cage espesh for rats the overall opinion is you may still need to chicken wire for kits just to be on safe side most kits upto about months depending on how well you feed them muchos protein for good sized ones can get through anything bigger than a critter martins cage mesh both are cage types i hate personally none of those cages can compare with this one though its fantastic and your girlies will adore it and you Ferret Fancy rat Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests Guinea pig Sin City Ford Thunderbird HyperText Transfer Protocol Cat Dog agility Solar cell Poker jargon Equine conformation Kim Possible Have I Got News For You Mattress RuneScape economy Uniform Resource Locator Mixed martial arts B-47 Stratojet Eddie Guerrero Shaggy dog story Stairway Aerial (dance move) Steel Cage Match Pet skunk Textile manufacturing Universal Serial Bus Science fiction on television Ford Mustang Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Dodge Charger Prostate cancer Diagon Alley Plastic Avenue Q Ajax (programming) Trapping Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma House Mouse Manual transmission Livestock XML Digital photography Internet fraud Violin Tire Milton H.
