this might be a stupid question but what is wet tail i have heard of hamsters actually dieing from it and i want to know what it is because i have russian dwarf hamsters and has babies here is everything that u need to know wet tail is a disease that is thought to be stress related and often affects young hamsters around the time of weaning as this can be a stressful time therefore it is important when buying a new hamster that its cage is prepared before its arrival home and it is left to become familiar with its new surroundings in peace apart from feeding for a day or two to keep stress to a minimum it is also thought that wet tail can be caused by bad living conditions etc which could also cause stress wet tail is a bacterial infection or an imbalance of the natural bacteria in the hamster's stomach or intestine and is often confused with diarrhoea although a hamster with wet tail has diarrhoea the diarrhoea is so severe that the hamster is wet and or dirty not only around the anus but usually around the top of the tail as well the diarrhoea is accompanied by a strong unpleasant smell droppings are pale in colour and extremely soft and may contain mucus the hamster often walks hunched up is weak and lethargic and may squeal in pain symptoms take days to appear and the disease is often fatal with death occurring as early as hours after the appearance of the symptoms therefore it is vital that veterinary treatment is sought immediately if a hamster shows symptoms of wet tail do not rely on over the counter products such as dri tail to treat wet tail as these are often not effective against severe cases of wet tail these should only be used if it is not possible to get the hamster to a vet immediately and veterinary advice should still be sought at the earliest opportunity but do ensure if you have used any over the counter product that you inform your vet when you visit hamsters suffering from wet tail often die from dehydration rather than from wet tail itself or they simply refuse to eat or drink also because of the severe diarrhoea wet tail can lead to rectal prolapse where the intestine is pushed outside the body through the anus veterinary treatment will consist of a course of antibiotics anti diarrhoeal medication and help with rehydration the hamster should be kept warm and quiet whilst undergoing treatment and be disturbed as little as possible wet tail is contagious to other hamsters and so any hamster suffering from wet tail should be isolated from other hamsters it is also a good idea to wash your hands thoroughly after handling a hamster suffering from wet tail to avoid passing the infection back to the hamster worsening its condition and certainly before handling other hamsters this is best kept to a minimum it is a good idea to remove droppings from the cage at intervals and disinfect the cage with a disinfectant designed for small animal cages when cleaning the cage although it is important to keep stress to a minimum it may help to clean the cage of a hamster suffering from wet tail every or days any equipment occupied or used by a hamster that has died from wet tail should be disinfected thoroughly with a disinfectant designed for small animal cages and left to stand for a few weeks before being used by another hamster wet tail is a disease associated more commonly with the syrian hamster and is not associated with dwarf hamsters dwarf hamsters can suffer severe diarrhoea but it is not clear at present that they actually suffer from 'wet tail' susceptibility to wet tail is also thought to be genetically inherited and so it is best not to breed from any hamster that has suffered from wet tail during its life Psoriasis Ulcerative colitis First aid Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Dysentery Cancer Fancy rat Guinea pig Clinical depression Gastroenteritis Acne Breastfeeding Anthrax Tuberculosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Traumatic brain injury Animal testing Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Asthma Dog Sickle-cell disease Chicken Cystic fibrosis Herpes simplex virus Shrimp farm Parkinson's disease Fecal incontinence Diabetes mellitus Pet skunk Prostate cancer Stroke Osteoarthritis Livestock Myxobolus cerebralis Rabies Rocky Mountain spotted fever Insulin Allergy Cirrhosis Equine conformation Cat Medicine Alcoholism Gonorrhoea Conjunctivitis Nutrition Radiation poisoning Homeopathy Paget's disease of bone Halitosis Sewage treatment Botulism Bipolar disorder Lyme disease Vitamin C Docking Hypoglycemia Hemorrhoid Cholera Multiple sclerosis Syphilis Migraine H5N1 Dairy Drowning Cephalic disorder Antibiotic Psychosis Group A streptococcal infection Ebola Clomipramine Helicobacter pylori Intravenous therapy Tooth enamel Gout Fibromyalgia Anorexia nervosa Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Anal sex Clostridium difficile Childbirth House Mouse Traditional Chinese medicine Poliomyelitis
