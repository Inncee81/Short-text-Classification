xbox multiplayer games i know that there are plenty of xbox games that offer multiplayer gaming whether it be multiplayer on a single console or multiplayer over xbox live but i was wondering if there are any good multiplayer games that allow both console and xbox live multiplayer simultaneously for example my little bro i are playing on my console but my fiancee who lives in brasil is playing on hers all of us want to play together but my bro doesn't have his own console so he has to play on mine with me so my question is are there any good games which allow multiple players on one console and allow those multiple players to connect to xbox live and play in the same game with people over xbox live thank you ahh yes that's one thing i meant to mention it can be an xbox game as well so long as it is one of the games that is compatible with the thank you for your answer ny my girlfriend and i play on one console while we play with friends over xbox live so split screen multiplayer support is an important feature for us i'm sure there are many games that would appeal to you but the following is a list of games we enjoy ghost recon advanced warfighter and its sequel for the xbox includes split screen and guest accounts can play there are many different game types to choose from you and your friends can play in co op mode against enemy ai or play against each other halo classic xbox game compatible with the xbox includes split screen and supports up to four players per console including guest accounts you can team up against other players over xbox live or play private matches amongst yourselves bomberman live you'll find this game in the xbox live arcade it's a cute and addictive game split screen is not necessary and up to eight players can play at once you can turn on off the ai and there are many different game types to choose from you can download a trial version rainbow six vegas allows you to play co op games in split screen for local play but not over xbox live please note the enemy ai uses harsh adult language they cuss a lot gears of war features a two player co op campaign on both local and online while the versus mode allows up to eight players on in matchmaking you can save a few dollars buying used games but you can also rent or download the demo trial versions of the games first good luck Xbox Live Halo 2 Multiplayer Xbox 360 First-person shooter Xbox Computer and video games Nintendo Halo: Combat Evolved Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Counter-Strike Need for Speed America's Army Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Computer role-playing game PlayStation 3 Nintendo DS Pump It Up Dead or Alive (video game) Nintendo GameCube Game Boy PlayStation Portable Bubble Bobble Super Mario Bros.
