hi is it worth buying the darkness has anyone play it played it for the it has really good graphics and there is nothing better then sending out your creeping darkness to rip the heart out of someone who decided to attack you it's set up like a fps but has alot of elements from rpgs you level up your darkness powers by as mentioned above eating the hearts of people that cross your path you can summon little creatures called darklings and set them loose on people the only thing i didn't like is that there is alot of backtracking you can go anywhere at anytime by using the subway station so its a big world to explore and also to go the wrong way in but all that aside it is a really good game i really liked it but i always recommend renting before buying Computer role-playing game Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories First-person shooter Game engine Summon magic (Final Fantasy) Role-playing game Samus Aran Poker jargon Golden Sun Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Yu-Gi-Oh!
