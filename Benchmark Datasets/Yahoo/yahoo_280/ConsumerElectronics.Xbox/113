can somebody tell me why my xbox the old one is freezing up and makes a humming sound when i play a game i was playing one of my old games nba live and it kept freezing up and making a humming sound and i would have to turn off my whole system off everytime and i gets on my nerves first check to see if it freezes on the same game at the same point etc if that is happening then most likely it is the cd itself or the reader on the dvd drive second it might be the fan you are hearing and the xbox could be overheating if you are leaving the xbox on a rug where most of the heat is absorbed that could be a problem try putting it up on a hard surface those rubber feet definitely help too keep it up to air out finally if it is still freezing i would send it in if you still have the warranty replace the fan or get a larger one if you feel up to voiding your warranty and placing it yourself or clean replace the dvd reader if after all that it still isn't working i would upgrade to a or replace the xbox but that seems like a lot of money so good luck Xbox Xbox 360 Modchip DVD PlayStation 2 Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Counter-Strike New York Knicks Playoff Pump It Up Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Video game music Computer and video games Xbox Live PlayStation 3 Heinkel He 100 Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Table tennis Futurama (TV series - season 5) Grand Theft Auto III Warranty Hyperthermia Halo 2 Engine cooling Motorcycle Nintendo GameCube Vacuum tube Game controller Rare (video game company) Mattress Items in the Metroid series Ice hockey Los Angeles Clippers Sonic the Hedgehog Tire Solar power GoldenEye 007 Hard disk Monopoly (game) Overclocking Poker jargon Tag Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Equine conformation Paintball The Price Is Right ZX Spectrum NBA Finals Van Halen Sega Dreamcast The Joker's Wild New York Giants DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Commodore Plus/4 Star Wars: Galaxies Bass guitar DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Ecco the Dolphin Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks IBM PC compatible Thermal power station New Jersey Nets DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Nintendo Entertainment System Mars Exploration Rover Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Yao Ming 1957 World Series Blood on the Tracks Deus Ex: Invisible War Fable (video game) Video game console Movie projector Betting (poker) Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Baseball Stars Console wars National Basketball Association Punisher Dance Dance Revolution Yu-Gi-Oh!
