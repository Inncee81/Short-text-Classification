buying an xbox and returning my broken one i've been through the repair process for my xbox several times this most recent time its been almost two weeks and i still don't have the coffin to send it back in i'm starting to crack and thinking about doing the previously unthinkable buy swap and return at walmart or best buy has anyone done this and had a bad experience i'm worried that the serial number on my is registered to me since i've had it repaired so many times and if best buy sends it back to microsoft they will connect it to me they probably wouldn't even do anything but still any insights from those with experience i know some people find this topic morally reprehensible but i am getting desperate and frustrated with microsoft i have also frequently requested new replacement units from microsoft when i send mine in and they say sorry it's up to the repair people who you can't contact in any way my sisters broke but the microsoft people did send her a new one they didn't just fix the other one Universal Serial Bus Xbox Domain Name System PlayStation 2 Windows XP The Daleks' Master Plan Bob and George Shaggy dog story Neighbours Electronic Arts Copy protection David Hume Modchip Billboard Hot 100 X86 Game programming Second Battle of the Atlantic Novell NetWare Killian documents Luke Skywalker Xbox 360 Aliens of London Heinkel He 112 GSM services God Emperor of Dune Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ashton-Tate Conker's Bad Fur Day Virtual memory CPU cache Tire British Rail Class 86 Make money fast Knots Landing Poker jargon IBM PC compatible Colony in Space Atari 8-bit family PlayStation 3 Computer virus Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans The Emancipation of Mimi Space Quest Pinball Serial Steven Wright Network Switching Subsystem John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Phoebe Halliwell Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Game controller Slashdot subculture RuneScape quests Surveillance Welding Modernism Nintendo Entertainment System MDAC Link (Legend of Zelda) Common Unix Printing System The Catcher in the Rye USS Yorktown (CV-10) Social rule Data Encryption Standard Goatse.cx Nintendo GameCube NVIDIA Phishing Milton H.
