how can i make my anime drawings look more three dimensional i'm just barely learning how to draw anime characters i am slightly impressed with myself because it seems i get better each time i draw being just a beginner i'm only drawing faces right now and as i walked past and glanced at my latest drawing i noticed something i disapprove of it looks too flat two dimensional not much life to it not only am i a beginner in anime but i'm a beginner at drawing period so i don't really know how to shade properly which i think may be one of my problems the other being they're always facing forward no angles if those are the cases can anyone give me some pointers please feel free to im or email if you'd like to discuss it many thanks in advance it has taken me years to figure that out my strength in the very beginning was machines then with faces i had to learn to shade and make the picture appear to have more than just the flat look for example when you draw clothes jewelry glasses make them fit the body as if they were your own drawing a necklace straight across makes your character appear to have a detachable head round the necklace or watch around the neck or wrist show the other side of a characters cheek and eyes make the lips smaller as they get to the furthest side of the face eyes as well i use my wife as shadowed reference by having her sit under a lamp in the same position as my character this tells me where to add the shadow and how much to add Aerial (dance move) Suplex Diving Drawing Shogi Swingout Poker jargon Volleyball Scapula Humerus Violin Equine conformation Strap-on dildo Akuma (Street Fighter) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Billiards Computer animation Horizontal bar Weight training Skateboarding trick Linked list Shaggy dog story Drill bit Lighting Hair Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
