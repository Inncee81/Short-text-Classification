do you think the ability to draw is significant if i want to take major in design graphics i'm in college for a graphic design right now i can tell you it certainly helps to have a background in art and to be able to draw it's not because you're going to be drawing a lot though it's the skills that you use to make a good drawing that really help when designing being a good photographer would help too things like a good knowledge of color and composition a mastery of visual hierarchy and knowing what catches someone's eye those are all great talents to go into design with however i do know a few great designers who couldn't draw if their life depended on it all in all i think being able to draw in itself has little to do with being a good designer as long as you're willing to take the extra time and effort to learn the things that the artist types already know Art Graphic design Graphics Drawing Color blindness Savannah College of Art and Design El Lissitzky Traditional animation Manga DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Stereoscopy Color Digital art Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Drew Struzan Artemisia Gentileschi Aphasia Norway national football team Graphic novel Wassily Kandinsky CPU cache Piet Mondrian Wolfrider Photography Martial art Web design Requirements analysis Carl Barks Jon Secada Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Time Out of Mind Mixed martial arts Graphics processing unit Extreme Programming M.C.
