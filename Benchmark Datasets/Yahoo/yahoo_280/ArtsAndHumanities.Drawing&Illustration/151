what medium may i use to design for a tshirt screenprint i am designing a tshirt for our small club and we worked out a design i'm pretty good at art ok no training but i'm still not bad but i don't know how to get my idea on paper i'm wondering if i can do it in oil pastels so it has a sketchy feel or do i have to ink it with markers or something or nowadays is it best that i just do it on the computer which wouldn't be as fresh at least for the way i work any insights would be great this design is going to get silkscreened on i believe but i am not the tshirt ordering person i would do it on computer because most tshirt screenprinting places need digital files of the image to be printed if you want that sketchy feel try playing around on a program like photoshop they have different textures of brushes you can draw with i once designed a club tshirt a few years ago in high school if i remember correctly it must be in digital file format probably a photoshop file psd or jpeg i had originally painted my design on paper but the tshirt printer guy made me scan it and fix it as a digital file he also made me do several black and white files for each color i want to use for ex say you have red and yellow as the colors of your printed design make a image file of just the red parts in black and a second one of just the yellow parts in black i think it's because they need to separate the colors when they print it and all i dunno if your particular screenprinting place will make you go through all of that but that's what happened for me hope it helps Screen-printing Printmaking Adobe Photoshop 2D computer graphics Drawing Inkjet printer Typewriter Digital photography PNG Color printing ImageMagick Computer printer Digital camera Photography Traditional animation Piet Mondrian Gamut Ebook Pastel Digital image editing Common Unix Printing System Pixel CMYK color model Color Color theory Microsoft Paint Graphic design RGB color model System/34 Fischer Random Chess Digital art Raster graphics Compact disc Tagged Image File Format Photocopying Printed circuit board Game Boy GIF Raw image format Ink Francis Bacon (painter) Vehicle registration plate Pretty Good Privacy Billboard (advertising) Paint Drew Struzan GIMP Steganography IPhoto Color space Trademark CPU cache Apple Macintosh Portable Document Format Printing press Fax Screenshot PlayStation Portable Dither Konica Minolta File format Graphics Digital circuit Adobe Systems Dot matrix printer Dots per inch Nintendo GameCube Mac OS X Black Computer virus Pixel art JPEG 2000 Comics Typeface Photographic film Euro banknotes Stereoscopy Cascading Style Sheets Laser printer Painting Apple IIGS System/36 Image scanner Geographic information system Floppy disk Punch card H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Copyright Color management ITunes Ukiyo-e Digital rights management DVD Enlarger Computer file
