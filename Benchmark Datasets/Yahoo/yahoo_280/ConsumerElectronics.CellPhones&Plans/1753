help my phone suddenly said no network coverage what does this mean my phone was working fine until all of a sudden it came up as no network coverage what does this mean i've gotten this message at random times with both t mobile and with cellular now at t sometimes it means a no network coverage their computer is on the blink and nothing you can say or do will make it work because you don't have a way to hit control alternate delete and reboot their computer arrrgh one time we had no coverage on t mobile thanks to a hacker who figured out paris hilton's password on her sidekick account was the name of her dog and i guess it really messed up t mobile's system for days it seemed hours for certain b your area may be blanketed by such bad weather severe thunderstorms or winter storms so much cloud cover that the satellites and other signal transmission systems tower to tower etc just has poor receptivity down to your phone or to a key area that covers your area it may not be obvious looking out where you are but if you got to a wider area like state or regional wide if you are in usa or even if you aren't and looked at a weather radar you could see really bad weather somewhere it might be enough to mess up signal and your phone won't be getting coverage and when i would call the customer service reps well they are always at least states away and completely clueless of the weather in your area so don't bother wasting your time calling them because they aren't going to admit the weather affects it but it does and i've watched that happen over and over and over soon as the storm blew out of the area our network coverage suddenly reappeared go figure c if you have dropped or hit your phone recently or someone else dropped it and you don't know about it etc your sim card and or your battery might have jiggled away from making full contact i had a huge problem with this with my old sidekick t mobile it would give me the no network coverage garbage and i'd pop that little baby out and pop it back in make sure it was seated in properly it popped in and out the side and rebooted the sucker and it would work so you could try that look on your phone's book or website for instructions on finding the sim card if it uses one not all phones do or for finding the battery compartment again not all phones have removable batteries the t mobile sidekick did not have user replaceable batteries which was a huge reason why i did not upgrade to the sk d sometimes the same thing happens with batteries just pull it out let it sit a minute or two pop it back in reboot the sucker see if it works lots of time you'll suddenly get coverage again e you may be traveling too far away from the interstate system if you look at coverage maps for a lot of the providers many times they only follow the interstate highways and if you get more than about oh with t mobile in parts of oklahoma and texas when i was traveling maybe miles miles depended on weather and terrain as well on either side of the highway i'd suddenly get no network coverage just too far out into the boondocks f sometimes ya just gotta break down and pay the man his phone bill heheheheh i know it slipped up on me a time or two and i'd be rebooting and shaking my phone and doing everything and then i'd suddenly thing hmmmm wonder if my phone bill is due i must have not seen the bill come in went to website and sure enough you owe us money and my phone was shut off and i had no network coverage waaaah hope some of these suggestions work or give you an idea of something to check
