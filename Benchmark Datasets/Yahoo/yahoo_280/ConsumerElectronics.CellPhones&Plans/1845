should i buy an iphone or a samsung u i am thinking of buying an iphone or samsung u but dont know which one to buy personally i'm not a fan of apple's user interface or any of their products in general not trying to give a biased answer though i think it would be wise to wait until all the kinks and problems with the iphone are sorted out first as with any new product the iphone probably has more capabilities than the u but it all depends on what you are looking for in a phone if you need web access or a music player or are just looking at it purely as a phone both are nice both are good buys though expensive if you need everything the iphone can dish out phone music gps internet camera a real os etc then i suppose you should buy that one it's all a matter of opinion personal preference and money Bluetooth Smartphone Mobile phone Microeconomics Copy protection Expert system Object-SQL mapping ITunes Hard disk Code division multiple access Private branch exchange Surveillance Voice over IP Wireless Application Protocol IPod IPAQ Customer relationship management Digital photography Password Inflation Internet fraud Macromedia Flash Mozilla Firefox Windows XP BlackBerry Musical Instrument Digital Interface Electronic commerce Embedded system Verizon Wireless Theory of conduct Flash memory Mac OS X GSM services I-mode Wi-Fi Pretty Good Privacy IBM PC compatible Domain Name System Phreaking Global System for Mobile Communications Mouse (computing) MSN Messenger Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB Contemporary culture of South Korea Vorbis Microsoft Office Palm OS NeXT Web crawler Teletext Internet troll Digital rights management Modem SimCity 4 Java programming language Bulletin board system Computer Floppy disk MP3 Enterprise content management Game programmer Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Ocean's Twelve WiMAX Microsoft Gross domestic product Universal Mobile Telecommunications System FireWire Object-oriented programming Cruising (maritime) Blu-ray Disc Graphical user interface Insurance Personal digital assistant Mozilla Application Suite Law of value Online shop Opera (web browser) ITunes Music Store Geographic information system Galactic Civilizations Encarta Haunted Apiary Web hosting Camera phone Apple Computer Machinima Personal computer WebObjects HyperCard Radeon Avenue Q Social rule Extreme Programming Timeline of computing 1990-forward Trademark Visual Basic CPU design Externality Sony
