what are your reviews on the razr v and the chocolate im trying to decide between the two so i need some pros and cons please also if you don't like these choices can you give me another choice of phone including name and provider the provider that im getting for my phone is verizon both of these cell phones are nice i think that you should get the chocolate the razr v runs out of battery fast therefore you have to charge it often however the pink one is very cute it's small and comfortable the chocolate has more gadgets in my opinion it's cuter and in general is a better phone the bad thing is that it costs way more than the razor as i said both of these very fine choices but i say you should go with the chocolate good luck Verizon Wireless Energy development Verizon Communications Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Virgin Mobile T-Mobile Cruising (maritime) N-Gage Reservoir Dogs Telephone numbering plan Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Sprint Nextel Corporation Battery (electricity) Symbian OS North American Numbering Plan The Amazing Race Telephone booth Telephone company Chocolate Telephone directory Bicycle lighting Friends The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Stuff (magazine) Slashdot subculture The Suffering (game) Global System for Mobile Communications GSM services The Wall Microeconomics M&M's Jennifer Lopez Voice over IP Telephone GED Nickel-cadmium battery IPAQ Cingular Wireless Social rule Cellular network Thermal power station The Sims Hybrid vehicle Conker's Bad Fur Day Mobile phone Shawn Michaels CPU cache Pocket PC Razor and blades business model Ocean's Twelve Fable (video game) Wonderland (McFly album) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Lithium ion polymer battery Joy (novel) Inspector Gadget School choice Economics Teen Girl Squad IPod Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Interactive fiction Hot Chocolate Fuel cell Legal research Customs and etiquette of Japan The Emancipation of Mimi Word of Wisdom Digital photography Theory of conduct Nintendo Electrophysiology Decision making Battery electric vehicle The Apprentice 2 Advanced Mobile Phone System Electronic voting Ron and Fez Payphone Veruca Salt Treo 650 Public transport Plasma display Taxicab Health insurance Skype Toll-free telephone number Lithium ion battery Labrador Retriever Oh My Goddess!
