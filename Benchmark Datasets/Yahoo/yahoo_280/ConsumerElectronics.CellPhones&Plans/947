water dectection stickers for verizon i have a lg vx env and it was in my beach bag with a lunch bag that had an ice pack inside and i think condensation got into the phone and killed it however the water detection sticker didn't change what is it supposed to look like normally mine is white with pinkish purple x's on it is my phone ruined by water or can i bring it back to the store and get it fixed its under day warrenty still id like to say it just stopped working unless they know something i don't any help is much appreciated thanx i emailed verizon annonomously sorry cant spell for crap and they said that the lg sticker is supposed to have pink x's on it when it gets wet it turns red is this true or are they trying to bull h t me i have an env that is practically new and never has been exposed to water works perfectly i read your question and pulled the battery to check it has a little round sticker on the inside both on the battery and on the phone the sticker has the pinkish purple x pattern on it so i don't think your sticker is indicating water damage i had an lg vx that fell in water a year or so ago and took it back to the verizon store it had been working after falling in the water and then started freaking out the store employee took it in back and exchanged it for a new one after a quick inspection the insurance thing might work but it sounds like a significant risk anytime someone buys insurance on an item that's not new especially if you call from a phone other than the cell phone on which you're buying the insurance it's going to raise a red flag then having a claim on the insured item a few days later major red flag considering everything i would just take it into the verizon store and see if they'll exchange it i seriously do not think your water detection sticker has been tripped good luck Verizon Wireless Insurance German car number plates Neopets Surveillance Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Plame affair The Inside Thermal power station Caving 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Blackjack Wal-Mart Ocean's Twelve Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Reservoir Dogs Shaggy dog story HIV test 2003 North America blackout Topps Ron and Fez USS Tunny (SS-282) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Vodafone Craps Tesco Toyota Prius Floppy disk Cruising (maritime) Health insurance Paul Is Dead Digital photography Debugging Taxicab Calvin and Hobbes Computer virus Drowning Gold as an investment Animal Crossing USS Waters (DD-115) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Naval mine Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Solar power Make money fast 7 July 2005 London bombings Mobile phone radiation and health Gaia Online USS Augusta (CA-31) Computer forensics Battery electric vehicle Russian joke Tea Confidence trick 2000 Australian Grand Prix Microeconomics Fuel cell Oplan Bojinka Lightsaber Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dog training Blood (computer game) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Piccolo Junior Saga Dow Jones Industrial Average Internet fraud Beltway sniper attacks Stopping e-mail abuse Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Final Fantasy XI Yu-Gi-Oh!
