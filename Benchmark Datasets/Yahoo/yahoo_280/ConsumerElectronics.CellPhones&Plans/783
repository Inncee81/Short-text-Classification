any way to get out of deductible for damaged phone cingular my phone had some water damage and now some of the keys don't work i have insurance and i'm looking into replacing the phone it really irks me that i have to pay a deductible on top of the a month i've been paying for almost a year to get the phone replaced i just don't see the point of insurance when i can get a newer better phone for insurance will probably give me a refurb and not have had payed the monthly premium anyway has any one had experience in getting the insurance company to waive the deductible if that is part of the agreement it's unlikely you will be able to get out of paying it it should however cover replacement with a new equivalent model phone not a refurbished model that too should be in the insurance agreement the only other way i could think that would allow you to get out of the deductable is if the contract is nearly up he should be eligible for a new phone or upgrade anyway i am with a different company and they allow you to upgrade with days remaining on a plan without paying a penalty you could also threaten to cancel the plan but if you aren't at the end of it they will hit you with a hefty early termination fee the only thing i can say that might help you feel a bit better is that if you look at the price of the phone without a plan and see that it probably is still saving you money having insurance i don't necessarily believe the phone prices are fair but it's what they would charge you to buy it outright good luck Auto insurance Annuity Publicly funded medicine Mortgage Wal-Mart Contract 401(k) Octopus card Medicare (United States) Verizon Wireless Social Security (United States) Virgin Mobile Taxation in the United States Warren Buffett Tax Bond Microeconomics Unemployment benefit Health savings account FairTax 2004-05 in English football Predatory lending United Kingdom corporation tax Variable universal life insurance UK Singles Chart Lloyd's of London Health care in the United States Telephone numbering plan Citigroup Primerica Financial Services Broadband Internet access Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Voice over IP Monopoly (game) Personal finance EFTPOS Option HIPAA Modem Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Poker jargon SCO-Linux controversies Home Box Office Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Internet fraud London Underground $ale of the Century Payroll Food Stamp Program Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Babylonian law Public transport London Congestion Charge Payphone Road pricing Medical malpractice Supply-side economics April 2005 in Canada Stock Canadian and American health care systems compared Schabir Shaik Trial Short selling Cable television The Amazing Race Managed care AT&T Health maintenance organization Air New Zealand Hyperinflation Derivative (finance) Laptop Wheel of Fortune TiVo American International Group Capitalism Flat tax BlackBerry Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 New Deal Capital accumulation Higher Education Bill Paintball Commodity markets Copyright Final Fantasy XI Gross domestic product Title insurance Mensal__o scandal Adverse selection Surveillance Bank Economy of Russia
