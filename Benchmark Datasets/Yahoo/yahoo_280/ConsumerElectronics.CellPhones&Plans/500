if i get an at t cellphone will it work with a t mobile sim card i want to get the motorazr v when it comes out but i believe it's exclusive to at t what exactly does that mean i know the iphone only works with at t but do you think i can use a t mobile sim card on that phone will the only downside be that there will be an at t logo on my phone i had a cingular phone that worked on my t mobile so and it was also a motorolla phone but an old one it says cingular on the outside but it's really t mobile i can live with that it's not an unlocked phone it's gonna be an at t phone it appears but i don't think the sim card is sealed in like the iphone i'm sure you can take it out do you know if the razr will be exclusive to at t or not also should i just get a t mobile razr or an unlocked do you think there will be an unlocked version if you got the phone wanting to use it for t mobile you'd have the get it unlocked the downside to that is when a phone is unlocked and used on a different carrier the reception will be decreased in some areas not very much in others far greater that is definitely something you should consider especially if you live in an area that already has poor coverage Global System for Mobile Communications N-Gage Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Vodafone Mobile phone Sprint Nextel Corporation T-Mobile Verizon Wireless Telephone numbering plan Treo 650 The Sims Telephone tapping Network Switching Subsystem The Sims 2 Bluetooth Push to talk Advanced Mobile Phone System Subscriber Identity Module GSM services Surveillance Short message service FIFA Series BlackBerry Wi-Fi Virgin Mobile Q-Telecom International Mobile Subscriber Identity North American Numbering Plan General Packet Radio Service Handheld video game W-CDMA SBC Communications Mobile phone radiation and health Verizon Communications Voice over IP Mobile game Mobility management ATI Technologies Cellular network Emergency telephone number The Sims 2: University Beatmania IIDX Danger Hiptop Resident Evil Radio AT&T Meteor Mobile Communications Electronic Arts Capitalism IEEE 802.11 Tesco MTV Smart card Modem BellSouth Nintendo DS One.Tel Octopus card Maxis UK telephone numbering plan MTR 9-1-1 Digital photography Code division multiple access Phone fraud Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution AT&T Wireless Camera phone International Mobile Equipment Identity GSM frequency ranges Ultra high frequency Telephone IPAQ Symbian OS Digital AMPS Turkcell Computer and video games Hiking Final Fantasy (video game) Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Suica Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Japanese mobile phone culture New York Jets Battlefield 2 Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
