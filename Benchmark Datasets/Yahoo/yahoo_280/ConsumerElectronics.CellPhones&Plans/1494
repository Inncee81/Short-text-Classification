sprint or verizon answers from people who've had both only please i'm a crossroads here i have sprint and i'm happy with the service my two year contract ended last month and i was thinking about reupping the service for a credit on my bill however my treo shuts off intermittently and since i can't reproduce the problem in front of a tech but it happens once or twice a day they claim it's not broken their response was to say it was stolen and pay insurance but i find that really dishonest i don't want to submit a fraudulent claim that isn't true and quite honestly i don't want to pay for a phone that i think they should replace under the warranty then there is verizon which has v cast while i don't do much in the way of watching tv it does seem pretty cool and they supposedly have a better network between billing customer service replacements or anything you think is relevant which is the best way to go i'll pay more to go verizon to pay for new phones so is it worth it sprint rules Verizon Wireless Sprint Nextel Corporation Verizon Communications Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Warranty Microeconomics BlackBerry Social rule Virgin Mobile Theory of conduct Treo 650 Toll-free telephone number Insurance Vodafone Treo E-mail spam Bank fraud Phreaking Paul Is Dead Push to talk The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Phone sex Ben Johnson (athlete) Credit card Telephone company Plame affair AT&T Phone fraud Internet fraud Bill Maher Health insurance 9-1-1 Cable television Meaning of life Shaggy dog story Advanced Mobile Phone System MCI Phishing Ocean's Twelve Nine Inch Nails Citigroup Fraud Major League Baseball television contracts Green Day ALLTEL Auto insurance 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Cingular Wireless Peer review The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie British national identity card CDMA2000 7 July 2005 London bombings T-Mobile United Kingdom corporation tax Automatic teller machine Tour de France The Ashlee Simpson Show Surveillance Qwest 2003 California recall Whois Telephone booth Ponzi scheme Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) EastEnders GSM services Outsourcing 9/11 conspiracy theories Speech recognition The break up of AT&T Halliburton Recording Industry Association of America Wal-Mart Karl Rove SCO-Linux controversies Apple Computer Friends Mediation Las Vegas Monorail Satchel Paige Poker jargon Kill Bill 2003 North America blackout The Amazing Race Evan Mecham Schabir Shaik Trial Voice over IP Customer relationship management Kodocha Jumping the shark Evolution Data Only Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Beach Boys Western Union Radio Yerevan Directory assistance Judith Miller (journalist) American International Group Procrastination
