the iphone okay i am supposed to be getting the iphone tomorrow but i can't find any reviews on it can someone that has already purchased the iphone give me some pro's and cons about the phone it seems like a nice phone but is it worth buying it it does everything the apple website says it does and nothing more it would seem alot of iphone purchasers were under the assumption their new phone would do whatever they imagined sadly most of them were disappointed overall i'd have to say the iphone is better than i expected it is extremely intuitive and more useful than i thought wasted time waiting for lunch at a restaurant can be used watching a movie surfing the internet or updating your schedule the google map makes it very easy to find everything in unfamiliar and even very familiar cities cool i didn't know a coffee house was there just type in what you want and it will give you ideas of where to go and phone numbers to call plus current road conditions enroute texting has never been easier the only flaw is now i often hit the char limit per text message battery life is great contrary to what you may have heard i watched three hour movies voiced for an hour surfed the internet for about minutes and listened to an hours worth of music and still had half a charge left if apple comes out with the faster internet gig mem version in november i'll upgrade immediately the iphone is more versatile in my personal and professional life than i could have imagined IBM PC compatible Shaggy dog story Microeconomics Apple Macintosh Mac OS X Social rule Gmail Digital photography National Weather Service World Wide Web Battery (electricity) Counter-Strike IPod Toyota Prius Computer Virgin Mobile Opera (web browser) Time Out of Mind The Amazing Race Predictive dialer GSM services Musical Instrument Digital Interface Walkman Quarashi Steam (content delivery) CPU cache Mobile phone Voice over IP Poker jargon Jon Secada Internet troll Windows Vista United Airlines Flight 93 Contemporary culture of South Korea Verizon Wireless Energy development Rush Limbaugh ITunes Music Store Storytelling HyperCard PlayStation Portable Supply and demand Fermi paradox Carl Jung Phone sex Radeon PowerBook ELO rating system Normal distribution The Ashlee Simpson Show Monkey Island Extraordinary Machine Hey Jude The Day After Tomorrow America Online Kill Bill Ocean's Twelve Annuity Common Unix Printing System ITunes Karaoke Monopoly (game) Copy protection Air traffic controller Modem Lithium ion battery Ontological argument The Jim Rome Show Live 8 Request for Comments Forth programming language Plame affair TiVo Rose (Doctor Who) Apple Newton Sharon Tate Visual Basic Mozilla Firefox Ashton-Tate Windows 2000 John Cage Episodes of Lost (Season 1) MP3 BitTorrent MSN Messenger Windows XP Technology Call for help Internet fraud Apple Computer Frank Herbert Personal computer The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
