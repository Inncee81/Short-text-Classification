how can i get a sidekick if i have at t i have at t and a sidekick is in another phone thing i think t mobile my mom wont let me switch so is there anyother way to get a sidekick you can but it won't come cheap if you buy the sidekick from the t mobile store or off of the t mobile site they charge you almost twice as much for the phone because you're getting it without a contract plan after that you'd have to unlock the phone because the sidekick is locked to only the t mobile network a reasonable cost for unlocking would be around you can unlock the phone in independent cell phone stores usually found in the mall i couldn't find the price of the sidekick if you bought it from t mobile without a plan i found a new but lock regular sidekick on ebay for a new d wade edition one for and a lightly used lifted research group limited edition one for but that is off of ebay i'm sure you'll find better deals on craigslist in the end it will cost you a lot less to buy the sidekick without a plan unlock it and use it on the at t network than to buy the new iphone from at t i hope that helps you a little Telephone numbering plan N-Gage Skype Gmail Danger Hiptop Wal-Mart Verizon Wireless Short message service Capitalism North American Numbering Plan Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Telephone tapping Digital photography T-Mobile Public transport Electronic commerce Telephone ITunes Music Store Filling station Bulk vending Cellular network Octopus card Virgin Mobile Computer Toyota Prius Best Buy Craigslist MTR GSM services Internet Eircom 9-1-1 Pocket PC Snoop Dogg Ministry of Magic Live 8 Mobile phone Battery (electricity) Voice over IP Microeconomics Password MegaMan Battle Network 5 Perfect Dark Armored Core Euro NEC Corporation Dot-com AT&T Flash memory Solar power satellite Global Positioning System Cruising (maritime) Vodafone Internet fraud IPod Auction General Packet Radio Service Insurance Modem United Airlines Flight 93 Solar cell Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition Philatelic investment NorthwesTel Legend of Mana Pok__mon (video games) Hydrogen economy Spice Girls Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
