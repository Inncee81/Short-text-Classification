after you do this just read the little stories and think of a wish as you scroll all the way to the bottom there is a message there then make your wish no attachment on this one stories i'm years old and i wished that my dad would come home from the army because he'd been having problems with his heart and right leg it was p m when i made my wish at p m minutes later the doorbell rang and there my dad was luggage and all i'm katie and i'm and i've been having trouble in my job and on the verge of quitting i made a simple wish that my boss would get a new job that was at and at there was an announcement that he was promoted and was leaving for another city believe me this really works my name is ann and i am years of age i had always been single and had been hoping to get into a nice loving relationship for many years while kind of daydreaming and right after receiving this email i wished that a quality person would finally come into my life that was at am on a tuesday at am a fedex delivery man came into my office he was cute polite and could not stop smiling at me he started coming back almost everyday even without packages and asked me out a week later we married months later and now have been happily married for years what a great email it was just scroll down to the end but while you do think of a wish make your wish when you have completed scrolling whatever age you are is the number of minutes it will take for your wish to come true ex you are years old it will take minutes for your wish to come true however if you don't send this to people in minutes you will have bad luck for years go for it scroll down stop congratulations your wish will now come true in your age minutes now follow this carefully it can be very rewarding if you repost this within the next min something major that you've been wanting will happen this is scary the phone will ring right after you repost as cell phone trick i answered this and sent off to one person this morning about am my phone didn't ring does that mean my wish won't come true just my luck to be the only one where it doesn't work or come true oh well have a nice day anyway Friends Shaggy dog story Social
