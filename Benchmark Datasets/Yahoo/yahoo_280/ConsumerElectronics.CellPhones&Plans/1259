cell phone fell into pool somebody pushed me into a pool and my cell phone was in my pocket i immediately took out the battery and then tried to dry it out i tested to see if it worked and only a blank white screen came on is there any hope that my cell phone is not completely dead or did i fry it by trying to see if it worked i did the same thing about a month ago i also took my battery out and let it dry out it may take a couple of days to completely dry out you may be lucky like i was and the phone will come back to life however my phone's screen is extremely dim and i cannot see it outside during the day hopefully you have insurance on your phone or you may be close to being able to upgrade otherwise if it does not work you might have to shell out a few hundred bucks for a new one i filed a claim and it only cost me for a new one good luck Battery (electricity) Poker jargon Nickel-cadmium battery Insurance Verizon Wireless Radio Digital photography Windows Mobile 7 July 2005 London bombings Mobile phone Solar cell Nintendo Handheld game console IPod Apple Newton Fuel cell The Suffering (game) Drowning Mobile phone radiation and health Ashton-Tate Battery electric vehicle IPAQ Protoss N-Gage Kill Bill Oplan Bojinka Toyota Prius 9/11 conspiracy theories Carbon dioxide Hubble Space Telescope Short message service USS Bagley (DD-386) HIV test Yom Kippur War PlayStation Portable Skype Telephone Social rule Lithium ion battery Microbrowser George Costanza USS Wickes (DD-578) USS Waters (DD-115) Philip J.
