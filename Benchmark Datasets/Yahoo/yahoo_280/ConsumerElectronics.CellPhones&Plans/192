which is better the motorola razr v xx or the motorola rizr z why i realize there are better phones and flaws with these phones but please choose one of the phones above thanks most significant difference i can see is that the camera on the rizr is actually megapixels while the razr is if you have a good digital camera and only use the phone camera for quick fun pics it really won't make a huge difference the rizr is a slider phone while the razr flips open the razr has a lot more options but both seem pretty good i guess it kind of depends on your purpose for the phone other than being a phone check the link i am including to compare the two models yourself and see what you think what i found most confusing is that they have similar features but for some reason they are listed differently in the specs like the camera function being listed differently for each though they both are camera phones anyway hope this helps Digital photography Digital camera Bluetooth Modem Mobile phone Pixel Leica Canon EOS Poker jargon CPU cache Camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Tungsten Handheld RISC Konica Minolta Computer Atari ST Password Apple Macintosh Walkman Camera phone Gmail Road-rule enforcement camera The Ashlee Simpson Show Password cracking Symbian OS Embedded system Microeconomics Hash table IPAQ Social rule Japanese mobile phone culture Pretty Good Privacy Screenplay Wheel of Fortune Mach kernel Universal Serial Bus The Amazing Race Coin flipping Windows Vista Endianness Single-lens reflex camera BASIC programming language Mouse (computing) Photography IPod Telephone Telephone numbering plan Patricia Ford Video game music Mobile phone radiation and health Associative array Sharp Zaurus Dassault Mirage III Smartphone Central processing unit Musical Instrument Digital Interface North American Numbering Plan Digital cinema Internet fraud Danger Hiptop Voice over IP Oscilloscope CPU design Beatmania IIDX Secure Digital card PowerPC Floppy disk Apple Newton Laserdisc MOS Technology 6502 View camera Normal distribution Armored Core Sprint Nextel Corporation Motorola 68000 Privacy Telephone exchange Amstrad CPC EXpanded MultiPlayer International Phonetic Alphabet Short message service Verizon Wireless IBM 1620 Wallpaper group Winning Streak Handspring Game programmer Whois High-definition television Push to talk PIC microcontroller Laptop Closed-circuit television Computer vision MSN Messenger Sampling (music) Prostate cancer
