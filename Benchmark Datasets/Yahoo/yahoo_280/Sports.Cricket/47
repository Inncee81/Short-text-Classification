dhoni is done so far he has gone from bad to worse since the world cup yea he made a decent in the second innings of the st test against england but he and india got lucky when play was delayed he took the aerial route way too many times and got lucky then he put up squat in the second test and now in the warmup match against sri lanka a he puts up and in a day match wow dinesh karthik should come up as the wicket keeper now and they should put yuvraj singh back into the mix take out laxman in the process and maybe put in irfan pathan its time for him to return he's been away from the national scene for a long time he and the other two lefties will create all sorts of havoc for england i mean day was ended early not delayed i think they should replace dhoni with yuvraj however they have a wicketkeeper dinesh karthik in the team because yuvraj will help a lot as he is a leftie so in the middle order with laxman or whoever there are two lefties ganguly and yuvi so it will help india to unsettle the bowlers with their line and length irfan pathan should not come back instead they should take out sree santh and put in ishant sharma or ranadeb bose as agarkar is not in the squad but i think they should remove sree santh Indian cricket team Border-Gavaskar Trophy International cricket in 2005 Ravi Shastri Australian cricket team Cricket Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 2005 English cricket season Mahendra Singh Dhoni August 2005 in sports Yuvraj Singh 2003 Cricket World Cup Fielding (cricket) Follow-on Test cricket Bradman Cup 20:20 Tournament 2005/6 One-day International Adam Gilchrist Fast bowling English cricket team History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Saurav Ganguly Laxman Sivaramakrishnan West Indian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005 1996 Cricket World Cup Laws of cricket History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wicket-keeper History of Test cricket (to 1883) New Zealand cricket team Rahul Dravid Zimbabwean cricket team Norway national football team ICC Super Series 2005 Timeline of cricket 1986 ICC Trophy Dismissal (cricket) James Anderson (cricketer) 1957 World Series 2005 Afro-Asian Cup Anil Kumble International cricket in 2005-06 Melbourne Cricket Ground Roy Dias Sachin Tendulkar 2005 ICC Trophy Batting (cricket) One-day cricket Bowling strategy (cricket) 2005 Ashes series 1999 Cricket World Cup Andrew Strauss The Ashes Pakistani cricket team February 2005 in India Tied Test Shane Warne First-class cricket Graham Dilley History of cricket Malcolm Marshall Left-arm orthodox spin George Lohmann South Africa A cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Imran Khan Muttiah Muralitharan September 2005 in sports Rajput Wasim Akram Steve Harmison Over (cricket) Brian Close 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup Cricket pitch Sidath Wettimuny Sydney Riot of 1879 Courtney Walsh Michael Vaughan C.K.
