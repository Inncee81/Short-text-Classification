first time getting belly button pierced i was wondering if normally the price of includes the ring or not i know that it depends on the shop but is there a times out of thing or something also do you have any comments or advice for me i'm not nervous or concerned i'm actually really excited but if you have any advice i would appreciate it i plan on getting my cartalage pierced at the same time so if you have any advice about that that too would be appreciated thank you usually the price is the price of the piercing as well as the jewelry the only way this would change is if you want something specific like gold or allergy free stuff just make sure wherever you go is clean bc the belly button is easy to get infected to begin with wear low rise pants to get it done and make sure you wear the same till it heals you also might want to consider wearing a slightly bigger shirt for comfort as far as cartalage if they bring out a gun instead of a needle run i got one side done with a gun and one with a needle and the gun side is still not healed completely almost years later also guns damage the tissue hope you have fun Body piercing Earring Tattoo Ear piercing instrument Violin Barbell (piercing) Prince Albert piercing Tongue piercing Condom Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Intravenous therapy Medicine The Apprentice 2 Allergy Aerial (dance move) RuneScape skills Traumatic brain injury Suplex Lip piercing Upholstery Clothing Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Gaia Online Mattress Prostate cancer Navel piercing Vegeta Final Fantasy magic Beretta 92F/FS Undergarment Hepatitis C Nipple piercing Shirt Insulin Local anesthetic Wound Umbilicus Suture Jewellery Poker jargon Diving Coeliac disease The Legend of Zelda series characters Euro Characters of Lost Social rule Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara E85 Cancer Rise of Nations Methamphetamine Corset Gradius Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Trailer Park Boys Menstrual cup Chainmail Quake III Arena The Invisibles Codename: Kids Next Door Breastfeeding The Inside Blood (computer game) Female genital cutting Beavis and Butt-head RuneScape weapons Heavy metal fashion Piercing migration Saruman Halo: Combat Evolved Stomach cancer RuneScape locations Sento Diamond Donald Duck Terminal ballistics Kim Possible Softball Donald Rumsfeld Shadow the Hedgehog Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Grandview, U.S.A.
