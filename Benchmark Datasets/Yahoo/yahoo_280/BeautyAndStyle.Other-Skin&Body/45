cystic acne again i have asked questions about this before but i am on meds for my cystic acne i have been on bactrim and clindamycin gel for two weeks but today i started forming more new cysts i am so depressed i can't even focus on anything i hate to look at myself in the mirror all i see are these huge red cysts and along with that scars and discoloration from future skin issues i know i know give the medicine time i hear that all the time but when you look like this you just wish someone would say oh this is what you can do unfortunately i understand there really isn't anything you can do about cystic acne but if anyone has any ideas please feel free to let me know thank you you probably hear this a lot but one thing to prevent acne in general is to drink you're glasses of water a day keeping you're body hydrated well is important not just for internal organs but you're skin needs it to consistently clean it self and rid it self of toxins that you're body takes in during the day also try to eat a lot of vegtables and fruit of course keep it in balance with other foods but make sure you have at least fruits a day and a salad almond oil works one slowly deminishing scars but wait until the acne is pretty much gone because the last thing you need is oil on acne it just doesn't mix but after for the scars use almond oil i know this because my friend had severe acne and i helped her get through that whole hate to look at myself in the mirror thing also this seemed to work for her to keep her skin clean and free of acne http www xanga com ricebunny aspririn beautiful skin html of course it does't work on all skins depending on each person and how they eat how they live how active they are it depends on you're life style really sometimes on genes but not most of the time i know some other things that might help if you like just e mail me i hope this helps and that you're cystic acne slowly demishes i personally have no idea how that must feel but from having a close friend go through the same thing i can tell how it affects people possibly talk to you're dermatologist about other treatments also Acne Scar Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Social rule Psoriasis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Diarrhea Rosacea Skin Theory of conduct Prostate cancer Cystic fibrosis Pneumonia Tocopherol Cirrhosis Isotretinoin Urinary incontinence Tofu Spina bifida Wound healing phases Tuberculosis Fasting Cephalic disorder Autism Puberty Stomach cancer Amineptine Escherichia coli O157:H7 Eczema Fancy rat Group A streptococcal infection Cancer Pitaten Radiation therapy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Characters in the Smurfs Medicine Keloid Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Shaggy dog story Hearing impairment Antidepressant Hypoglycemia Dietary fiber Current teachings of Prem Rawat Chronic fatigue syndrome Anthrax Insulin Lupus erythematosus Stroke Piccolo Junior Saga Sewage treatment Tooth Folic acid Borderline personality disorder Veganism Time Out of Mind Yoga Sutras of Patanjali World Wide Web Cleanser Hyperthermia About a Boy Bipolar disorder Jiddu Krishnamurti Hiberno-English Garfield Marathon (sport) Allergy Clinical depression Ultraviolet Karen Horney Salad Fingers Kosher foods Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Autistic community Common cold Herpes simplex virus Baldness treatments Anorexia nervosa Botulism Multiple sclerosis Protein-energy malnutrition Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Drosophila melanogaster Alcoholics Anonymous Science Phoebe Halliwell Malaria Kodocha
