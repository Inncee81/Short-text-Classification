is it possible for asians to go from having a flat nose to a thin caucasian nose through rhinoplasty i'm curious because i've seen other asians btw i'm asian as well who go through rhinoplasty wanting to have a completely new transformed thin nose to look more caucasian but as a result they just wind up having their nostrils pushed inward and they still have that flat nose asian look its something that i just don't quite understand instead of just having their nostrils pushed inwards why can't they just undergo a dramatic transformation through rhinoplasty if they want to have a caucasian nose because that pushed nostril inward look isn't exactly a caucasian nose so it leads me to wonder can rhinoplasty go beyond that and completely change the entire structure of an asian nose flat and wide to a narrow thin nose like what caucasian ppl have and not just having their nostrils only pushed in i read about rhinoplasty surgery on the internet i think u should read it too this could be helpful to you http answers yahoo com question index ylt aiymzm zru i zl mrcuijzkix qid aaotlgk http www content syndication org health medicine rhinoplasty surgery in india costs benifts and risks html http surgeryindiatestimonials wordpress com revision rhinoplasty surgery testimonial india Rhinoplasty HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator White (people) World Wide Web Open access Wget XML Plastic surgery Common cold Urinary incontinence Domain Name System Web browser Nose flute Black (people) Ayurveda HTML HTTP cookie Blog Physical attractiveness Prostate cancer Web server Floppy disk Traditional Chinese medicine Cross site scripting Cascading Style Sheets Stroke Pneumonia Enterprise content management SAML Paula Jones Mesothelioma Uniform Resource Identifier Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nose Breastfeeding Wireless Application Protocol WordPress Transmission Control Protocol Tai Chi Chuan Body modification Organ transplant HTML element Internet Body piercing Common Unix Printing System Cancer Wiki Backstroke Media and ethnicity Stu Ungar Internet censorship in mainland China Ulcerative colitis Sexual attraction Representational State Transfer Nose piercing Ajax (programming) Traumatic brain injury Transformer Russian joke XMLHTTP Medicine Northwest Caucasian languages Web crawler Atherosclerosis Cephalic disorder Plate tectonics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) JavaServer Pages African American Vernacular English Bleeding Race WebDAV Spark plug Comic Relief Obesity Glasses Intersex surgery Church of Christ, Scientist BitTorrent Jala neti Netscape Communications Corporation Terminal ballistics Tetrapod Snake Education Tobacco smoking Web page Unicode and HTML Tattoo Controversies in autism Stem cell Cocaine Atkins Nutritional Approach Gastric bypass surgery Whois Stairway Waverider
