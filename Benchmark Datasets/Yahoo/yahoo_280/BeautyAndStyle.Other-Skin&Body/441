are there plastic lip rings that look like metal i want to get my bottom right of my lip pierced but my mom wont let me because it can damage teeth will a plastic one prevent that where can i get one any link would be amazing what was getting it pierced like and does anyone of a picture of the scar left over can anyone tell me their experience i need an argument for my mom i've had my lip pierced both sides and my labret and my monroe although i don't have them anymore there are bars that are plastic you can buy them from off ya tree in australia not sure where you are the plastic bars are good because you can screw a metal ball on the end of the platic so you have a metal stud but the bar is plastic and doesn't do any damage this is what i had and the plastic bar was alot more comfortable than the metal ones but you have to make sure you don't bite on the plastic bar getting my first lip piercing ever i was pretty scared but it wasn't as bad as i thought it was i've also had my nose pierced my ears and my tongue and it didn't hurt much i don't have a very high tolerance of pain either i'm an absolute sook and i didn't cry or anything i don't have a picture of any scars now because there are no scars on my lip you can still see a tiny hole ifyour up close enough but it's hardly noticeable you can see it a bit better if you make a fish face or something but clearly that isn't often my mum also said no at first but then after my first piercing i got more and more although she is happy that theyre gone now i think if you put a stud in your lip it looks alot nicer than a stud and can be hidden easily by this i mean if you get a plastic bar you can buy what is called 'o rings' to go on the end of the bar if you need it to be hidden so you cant see the metal ball try find a website that has more information to show her also if you go to the piercing place they could tell you alot too and explain to your mum a bit more about the plastic bars not sure if they come in rings Drill bit Body piercing Earring Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Poker jargon Nine Inch Nails The Inside Harmonica Screw Piccolo Junior Saga Theory of conduct Condom Textile manufacturing Bullet Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist EastEnders Plastic Body modification RuneScape quests Marilyn Monroe Kodocha The Shining (film) Violin Plastic surgery Hamster StarCraft: Uprising Tongue piercing Pok__mon Live!
