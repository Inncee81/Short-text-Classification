insecure about double jointed ness i know other people are double jointed but mine is just very noticeable my elbows are the most noticeable double jointed part in my body my knees are also double jointed they may not be that noticeable but i still feel pretty self conscious about them so im afraid to wear shorts most of the time what can i do to get over my self consciousness just wear what you are comfortable in and screw what anybody else thinks i know it's hard to have that attitude i have skin problems on my legs and for years i would only wear pants even if i wasn't broken out i live in florida so this was miserable one day i just said screw it i'm not doing this anymore i'm going to wear what you want chances are your double jointedness is not as noticable to others as you think Professional wrestling holds Mixed martial arts Trousers Figure skating Kodocha Tai Chi Chuan Undergarment Breaststroke Diving Drill bit Decompression sickness Milton H.
