jergens tan did it work for u im not looking for a suttle change im looking for a noticeable change is it worth my money please only answer if you have tried it yes i have used it i have light skin and i used the darkest one you have to apply every day it and make sure to rub it in thuroughly every time after about days you will notice a difference go light with it around knees elbows and around your ankles toes cuz it will get darker and kinda orangy around those areas after about a week it will start to wear off it doesnt all come off overnight but slowly over a couple days will start to dissapear if you use it every day for a few days you will notice a difference the only downfall is you cant go any darker than the dark one which isnt really very dark and it starts to wear off even if you apply it every day for weeks but overall for what it is i think it works pretty well Tattoo Human skin color Professional wrestling holds Physical attractiveness Wood Bicycle lighting Equine conformation Horse Glossary of partner dance terms Decompression sickness Marching band Black (people) Motor oil Albedo Slayers Jon Secada Color theory Psoriasis Kurt Angle Serial Wheel of Fortune Shoe Aerial (dance move) Sento Volleyball Ski $ale of the Century Glossary of ballet terms Shawn Michaels Greg Valentine Dark Side of the Moon Biped Shorts Sandy Koufax Lunar eclipse PRIDE Barbie Cigar Breaststroke Black Gregorian calendar Softball Laser hair removal Professional wrestling aerial techniques Upholstery Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Microeconomics Comanche Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Wolfrider Leather Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sunlight Clean and jerk Scabies Tai Chi Chuan Sunscreen Figure skating Human anatomy Snowboard Astronomy on Mars Pointe shoes Acne Baseball Stars WNNX (FM) White (people) Babe Ruth Sock Tarantula Gout Motorcycle safety clothing Imperial stormtrooper Social rule Muay Thai Trousers Paul Is Dead Chain Reaction (game show) Fox McCloud Hebrew calendar Tropical year Hogwarts Breastfeeding Frog ALGOL 68 The Ashlee Simpson Show Billboard Hot 100 Anatomical terms of location Academic dress of Oxford University Species Amateur wrestling Tour de France Backstroke Kimono The Joker's Wild Diamond enhancement Contact lens Blue Jeopardy!
