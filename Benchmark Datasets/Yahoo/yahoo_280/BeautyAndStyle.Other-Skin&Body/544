has anyone ever used maui babe browning lotion does it actually work i bought it yesterday and i was wondering how you use it no duh you have to rub it in your body but like how long until you can get into water after use is there any place on the body you shouldn't use it thanks a zillion my wife got and used some when we were in hawaii a few years ago it has some kind of ingredient smells like cinamon and brown sugar that is supposed to help your skin become browner with exposure to the sun i don't know if the stuff worked but it is very sticky and you'll smell like a cinamon roll for a couple of days it's probably not worth the money since we didn't really notice any results it's got an oil base so it doesn't readily wash off in the water and it seemed to be all natural ingredients so i don't think it will hurt to use it anyplace sensitive on your body like anything though avoid getting it in your eyes it might burn or sting a bit Sunscreen Sushi Maui Hamster Eczema Massage Shark Sunlight Mosquito Shampoo Spider Tarantula Social rule Formic acid George Burns Perfume Ammonia Hay fever Leather Potato Smoke-screen Jellyfish Diving suit Pok__mon Abilities Shaggy dog story Tocopherol Obsessive-compulsive disorder Tattoo Soap Acne Shit Sin City Babe Ruth Psoriasis Breakfast Sperm Whale Diving Aloe Tofu Surveillance Hydrogen sulfide Manicure Human skin color Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Japanese cuisine Sauna Aerial (dance move) Scabies Phoebe Buffay's songs Neighbours Kurt Cobain Ultraviolet Rice pudding Rice Solvent Dandruff Piccolo Junior Saga Microeconomics Milton H.
