is proactiv a pro active decision i would like to ask current proactiv users if this product actually does work wonders does it leave skin clear and smooth or will the harsh chemicals make the acne worse if proactiv isnt the right choice any suggestions for products that do work thanks a bunch wuv i ordered practiv about a month ago and used it right away it cleared me up but the bad part is if u dont follow the directions exactly it wont help at all and u'll just be wasting your time i figured that out the hard way but now i can go out in public w o makeup and it made my skin soft and smooth i think it really depends on your useage and skin type it may not work for you but its worth a shot Acne Bong Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Scar Stomach cancer Breast cancer Stage lighting Skin Unemployment Tofu Malignant melanoma Diving suit Leather Prostate cancer ALGOL 68 Expert system Fecal incontinence Drawing Microeconomics Drill bit Fume hood Plastic Energy development Jessica Simpson Dinosaur Atomic Kitten Windows XP Software agent Enceladus (moon) Gross domestic product Illegal drug trade Mattress Allergy Street Nutrition Chocolate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Digital photography Information Services Procurement Library Tattoo Textile manufacturing Puberty Aikido Strap-on dildo The Apprentice 2 Quadratic sieve Sweet potato Broadband Internet access Methamphetamine Hard water Human skin color Cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Nuclear reactor Manifold Waste management Asthma Wood Dog Moisturizer Intravenous therapy Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Forgiveness First Amendment to the United States Constitution Boom Town (Doctor Who) Blackjack Soft drink The End of the World (Doctor Who) Glossary of partner dance terms Implications of peak oil Softball Ozone depletion Biomechanics Incineration Downing Street memo Fast bowling Autonomic nervous system Isotretinoin Drag racing Trademark Fox hunting Social justice Beretta 92F/FS Renewable energy Unicode Battery (electricity) Pneumonia Vitamin D Bicycle helmet Wood carving Password Zhao Yun Counter-Strike Addiction Moon Eczema Pottery Jute
