using veet help please is it okay to use on the pubic area armpits how long does it take i was also wondering the razor like thing that they use to remove the cream do you have to use that to get it off or can you just rinse the cream off after its been sitting there if you have to use the razor like thing what does that do just take the cream off a certain way or what is it worth it the cost is it better than shaving why i bought veet to try and use it on my bikini area but after one try i just threw it away and shaved it really doesn't work the way they lead you to believe it's basically nair if you're wanting to use veet as an alternative to shaving down there because of ingrown hairs or razor burn you're experiencing i have a better solution i just recently found out first of all wait a few days for your hair to regrow back at least of an inch if you currently have any irritated areas rub cortizone cream on it even one of the generic kinds at walmart it works wonders even better than bikini zone or anything like that then when your hair is long enough get a new clean razor there are these pink disposable razors called daisy that have a nourishing strip and are surprisingly good and once your skin has been wet for awhile apply a really good conditioner all over the area you wish to shave you can also use a few drops of this shaving serum called shave secret that you can find next to the mens razors at walmart then shave as normal and apply a cooling shave gel afterwards like gillette cool affect wash it off and after you get out of the bath apply the cortisone cream all over and even a little baby oil if you want this will literally prevent any razor burn irritate hair follicles and feels sooo smooth you could use it on your legs too if you have a problem there but i'd much rather you spend money on good razors conditioner and some shave secret than veet good luck Shaving Pubic hair Psoriasis Hair Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Waxing Acne Shampoo Global Gillette Eczema Baldness Puberty Beard Sento Pseudofolliculitis barbae Dairy Haircut Fecal incontinence Baldness treatments Menstrual cup Knife Social rule Coffee Hyperthermia Occam's Razor Tarantula Genericized trademark 613 mitzvot Hard water Soap Scar Inflation Hypertrichosis Dishwasher Swimsuit Barber Textile manufacturing Sauna Manicure Keeshond Wound Bathing Urinary incontinence Hyperinflation Laser hair removal Androgen insensitivity syndrome Professional wrestling throws Skin Transformer Head shaving Scabies Tanning The Inside Callus Philosophy of science Nocturnal emission Wound healing phases Allergy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dialysis Common cold Swimming Drill bit Thermal power station Hypoglycemia Upholstery Fluoride therapy Certified Nursing Assistant Powerbomb Kodocha Brazilian waxing Hypothermia Pilonidal cyst Blood Simple Leather Tattoo Horse Water Ice cream Guinea pig Conjunctivitis Explosive material Battery (electricity) Hair color Joe Namath Piccolo Junior Saga First aid Jock itch Happy Tree Friends Dandruff
