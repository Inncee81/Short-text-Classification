getting my ears pierced i want to get them done but i play sports year around and i have about a week off then volleyball starts again i need a few questions answered how long do they have to stay in is there something i can put in there that isnt the actual earring when i play games or do i have to bandage them where is the best place to get them done at and cheap thanks new piercings have to stay in weeks to make sure they don't heal over if you take them out sooner you risk them growing back plus infection in essence you're dealing with open wounds if you have to take earrings out for sports you should wait until you have a summer break which you may not since you play year round a lot of people get their ears pierced at the mall i did it myself and won't do it again i recommend going to be piercing parlor tattoo parlor do them too usually they use needles instead of the piercing guns which i don't like at all they aren't as accurate the needle piercings i've gotten were much smoother and healed better if you get your cartiledge pierced definitely go to a piercing parlor i had my upper ear pierced with a gun and it took forever and many infections to heal good luck with your decision Body piercing Earring Tattoo Ear piercing instrument Swimming Wound Prostate cancer Play piercing Nipple piercing The Contender (television series) Dobermann Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Knife Massage Baseball Stars Navel piercing Team Fortress Classic Final Fantasy magic Game show Scarification Shotgun Keloid Steffi Graf Marathon (sport) Dialysis Four square Volleyball Archery Naruto jutsu Ra (board game) Blood donation $ale of the Century Sports timeline Barbell (piercing) Equine conformation Pools of Darkness New York Giants Sexually-transmitted infection Common cold Theory of conduct YuYu Hakusho Bikini Bottom Violin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diving Mary Pierce Zerg The Death Gate Cycle Comanche Andre Agassi Wild ARMs 2 Columbine High School massacre Twelve Swords of Power Betting (poker) Ear Traumatic brain injury AIDS reappraisal Intravenous therapy Bleeding Sydney Riot of 1879 University of Southern California Whitney Houston Franklin Pierce Wait Wait...
