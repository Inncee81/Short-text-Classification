if you smoke have you been finding rules and regulations going to far like who wants to go out any more even to a doctor or hospital and is it not time the smokers start getting their rights back my grandparents lived for old ages and they smoked every day and going out side is not enough you go to the hospitals for help and they send you blocks away to smoke enough is enough do you not think yes i do agree i do not smoke but my husband does i wish he would stop for health reasons yes but smokers have rights too it is a persons choice whether to smoke or not and it is not right for others to tell them they can not and when or where they can smoke just this week at my husbands workplace they took away their smoking privileges for days because some idiot threw his cig butts in the new mulch and not in the container he can not even smoke in his car in the parking lot they may even make this a permanent thing i think this is wrong i do not like the smell of coffee it makes me really sick but do i have the right to make others stop drinking it because i don't like it or because it makes me ill no and people who wear a whole bottle of perfume and go out in public this makes me have a terrible headache and nausea but do i have the right to make them stop no i could go on and on if they are going to pick on one thing then lets get them all we should not just single out the smokers and penalize them Tobacco smoking Smoking ban Health insurance Theory of conduct Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Cannabis (drug) Jackass: The Movie Common cold The Smoking Room Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Apprentice 2 Bong Cigar Sin City Breastfeeding Jennifer Lopez Green Day Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Stomach cancer Traumatic brain injury Pneumonia Traumatic incident reduction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tobacco advertising Arguments for and against drug prohibition Cancer of the larynx Jam (TV series) Prostate cancer Smoking pipe Friends One Piece minor characters Externality Foodborne illness Aerial (dance move) Multiple chemical sensitivity Mojave people Australian words Mental Health Act 1983 Microeconomics Migraine Beavis and Butt-head Pitaten Meat Loaf Hookah Ebola Myocardial infarction Office 1957 World Series Time Out of Mind Fasting Consensual crime Sauna Trailer Park Boys Fecal incontinence Hangover The Contender (television series) Word of Wisdom Wine Barbecue Epidemiology Joke Indianapolis 500 Utilitarianism About a Boy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mao (game) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Futurama (TV series - season 5) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Moe Szyslak Cigarette Smoking Man Baroque chess Anthony Burgess Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Waterworld Caffeine Publicly funded medicine 1,4-dichlorobenzene Smoking cessation Hyperthermia Brian May Center for Consumer Freedom Coffee Humphrey Bogart Hayer affidavits Cancer Oral contraceptive Le Malade imaginaire Monty Hall problem Sharon Tate Coming of age The Visitation Airplane!
