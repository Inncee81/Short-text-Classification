mycoplasma respiratory infection information i have a mycoplasmal respiratory infection so far for a week and still feel lousy and have inflammatory arthritis ouch how much longer will the fun persisit i can't take z pak or biaxin i have long qt syndrome so my doc could only prescribe omnicef anybody out there know when i'll feel human again any suggestions to speed up the process thanks ya'll hmmm a mycoplasma may not respond well to an antibiotic these germs are rather unique type of a bacteria which actually fall out of the strict definition of a bacteria including some fungal elements sometimes with spores so if all you are receiving is an antibiotic like omnicef then i'd say clearance of symptoms is going to take awhile on the other hand many mycoplasma infections are self limiting requiring little intervention the antibiotic is more prophylactic preventitive then anything else also you may have some underlying interstitial lung tissue component associated with the inflammatory arthritis but arthritic diseases are a bit out of my realm of knowledge still there is a connection between some arthritis diseases and interstitial lung problems the important part of this dx is if you have an atypical mycoplasma infection cultures and perhaps a bronchoscopy would be necessary to fully dx this maybe you already had a bronch and culture my guess is you are over and have some serious medical history if you are under then by all means you need to be followed by someone with medical skills to manage heart arthritis and other issues you are having prognosis good getting the arthritis inflammation controlled will go a long way to improving your well being the other is bothersome but usually not serious Rheumatoid arthritis Medicine Lung cancer Asthma Tuberculosis Psoriasis Anthrax Group A streptococcal infection Reiter's syndrome Mycoplasma Chronic fatigue syndrome Aspergillosis Chlamydophila pneumoniae Sexually-transmitted infection Arthritis Crohn's disease Ulcerative colitis Common cold Bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae Cancer Inflammation Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Autoimmune diseases Conjunctivitis Muscle Multiple sclerosis Cirrhosis Cystic fibrosis Meningitis Folic acid Pulmonary alveolus Antibiotic Lupus erythematosus Dermatology Acne Gonorrhoea Gout Immunosuppressive drug Streptococcus pneumoniae Abscess AIDS Nutrition Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Penicillin Traumatic brain injury Cardiovascular disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever Osteoarthritis Homeopathy Gastroesophageal reflux disease Blood Legionellosis Coeliac disease Medical analysis of circumcision Cellulitis Sepsis Hepatitis Hypoglycemia Cephalic disorder IgA nephropathy Bronchitis Allergy Inflammatory bowel disease Emphysema Diarrhea Immune system Traditional Chinese medicine Pelvic inflammatory disease Malaria Virus Bacterial pneumonia Pharyngitis Helicobacter pylori Rheumatic fever Parkinson's disease Diabetes mellitus Eczema Guillain-Barr__ syndrome Otitis externa Atherosclerosis Candidiasis Antiviral drug Upper respiratory tract infection Biological warfare Wegener's granulomatosis Aortic dissection Fancy rat Erysipelas Bone marrow transplant Mastoiditis
