throat swab i have been coughing a lot latley it's that kind of cough you get from congestion in the chest my throat isn't sore or anything and other than that i feel fine so do you think they'll have to do the throat swab i've never known of having to have a throat swab strep test without having a sore throat the dr will usually ask me if i have been exposed to strep and then offer me the strep test to be sure if your coughing is coming from the chest and not from a scratchy throat i don't think you have to worry about having a throat swab you can also let your dr know you would prefer not to have one unless he she feels it is absolutely necessary which i doubt they will push one on you under the circumstances best of luck hope you feel better soon Group A streptococcal infection Streptococcus Common cold Rheumatic fever Pneumonia Deep Throat (Watergate) Infectious mononucleosis Nasal congestion Philosophical skepticism Cocaine Pertussis Gastroesophageal reflux disease Breastfeeding Upper respiratory tract infection Transmission (medicine) Hay fever Urinary incontinence Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cytomegalovirus Drowning Treehouse of Horror IX Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma W.
