why is my chest popping sternum area i was in a car accident year ago it was pretty bad i t boned a mini van that pulled out in front of me i had a twisted vertebrae and strained muscles and ligiments in my back i also sustained air bag burns to arms and face my chest had a laseration across the middle due to the seatbelt it hurt then and was told that nothing showed up on the x rays now my chest has been popping for some time now what could this be you should go back to your doctor and let him or her know about this x rays taken at the time of your accident are not current there are a couple of things i would wonder about first it could be scar tissue which is less flexible and may be making this popping noise as fibers in it break second it is possible to have leakage of air from your lungs into the mediastinum the area in your chest that's kind of between your lungs that air can be trapped in the tissue and then 'pop' as it's pushed out by muscular action it also may be from some arthritic changes in your ribs from damage from the accident in any case your doctor can check it out and let you know for sure good luck Equine conformation Sternum Professional wrestling holds Lung Autopsy Tetrapod Drowning Scar Rib Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling throws Muscle Weight training Traumatic brain injury Tyrannosaurus rex Aortic dissection Asthma Lung cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma X-ray Internal oblique Fecal incontinence Myocardial infarction Pneumothorax Diving Vertebra Nuclear explosion Crash test dummy Professional wrestling attacks Optical fiber Peripheral nervous system Swimming Boxing The Empty Child Single bullet theory Myasthenia gravis Sin City Characters of Lost Electric shock Scoliosis Snake Duchenne muscular dystrophy Anatomy Piccolo Junior Saga Mesothelioma Chest Abdomen The Ashlee Simpson Show Radiation therapy Bone Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Action potential Butterfly stroke Menstrual cup The Shining (film) Spina bifida Lightning The Inside Sperm Whale Fast bowling Professional wrestling aerial techniques Medicine Ventricular fibrillation Link (Legend of Zelda) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Becker's muscular dystrophy Captain Thunderbolt Acne Asbestos Father's Day (Doctor Who) Dinosaur Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Larynx Swingout Car safety Tobacco smoking Humerus Metastasis Mediastinum The Contender (television series) Stephen King Mechanical ventilation Backbreaker Airbag Hip fracture Futurama (TV series - season 3) Breech birth Wound healing phases Gesture
