i have a curvy body and a big bum is it bad if i wear shorts im not going to show a picture sorry horndogs wow thanks for all the answers make sure to wear shorts that will cover your bottom generally if you want emphasis away from your bum try wearing bermuda shorts they will give more of an illusion of less shape by making a straight line down over your bottom and down a good portion of your legs don't wear clothing that is tight because that will probably put more emphasis on the parts you don't want emphasis on but don't wear really bulky boyish shorts either that'll look like you're covering up things edit i answered mostly from a fashion perspective but if you don't mind the opinions of others then wear what you want edit contrary to what the person below me thinks skinny girls look best in shorter shorts but it also depends on how long short your legs are i'm tall and uncurvy and bermudas tend to make me look even more like a pole if you wear really small shorts that don't at least give you full coverage in every position possible you'll just be uncomfortable if you want people to look at your underwear then that's fine and if you want to keep emphasis on your bottom wear short shorts i don't care Undergarment Strap-on dildo Equine conformation Corset Trousers Skirt and dress Buttocks Pantyhose Brassiere Theory of conduct Diving suit Social rule Tightlacing Social aspects of clothing Swimsuit Figure skating History of corsets Diving Aerial (dance move) Mattress Fecal incontinence Fast bowling Japanese tea ceremony Poker jargon American Psycho Punt (boat) The Emancipation of Mimi Jennifer Lopez Marching band Crinoline Glossary of American football Billiards Fielding (cricket) Philosophy of language Fashion A Course In Miracles Casualty lifting View camera Stocking Sauna Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Customs and etiquette of Japan Breaststroke Drill bit Sock Shoe Human height Stairway G-string 1957 World Series Surveillance Marilyn Monroe Discworld Skinhead The Ashlee Simpson Show Human Swimming The nature of God in Western theology Professional wrestling match types Kimono Textile manufacturing Shorts Gravity Dragon Booster Moral Politics Kilt Aikido Tai Chi Chuan Professional wrestling holds Speedo (suit style) Leggings Doug Noam Chomsky Beard Triathlon Dreadlocks Piccolo Junior Saga Philosophy Brewery GED American football strategy Professional wrestling throws Menstrual cup Billboard Hot 100 Softball Current teachings of Prem Rawat Infinity Stereoscopy Human nature Haircut Sail-plan Skiing Breeches Grunge music Shit Sydney Riot of 1879 Draw poker
