what hair color for my skin tone w pic i have been dying my hair a dark auburn color and it has really suited me but i just want a change naturally i have medium to dark brown hair i have a very warm skin tone some say it's olive so i usually look good in fall colors my eyes are green i recently dyed my hair a semi permanent super dark brown i thought it looked nice and people told me it looked nice but i think i could go with a better color to suit my features it's going to be hard to dye over the red i've heard i will probably be going into a salon to get it dyed but do you have any suggestions a brand and color that i could look up online would be nice so i could bring it in to the salon i am open to all colors but blonde i don't think blonde would look right at all thanks http www flickr com photos n saved we're about the same color hair everything except the eyes mine are gray that's definitely an olive tone and you're right about fall colors blonde didn't look right on me when i tried it and my hair was fried i also had burgundy hair and you can't dye over it well at all i would keep using the brown black from this point on it's lovely just the way it is the more you use it the more you'll find the red doesn't show as much Hair color Red hair Dragon Booster Blond Joker (comics) Race of Jesus Human skin color Physical attractiveness Melanin Hair coloring The Ashlee Simpson Show The Rasmus Blonde on Blonde W.I.T.C.H.
