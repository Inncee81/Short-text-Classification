business casual appropriate for tomorrow business casual tomorrow i'll be going to a hiring fair for employment in an amusment park somewhat like six flags it says to wear business casual so far as it will be really hot tomorrow i'm thinking a pink striped dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up navy dress pants or should i go with black flat black shoes i hate heels any other suggestions and i'm contemplating on the bag of choice as i am a student i think it would look more appropriate to blend in with the other mass of students to wear a backpack but i dunno therefore the question is please critique this choice of wardrobe and if it is suitable for business casual and please help me find some alternatives that will work better etc etc thanks your outfit sounds good and take a small purse rather than a backpack flat shoes are fine as long as they are not run down an alternative would be a wedge heel they are fairly comfortable also make sure your hair nails and makeup are neat and well groomed good luck Suit (clothes) Kimono Shoe Black tie Canadian Armed Forces Social aspects of clothing Cowboy Hasidic Judaism Marching band Bob Jones University Violin Heavy metal fashion Mess dress Beachwear High-heeled shoe Kilt Culture of the United States Softball Jesuit College Preparatory School Clown Rock (music) The Warriors Morning dress Starfleet ranks and insignia Clothing Mario Shirt Paul Is Dead Casual Eric Cartman The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe School uniform Sock DisneySpeak Jill Valentine Leggings Necktie Gothic Lolita Equine conformation Sento Grunge music Extreme Programming Academia Death rock fashion Billiards Sea Scouts (BSA) Customs and etiquette of Japan Undergarment Nakoruru (Samurai Shodown) Modern Western square dance Ada Wong Singapore Police Force Sheryl Crow The Smiths Reservoir Dogs Green Day Swimming pool Knitting Academic dress Taxicab Chun-Li Veruca Salt Johnny Appleseed Joker (comics) White-collar worker Skirt and dress Singlish Trailer Park Boys Horseshoe Punk fashion Billie Jean Knife Teen Girl Squad Black Flag (band) Apollo 11 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dress shirt Horse Unemployment Hamster Golf Nine Inch Nails Barbie The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Court dress Napoleon Dynamite Backpack Climbing equipment Spidey Super Stories Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Recess (TV series) Jeans Beavis and Butt-head Ed, Edd n Eddy Black
