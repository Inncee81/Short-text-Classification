hiding belly button piercing im having a family get together pool party and no one knows i have this piercing is there any way to hide it are the clear belly button rings or retainers good enough the easiest way out is to just say you feel sick to your stomach and don't feel like swimming then wear your regular clothes all day don't pretend too much or act too sick that they end up wanting to take you to the doctor or anything just make a little pouty face and hold your stomach once in awhile that should do the trick as for a clear one i'm sure someone would still notice just because it's clear doesn't mean it's invisible especially if sun gleams off it or something or you could use fyouimatwirp's suggestion and use the sterilized fishing line when my sister got hers pierced they told her not to take it out for any reason for at least months but if she really really had to take it out like for an xray or something to put a piece of fishing line through it somebody might notice though and that's going to look even weirder than if you just had the ring in lol in the water it would be invisible though so just stay in the water as much as possible and when you get out hold your arm or your towel over it then run to the bathroom to get changed saying you're cold or something if all else fails and they want to make you go swimming just hold your arm across your stomach or something one piece bathing suits might work but they might still see the little bump from the ring they might also get suspicious if you don't normally wear one pieces same goes for t shirts not white when wet it will be basically clear and they'll see it so pick blue or black or something you can just say you don't want to get sunburned but if you never normally wear shirts while swimming someone might get suspicious if at all possible just take it out right before you put on the bathing suit and then put it back in right away after you get out probably shouldn't try that if it's been less than two or three months but even then someone might notice the holes if they look close enough good luck ps they're gonna find out someday though it's kind of inevitable so start planning now what you're gonna say juuuust in case Aerial (dance move) Sento Drowning Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Diving suit Diving The Shining (film) Social rule Swimming pool Sauna Bathing My Life as a Teenage Robot Friends Swimsuit Combine (Half-Life 2) YuYu Hakusho Professional wrestling throws Earring Happy Tree Friends The Amber Spyglass Body piercing RuneScape quests Invisibility Shirt Social aspects of clothing Comanche Blood Simple Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Ring Treehouse of Horror XV Upholstery Computer virus One Piece minor characters Tag Baroque chess Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Theory of conduct Saruman Characters of Naruto 2000 Australian Grand Prix Mercury Atlas 6 Archery The Hobbit Knots Landing Menstrual cup Slow Train Coming Strap-on dildo Akatsuki (Naruto) Time Out of Mind Hyperthermia Jackass: The Movie Sharon Tate Professional wrestling holds Animal Crossing Nudism Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Shaggy dog story Mattress Chess strategy and tactics Characters in the Smurfs Professional wrestling match types Sea-Monkey Midnight Run Sheepshead Textile manufacturing Headgear Common cold Clothing Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Dragon Booster Towel Fecal incontinence Jon Secada Paul Is Dead Conspiracy (TNG episode) Characters of Lost The Ashlee Simpson Show Suplex Breaststroke Mario Suit (clothes) Team Fortress Classic Beachwear Clown EastEnders Frankie Laine James Hanratty Hamster
