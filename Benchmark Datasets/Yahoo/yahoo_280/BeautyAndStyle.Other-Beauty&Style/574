girls what do you think about guys shaving does the face always need to be cleanly shaved are there any areas you would like to see us shave armpits back down there legs were i grew up it was considered kinda gay to shave anything but the face but now there is metrosexuals and i'm wondering what the girls think and why after all i prefer girls to shave there legs i think its just cleaner and well sexy so what are the girls views for guys hmmm smooth face is nice though honestly a little scruff can be cute personally if there is some back hair going on that's probably the only one i personally feel should be taken care of and keep the chest amount at least tidy the rest is personal preference if a guy wants to or feels the need to go for it i'm not big on armpits even in movies etc ew but if a guy is mine then it's no biggie to me legs don't mind if they are natural down there well that's up to him if it needs to be manicured much Pubic hair Hair Friends Leg shaving Haircut Aerial (dance move) Kyle Broflovski Depilation Humphrey Bogart Cliff Richard Sexual attraction Professional wrestling throws Physical attractiveness Transsexuality Waxing Shaving Gender role Baldness Pat Boone Casualty lifting Tupac Shakur Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Social rule American Psycho Lenny Leonard Rod Stewart Metrosexual Guinea pig Late Night with Conan O'Brien Ron and Fez Social role of hair Transactional analysis Skinhead Razor Bish__jo game Marilyn Monroe W.I.T.C.H.
