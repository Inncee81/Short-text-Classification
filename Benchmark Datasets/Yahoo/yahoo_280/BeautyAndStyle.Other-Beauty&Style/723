how can i get a tan faster really well moisturised skin takes less time to tan and will take a tan far easier and more evenly so use loads of moisturiser for a few weeks in preparation for your holiday in the sun or whatever but trying to tan too fast by sitting out in the sun for long periods is very foolish there have been surveys which prove that two people who sunbathed for different times one long and one short ultimately ended up with the same depth of tan at the end of the three week trial but the person who had sat in the sun for long periods had burned peeled and generally been very uncomfortable whereas the person who sat in the sun for shorter periods had acquired their tan safely evenly and with no problems lastly the very fastest way to tan is air brushing or a fake tan Sunlight The End of the World (Doctor Who) Comanche Trajectory Sun tanning Diving suit Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Sunscreen Kepler's laws of planetary motion Tai Chi Chuan USS Alfred A.
