help i know this has nothing to do with beauty and style but i just thought a lot of ppl answer questions in this category lol okay so i joined the tennis team with my friends and everthting was great and now both of them cant do it anymore and i dont know what to do i dont really know anyone else but there is this one girl that was new to my school but she was friends w one of my friends and we met and shes nice so im not sure if shes gonna quit too or if shes gonna stay too any advice and i do like tennis well i joined the volleyball team and i didn't know anyone at all until the girls were talking to me and we became friends till then i think you should still stay in the team make a difference because if you quit the team because your friends didn't want to be in it anymore they'll think your more of a follower and think your not independent so just try to make talk with the other girls try talking to the other friend you met and ask if she'll stay on the team it really doesn't hurt to ask Ultra Maniac Atomic Kitten Avenue Q The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Yogiisms One Tree Hill (TV series) Kodocha The Inside Nico Robin Theory of conduct Little Britain Blood on the Tracks Pitaten EastEnders Volleyball Pok__mon Live!
