are there any exotic dancers here that can tell me about the job hi i am an ex dancer the first thing you want to do is find a good club one that is not into the extra curricular activities if you know what i mean talk to the dancers waitress and bartenders some clubs have open audition nights this is where you can go and try out dancing if the club likes you you then can get a job there second it takes money to make money meaning depending on the club you may be required to wear evening gowns in new york at scores we had to have some pretty fancy gowns at flashdancers it was not required scores is a lot classier club than flashdancers but flashdancers was still a clean legimate club under the gowns you will also have to have a costume it could consist of just a g string or it can be more elaborate once again it depends on the type of club that you are working in i have danced in topless clubs where you only had to wear latex on your nipples other clubs require pasties i have also danced nude so it really depends on the laws of your state and the club in which you work third dancing is hard everyone thinks that you just take your clothes off and get the money you have to be creative not only in your dance moves but also in your talking with customers believe it or not once you start getting regular customers these are customers that come to see you you will find out that they don't want to see you dance they really just want to spend time talking of course they are going to pay you for dances because they know that this is your job also physically dancing is hard on you think about it do you know anyone who goes to a gym and works out for to hours this is what you will be doing it is physically and mentally exhausting now i don't know if you are in a relationship or not if you are you need to really talk about it most guys that say they are okay with really are not the newness of it and the bragging rights saying my girlfriend is a stripper is what makes them say that they are okay with it but when you come home and you are exhausted and some butt hole kept grabbing you all night and all you want to do is take a hot shower and relax and all your boyfriend wants to do is have sex the problems start he will accuse you of all kinds of nasty things so be prepared if you are not in a relationship don't hook up with anyone at the club most clubs will fire you for doing this to begin with but even if they don't fire you you still don't want to be hooking up with a guy you met stripping it causes a bunch of drama and headaches trust me i know other than that the money is great don't get caught up in the drug scene just go in and do your job when your shift is over leave the job behind and go home make sure someone walks you to your car or cab you can get stalkers don't let anyone know where you live make up a fake name to dance by don't give out your phone number and don't ever do anything that you are not comfortable doing if the club or anyone else tells you have to do it walk out there are millions of clubs that you can work at its been about years since i have danced im now but i had a lot of fun made a lot of money blew a lot of money and made every mistake i am telling you not to make i started dancing in virginia then i worked in new york and flew back to virginia every other weekend i worked in pa fl ky nv and my favorite was the time i got contracted to go to alaska you can choose to remain in one club or work the circuit if you are just starting out stick to one club until you learn the ropes the circuit can be hell on you i wish you luck Social rule Aerial (dance move) George Costanza Friends Little Britain Striptease Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing About a Boy The Ashlee Simpson Show Sin City Gay bathhouse The Apprentice 2 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fancy Crane Avenue Q Professional wrestling match types Lindy Hop Great Teacher Onizuka Spidey Super Stories Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Pitaten Meat Loaf Janet Jackson The Amazing Race Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sex and the City Carnival Rain Man A Night in Heaven Beavis and Butt-head 2000 Australian Grand Prix Jennifer Lopez Marilyn Monroe Time Out of Mind The Emancipation of Mimi Strap-on dildo The Inside RuneScape quests Showgirls Crazy in Love Something Positive Opie and Anthony Ocean's Twelve 1957 World Series Late Night with Conan O'Brien Reservoir Dogs Society for Creative Anachronism The Amber Spyglass 24 Hours of Le Mans Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Extreme Programming One Tree Hill (TV series) Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
