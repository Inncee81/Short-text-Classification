sunless tanning lotion i have a fair skin tone and it's super hard for me to tan i almost always get burned and then it just fades back to pale i found some sunless tanning lotion stuff and have been using it for a while but it dosen't really do much also i think i bought it like or so years ago is t still good oh and the brand was neutregena or whatever and it was called control you shade i know some of those lotions work better then others so which ones give you the darkest brown not yellow tan neutregena is the best brand to use in my opinion the micromist spray is the least likely to show lines and it gives you an even bronze they have levels you can chose as to your skin tone exfoliate your skin before using it so it will last longer plus if you put a little lotion around your ankles knees elbows and dry areas it will help it look more natural spray then rub it in just a little wash your hands thoroughly after using so you don't have orange hands hope this helps Manicure Human skin color Acne Psoriasis Tattoo Leather Sunlight Dragon Booster Laser hair removal Tanning Soap Scabies Aloe Color theory Professional wrestling aerial techniques Bacon Upholstery Sunscreen Pubic hair Hand washing Pepper spray Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling holds Stomach cancer Horse Ultraviolet Eczema Champagne (beverage) Sunburn Urinary incontinence Drawing Volleyball Leopard Geology of the Grand Canyon area Advertising Minor Harry Potter Beasts New York Jets Tobacco Casting M&M's Massage Pottery Cleveland Browns German Shepherd Dog Doom enemies Diving suit Happy Tree Friends Breastfeeding Urticaria Mummy Professional wrestling attacks Sun tanning Osteoarthritis Cigar Mixed martial arts Equine conformation Textile manufacturing Potato Blood (computer game) Shaving Decompression sickness Fecal incontinence Jute Peat Neighbours Color Professional wrestling throws Blond Suplex Collectibles in Bionicle Hair color Koopa Troopa Physical attractiveness Darken Rahl Wolfrider Nile crocodile Diamond enhancement Wound Hair Vegeta Bedbug Breaststroke Hand grenade Vitiligo Tai Chi Chuan Corticosteroid Swimming Craps Wang Chongyang Skin Zinc Pentagram Smoke-screen StarCraft: Uprising Huangshan Mountains Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pump It Up
