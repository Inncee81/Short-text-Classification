what's an appropriate outfit for a wedding i'm going an evening wedding next month and was wondering what's a good outfit for a teenager to wear and if yall could post links too that would be great something sophisticated and not showing too much cleavage or leg perhaps a nice skirt and heels with a cute blouse with some nice jewelry you can wear a dress if it is a nice classy one that is not too short there's a pretty big range or what you can wear even pants just as long as you are pretty formal and comfortable remember its always better to be overdressed than underdressed my opinion anyway just as long as you feel good about what you're wearing and think you will be comfortable standing next to say someone from the wedding party in a full length strapless dress try dillards for a dress they were having some real good sales last time i was there they had some beautiful betsey johnson dresses for under you can also try tj maxx they have cute dresses there for under good luck to you Skirt and dress Suit (clothes) Kimono Undergarment Black tie Clothing Gothic Lolita Debra Marshall Evening gown Pantyhose Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Strap-on dildo Japanese tea ceremony Cowboy My Life as a Teenage Robot Trousers Urusei Yatsura Okashina Okashi Frock Kylie Minogue Kilt Go-Go boots Social aspects of clothing Hulk Hogan Culture of the United States Brassiere Shirt Marilyn Monroe Britney Spears Barbie Roxette Hakama Mariachi The Maxx Belly dance Crinoline Casual Canadian Armed Forces Paul Is Dead Mess dress Totally Spies!
