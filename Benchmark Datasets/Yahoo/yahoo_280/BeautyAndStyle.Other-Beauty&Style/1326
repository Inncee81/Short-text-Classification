should i buy these ok so i just saw a pair of really pretty contact lenses at the eye office today and they were light pacific blue with yellow in them i was wondering should i have bought them they were only they are soooooo pretty i wonder if i should go back and get them what do you think it is entirely up to you keep in mind that those contacts that you like sooo much are that is waay too much to spend on contacts you could go somewhere else and buy colored contacts for a lot less than that i wear prescription contacts and it is per box it is monthly and it will cost me even more if i decide to get colored whatever eye color you have keep it there's no doubt in my mind that you have pretty eyes so keep them Sunglasses Glasses Contact lens Iris (anatomy) Eyeglass prescription Eye color Stereoscopy RGB color model Dragon Booster Totally Spies!
