what to do about nails which are damanged from artifical nails how to get them healthy i have been using artifical nails because mine look so bad really tired of having to buy them and worry about them coming off please tell me a product that really helps i am unsure if you are just buying the fake nails at a beauty supply store or if you are getting them done at a salon if you do them yourself in order to remove them you have to soak them in acetone nailpolish remover that says it will take off fake nails then with an oragne stick gently push them off your real nail if you got them done at a salon you can do the same thing but i would suggest going back to have them removed take a few tylenol as it hurts when they break the acrylic off your natural nail when i had acrylics i kept my nails painted for the first couple of months because they looked really nasty just rough and discolored then after a month of so i just kept my nails short the natural nail is now brittle from the use of fake nails and buffed them once every few weeks take a good vitamin and get plenty of calcium and in a few months your natural nails will grow out and should be ok once the damaged nail has grown out you can re grow your nails to a natural length if you keep a good coat of clear polish on them it will help them from breaking best of luck Manicure Nail (anatomy) Acetone Textile manufacturing Plastic Breastfeeding Nine Inch Nails Leather Horseshoe Tire Knife Milk Drill bit Humphrey Bogart 2000 Australian Grand Prix Lacquer Tooth enamel Pedicure Gesso 1957 World Series Tattoo Trish Stratus Organic food Piccolo Junior Saga Shroud of Turin Rice Soy milk Guinea pig Carpal tunnel syndrome Psoriasis NWo Domestic rabbit Nutrition Theory of conduct Marilyn Monroe Jam (TV series) Bone fracture Wound Deflation (economics) Prostate cancer Chicken Joy Electric Polymethyl methacrylate Apple Shaggy dog story Mattress Stomach cancer Ocean's Twelve Second Battle of the Atlantic Neighbours Tooth Heinkel He 112 Vitamin Green Day Casting Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Iron EastEnders The Passion of the Christ Solvent RuneScape skills Fake etymology Tofu Karl Rove Fractal Vlad III Dracula The Young Ones (TV series) Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Kitsch Vitamin D Jennifer Lopez Clown Bong Coeliac disease Fast bowling USS Vestal (AR-4) Meat Loaf Calcium Blood (computer game) Tocopherol Upholstery Nail (engineering) Woodworking Paul Levesque Hurt (song) The Rutles Tenshinhan Milton H.
