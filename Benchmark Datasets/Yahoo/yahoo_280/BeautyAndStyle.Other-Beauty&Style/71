why do woman have to choose whether or not to wear make up my husband says there is no one telling him he should wear mak up no one is convncing him to he does not see it as a choice fom himself at all it is not even a thought in his mind on the other hand i quit wearing it about a year ago but i still feel like i have to wear it sometimes job interviews for example i also cut my hair short and stopped wearing dresses skirts this was a very painful transition and still is i feel like a stranger in my own body a straight woman rejecting beauty for herself not easy one woman told me that i should just be a lesbian a man told me he felt sorry for my husband when i cut my hair the choice to stop wearing make up has definetly been one of the hardest things i have ever done sick huh even more sick though was wearing it i was never really doing it for me even though i tried to convinve myself i was i told myself that it made me feel good but what i wanted more than anything was just to feel good without it like a man my husband is not my concern my concern is why is it only a choice for females im saying that it is sexist and that is why i do buy into false feminine ways ie make up highheels dresses correction do not buy into why does july get it but the rest of you do not society the media everywhere we look women are told that they have to do so many things to look beautiful this culture has convinced women that they are not attractive enough they have to wear makeup be rail thin but have great curves hold down a full time job take care of the family chores raise the babies but not lose their figures being pregnant and be ready for sex anytime a man wants it the worst part is most of us have fallen for it so we spend millions of dollars on makeup and make ourselves miserable trying to be someone else's image of the perfect woman if your husband is happy it is because he appreciates your inner beauty which he sees every time he looks at you be yourself and having made the choice don't give respect to anyone by letting them hurt your feelings and definitely stay away from those people who say ugly things life is too short to spend it with bad people Gender role Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Friends Marilyn Monroe Social rule Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Abortion debate Skirt and dress Sin City Gender-neutral language Sexual orientation Domestic violence Kodocha Pitaten Clothing Avenue Q Transgender One Tree Hill (TV series) Joke Beavis and Butt-head The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex The Apprentice 2 The Catcher in the Rye Transsexuality Humphrey Bogart Hijab Woman Shaggy dog story Theodicy Strap-on dildo Women in Islam Infantilism Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Jon Secada Tightlacing Jam (TV series) Gay slang Human sexual behavior Cross-dressing Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Hair Rais massacre Aesthetic Realism The Inside Kimi Finster Goodness and value theory Poker jargon Characters in the Smurfs Economic inequality God and gender Everwood The Ashlee Simpson Show George Costanza Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Spidey Super Stories Fast bowling Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Socrates Aristasia Boston Public American Psycho Le Malade imaginaire Utilitarianism W.I.T.C.H.
