any advice on how to make more friends sometimes alittle too outgoing so people dont like me any advice on how to mellow down okay so just so you know i'm crazy not like insane but super outgoing and just kinda out there and i started to realize that maybe i should be quieter to get more friends but i learned that the people who matter are the ones that liked how i really was being loud and outgoing might make some people look down on you but on the other hand it attracts more vivid personalities so you may not have a bajillion friends but they'll all be amazing and important to your life One Tree Hill (TV series) Squidward Tentacles Sleeping Murder Kim Possible Green Goblin Pepper Ann Past teachings of Prem Rawat Friends Governor-General of Australia Charmed Social rule About a Boy Rich Mullins The Giver Luke Skywalker Jack Kerouac Love W.I.T.C.H.
