what should i wear for clubbing hi i am years old and i am going to go to a club the last time i went all the girls were dressed in really short skirts i wore a dress just above my knee's which i thought was short enough but once i got there i thought i looked like a nun so i was wondering what everyone thinks i should wear i don't want to look tarty thankyou lol the birthday suit thing made me laugh what so you think i should dress like the other girls here's some style advice if you obt for a skin baring daring top then cover up the bottom half so wear jeans with like a really hot top however if you choose to wear a tight short skirt then wear a less daring revealing top always remember to balance it out because if you wear top and bottom thats way too revealing you will ldefinitely ook easy and slutty which is not good because then you won't give the right impression unless that is the impression you want to give but i highly doubt that but if you wear a top and bottom thats too covered up you willl look like a nun and prudish and no one will approach you because they'll probably think you will want to lecture them on drinking and drugs and religion most importantly have fun and stay confident and be careful no one sometimes mean girls and not just guys put date rape in drinks just really be careful no one puts anything in your drinks like speed or date rape drugs always keep an eye on your drinks and if you have the slightest suspicion don't drink it Trousers Paul Is Dead Avenue Q Marilyn Monroe Social rule Undergarment Diving suit Humphrey Bogart Sauna Customs and etiquette of Japan Nudity Japanese tea ceremony Pitaten Donovan The Marshall Mathers LP Faustyna Kowalska Prince Edmund (Blackadder) 1957 World Series The Emancipation of Mimi Jon Secada Jennifer Lopez Sin City Hijab The Critic Piccolo Junior Saga Negima Leo Frank EastEnders Gwen Stefani History of corsets Social aspects of clothing The Apprentice 2 Alcoholics Anonymous Friends Suit (clothes) Spidey Super Stories Sinfest Aerial (dance move) Pantyhose Hall & Oates Girls Aloud Dragon Booster Roxette Cliff Richard Charmed Bicycle Skinhead The Smoking Room Shorts Trailer Park Boys The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Theory of conduct Good Morning, Vietnam The Ashlee Simpson Show Fancy Crane Satchel Paige Whose Line Is It Anyway?
