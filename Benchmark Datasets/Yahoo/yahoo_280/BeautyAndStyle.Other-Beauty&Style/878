i want to pamper and beautify myself i would like to have a day of pampering and beauty tommorrow i go back to high school next week do you have any suggestions for beauty treatments procedures i'm going to have a few girlfriends over so what can we do on our day of relaxation pampering and beauty thanks so much pair up and give each other a pedicure and manicure do several coats so it looks nice and clean for a while straighten each others hair and make it really smooth and shiny i like having others do my hair because i can't see the back of my head so its harder to know what i am doing pluck eyebrows and give a defined arch remember not to make it too thin use lots of lotion soft skin is really attractive and says to people 'i respect myself and i want to be friends with you' expirement with make up styles for school that are easy to do tell everyone to bring clothes they don't want to wear or don't have anything to wear with trade around your clothes so you get new to you atleast stuff and have ideas for outfits take your hair and look at it closely cut off cut ends go strand by strand don't attempt to cut it yourself just snip away at the specfic hairs if you have a lot of split ends that means you need to get it done but usually my hair looks much better after cutting off some of my split ends use a hair mask they feel soooo good and leave your hair really nice if you have tanlines buy a self tanner an cover up the lines use your friends for your back remember to return the favor wear plastic gloves while doing it so you don't get 'self tanner hands' make facials here are some ideas this isn't homemade but if you are looking for something to store is cheaper than ingredients for a homemade mask and is very nice look into the freeman line called 'feeling beauitful' it comes in a gree blue bottle with either a picture of papaya or cucumbers you can get a clay mask or a peel off mask i love them it costs but for the peel off masks you get over and i don't know about the clay mask since i have not used it that much definately look into those for homemade stuff honey mask recipe the best facial mask is honey place a cloth in warm water and apply to your face to open the pores smear on honey and leave on for to minutes rinse off with warm water then use cold water to close the pores use once a week miracle whip exfoliator yes i am talking about the same miracle whip your aunt mable uses in her macaroni salad apparently women all over the us are using this salad dressing ingredient on their faces to remove dead flaky skin i have not tried it myself but supposedly kraft miracle whip exfoliating facial makes an amazing treatment for normalizing over oily skin here is how you apply this miracle cream make sure all your hair is pulled back from your face apply a thin layer of the kmw all over your face up to the eyelashes and make sure to also put some on your neck the fumes from the vinegar may bother you so walk around the house to try to escape them lol leave on for minutes then massage gently the dead skin cells on your face will roll off in rubbery little balls rinse your skin with tepid water then cleanse as usual following your regular beauty regime if you apply the kmw every day in weeks your skin should be completely renewed i cannot help but wonder if this miracle whip eats away at the dead skin cells on your face what does it do to the inside of the body when someone eats it pretty scary one person believes that the vinegar in the miracle whip is what causes the exfoliation and rejuvenation if that is true why not try a mixture of organic apple cider vinegar with some olive oil apply that and see what happens one could whip together the olive oil and apple cider vinegar apply it to their face and then use the leftovers on their salad i think i will start experimenting with some ingredients and try to come up with a facial recipe to rival the kraft miracle whip special note from lucie site owner after reading victoria's email about the miracle whip beauty trick the above is an excerpt from that email i bought a small jar of miracle whip i applied a slighter thicker layer than was recommended and the vinegar smell was unpleasantly strong after a minute or two the miracle whip 'melted' and my face was very shiny and oily yuck after minutes i washed the whip away and i couldn't believe the results all the flaky dry skin was gone and my skin felt tight and smooth very strange avocado facial recipe avocado is a naturally rich moisturizer mash the meat of the avocado into a creamy texture massage into the face and neck leave on for minutes and gently rinse off facial mask recipe squeeze half a lemon and mix the juice with one beaten egg white leave on your face overnight or for a quick pick me up just minutes splash warm water on your face to rinse it helps to removes blotches because the lemon works as a bleaching agent egg honey mask recipe mix together tablespoon honey egg yolk teaspoon almond oil and tablespoon yogurt honey stimulates and smoothes egg and almond oil penetrate and moisturize and yogurt refines and tightens pores egg avocado mud facial mask recipe clay is available in powder form at any health food store mix tablespoon dry clay with egg yolk of a mashed avocado and enough witch hazel to create a smooth mixture mud dries excess sebum while the egg yolk and avocado replenish lost moisture witch hazel tones facial exfoliater recipe heaped tsp fine oatmeal tsp baking soda combine ingredients and add enough water to make a paste apply to skin and rub gently rinse and gently pat dry grape cleanser recipe grape juice makes an excellent cleanser for any skin type simply split one or two large grapes remove pips and rub the flesh over face and neck rinse off with cool water oily skin mask recipe mix tsp brewer s yeast with enough natural yogurt to make a thin mixture pat this thoroughly into all the oily areas and allow it to dry on the skin after minutes rinse off with warm water then cool water and blot dry now stuff to do on your own involves a shower therefore more of a 'solo' acticivity shave your legs or use a diplatory product ie nair veet use an exfoliating scrub all over your body scrub hard on your lower legs because lots of dead skin tends to be there don't srub your breasts that just hurts wash it with a wash cloth though gently because you can get zits on your breasts use a conditioner and leave it in finish washing get out of the shower and massage yourself listen to music exfoliate your feet etc get back in the shower after a little bit minutes the longer the more shiny and soft it will be and wash out the conditioner with cold water i like using powder and lotion after i shower i find it relaxing and makes me smell good but not overpowering have fun Carbon dioxide Barbecue Wood Leaf Cider Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ketchup 613 mitzvot Mattress Bengali cuisine Milk Clothing Idli
