yr old won't clean her room lol okay my daughter is usually very helpful and picks up her room usually yesterday and today she is being very naughty yesterday she had dumped all of her toys out in her room so before going to the movies i made her clean them all up i e just tossing them in various toy bins not hard she got mad at me and dumped all of her books in the floor afterwards so we missed the movies i tried offering her a reward and praising her when she did pick them up but she didn't respond to either then it was bedtime so this morning i explained to her that she had until lunch to pick them up or i would put them in a bag and take them away for a week set the timer and left the room she still didn't pick them up so i went in and bagged them she cried right at that moment the ice cream truck went by and she asked to get one i told her no because she didn't help with her room and that if she finished cleaing the rest of it i'd take her later to buy and before it happens i'll tell you straight up that i don't spank and don't believe in it and don't want this to turn into a debate about spanking even children who are spanked get naughty now and again any other suggestions advice lmbo she just came in here and took me by the hand to show me her now clean room she even thanked me for taking her toys she said it made me mad but it was too many to clean up lol but she did clean up the others that were in the floor that i didn't take i have children and though they may try me at times it is short lived ive never really had them not do what i asked thm to do when it comes to cleaning etc you said youre not a spanker so i think that you are doing right by taking the toyz away for a while all i can say is when u pick the punishment stick with it keep the toyz away for a week as you said crying will not hurt her but in the long run disobeyin her parents will good luck she sounds like she is just testing the waters a little bit to see if she can get her way at least you are not givin in to her and is standing your ground Spanking Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mad Money Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Dog training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Apprentice 2 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Catcher in the Rye New York Giants Silent Night, Deadly Night Kodocha Humphrey Bogart The Contender (television series) Customs and etiquette of Japan Dogville The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe RuneScape quests Social rule Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Erotic spanking Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Toilet humour Sydney Riot of 1879 History of Test cricket (to 1883) Ron Weasley Poker jargon History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) EastEnders Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Jam (TV series) Reservoir Dogs Teen Girl Squad The Inside Blood on the Tracks The Penultimate Peril Piccolo Junior Saga Rose (Doctor Who) Codename: Kids Next Door Escape from New York Brian Close Muslim ibn Aqeel Tenshinhan The Cure Missouri Compromise Ben Johnson (athlete) Good Morning, Vietnam Little Britain Aerial (dance move) My Parents are Aliens Miss Saigon Columbine High School massacre Singlish Blonde on Blonde Santa Claus Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Jackass: The Movie Milton H.
