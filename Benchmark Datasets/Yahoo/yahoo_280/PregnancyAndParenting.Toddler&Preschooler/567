ok so my fiance and i saw a picture of my stepsons biological mom holding an ak and she look a little crazy she has been out of the pic since may and she just came back on august stepsons th bday but that was also the last day we have heard from her since to soon to tell if she is gonna stay around well she also told my fiance that she has been drinking a fifth of tequila a nite and has been doing other things but wouldn't specify what we were wondering is would this be enough evidence to get all her righs taken away we dont' want to but she is only hurting him moree than helping him we have the pic i wouldn't be discussing any of this around the kid s if you are really concerned about the child's safety i would apply to family court for custody and guardianship then it's up to her to respond to your filing and she would have to prove she isn't up to the things you're claiming see if you can get anyone to write a letter to the courts that would back your story up but do not falsify anything or it'll come back and bite you in the butt good luck 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Terri Schiavo Plame affair Hey Jude Charmed Married... with Children Pok__mon Live!
