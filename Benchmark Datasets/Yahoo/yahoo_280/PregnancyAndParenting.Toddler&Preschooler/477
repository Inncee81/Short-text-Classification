single mom with little boy need advice my son is two months away from his th birthday he sees his dad on the weekend sometimes for the day and sometimes overnight the issue right now is that if a man ie his dad uncle grampa asks him to do something he does it if i ask him he fights and throws himself on the floor or runs away i literally feel like i have i have no control i have read and used the theory of magic for discipline advice and had fairly good results but being in his room he throws things and breaks thing and i do not want to do time out any other suggestions on dealing with this one pick your battles carefully your son is learning to think and prioritize for himself and he may have a different set of priorities than you do he is comfortable and trusting enough with you to say no without fear that you will whack him so when he does say no think carefully about what you have asked him to do and whether or not it s worth the effort and let him have his say on the unimportant battles when you do let him have his way tell him he s right or tell him he s wrong but it s not worth fighting about teaching children they can have opinions even if it runs counter to popular opinion and authority is not a bad thing two don t get mad at him when he says no smile at him and be his friend maybe even laugh if the task at hand is important enough buddy up to him and inspire him to do it come on you can do it gently very gently with an arm over his shoulders lead him to what he needs to do keep smiling true leadership inspires without fear three a lot of different techniques can accomplish what you want with your son but it s important you pick one and stick with it four remember that your son is learning a lot from you and not always what you think you re teaching him so you may think you re teaching him to brush his teeth pick up his room get ready for bed etc and in fact he s also learning how you get other people to do things so if you opt to whack him guess what he s learning if you choose to bully and belittle him guess what he s learning and if you choose to gently lead and inspire guess what he s learning none of this is easy and i don t suggest that what i advocate is a cake walk but then raising our children is the hardest most important and most rewarding thing we can do Theory of conduct Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Spanking The Adventures of Pete & Pete Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Fairly OddParents Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Little Britain About a Boy Calvin and Hobbes Dog training Avenue Q Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
