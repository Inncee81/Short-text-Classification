i don't want to breastfeed forever my son will be one year in about three weeks and i am not sure how to go about weening him it took him and i about three months to get nursing down and now i am not sure how to go about stopping everyone else i've talked to said that their children weened themselves but i find that he is a bit addicted to the breast and i really just do it out of habit he is drinking out of a sippy cup and he will take a bottle when he has a babysitter but i am planning on going back to work and feel a year of nursing is enough i do love breastfeeding and will be a little sad when we won't have that time together but practically speaking it can't go on forever i've heard the longer you wait the harder it is can someone please give me some tips i am willing to go gradually but not willing to nurse until he is thanks in advance i knew i came to the right place for answers just to rest some concerns he is eating solids throughout the day and we have cut our feedings to about what they were it really is the night time and naptime that is the problem and how do i ease engorgement lettuce leaves your ideas so far are great and i will start on many of them in a few weeks probably not cold turkey though really for my own selfishness and not his not ready to cut the apron strings completely lol thanks again holy sh t i knew i would get a breastfeeding freak sooner or later lithiam seriously i never said that my son was addicted to breastmilk only that he is addicted to the breast just as a figure of speech since he doesn't always need feeding just comfort i understand the complete benefits of breastmilk but i don't think that my child should be able to lift up my shirt saying 'booby mommy' if i had asked this question when he was you would probably be b tching that i should wait til he's or or hell let's wean him when he's in gradeschool get a grip i'm a pro nursing mother who just had a simple question i'm not on here to be lectured by some breastfeeding nazi the longer you go the harder it will be i know this one there is no doubt about it if he will take a bottle and a sippy cup then give him these instead it probably will not be as hard as most are that wait longer and have breastfed without a bottle or sippy cup just tell him he has to take the bottle and cup when he disputes it take him and hold him similar to the way you do when you breatfeed and give him the bottle or cup babies should be broken from the bottle as well at one year so try to stick with the sippy cup as much as possible stay consistant with it even if he cries or it will set the process back majorly i had a hard time taking the bottle away i told them that the dog got it and took it away the hardest was nap time and bed time good luck and god bless also get a back brace that is all cloth that you can wrap around your breasts this will help them not be so sore and not leak milk only take it off during your shower make it as tight as possible this is what i had to do and within a few weeks they were not sore a bit Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fertility awareness Social rule Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Baby bottle The Amber Spyglass Futurama (TV series - season 5) Little Britain Childbirth EastEnders Milton H.
