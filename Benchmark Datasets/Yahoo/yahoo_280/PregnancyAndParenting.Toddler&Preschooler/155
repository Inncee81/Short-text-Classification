i don't know what to do i'm and every week from pm on friday until am on saturday i babysit this crazy child he just turned five he has no sibilings or anything and gets his way all the time i think he may have autism or adhd or something but there is no way of telling until he is in school his mom is really nice but she doesn't believe in time outs or anything i don't exactly know what to do i want to keep the job but everything i've tried fails he runs around screaming he cried when he couldn't get his shoe on then cried when his mom helped him he punches and kicks people and kicks people for no reason also he will never go to sleep i need help thanks everybody i know you are all right about this the thing is the mom is really nice and i feel sorry for her because she is a single parent doesn't have enough money to afford a real day care service and has to work all the time also even if she did have enough money for one she lives no where near one thanks for your advice though this is what i would do i have been babysitting for a really long time and never really had a problem with the kids what you can do is plan crafts and stuff for you two to do together because his mom is single and he doesnt have his dad around he is probably wanting attention so you can buy construction paper glue glitter scissors etc anything that you think a year old would like it really isnt that expensive it will probably cost like dollars max then when you get there tell him you have a surprise and if he is good he will get to see what it is kids around his age love to do projects i babysit for a six year old and a four year old and i always find stuff i can make for them for example you can do projects centered around the holidays or make things that he can give to his mom like puppets out of lunch paper bags or animals out of paper plates it will keep him occuppied and happy another thing that kids love doing is building forts this is sooooooooo easy all you need is kitchen chairs and a blanket then pop in a movie make some popcorn and chill when he goes crazy on you and kicks and screams take a deep breath and just relax tell him you cant help him if he is acting crazy ask him to use his words so that you can solve the problem dont let him see that you are getting frustrated because he will feed off of that i have had trouble getting kids to bed and this is probably one of the hardest things a babysitter has to do because will come up with the most randomest things so they wont have to sleep you have to think of everything ahead of time before he goes to bed make sure he has went to the bathroom brushed his teeth has water by his bed then you can read him a book and sit with him for a while only if he closes his eyes and tries to sleep but if he starts playing around that you are going to leave another thing that you can do is play a lot with him during the day so when it is time for bed he is super tired Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents EastEnders Calvin and Hobbes Avenue Q About a Boy Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Tag The Marshall Mathers LP Garfield The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Theory of conduct The Inside Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kurt Cobain Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Grandview, U.S.A.
