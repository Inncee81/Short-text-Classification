tantrum question for toddler months old ok so it goes you'd think i'd have this down by now seeing she is my rd but boy oh boy is she feisty and demanding she's even more strong willed than my other two were at this age i feel like i've met my match my little twin she was born on my birthday march th my dad told me when i was her age i used to hold my breath and turn blue when i would get mad last night she woke me up and decided she wanted to go into the living room at am i said no go back to sleep she threw the biggest tantrum for min do you think putting her in her crib when she throws a tantrum during the day is ok or will she then associate her crib with discipline she's too little to stay in time out anywhere else she sleeps with me at night because she's still nursing so she'll be sleeping with me until we're done with that how do i deal with her tantrums and how if possible can i avoid them the issue here is not nursing and that is a choice that i have made it worked fine for my other two and they both sleep fine in their own beds i know she doesn't need to nurse at night i'm asking about the tantrums not if i should still be nursing my daughter and when thx my husband used to hold his breathe and turn blue too when he was little our son just turned months and he's a fiesty little kid too you can use the crib but run the risk of associating it with tantrums i'm sure its hard enough to get her to sleep in it since she's used to sleeping with you its great that your still nursing but shouldn't she be sleeping through the night without waking for food my son wouldn't sleep through til we moved into his own room and crib as far as the tantrums go we have a playpen we use for those moments when our son needs to be seperated from the issue it's more for me than him though so i can let him scream and know he's safe and i can go into a another room so i don't have a tantrum too most times he responds well to just removing him from the situation distraction with something he is able to do don't respond until she is calm i've discovered that he tends to fuss more if i respond to him also try not to let things go one day and then say no to it the next with time she'll learn whats expected and whats not sometimes though we just need to think about that our kids are people too haven't you ever woke up at night and not be able to sleep or haven't you wanted to eat chips and cookies instead of your veggies i'm not saying to just let her do what she wants just remember that kids have their own needs ands wants and sometimes they don't jive with ours Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Teen Girl Squad The Shining (film) EastEnders Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Sin City Friends Breath of Fire III Avenue Q The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Theory of conduct The Big Sleep Social rule Humphrey Bogart Miss Saigon The Death Gate Cycle 50 First Dates 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Amber Spyglass House of M The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Urinary incontinence Vegeta Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Autism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Little Britain Babe Ruth Big Brother UK series 6 W.I.T.C.H.
