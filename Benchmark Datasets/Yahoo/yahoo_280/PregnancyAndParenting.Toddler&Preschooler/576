generic brands what baby or toddler product would you never buy a generic brand of i use coupons so i have never had to buy store or generic brand diapers or wipes but i have nothing against it i nursed all three of my son's and i have never bought formula in my life if i didn't nurse my son's i would never buy store or generic brand formula i can't think of any baby or toddler product that i would never buy the generic or store brand other than formula i am good at saving money i can't think of one time that i didn't buy diapers on sale with a coupon or both i am fortunate that i have never had to buy generic brands for diapers or wipes if i didn't have a coupon then i bought luvs which i think is the cheapest don't get so offended about the formula if you read my question you see that i breastfed so i never had to buy formula name brand store or generic brand my son's are nine six and two and a half so this question does not really apply to me i was just interested in mother's opinions on this matter i used parent's choice formula and diapers with my son the only problem i found with the diapers was that they are short through compared to pampers or huggies i used zeller's store brand diapers and didn't like them at all i buy him store brand clothing if i like the look of it i won't buy generic wipes from anywhere i bought dollar store wipes before my son was born and the only thing there are close to good for is my hubby wiping his hands after using modeling clay i would never use them on our son's butt it is too cute to do that to i don't particulatly like the wal mart store brand toys they break too easily one thing i have to say about store brand formula is that all formula's have to pass quality inspection so there are not lacking nutrition in any way i realize that you breastfed and are not mentioning it to push breastfeeding on other's i just wanted to say that so that other parents using store brands for formula or diapers or whatever don't feel bad about it my son will be in the fall he has always been above the th percentile for height and weight for his age and aside from asthma caused from our last house he is healthy as a horse and strong as an ox no word of a lie Breastfeeding Kimberly-Clark Corporation Infantilism Procter & Gamble Childbirth Wal-Mart Infant Diaper Inflation Nestl__ The Apprentice 2 Charles Ponzi Genericized trademark Knots Landing Human height Rugrats Alcoholic beverage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Advertising Abortion debate Spanking Urinary incontinence Microeconomics Characters in the Smurfs Electronic commerce Commodore International Atkins Nutritional Approach Fertility awareness One Tree Hill (TV series) Gross domestic product PlayStation 2 Infant formula Bulk vending Pitaten Humphrey Bogart Adoption Milton H.
