how do i get these crazy kids to sit still i take care of my cousins during the day they are ages and i am having problems getting them to sit still and listen to me while i try to get them ready for school ie teaching them shapes and letters i don't have any kids so i've never had to figure this out before any suggestions would be greatly appreciated trying to sit them down and hush up while you teach them isn't going to work try to incorporate learning throughout the day take a walk or give them rides in a wagon point out the blue sky the white clouds the green leaves and the circular wheels of the wagon as well as the big red rectangle they're sitting in count out goldfish to each ask the year old to give the year old more goldfish draw shapes and letters in the sand or point them out on signs there are multiple learning opportunities everywhere exploit them kids that age don't learn very well when constantly being scolded to sit still good luck Into the West (miniseries) Frankie Laine The Catcher in the Rye Humphrey Bogart Paramount Pictures The Strangerhood The Amber Spyglass Care Bears Pitaten Milton H.
