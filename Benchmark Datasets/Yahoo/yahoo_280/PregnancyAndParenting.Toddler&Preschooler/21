how the heck do i get rid of lice oh my god ok so just the facts as simply as i can during late may my and a half year old came home from daycare with lice we didnt realize this at first so we arent positive thats where it came from but it makes sense we dont really hang around a lot of other small children or licey people anyway i took her outside combed her hair out and picked out the little bugs that i could see or find i called the nurses line for our doctors office and they told me to cover her head in olive oil and put a shower cap over it for the night which we did the next day i washed her hair and took her to the dr and showed it to him and asked what to do my first child my first lice no idea he wrote us a presription for something called lindane or something or other i took it home looked the label and insert and decided he must be insane it said in very clear words that this was a product only to be used as a last resort it could cause death seizures and is only recomended for people for people who weight more than lbs my lb daughter does not meet that so i said no way i went to the store bought over the counter stuff and put it in her hair however we have not gotten rid of the lice at all i think we are killing the live lice but the eggs will not go away and her hair is extremly curly so its very hard to comb them all out even with the special combs they give you we have used the over the counter stuff times so far with no luck in getting her to be lice free she has been taken out of her daycare because im concerened its coming from someone there or that she will spread it also just feel terrible as a mother watching my child itch constantly we have had our house bombed for bugs over the weekend while we stayed at a hotel we have washed all linens clothes pillows etc several times her father and i have even used it on our own hair just in case so today she woke up from her nap crying badly and itching i decided to go ahead and use the stuff that the dr presribed way back when we put it in her hair followed the instructions rinsed it out and then went to use the little comb to get out any eggs left over upon doing this i right away see at least live lice in her hair right after using this beware it could kill your child but will defintley kill lice poison sigh i really dont know what to do at this point is there notthing that can kill the actual lice eggs i dont want to have another round of this as it is she isnt spending any time with friends sleepovers daycare and our lives are being turned upside down not to mention her little head is all itchy and sore please help me someone ps i understand having lice has nothing to do with money dirt or how clean your hair is all i meant is that i didnt know anyone whose child or themselves had lice at this point in time in addition to the rid and nit combs you may also use hot air seriously twenty minutes with a regular hair dryer will kill of the lice and nits there is currently an item production available to health care professionals in the next two years that is essentially a super dryer after twenty minutes of blowing all the nits are dead and the few lice that survive are too damaged to reproduce also you will want to put all the stuffed animals bedding and pillows in your house either through the dryer for a half an hour or in a plastic bag for a few days you might also want to look into treating yourself for lice as they spread easily your daughter has had lice since may and this is now august you can safely assume your home and everyone in it is infested sorry to hear of your troubles Crab louse Neighbours Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mattress Clothing Fancy rat Textile manufacturing Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Amber Spyglass Knots Landing Bedbug Sento Pediculosis Diseases of the honeybee EastEnders Meat Loaf Teen Girl Squad Ty Cobb About a Boy The Catcher in the Rye Professional wrestling throws The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe YuYu Hakusho Pitaten Upholstery First aid Ocean's Twelve Theory of conduct Ayyavazhi mythology Social rule Guinea pig Sin City Joker (comics) Characters in the Smurfs Columbine High School massacre Blood (computer game) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Garfield 613 mitzvot Great Teacher Onizuka Traumatic brain injury Piccolo Junior Saga 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Human Stain Little Britain Kodocha W.I.T.C.H.
