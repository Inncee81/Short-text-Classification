how do i get my yr old girl to poop in the potty right after she turned we went crazy with the potty training and she was really starting to catch on then one night she was constipated and couldn't poop because it hurt we had to give her prune juice and put a pull up on her ever since that incident over a year ago now she has not wanted to poop in the potty we have tried everything we've sat down and talked with her telling her that she's a big girl now and she needs to poop in the potty she'll watch me and even tell me to push and we've bought a few really big toys that she can have when she poops in the potty she knows this because every time she pees she says poop in potty get toy and i repeat to her every time yes if you poop in the potty you can have a toy but you have to poop in the potty first a few weeks ago we even decided to leave her in underwear at night because she holds off until we put the pull up on her to poop but that just left about dirty sheets a night please help we have a potty chair which was a waste of money she never used it she has always used the seat on the toilet and it's not like she is going into kindergarden tomorrow she won't go for another years i feel your pain i have a year old that refuses to use the big girl potty she is my rd child and so far the hardest to train however from experience the time will come where they will make the decision and do it just be patient and do not force the potty thing all the time it will just become a point of contention for her i would put pull up's on her at night if she is still peeing at night there is no harm in that keep up the positive talk and a little bribery will eventually work good luck Toilet humour Pitaten EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shawn Michaels Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Toilet Kodocha Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.
