my months old son has high white blood count my son is months old for the past and a half months he has had swollen glands but no other symptoms my doctor kept telling me it was just a virus i finally got her to do a blood test his first wbc was than she said it must be a bacterial infection and put him on antibotics took another cbc a week later and it was they then send me to detroit childrens hospital to see a blood disease specialist they did another cbc and his blood count went up to and also a blood smear that showed a virus i was just wondering if anyone knew what type of virus could last for this long i know that mono can do that and lasts for months it also causes the white blood count to go high yes kids do get it it can come from drinking after someone and such bacterial and viral both makes the wbc go up the glands swollen could be a sign of mono or it is also a sign that the lymph nodes there are doing their job and fighting infection and getting swollen due to the white blood cells and the dead virus my daughter did the same thing at around two years old and we went to all kinds of specialists we even had to go to saint jude childrens research hospital and have bone scans blood tests lung scans i mean they did everything and it went away about three weeks later a lot of the times the doctor's don't know and just rule out what it is not its frustrating but unfortunately it usually happens that way make out a list of questions to ask when you go and don't be afraid to get second opinions good luck Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infectious mononucleosis Prostate cancer AIDS Stomach cancer Pneumonia Ebola Cancer Cirrhosis Leukemia Hodgkin's lymphoma Lung cancer Chronic fatigue syndrome Group A streptococcal infection Chronic lymphocytic leukemia Tuberculosis Common cold Virus Lymphatic system Obstetrics Medicine Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Marburg virus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Hepatitis Cytomegalovirus Breast cancer Lupus erythematosus Conjunctivitis Syphilis Herpes simplex virus Colorectal cancer Pharyngitis Multiple sclerosis Rabies Cervical cancer Meningitis Ehrlichiosis Bubonic plague Mumps Vitamin C Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Echovirus Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Poliomyelitis Hepatitis C Spanish flu Radiation therapy Dendritic cell Kaposi's sarcoma Feline leukemia virus Herpesviridae Brain Stroke Kawasaki disease Immune system Lymph node West Nile virus Foot-and-mouth disease AIDS reappraisal Malignant melanoma H5N1 Acne Thyroid cancer Multiple myeloma Human papillomavirus Influenza Asthma Antiviral drug Malaria Infectious disease Cancer of the larynx Pulmonary alveolus Crohn's disease Smallpox Rubella Cystic fibrosis Lassa fever Autoimmune diseases Endometrial cancer Blood Sexually-transmitted infection Vaccine Red blood cell Coeliac disease Appendicitis Black Death
