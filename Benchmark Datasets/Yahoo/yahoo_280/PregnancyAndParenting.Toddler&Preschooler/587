i don't know what to do my best friend has a three year old i feel horrible saying this but he is evil i know it is because the way she raises him she screames at him and doesn t disaiplin him i can't take it any more she askes for my help and i give her my oppinion but she never follows through with anything i love her to death but can t take it any more i have a year old and a month old i don't any my month old to pick up his bad behavior including his horrible mouth as easy as it is to stay away from this child i think as this person is your bestfriend that will be very difficult sooner or later your children are going to come across other children that behave terribly and set horrible examples i think that if he doesn't harm your children that it's okay to be around him just teach your children that his behaviour is unacceptable perhaps you can let lead by example by setting clear boundries adn consequences for your own children maybe just maybe if she sees how you discipline your children and that it works she'll follow suit Theory of conduct Theodicy Alignment (role-playing games) Evil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Social rule The Fairly OddParents Pitaten Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Transactional analysis Ranma __ characters Incarnations of Immortality Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories It's All Gone Pete Tong Salad Fingers Spanking Karen Horney Domestic violence Beetle in an Anthill YuYu Hakusho Grief Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Shannara Druids Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Avenue Q The Life and Times of Juniper Lee One Tree Hill (TV series) Little Britain Children of God Appeasement Gender role Arjuna Motivation Justification (theology) Tommy Atkins Goodness and value theory Phoebe Halliwell Death Comes to Time Ethical challenges to autism treatment Polyamory Equine conformation Darth Vader Ashton-Tate The Amber Spyglass Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword John Howard Yoder Socrates Noam Chomsky Stuttering The Shining (film) Dog training G-Man (Half-Life) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Miss Saigon The Adventures of Pete & Pete Kender Sydney Riot of 1879 Salvation Social psychology Sex education A Beautiful Mind Nicomachean Ethics Burrhus Frederic Skinner Past teachings of Prem Rawat Muslim ibn Aqeel Conspiracy (TNG episode) Kodocha Internet troll Phaedo Human sexual behavior Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Paternalism Original sin Shaggy dog story Electrophysiology Rick Santorum Cube (film) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Halting problem Toy Story 2 Warren Buffett Attachment theory Rain Man Sin City Motif of harmful sensation Euphemism Death Note Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Coming of Age (TNG episode) Aida (musical) Joke Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Catcher in the Rye Perseverance of the saints Ludwig Wittgenstein Blonde on Blonde W.I.T.C.H.
