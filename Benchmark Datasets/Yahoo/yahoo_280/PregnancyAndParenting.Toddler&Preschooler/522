any parent with experience with kids getting tubes in there ears plz tell me about the before and after care i would like to know how kids felt when they came home good and the bad plz around three yrs preferably how soon they were back in to there normal routine ie school daycare what ever just so i have an idea what to expect from my daughter thank you all for your time it is greatly appreciated my son is and had to get tubes in his ears this past january it was the best thing i could have done for all of us he got an ear infection in october but no matter what we did it wouldn't fully go away we had to get some pre op tests done and then came the surgery the medicine they gave him to drink he took just fine i always taste my sons meds so i know what to expect and it tasted pretty good when he started getting drowsy the nurse took him back to the o r while my husband and i waited in the lobby waiting room my anxiety as a mom was high he did have to be sedated when he went to recovery we were called to where he was it took some time for him to wake up some kids do get cranky because the medicine has them groggy and they aren't really in control of themselves as usual my son was unhappy for a bit but i gave him a new car for doing such a good job and being a good boy that seemed to help ease him a bit he could hear better immediately and for a little bit he was jumpy he would walk around cupping his ears experimenting with sounds he was back to normal in about hours we were given drops to put into his ears for the first few days to make sure the tubes didn't clog warm them in your hands a few minutes before you put them in her ears it will help as far as swimming goes put plugs in her ears baths only require them if she tends to put her head ears below the water otherwise just dumping water over her head she won't need them after months to year they should fall out on their own my son has had them for almost months now and is doing great he had a check up this past monday and his pediatrician said that they are looking great i hope this helps good luck Breastfeeding Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Social rule Poker jargon Triage Dog Carburetor Diazepam Milton H.
