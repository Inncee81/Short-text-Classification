when is it okay to leave toddler in bath alone i have an month old daughter and i do believe she is too young to be left alone i just want to know when you all started being secure with leaving your children in the bathtub without supervision i am a little paranoid about it so i haven't a clue as to when it is the right time thanks for all your input please know that i am not asking if i can leave her alone right now that isn't the question i wouldn't even if every one said i could i am not comfortable with that i am simply asking when you all felt comfortable with it so that i have a general idea of what most parents think is the right time thanks again it depends on the child my oldest didn't start taking a bath alone until he was my daughter is and i am able to leave her alone and have been for about a year now i still check on them both and they are not allowed to lock the door they need help with their hair from time to time but they usually do a good job my youngest is and i don't leave him alone at all while he is in the tub if the phone rings one of the other kids can get it or i will call them back he is all over the tub playing so he could easily slip and hurt himself you will have to be the judge on when your child is ready most likely around age when she is ready make sure you have a non slip mat and make sure your razors are out of site even older children can try to shave and really hurt themselves The Shining (film) The Inside Customs and etiquette of Japan Sento Social rule Friends Theory of conduct Ben Johnson (athlete) The Giver Professional wrestling holds Textile manufacturing Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Good Times Child Shaggy dog story Charles Peace Knife Knots Landing Shaving Good Morning, Vietnam Swimming pool The Amazing Race Have I Got News For You Aerial (dance move) Codename: Kids Next Door Kyle Broflovski Little Britain 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Milton H.
