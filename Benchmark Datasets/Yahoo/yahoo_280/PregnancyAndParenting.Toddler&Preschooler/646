my baby will only sleep hours per day but acts tired all day long what can i do all the books and experts seem to say that the average month old baby needs about hours of sleep per day my month daughter will only sleep hours per day no matter what i do she sleeps hours of naps and hours at night also she acts sleepy rubbing her eyes yawning fussing all day long even within only an hour of waking up from a nap is it normal for her to act tired all the time i try to make her nap more often but she fights it and if i try to put her to bed earlier she just wakes up earlier and won't go back to sleep right now this is her sleep schedule am wake up for day am first nap pm second nap pm bedtime i hate seeing her so tired and trying to keep her going for hours between sleeps but if i put her down after hours she will fight the nap for another hour anyway if i put her down after only hours she will usually go to sleep but then it throws off the rest of her schedule for the day any suggestions i haven't started her on solids yet do you think she might sleep more after we start her on solids ooops i meant to put this question in the newborn baby category sorry i'll go post it over there instead while it is a commonly believed idea that eating solids will help a baby sleep more there really is no reliable evidence to show this to be true i think her sleep schedule sounds pretty normal and you must remember that when you read guidelines for milestones that the numbers are just averages all babies are different and if she won't sleep more or longer than it is not for her right now the fussiness with yawing and eye rubbing may not have anything to do with sleepiness but may be a sign of boredom or a sign of needing a quiet time even if she seems content most of the time in her swing or bouncy seat move her to the floor more often take walks with her either in the stroller or in a snugli or just go outdoors for a bit some babies are very social and like to have someone interacting with them a lot but may fuss rub their eyes or turn away when they just need a little down time the same can be true for babies who entertain themselves alone well some fussiness and eye rubbing my indicate they are ready for someone to pay attention to them now it takes a while and requires some detective work but eventually you'll be able to know what different signs mean from your baby i would suggest that you try changing her physical location such as holding rocking her putting her on the floor using a swing carrying her in a sling going outside somehow change her position first if you have been talking a lot to her stop for a bit or turn on a music cd for babies if she has been doing something quiet such as looking at her toys try something more active such as dancing with her singing interactive baby rhymes such as insy winsy spider patty cake or anything that you can help her hands body do the motions to read her lots of books if you don't already do that she will love the sound of your voice and the bright pictures it will help her language skills develop plus instill a love or reading it is also helpful to know that sometimes babies just plain are fussy and there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them this is ok there is no need to always try to make your baby happy as it will be impossible to do if all her basic needs are met and she isn't happy with anything your try it is fine to let her fuss it out a bit in her crib you should be able to tell a mad cry from a hungry cry from a scared cry if not try listening to her closely she will have different ways of crying for different things she wants she may just need to get it out of her system with some fussiness for a bit each day many babies have a fussy time Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sleep Cat Shaggy dog story Social rule Milton H.
