what age did your boy sleep through the night without wetting the bed mine is four this year and we just ran out of diapers he's potty train but not sure if he's ready for sleeping in the bed with big boy pants my son was under years old when he started going dry all night but i understand that is unusual these days your son should be fine by this age make sure you don't give him a lot of liquids in the evening before he goes to bed and have him empty his bladder just before getting in bed make going to the potty the first thing he does in the morning to make sure that he doesn't wet his pants on the way to breakfast put a wet pad under him for the first week or so and if he does wet the bed don't make a big fuss over it you can also leave a little reward sticker or something small on the back of the toilet at night for him to get in the morning when he goes pee pee to encourage him to go into the bathroom first thing good luck Kimberly-Clark Corporation Urinary incontinence Bedwetting Fecal incontinence Toilet training Toilet Grandview, U.S.A.
