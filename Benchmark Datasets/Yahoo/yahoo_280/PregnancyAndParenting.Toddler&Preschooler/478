help my son is going to be and is having bed wetting problems it doesnt happen every night but he has been having accidents at least times a week he just holds it in and if he could he would hold it all day any ideas suggestions i do have a plastic sheet over his mattress he doesn't drink hardly anything after dinner a very small glass of water after he brushes his teeth he just holds it in i am worried he will give himself a uti there is some good advice ahead of me but here is my plan of attack no drinking after dinner potty right before bed don't go to bed without wake him up right before you go to bed and make him go again no pull ups those will merely keep him from being aware he has gone they are not a fix they are an easy clean up for mom without them he stands a better chance of learning to recognize and stop the flow in time to run to the potty screw waking him up as others suggested at am that's cruel one more time when you go to bed or a pm is enough remember that when it comes to snacking in the evening fruits contain water Mattress Social rule Urinary incontinence Bong Grandview, U.S.A.
