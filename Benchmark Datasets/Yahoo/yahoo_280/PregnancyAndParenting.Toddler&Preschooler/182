my son calls my by my first name i have a year old son and a year old step son its kinda strange because i want the year old to call me by my first name and my son to call me dad my year old has a very involved father and i don't want to break that up they have a great realtionship but my son will call me tom because he hears his brother call me that we remind him every time he calls me tom to call me dad but the next time he talks to me its tom you may want to have your year old refer to you as daddy tom it doesn't affect his relationship with his real dad and your year old will start to emulate his older brother eventually the tom will fall off as the year old gets older my mom said i would refer to her as martha mommy and my dad as daddy lou for a long time she didn't mind because the up side to it is that your child does know your name if something were to happen like get lost in a store or something try it and give them time to adjust to daddy tom they'll catch on soon good luck Father Wonderland (McFly album) The Fairly OddParents The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Grandview, U.S.A.
