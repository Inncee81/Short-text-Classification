my month old son doesnt talk yet my son still doesnt speak i am wondering maybe its because i am bilingual and am speaking languages to him he is giving signs of communication like pointing grunting and is saying only words which one of them is ''gimmie'' it is proven that being raised learning two languages does delay speech it takes time for them to process all the words and understand that many words mean the same thing they also need to figure out which words go with which language however once a bilingual child begins talking he is fluent in two languages it is well worth the wait delayed speech can also be the result of many other things such as hearing probs older siblings to do the talking for them or medical probs my son had delayed speech as a result of being tongue tied this means the skin under his tongue came too far forward and prevented his tongue from moving enough to make proper sounds this should be caught by the ped when they are newborns or even by a speech pathologist after speech evals a few hearing tests an ent finally found it in seconds when he was years old it requires a simple minute surgery in our case he was talking normally in less than a month to check for it yourself play a tongue game together see how far he can stick out his tongue see if he can touch the roof of his mouth with the tip see if he can curve it up or down can he touch the back of his teeth my son could do none of these things and at the time i didn't know enough to look for these things i suggest a trip to the ent for a hearing eval and a quick check of the tongue and probably a trip to a speech pathologist but it is probably due to the privilege of being raised bilingual Hearing impairment Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Traumatic brain injury Stuttering Prostate cancer Multilingual Second language acquisition Australian Aboriginal languages Aphasia Hangul Sesotho language Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Languages in Star Wars Ice hockey Vowel Speech synthesis Hypoglycemia Asperger syndrome Chopsticks Autism Origin of language Phoneme Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Languages of France Poker jargon Stroke Snake Androgen insensitivity syndrome Manually Coded English Viterbi algorithm Milton H.
