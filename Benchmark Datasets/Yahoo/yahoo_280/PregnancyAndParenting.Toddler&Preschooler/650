my yrold seems to have regressed to a younger age we are having a nother baby in a month and for about the last wks he has wanted me to feed him rock him hand him things he can get him self thankfully he has kinda stopped and became the little independent boy he is has anyone else experienced this yes and it's very normal it will be hard on him trying to understand that he's not the baby anymore expect him to try and get in your lap while you are caring for the new baby when i went into labor i talked to my kids and told them that i was going to be gone for a few days and that they were going to meet their baby brother soon as soon as baby and i were presentable my kids were the first ones in the door i gave them hugs and kisses then i introduced them to their new brother year old might not understand very well so you may need to let him check out your smaller belly let him visit you and baby at the hospital as much as possible when you go home have your arms free so you can give those hugs and kisses to your son it encourages him to understand that you haven't forgotten him and still care it's very hard to split your time between little ones but try your best let the older one help with the baby by letting him put the diaper in the trash getting wipes for you ect he'll soon feel pretty special and will start to take on the big brother role best of luck and remember it takes patience as he will need time to adjust Care Bears Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Childbirth Infantilism Milton H.
