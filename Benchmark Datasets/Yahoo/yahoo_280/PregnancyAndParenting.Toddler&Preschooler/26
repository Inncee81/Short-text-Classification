months old swallowing food instead of chewing it my month old daughter swallow her food instead of chewing and if u give her something which has to be chewed she'll keep that in side of her mouth for as long as she can i don't know what to do please help my son does the same thing he's never been much of a chewer for us the problem got much better when he finished getting in his two year molars i now think that the molars took a long time in coming and chewing was uncomfortable for him he got them early so we have been seeing some good chewing lately we just gave him lots of small bites and did our best to keep him from choking i've read in many places that eating is just not a battle you want to pick with your kids at this age keep offering only healthy food and your child will figure out how to eat in my opinion the more that you try to force the issue the harder it will be pick your battles you'll have plenty to deal with in the next year right i would say hang in there this is probably a phase that she'll get through in her own time and her own way Tooth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Domestic rabbit Stomach cancer Dog training Adjustable gastric band Eating Fancy rat Dental caries Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hamster Snake Ferret Social rule Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Korean cuisine Equine conformation Customs and etiquette of Japan Elephant Mastication Chewing gum Piccolo Junior Saga Oral sex John the Baptist Mojave people Maxilla 2000 Australian Grand Prix Two Treatises of Government Evidence of evolution The Fairly OddParents Kosher foods Professional wrestling holds Terri Schiavo Old wives' tale Coca Uranium Atkins Nutritional Approach Extreme Programming Treehouse of Horror V Deinotheriidae Tooth enamel Dental brace Halitosis Garfield Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sesotho language Feeding tube Fecal incontinence Cat Mandible Natural Selection (computer game) Dentures Topps Chopsticks IPod shuffle Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Evolution of the Horse Oral cancer Hyperthermia 613 mitzvot Tomato Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Fluoride therapy The Critic Gastroesophageal reflux disease Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
