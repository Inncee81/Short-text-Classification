how can i encourage my year old daughter to poop in the toilet she'll only pee she does all her urinating in the toilet but won't poo help i need to have her fully potty trained in a few weeks for preschool hmm a little bit more information from you would help where does she do poo if not in the toilet is she holding on to it i helped toitlet train my cousin she was having the exact same problem she would ask for a nappy to be put on so she could do a poo we discovered that she didn't like sitting on the toilet for too long because it was too hard and also she was afraid of the splash haha so we wrapped some handtowels around the seat and put a wad of toilet paper in the bottom of the toilet and sat her there and i painted her tow nails while she sat there which was very exciting for her and she did her first poop on the toilet she was so proud of herself and never had a problem again as a childcare worker i have also toilet trained children by reading to them on the toilet it helps to relax them and then the poop just happens good luck oh and with the preschool thing it she hasn't trained by then she will probably just hold onto her poop til she gets home so don't stress too much about the time frame she might feel your urgency in the matter and this won't help the situation Shit Toilet humour Toilet Diaper Kimberly-Clark Corporation Urination Japanese toilet Fecal incontinence Toilet paper Ron and Fez Toilet training Dog training Pitaten Elimination communication Shaggy dog story Milton H.
