my son will be years old this month is legoland a fun place to take him legoland can be alot of fun for toddlers but be aware that the lines can get kinda long all it takes is one early meltdown to turn the day into a disaster for a two year old don't even bother with the more extreme sections of the park when we lived pretty close we got a membership so we didn't feel we had to do every ride every time if you can go on a weekday that isn't too hot and get there early hit the safari ride and the fairytale boats right away before the lines get too long try to get to the car track early on also cause i think that can be the longest wait in the back of the park the king arthur horse ride was a big hit the king arthur playground was great fun for the kids but kind of a panic for the adults as it is extremely hard to keep track of where your kid is unless you feel like following him around through the rope mazes and such i would suggest giving your son time to unwind in the playgrounds which are very well done though your parental instinct might be saying what i paid all this money for him to climb around in a playgroud it will ultimately be worth it you can take your time later in the day perusing the incredible lego world sculptures in the middle if its a hot day don't bother with the king arthur show it was rather boring as was the big fire show in the middle of the park but the puppet magic show near the kiddie coaster was good and i would suggest you don't try to visit every possible ride pick the five or six things he would most like to do and then call it a day before amusement park meltdown takes hold congratulations and have a great time LEGOLAND Windsor Amusement park Roller coaster The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Lego Hersheypark About a Boy Milton H.
