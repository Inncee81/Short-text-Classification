how to stop a year from picking his nose thanks to a gym daycare for hours a week our year old has picked up the nasty habit of nose picking at first it was just inappropriate but now he's picking it to the point where his nose bleeds make it inappropriate and unhealthy any ideas we've called his doctor and she's basically told us nothing helpful well you shouldn't have to worry unless it bleeds uncontrollably for a few hours two things we don't believe in smacking especially fingers love the band aid idea it apparently doesn't hurt him to pick his nose until it bleeds while i understand all kids pick their nose this is getting way out of hand my friend's daughter did the same thing her husband put a big old bandaid around their little girl's finger so she couldn't get it up there eventually the behavior stopped they basically had to keep catching her and they'd give her a short time out it's absent minded behavior and from what my friend was told by their pediatrician they had to keep drawing attention to it until the little girl stopped the other thing they did is that once she went a whole day with no picking she got a very nice treat eventually they stopped treating her for not picking because the behavior was over but they found something else to give treats for our big problem has been to get our year old son to stop scratching mosquito bites as they were starting to infect so we used a similar approach but didn't put anything on his hands i made sure his nails were kept very short and used time outs and rewards it has worked wonderfully he now catches himself scratching and immediately comes to get something put on the bite ps i have to disagree strongly with both of the other posters for one picking can damage the nose lining and cause infections it does not help a child breathe as to putting hot stuff on the fingers hello the child can rub his eyes i don't agree with slapping the child's fingers hitting isn't the answer and no i'm not anti spanking but if a parent is going to be vigilant enough to catch the behavior to slap the hands the parent can use other methods of discipline you can make him stop it's a matter of working at it it's causing nose bleeds so it's a problem and it may not stop just because other children stop my girlfriend's brother picked his until he was and he ate it too remember kids like that some behavior you can ignore some is just dirty i can't believe folks are saying just let him do it if he played in the toilet would they say just let him do it two year olds try that one too Dog training Milton H.
