how can you love one little person so much and not burst just feeling overwhelmed with love for my little man tonite i wish he could comprehend just how precious he is to me is that too sappy i am trying to decide whether or not to have another child and i am wondering if my heart feels ready to burst with love for one child how will i ever have enough for i know i know people do it all the time and have way more than kids but i am feeling so ambivalent on one hand i would love for him to have a brother or sister to play with but on the other hand he is my whole world and i don't know if i can love another the same way i do him do other people feel this way too or am i just being a sap i have three daughters and i understand perfectly how you feel sometimes i just want to hug them and never let them go and i hate letting them leave the house for anything i miss them so much as for loving another child the same way you love this one you won't each child is different and you will not love them all the same way don't get me wrong you will love them equally but all for different reasons once you start getting to know their personalities and little quirks and such things as that then that will be why you love that child not because he's your child so much as for the little person he or she is you will love them for themselves and it will be just as strong as the love for all the other children when i talk to my kids ages and i tell them i love them all the same but for different reasons i want them to know that i love them not just because they are my kids but also for who they are i do admit when each new child came along i had a strange sense of loving one child more than the other but this didn't last long i had to really think about it to get my head around the fact that if any of them were harmed it would just about kill me equally no matter what after the period of adjustment i managed to realize that the strange feeling wasn't real or true it was just a mother's protective nature coming to the surface for a more helpless child ie the baby as the baby matured everything clicked back to normal and my kids never knew any different because my love for them never really dimmed at all it's nothing to worry about as for not having any other children there are pros and cons to both sides my sister has one son and he's spoiled rotten he has no other little person to share things with unless my sister finds time to take him to a play group which with two working parents is hard to do i as i mentioned have three kids and they all fight and carry on but they also help each other out and interact with each other on a daily basis one can teach the other about different things and they have someone to talk to if they can't talk to me personally i think having more than one is good but as you can see mine are also spaced out a great deal it allowed me the time to devote myself to one kid without stressing me to the point that i couldn't take care of the others other people might think close together is better because they get all the potty training and teething and such out of the way but i think being able to focus on one at a time to be a better way it's a personal preference though do what you think works best for you good luck Jon Secada EastEnders Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends The Contender (television series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism The Fairly OddParents Pitaten Knots Landing Charmed A Course In Miracles Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scenes from a Memory Milton H.
