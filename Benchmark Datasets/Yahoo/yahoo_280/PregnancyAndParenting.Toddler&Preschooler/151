what's the best travel toddler car seat carrier i need to travel with two toddler car seats big forward facing graco seats i will have to check one of these at the curb instead of gate checking because i'm traveling by myself and can't carry both seats and both kids through the airport i'm looking for a durable carrier that could possibly survive luggage check in at an airport and also one that i could carry or drag through the airport while toting two preschoolers i will probably be buying two carriers any suggestions i have rented a carseat from a car rental place and will never do it again it was the most disgusting car seat i have ever seen it clearly had never been cleaned and it's safety was questionable unfortunately the rental place only had one car seat available to rent the only way i will travel with my kids is if i can bring along their carseats because i know they are clean safe it might be cheaper just to rent the carseats at your destination many car rental companies rent them otherwise there are a few toddler car seats with wheels for travel but they are expensive edited to add i found this one answering another question it might work for you the carseat folds flat http www macklems com sunshine kids radian car seat htm http www littlebabyshoes com radianfoldingcarseat html http www car seat org showthread php t Baby transport Limousine Airport Taxicab Bicycle Car safety Singapore Changi Airport Auto Train (Amtrak) Station wagon Air New Zealand Personal rapid transit PHP World Wide Web HTML Rental car HyperText Transfer Protocol Airline Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Toyota Prius EasyJet Sport utility vehicle Transport in Hong Kong General aviation Leasing Wayne Corporation HTTP cookie Ford Crown Victoria Passenger car Auto insurance Automobile High-speed rail MTR New York City Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Tire Drag racing Uniform Resource Locator The Amazing Race Amtrak Intermediate consumption Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rafic Hariri International Airport Budapest Ferihegy International Airport Panama City Autorack Porsche 928 Pickup truck Poker jargon United States Postal Service National Kidney Foundation Singapore Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Web server Wheel of Fortune Belgrade Airport Cathay Pacific Singapore Airlines EasyGroup Ajax (programming) Space Shuttle program Mercedes-Benz A-Class Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Our Gang Octopus card Ryanair Kitesurfing Common Unix Printing System Semi-trailer Dodge Charger Road traffic accident Fixed-wing aircraft M16 (rifle) Web page Internet Let's Make a Deal Vietnam Airlines Utility cycling Truck Domain Name System Rules of the road Volkswagen Motorcycle Cerritos, California JetBlue Airways Oneworld (airlines) United Parcel Service The Flintstones Kimberly-Clark Corporation $ale of the Century Railroad car Low-cost carrier Gmail Chevrolet Corvair Airplane!
