my almost year old son likes to get into the litter box it's disgusting and i have done everything in my power short of duct taping him to the wall any suggestions thank you for all of the wonderful suggestions everyone awesome i would like to add a few things on here at first it was an open litter box and i thought that it would alleviate the issue if we got a covered one we faced it towards the wall and he turned it around and then eventually learned how to take the tabs off so that didn't work i really like the suggestion about pleasing him with different textures but i am afraid that if i give him something similar it will encourage him even more there is no place that is not high enough that he cannot get to he is a really tall little kid i do not appreciate being told to get rid of my cat because it's beyond disgusting i believe with a little effort we can work things out so thumbs down to those answers does he for sure understand that it's the kitty's potty maybe he's just going through a phase sometimes when a child is trying to figure out something he she will be preoccupied until the concept is worked out is it possible to make litter box maintenance a scheduled activity set a timer for a certain time when the timer goes off let your son assist as much as his age allows with the scooping wash your hands together and say no touching the kitty's potty until tomorrow when the timer goes off Extreme Programming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Saw II Genericized trademark EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Milton H.
