is taking your child to the playground every day a bad idea i've been taking my daughter to the playground everyday for the past week and today i just felt like i let her down cause we couldnt go and she kept asking all day to go to the playground now i feel bad the playground isnt that far from where we live either it's about blocks and she's only so i wouldnt dare let her go alone so was it a bad idea to get her into the idea of us going every day i have free time now and i want to do something fun with her here at the house to hopefully take her mind off of the playground until at least tomorrow or the next day what do you think i don't think taking her every day is a bad idea at all children need physical activity you just need to explain to her that you there will be times when you can't take her she would most likely be upset even if you said no and you hadn't taken her every day don't feel bad about not taking her she has to learn that not everything in life will go exactly the way you want it Playground Pitaten Scientology beliefs and practices Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Milton H.
