parents of boys ok i have a yr old son and yesterday he was playing and he ran into the coffee table and he hit his pee pee he was in so much pain and crying and i could just see the pain in his eyes i started crying cause it hurts me to see my child in pain and my husband was just sitting there like nothing i yelled at my husband cause i would think him being a man that he knows the pain and he did nothing to comfort my son i was angry and hurt is it cause he is a man and he knows the pain and that it will be alright and did i just over react cause i am female and i don't know that pain idk i was just mad and was very sad for my son also what can i do to teach him to be more careful there well i didn't run to comfort him i was sitting on the floor with my daughter when it happened and he just stood there grabbing himslef crying and i started crying cause i could just see the pain in his eyes and my husband did nothing so i called him to come to me and i more like cried at my husband cause it hurt my feelings that he just sat there when i had my daughter in my arms and i thought it was more of a male thing and he should have comforted him i have seven children and two boys i think i would have jumped up and looked to see if it was still attached but i might even chuckle at that scene not in a mean way but just to distract the child from the pain and tears one thing i'm not sure you understand about male genitalia is that being hit in the penis is just like being hit in the finger its when his testicles drop in puberty then being struck in the testicles will make most men nearly pass out or be totally paralized in pain for a minute or two dont be too mad at your husband your boy will have countless moments of tears and pain as your husband has also had so you try as a man to not be a baby about it and just get through it in silence it is good to have a nurturing mom to tell you it's going to be alright but dont expect your husband to be that way its not in his nature as far as teaching him to be more careful there its the first time when he really gets nailed in the ba s he will never forget it and will always remember to protect that area good luck swequin Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.
