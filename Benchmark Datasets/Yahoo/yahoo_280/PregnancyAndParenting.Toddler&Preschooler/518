cild pros why will my yr old only sleep on the floor at the moment if moved he wakes gets back down up until a few weeks ago he would go into his bed sleep through without any bother but now insists on sleeping on the floor is this ok should i perservere in moving him or let him get it out of his system children can sleep in the oddest places it bothers us because it looks either unconventional or uncomfortable but if your son is getting the sleep he needs and shows no ill effects from snoozing on the floor there's really no problem the key is to remember the goal you need him to have a good night's sleep so that he'll be healthy and have the energy to get through his day it sounds like he's doing that it's almost impossible to figure out why he's chosen this sleeping place maybe he gets more light from the hallway and likes that maybe he finds the bed too big too high or too lonely he might like falling asleep to the sounds of his parents' conversations maybe he just tried it one night on a whim and liked it it doesn't really matter though because he is taking care of his sleep needs and will move into his bed when he's ready Sleep Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Insomnia The Emancipation of Mimi About a Boy Co-sleeping Urinary incontinence Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Mattress Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Catcher in the Rye Avenue Q The Big Sleep The Death Gate Cycle Sleeping Murder Sin City Apollo 8 Blankets (graphic novel) W.I.T.C.H.
