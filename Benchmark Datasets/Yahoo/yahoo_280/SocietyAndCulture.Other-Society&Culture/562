minneapolis vs st paul i often hear you shouldn't move to the east side of the twin cities because it's different what do people mean when they say that i ask and they never elaborate my theory is the west side is distinctly midwestern where the east is not could that be the reason love the twin cities don't get me wrong but it's sort of a running joke about wouldn't be caught dead in the city across the river and it is said by people on both sides of the river i live on the minneapolis side and can count on one hand how many times i've been in st paul this year it's not for any other reason that whatever i need is within a three miles radius of where i live st paul is a smaller town than minneapolis the one challenge about st paul is that their street names and numbers can give you a headache in minneapolis the city is on an easy to understand grid for most of the city no matter where you go in the twin cities each neighborhood has it's own profile and sometimes it can change within blocks if you are looking to make a move and you don't live in minnesota i would try and find a place to live close to where you work and go from there the links i have for you below are some very interesting stats and if it hadn't been for your question i wouldn't have found them hope this helps a little ps mary tyler moore lived on kenwood parkway in minneapolis Saint Paul, Minnesota The Mary Tyler Moore Show University of Minnesota Minneapolis-St. Paul Minneapolis, Minnesota Minnesota Minnesota Twins Theory of conduct Hiawatha Line Twin cities Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis) Mississippi River Grand Forks, North Dakota WCCO Twin City Rapid Transit Manhattan Epistemology Interstate 94 Bloomington, Minnesota Milwaukee, Wisconsin Friends Jon Secada U.S. Highway 1 Streets and highways of Chicago Blood on the Tracks Nicollet Mall Midwestern United States Time Out of Mind Minnesota Transportation Museum Social rule Paul Is Dead West Side Highway Mary Tyler Moore Duluth, Minnesota Shot of Love Softball Aerial (dance move) Chicago and North Western Railway Interstate 35 Knots Landing Minnesota River Blaine, Minnesota Roger Maris University of Minnesota system Underground city Conway's Game of Life The nature of God in Western theology Fargo, North Dakota Mojave people Newark City Subway U.S. Electoral College Falsifiability String theory Halting problem Margin of error University Avenue (Minneapolis-St. Paul) Augsburg College Terri Schiavo Indiana state highways Star Tribune Neighborhoods of Minneapolis Humphrey Bogart Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Black hole Theodicy The Replacements Chess strategy and tactics Minnesota State Highway 62 The Dalek Invasion of Earth Long Path Sudoku Philosophical skepticism Minesweeper (computer game) Ontological argument Leicester City Centre Mall of America Dog agility Neighbours Pedophilia Metro Transit (Minnesota) Craps Fridley, Minnesota Geography of Washington, D.C. 400-Series Highways Philosophy of language Roxette Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport Socrates David Hume Metaphysics Uptown, Minneapolis 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Williamsburg, Virginia Scientific method Jumpstart 3rd Grade Samuel Goldwyn Cork BMT Canarsie Line Carl Barks Paradox
