why is it that universities have to have a certain amount of minorities wouldn't it be less racist if ethnicity was removed from the applications honestly i am a white female and it is the worst demographic not male anymore and i am a little worried about getting many scholarships i know i still have time i am only however i think it is ridiculous that there are so many scholarships available for only minorities i am not racist but i can help but feel that it is unfair that i have to work so much harder for a scholarship for example friend is a minority and she got the bill gates scholarship and it pays for everything new laptops room and board everything my other friend national merit and she also got a full ride to a state school however her scholarship is not paying for everything and she still needs to come up with a lot of money i have nothing against her fiend i mean good for her but seriously how does that get rid of prejudice absolutely agree one of the ways to keep racism is to emphasize it i would better have scholarships for those who work hard and have good grades or give a chance to someone who want to improve their level of education and after that the harder you work less you pay in some countries you have to pay for your studies only if you have under notes maybe that would be good guide Affirmative action Racism Graduate school Education in the United States National Certificate of Educational Achievement Theory of conduct Scholarship Education in Romania SAT Student loan Numerus clausus Tariff School choice Education in Germany New Zealand Scholarship College admissions Education in Portugal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Japan Education in the People's Republic of China Poker jargon Grade (education) Boston Public Bumiputra Education Nadir of American race relations Black (people) Unemployment Race and intelligence Students' union Final Fantasy XI Scientific racism Arab-Israeli conflict University of Maryland Baltimore County Education in New Zealand Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Korean adoptee Androgen insensitivity syndrome Commonwealth of Nations Asian fetish Deflation (economics) Infantilism Internet fraud GED University of Michigan Fair use Pioneer Fund Bob Rae Bond Anti-Defamation League Zionism and racism IBM PC compatible African American contemporary issues Model minority Intelligent design movement Capitalism No Child Left Behind Act Westminster School Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Council of Conservative Citizens Franklin W.
