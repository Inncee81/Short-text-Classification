taking photos at a funeral just recently i've seen a lot of people close to the person that's passed of course taking photos of the person casket flowers etc i think it's a bit strange but memorable at the same time why do people do this it's actually quite common as some other people have said people grieve in different ways each to his own as a funeral director i get requests to take photos of the deceased for the benefit of family members who are out of town or unavailable at the time of the funeral as a rule we make it a practice of asking the next of kin or the family member in charge first before we take photographs our funeral home serves a large portion of the asian community locally asians are the ones who most often take pictures or video tape the funeral literally every funeral you can bet there is a camera there they will even try and video tape the funeral procession if there is one that is until the traffic escorts prohibit them from doing it for safety reasons why do people do it i don't know as i said people grieve in different ways i try not to judge i respect that everyone in this world is unique Funeral Cremation Funeral home Burial Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan Embalming 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Death and state funeral of Pierre Trudeau Current teachings of Prem Rawat Military funeral State funeral of John F.
