where past events go do they stay in some kind of eternal form in spiritual realm or they are just part of our memory probably we forget something that is not written or recorded however if something is written and recorded or just helps our memory to recall the event is such event reality because it happens now for example if in a newspaper or on television is writing and talked about some past events they are actualised so with enough repetition of past event it become reality therefore in such case past is not past it is reality if some person in his her mind still recall some old lover such person is still in love and such love is reality let us suppose that some person wears the dress he she was not wearing for years such fashion for such person become reality and in the moment when such dress is taken from shelf it is not past anymore if you take photo from past and if you put such photo in your room such photo becomes reality in your life therefore past events can be reality dude you are so stoned Reincarnation S__ren Kierkegaard Blonde on Blonde Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Simone Weil Scientology beliefs and practices Memento (film) Immortality Reality Milton H.
