is this a good idea this guy keeps calling my work and swearing at me i'm the receptionist and he's asking questions and throwing hte swear words in for flavor can i call him on it tell him to quit it or i'll hang up he's allready mad and i feel like i don't get paid enough to put up with it i used to be a customer service rep for a government benefits company so i know all about irate callers you are allowed to say in a calm but firm voice that you cannot help him while he is being abusive and that if he doesn't calm down you will have no choice but to end the call i would also report this to my supervisor and ask what the official policy is Call centre Liam Gallagher Federal Marriage Amendment LiveJournal Health insurance United Airlines Flight 93 Wal-Mart God Emperor of Dune Outsourcing Corporate governance United States House of Representatives EastEnders Monopoly Caller (dance) Ra (board game) E-mail spam Natural monopoly Little Britain Timeline of the 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities You Don't Know Jack Totally Spies! 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Mad Money Reservoir Dogs Enron Corporation Privatization W.
