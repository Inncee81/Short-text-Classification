screaming is funny my friend think its hysterical to scream not only does she find screaming herself funny but hearing other people scream she is and records herself screaming and then begs me to listen to the recordings and laughs hysterically for hours at it this is not surprising to me considering her older brother records himself farting they also tell me they have recorded their screams and farts since they were children so they pretty much have a box set full of their screams and farts throughout the years this is a very annoying thing because whenever someone is being funny or laughing at something my friend will scream everyone will jump up and get irritated and then she will laugh about it i can't understand why she finds screaming so funny she even laughs when babies are crying she is a great friend but its so irritating has anyone else ever heard of finding screaming amusing my husband's family have an infantile crude sense of humor too what can you do Shaggy dog story Ron and Fez Humour I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Good Morning, Vietnam Jam (TV series) Family Guy Bart chalkboard gags Toilet humour Spidey Super Stories Rain Man Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Joke Internet phenomenon Slayers Comedy Garfield Friends EastEnders AFI 100 Years series Skin of Evil (TNG episode) Hide and Q (TNG episode) Pitaten Salad Fingers I Am Furious Yellow Social rule Inherently funny word Time Out of Mind The Smiths Mojave people Have I Got News For You Scream (film) Prank flash Aliens of London Piccolo Junior Saga Mary Poppins Sinfest Spice Girls Laughter Undergrads I Want to Hold Your Hand The Country Wife Squidward Tentacles Marie Antoinette Autism rights movement SpongeBob SquarePants Rais massacre Jackass: The Movie Autism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Elijah Wood Avenue Q The Inside Highway 61 Revisited God Emperor of Dune Escape from New York Hollyoaks Recurring South Park characters Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker Slashdot subculture Unhinged America's Funniest Home Videos Beatles for Sale 3rd Rock from the Sun Australia's Funniest Home Video Show The Doctor Dances Dilbert Humphrey Bogart Love and Theft El Chavo del Ocho Surreal humour The Jim Rome Show The Shining (film) A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum Great Teacher Onizuka Shit Calvin and Hobbes Carry On films Double entendre Dave Grohl Miss Saigon Street-Legal The Empty Child Thomas Pynchon Oasis (band) I Love Lucy Pure Pwnage Doug Girly History of SNL:1980-1985 Tickling Sugo Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968 Jennifer Lopez Rich Mullins Kodocha
