this is supposed to be funny what kind of a society do we live in where comics like this win awards i'm new to the world of mp players and podcasts since i gave my daughter an mp player for her birthday i heard about a website for the podcast awards and decided to check it out i followed one of the links for one of the people's choice candidates a comedy podcast called keith and the girl the animated sample podcast was an absolutely disgusting skit mocking and ridiculing kids with mental disabilities at some imaginary benefit for a home i stopped watching after about a minute and my blood is still boiling these kind of lowlifes make me absolutely sick i guess if you can't be funny you just have to be idiotically insensitive and crude oh how clever of them to push the boundaries of bad taste way to cater the worst in people for every person out there who tries to set a positive example for the young and impressionable there's idiot parasites like this exploiting and promoting the worst in them continued what is wrong with a society that not only produces this garbage but also that receive popular support as the peoples choice all of the hard work done by wonderful and compassionate people to undo the stigma is so easily and thoughtlessly undone by this kind of cruelty i feel dirty just having been briefly exposed to this thanks for listening to my rant looking forward to hearing your responses p s i have another daughter who is mentally disabled so this is not just about me sheltering my older daughter i haven't seen this bit i haven't heard of it either but that doesn't mean much i guess that my answer to that would be that as of late there really is no original bit of anything pretty much everything has been done and now the only thing left is to explore uncharted frontiers and to make fun of those with disabilities it's sad and flawed but it is the reality in which we live if you just poke around online and read some people's answers to questions you will see that a lot of people's first response to anything that they do not understand is to simply ridicule it s the easiest way out and in some forums the easiest way to get a laugh it s very easy for someone lacking a conscience to obtain laughs and or approval from a vacant insipid audience the content fits the audience and one can only hope that the audience is a small one Theory of conduct I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Social rule Joke Late Night with Conan O'Brien Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
