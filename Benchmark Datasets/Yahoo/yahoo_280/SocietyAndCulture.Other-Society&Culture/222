is it possible to lose social skills im a college student during the school year i don't really talk to many people in my classes i don't have a job other then being a student and only live with my boyfriend all my friends are at different schools so i don't talk to many people here now im working in an office for the summer and i don't feel like i am as funny with people as i used to be or sarcastic or smart it used to be so easy for me to get along with people now it's hard to find ways to make conversation and think of things to talk about because i haven't really talked to anyone other then my boyfriend parents and friends once in a while i don't really talk to other people on a regular basis sometimes go days with only talking to just my boyfriend is it possible to lose your social skills or forget how to talk to people yea same here but for me its more like iv lost touch with everyone els's lifestyles i don't watch tv anymore really i don't go out drinking except birthdays etc i don't do much except play guitar listen to music skate surf and sleep pretty much it so i really don't have much in common with people these days also iv had the same group of about friends since i can remember which is kool but when it comes to meeting new people i find it hard because i'm just used to having my normal friends which do the same stuff i do and we've known each other for most of our lives so we know each other so well and are sense of humer works well together so yea you can definitely loose your social skills but i guess you can loose any skill really if you don't use it you will loose it Social rule Friends Cliff Richard The Catcher in the Rye The O.C.
