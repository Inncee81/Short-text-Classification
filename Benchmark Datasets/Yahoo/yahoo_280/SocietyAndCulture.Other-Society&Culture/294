why does american televison suck so bad i've been watching some shows online from other countries like britain france switzerland etc and i realize they have better writing greater ideas and aren't focused so much on reality tv so why is it that these countries have great tv and america with so many companies and budgets can't produce anything but crap maybe because here in america we put any and everything on tv that shouldn't really be there i guess in other countries they have a good intentions for tv and it's mainly to educate their audience and entertain them in a positive way here in america the main purpose is to entertain and you can see that because many of us don't pay attention to the important stuff Theory of conduct Craps Advertising Paul W.
