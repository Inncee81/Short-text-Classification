is there something wrong with me nowadays teenage guys my age i'm tend to spend their time playing at the arcade or dying colored streaks into their hair or wasting their time doing one silly kind of thing or another i find myself asking where are the days where males concentrate on their fitness or studies or martial arts instead of playing at the arcade all day playing once a while is ok to me but playing almost everyday is just too much for me i believe in hard work and believing in what you do i believe that hard work can make up for match and even truimph over talent so what i do everyday is to concentrate on what i do best playing football soccer martial arts and studies i do play arcade with my friends once in a while but i dont smoke or drink or dye my hair so is there something wrong with me because i dont think like other guys of similar age to me another thing i cant stand being in a fixed schedule so when i get bored of study i will go down to excercise i excercise real often and i prefer jobs more outdoor and hands on so office jobs are out of the question there is nothing wrong with you people are just different we like different things have different priorities etc keep being true to who you are i'm sure that you will have wonderful things in your future look at it this way it will be guys like them that will make you look good when it comes time to apply for college get jobs etc Social rule Martial art Professional wrestling slang Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Double Dragon Football (soccer) Law of value Pitaten MAME Mixed martial arts Aikido Unemployment Goodness and value theory Art Football (soccer) positions W.
