sensitive subject no jerks i am reading this harry potter fanfic story even though its only a story totally made up it can reflect with real life revenge rape say someone has been really really horrible to you for many many years and then you wake up and a plan has hatched in your head what better way to make them pay is to rape them out of revenge i know its only a made up story but as i said it could happen in real life i hope it never has or will does the tormentor deserve something as extreme as that asking this cause its really upset me and making me wonder now how the author came up with this rob s rig wow i did say no jerks well eyedontknow i did not know what the story would be about but believe me i am going to read something different maybe the real harry potter books by j k rowling scowls believe me i did not write this story and believe me i did not go out of my way to find a story containing rape considering anyway i did say no jerks and that this was a sensitive subject the author definitely has been watching too much anime and reading too much manga oh yes and hentai they always have that sort of thing in manga read angel sanctuary and ayashi no somthing girls are always almost being raped in her mangas not the kiddy ones like naruto its really disturbing but people are twisted and that is also why i dont like people who watch are influenced by anime or j culture whatever you call it cause even if they dont read or come in contact by chance with this twisted stuff also present in other medias j culture is also really sexist and berate females in a way that just rubs me the wrong way and yeah people who usually write fan fiction on the internet are the ones who watch alot of anime anyways Manga Fan fiction Harry Potter Hentai Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Anime Otaku J.
