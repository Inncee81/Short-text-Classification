why must america change it how comes everytime something british goes over to america it's changed for example harry potter and the philsopher's stone telly tubbies the office etc etc they completely changed the cast of the office for american actors and changed the storyline so that it's 'relvant' to americans' it's not the office then if it's a different cast i watch american programs all the time and i can get the drift of the time to their references why cant it stay as it is is it that hard to understang what's happening accents then why don't they change tv over here for us it took me ages to work out who martha stewart though i am still unsure i think she's some sort of jail bird who was once a homemakerish type person is and i often hear references that go straight over my head telly tubbies was supposedly dubbed and they got rid of the narrator man harry potter became harry potter and the sorceror's stone i would give better examples but i have not been to america to experience the joy of cable tv millions of people over here and the world watch american movies and comedies and dramas and read the books don't you as a american find it offesive that who ever is in charge thinks you're too thick to understand what's going on so have to spell it out to you for example i and us british understand the program friends though their lifestyle and goals is different from my lifestyle or sex and the city when they were going on about foreskin over here that's the norm but they made a big deal about it yet i got what was happening in the case of the office the style of humor may have something to do with it it's all about viewership and ratings they didn't just change it they revised and familiarized it and tested it b mass producing also our tv ratings guidelines don't allow certain dry humor which the brits are famous for i haven't watched british tv in years but using the old stand bys of benny hill and monty python you get away with a lot more than we ever could lol god i miss those shows EastEnders Sesame Street Humphrey Bogart Desperate Housewives Queer as Folk (U.S.) Comedy film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) John Cleese Ron Weasley Monty Python's Flying Circus Ron and Fez One Tree Hill (TV series) Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Television in the United States Monty Python I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again Theory of conduct Harry Potter Whose Line Is It Anyway?
