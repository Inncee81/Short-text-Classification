why do well off successful people get hated on i've witnessed this in other successful well off people and in myself i'm not successful yet in the work sense but i'm pretty well off happy and like to dress well and i like fashion so when i go out in public i do like to wear current clothing etc what i noticed are a few things some retail workers would roll their eyes and just look frustrated or sigh upon me entering their store and be more rude mean to me at the checkout counter i'd get dirty looks or whatever types of gestures by other people as they walk by me at a public place such as a mall this is a funny one if i'm driving parallel to someone sometimes that person upon making eye contact with me gives me a dirty look and veers to the lane next to them i get my car purposefully vandalized among other things i mean i just like to go out there and be the best person i can be in all ways and people don't seem to like that they hate on it why also taking the focus away from myself other people that are really successful and i don't mean just celebrities get hated on constantly and put down don't those haters realize that it takes alot of hard work constant motivation craftiness and skill just to be able to do what these successful people do daily also if they look well made up it takes money good taste and well many things why dismiss things that obviously deserve respect not everyone has success thrown into them it's funny because you can spend your whole life trying to succeed and once you do more people may hate on you than before and you could find yourself with less friends and a more miserable life if you're on the bottom people call you a loser if you're towards the top it's not any easier socially human beings suck oh so it's snobbish to try to be well off successful and dress well well excuse me for not dressing in sweats pigging out at mcdonalds and being down on my luck forgive me maybe i'll try to be a follower and fit in with everyone else rather than be proud of myself i didn't ask for a judgement i asked for a response anyways hopefully your response keeps getting the thumbs down and eventually i can report it as spam d have a wonderful day dear people dont have respect for anyone any more that is jus the way it is if they had any class at all they would treat everyone like they were worth millions no one ever knew my i q or my talents and abilities because i always treated everyone with such high respect i admire people who are self made people just get jealous because you represent the person they wanted to be and couldn't because they didnt try or don' know how you be who you are and god bless Shaggy dog story Beavis and Butt-head Social rule EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The Apprentice 2 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga Good Morning, Vietnam One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.
