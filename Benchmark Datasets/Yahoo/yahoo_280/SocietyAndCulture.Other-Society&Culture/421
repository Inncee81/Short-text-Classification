asking questions about our society means you're anti american okay so i just posted a question a little while ago about assimilation in american society and the feedback i got was very interesting many people took offense in the fact that i even had the nerve to question american society don't get me wrong i'm proud of where i come from too but i thought one of the highlights of being american was freedom of speach and the right to question things because i asked this question people automatically assumed that i was taking a stance on a political issue such as immigration one gentleman even asked me to just come out and say it i was doing no such thing all i wanted to know was to what extent must we assimilate into american society if that was so offensive then i apologize but i really don't think it was it wasn't anti american it was anti their perspective many pple feel that their opinion on things is an attack on them but it's an attack on that concept since many hold their same stance when you come to any country you have to assimilate or what i really like to refer to as accommodate when you accommodate you are fitting in new stuff with what you all ready know you aren't changing anything you are just accepting some things to fit in you are accepting the new and keeping the old assimilation is when you are changing something usually has an uncomfortable feeling attached you have to throw out something old and replace it with the new immigration well it is accommodation imo they need to learn the communal customs of americans and accept some things like our language you shouldn't come up to someone and just start speaking spanish like we all speak it this isn't mexico they can still keep their traditions Extreme Programming Franz Boas Social rule Abortion debate Theory of conduct Cultural relativism Melting pot Shaggy dog story Milton H.
