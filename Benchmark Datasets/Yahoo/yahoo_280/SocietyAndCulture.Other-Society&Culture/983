what do you do if you feel disillusioned about things in life eco i was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis years ago i was given years for the first six months i was so disillusioned that i was paralyzed then i got mad and decided that i was going to live and no one could stop me i went to the doctor for some anti depressants and therapy together cause if you are not aware therapy works and anti depressants can work but together you get real results they scaled it to where i could afford it and i learned skills to put myself back together i now fight for research for my disease for a cure and laugh everyday i found that finding something funny everyday made me whole again try it find some joy in there it's there you have just forgotten how to access it but you can get it back you can try therapy or spend time doing things with a good friend don't direct what you do let your friend lead you to fun sometimes we get disillusioned because we work at being fun and having fun tooo hard you can do it luka Milton H.
