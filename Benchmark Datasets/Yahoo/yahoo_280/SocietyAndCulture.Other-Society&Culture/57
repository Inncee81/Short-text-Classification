what do people enjoy about smoking i'm sure the reason that people smoke is because cigarettes are addictive but for people who first start smoking why there has to be some reason something people enjoy about it i always here about the health effects of smoking but isn't their something that gives people a good feeling when they smoke i mean it can't just be the taste because then people could just eat something and if they taste anything like they smell that can't be what gets people to start what is it that's enjoyable about a cigarette some people start smoking because of the social aspect of it because i know that's why a lot of my friends did i also know people who took it up because it was an excuse to have a break and go outside while at work the good feeling may stem from the fact that tobacco is a stimulant just like coffee etc and a lot of people start having those when they are tired or to be social and eventually can not go without them so i think it could be the same for cigarettes Tobacco smoking Cigarette Cigar Cigarette Smoking Man Cocaine Cannabis (drug) Mojave people Hookah Tobacco Arguments for and against drug prohibition Drug addiction Smoking pipe Tobacco advertising The Smoking Room Goodness and value theory Hypnosis Health issues and the effects of cannabis Snus Word of Wisdom Coffee Drug abuse Methamphetamine Medical cannabis Microeconomics Tobacco industry Friends Tea Sauna Bong Social rule Breastfeeding Nicotine Consensual crime Billboard (advertising) Yerba mate Illegal drug trade Traumatic incident reduction About a Boy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Usual Suspects Addiction Fruits Basket Coffee and Cigarettes Starbucks Prohibition (drugs) Kretek Banana Spliff Anger management Common cold E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt) Trailer Park Boys Health insurance Extreme Programming Fred Flintstone Oral sex Luther Leonidas Terry Smoking fetishism Kitchen Traumatic brain injury Opium Cancer Chocolate People's Republic of China Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Schizophrenia Cheese Daredevil Human sexual behavior Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Prostate cancer National Institutes of Health Theory of conduct Masturbation Hydrogen cyanide Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Red Hot Chili Peppers Ron Weasley Gauloise George Costanza Meditation Cuisine of Denmark Beavis and Butt-head Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Caffeine Phencyclidine Breakfast Harm reduction Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wall Street Food Mid-levels Drinking culture Sento Public relations Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2000 Australian Grand Prix Richard Doll Hashish
