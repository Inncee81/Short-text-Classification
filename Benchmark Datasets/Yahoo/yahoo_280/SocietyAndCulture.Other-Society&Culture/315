why do we kill people who kill people to show people that killing people is wrong referring to the death penalty kind of hypocritical isn't it please keep person attacks comments out of this there's no room for immaturity thanks to everyone i oppose it because it does not prevent or reduce crime and it risks executing innocent people although this is a highly emotional issue for many people i think it needs to be discussed with the facts here are answers to questions about the practical aspects of the death penalty system with sources listed below what about the risk of executing innocent people people on death rows have been released with evidence of their innocence doesn't dna keep new cases like these from happening dna is available in less than of all homicides it is not a guarantee against the execution of innocent people doesn't the death penalty prevent others from committing murder no reputable study shows the death penalty to be a deterrent to be a deterrent a punishment must be sure and swift the death penalty is neither homicide rates are higher in states and regions that have it than in states that do not so what are the alternatives life without parole is now on the books in states it means what it says it is sure and swift and rarely appealed life without parole is less expensive than the death penalty but isn't the death penalty cheaper than keeping criminals in prison the death penalty costs much more than life in prison mostly because of the legal process anytime the death penalty is a possible sentence extra costs start to mount up even before a trial continuing through the uniquely complicated trial actually separate stages mandated by the supreme court in death penalty cases and subsequent appeals what about the very worst crimes the death penalty isn t reserved for the worst of the worst but rather for defendants with the worst lawyers when is the last time a wealthy person was sentenced to death let alone executed doesn't the death penalty help families of murder victims not necessarily murder victim family members across the country argue that the drawn out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative so why don't we speed up the process over of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade if the process is speeded up we are sure to execute an innocent person Miscarriage of justice Life imprisonment Roper v.
