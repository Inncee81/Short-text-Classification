why are mom's the only people in the house who know how to clean the washroom i have been gone for three weeks i returned home entered the washroom and wow not once was it cleaned in the time i was away they all claimed they didn't know how to do you think it should be taught in school and then final exam to get to the next grade jjjjjjjjjjj you missed my humour of course i taught them you don't know me another person who feels they can mouth off without a clue or a sense of humour lol a never ending battle with the whole house not just the restroom i like your idea about teaching that in school funny i've said many times you guy's are gonna have this house condemmed if something ever happens to me of course they know how or at least could figure it out they just choose not to but when i'm sick they are so sweet and take over fully with no questions asked and fret over me terribly to take care of me and make sure i'm o k and don't need anything so i know they can do it if needed but i'm honestly trying to learn to enjoy life daily with my family and not worry or get so upsset over the smaller things i want to leave nothing but good memories i don't want my kids remembering me screaming about cleaning to toilet i want them to remember me laughing and having fun with them i know there should be a fine line here and teach them dicipline about being clean and taking care of things and i'm working on that too hopefully i'll get the right combo and figure this out but yeah your not the only one Social rule Joke Pitaten Washroom Pure Pwnage Shaggy dog story Pok__mon Live!
