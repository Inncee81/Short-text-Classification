why do so many non smokers act like they own the earth don't get me wrong non smokers have the right to breath fresh air but i have noticed that non smokers would really like to ban smoking on earth like it belongs to them the worst part about it is the burning of gasoline fuel is just as damaging if not more to the enviorment and human health but non smokers are still buying suv's and things like that it seems like they feel that their personal choice is better than the smokers personal choice like they're better than others how does anyone else feel about this well i'm not a smoker but i do agree with you people should be able to smoke out in public because the streets belong to everyone now restaurants are a different story those are private places so the owners should have the right to ban smoking or have a special section for those that do it what happened to this being a free country it seems like it's free until it bothers somebody and we have to accommodate the rules to their liking i believe smoking is unhealthy and i would personally never do it but i think that should be a one's choice if a person is smoking out in public and someone else doesn't like it then they should just move away from where they're at it's as simple as that Smoking ban Cigarette Tobacco smoking Causality The Smoking Room Theory of conduct Health insurance Tobacco advertising Cancer Cancer of the larynx Lung cancer Sport utility vehicle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tobacco Air pollution Microeconomics Cigar Waterworld Gasoline Adverse selection Goodness and value theory Firefighter Abortion debate Filling station Friends Fatality Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sauna Carbon dioxide Cigarette Smoking Man Externality Alcohol fuel Barbecue Gay rights Arguments for and against drug prohibition Sento Evil Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Spliff Green Day Economics Tocopherol Hand grenade Hookah Diving Public health Two-stroke cycle Center for Consumer Freedom Tank Epidemiology Fire Smoking pipe Theodicy Cocaine Office Transactional analysis Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 2005 trial of Michael Jackson STS-51-L Ten Commandments Publicly funded medicine Fish and chips Nicomachean Ethics Carburetor Cannabis (drug) Consensual crime Fox hunting Tlingit Energy development Coercion Prostate cancer 2000 Australian Grand Prix September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Utilitarianism Smoke-screen Alignment (role-playing games) Hybrid vehicle Mojave people Taxicab Fecal incontinence Sexual orientation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Genetically modified food Liberalism Paternalism Capitalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism United States Department of Health and Human Services Pneumonia Act of Parliament Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Separation of church and state Anger management Public domain Episodes of Lost (Season 1)
