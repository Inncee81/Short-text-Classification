this question requires a thoughtful answer ok living in australia i am very lucky to have plenty of food free healthcare education and freedom as are many many people in the world when you are blessed with these things and you see the ads on tv with starving children and people dying of disease in other parts of the world do you feel guilty i get torn when trying to decide what to do with money should i live in a small but decent house drive a cheaper car wear fake diamonds and have fake louis vuitton so that i can donate all of the money left over to try and make other people's lives better i said to my mum that i feel like i want to give away everything i don't need to help people who have nothing and she said amanda we only have one life and you have to live it for you and your own your time on earth is short so don't spend your life feeling upset about other peoples lives so my question is what is the right thing to do assuming that there is no heaven because i dont want to bring religion into it oh and let me just say i am not all superficial and everything i was using the louis vuitton and diamonds as an example i am trying to ask if we should cut down on our material possessions to give food and medicine to other people even though those material possessions might make us happy you can thank the british for the non industrialized africa it's because of them they never went through their industrial revolution thats my example of starving people sick homeless people don't feel guilty feel blessed people have to want to help themselves and instead of giving them everything we should teach them how to do it themselves Altruism Louis Vuitton EastEnders Knots Landing Mother Teresa Publicly funded medicine Sant Thakar Singh Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Summa Theologiae The Amber Spyglass Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Microeconomics Social rule Marie Antoinette Ten Commandments Live Aid Economy of Africa Scientology U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Human Sola fide America's Cup Current teachings of Prem Rawat Past teachings of Prem Rawat Food and Drug Administration About a Boy Religion Quackery Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Anthroposophy Live 8 Diamond Scientology beliefs and practices Ty Cobb Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Guns, Germs, and Steel Le Malade imaginaire Apology (Plato) Reincarnation Roman Catholic Church Animism Health insurance Nineteen Eighty-Four Samuel Goldwyn Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Luke and Laura Spencer Night (book) Free trade The Apprentice 2 Abortion debate The Catcher in the Rye Spiritism The Wall Shamanism Jiddu Krishnamurti Immortality Theodicy Neolithic Revolution Muslim ibn Aqeel Rent (musical) Supernatural The nature of God in Western theology 2005 Kashmir earthquake Buddhism Health care in the United States Incarnations of Immortality Bill Maher Drill bit Rudolf Hermann Lotze Predestination Church of Christ, Scientist Pitaten Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Plains Indians A Course In Miracles Same-sex marriage in Canada Free will Anarchism and society Meaning of life Rich Mullins Ayyavazhi mythology Binge eating disorder Jacob John Titor Clothing Knife American Red Cross God Happiness Kodocha Poker jargon Justification (theology) Nation of Islam Education The Invisibles Soul Poverty
