any suggestion in eliminating bad luck you just know when you are in bad luck chains of bad things keep happening despite effort to change that any suggestion my bad luck includes for example no one answers the question i posted someone hit my car and ran away and i have to pay for the fix out of my own pocket stepping on gum for no reason i didn't believe in luck for sometimes i used to think bad things happen for a reason and that we can learn from it and make ourselves stronger but bad things just happen and sometimes there's no lesson to be learn nor make the world better face it there's no such a thing as bad luck what there is it's cause and effect on our own decisions that we take being responsible and irresponsible there's a bit of karma involved and this has to do a lot with your personal actions toward yourself and others so take it easy and everytime something happen to you take it as an opportunity to learn to be better more selfconcious less materialistic and more toward evolving as a better being Luck Causality Social rule Predestination Theory of conduct Determinism Theodicy Kimi Finster Rincewind Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Poker jargon Ethics I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Magical thinking Mojave people Meme Pitaten Free will Plame affair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Bad Wolf Whose Line Is It Anyway?
