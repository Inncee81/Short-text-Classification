should we avoid buing products from countries where child labour is an issue there are those who believe that our purchases keep children in chains and those who say that poverty creates child labor and by improving the income of impoverished households we help reduce the workload of children what do you think the short answer is no if you did boycott then two things would happen the children would have nothing at all and in most cases this money although what we in the west call slave labour is in most cases in line with the cost of living in these countries and their families depend on this income to live as the job market is limited and there is no social security as in britain to sustain them the already fragile economies of these countries would collapse as their would be even less foreign income into the country if we go down the route some people are calling for ie paying a realistic price for these goods you would find again what would happen these increased prices we would theoretically pay would not be passed on to the workers involved and if you think about it the respective governments could and would not allow this to happen because contrary to what a lot of people think their economy is mainly based on internal issues and if a certain minority altough a significant minority suddenly began receiving western style salaries then the internal economy would disintegrate a lot of essential internal items would overnight be subject to price hikes and the governments couldn't stop it and they certainly couldn't increase local salaries to counterbalance if you think of it in terms of britain the average salary in britain is ponds per year and the cost of living is roughly the same if you take essential costs the average salary in a lot of third world countries dollars per month and the average cost of living is roughly the same so what would happen if a significant minority suddenly started getting western style salaries and the majority are still on local salaries think about it because as much as we criticise it's less than years ago britain was also using child labour to keep a few priveliged people in comfort and it was only though internal struggle via unions and a few politicians who came from working class backgrounds that things improved here over in most underdeveloped countries there are no free and impartial elections it is more likely a dictatorial style of government similar to the ones we had when child labour was being used here ie only the rich were in power and if you were working class you had no chance of getting in parliament alittle bit like today but at least you have an oportunity to try Gross domestic product Free trade Minimum wage Microeconomics Economic inequality Capitalism Trade union Anarchism and capitalism Progressive tax Labor theory of value Great Depression Capital accumulation Inflation Privatization Political economy Labor-power Labour economics Surplus value Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of Pakistan Publicly funded medicine Productive and unproductive labour Economy of Africa Health insurance Democracy Trade Unemployment Compensation of employees Tariff Commodity Flat tax Arbitrage Economy of India Canadian and American economies compared Deflation (economics) Article One of the United States Constitution 1973 oil crisis Wal-Mart Soviet Union Economy of Russia Mutual fund Supply and demand Monetary policy Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Graduate school Balassa-Samuelson effect Eight hour day Gold standard Libertarian socialism Euroscepticism Surplus labour Economy of the United States New Deal Fair trade Taxation in the United States Hyperinflation Industrial Revolution History of the United States (1918-1945) Principal-agent problem Contract Euro Asian financial crisis Economy of Belgium Globalization Economy of El Salvador Wealth Ethical consumerism Elections in the United Kingdom Zambia Economy of Norway Canadian House of Commons Sweatshop Economy of Chile Primitive accumulation of capital Australian Labor Party Insurance Offshoring Social Security (United States) Education in the People's Republic of China Arturo Frondizi Economic history of Japan Tuition Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Famine Karl Marx U.S. public debt Ford Motor Company
