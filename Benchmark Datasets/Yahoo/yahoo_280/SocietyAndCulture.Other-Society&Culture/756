if you suddenly became an over night sensation how would it change you do you think you could take all the attention both welcome and otherwise without it going to your head would you maintain your current friendships or move away and start a new life would you try and use your income and influence to change the world or would you just pocket the cash and put your feet up by the swimming pool i know how we all love to celebrity bash sometimes but do you honestly think you could do any better and if so how i would move away but still keep all my old friends in fact i'd invite the best of them to come with me i would definitely use my income to help people i'd find little ways to help people on an individual level like meeting people who are down and out and asking them if they could do one thing to get their lives where they want it what would they do and if it's reasonable helping them to accomplish it i would help to house homeless families and leave really huge tips everywhere i go the attention would be hard to take paparazzi are ruthless sometimes and i love my privacy i don't really like to celebrity bash but when they do really dumb crap like hit a parked car in a parking lot and leave without talking to the other owner or leaving a note despite the fact that there's a dozen people photographing you doing it britney ever heard of hit and run that really is just laughable Mojave people Shaggy dog story The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Donovan Britney Spears EastEnders Sant Thakar Singh Homelessness Carl G.
