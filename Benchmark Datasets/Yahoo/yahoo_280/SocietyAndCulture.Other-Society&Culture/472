am i in the wrong place i started a new and lucrative job some few weeks ago the job is fine and good i like it i have no intention of leaving it in the near future but one thing i have noted is that the canteen is full of mags with nude and semi naked girls even during tea breaks the guys can spend a good mins discussing girls in the daily papers i just feel out of place just go sit off by yourself and bring a good book and say that you are just wanting to read the latest dective novel or something if that bothers you don't do it most of the guys who do that are jerks anyway Avenue Q Spice Girls Friends The Catcher in the Rye W.
