what would you do here is the situation i know some friends that are to say the least welloff one has a problem with his kidneys he has said to me if my blood type is the same as his would i donate a kidney to him and he would make sure im financially stable for the next years what do i do or what would you do thanks guys and gals he is a really good friend iv known him for about years now and if i did i wouldn do it for the money its friendship but he said either way he would find a way of putting the money in my account think about how healthy are you if you are healthy you can live with one undamaged kidney no problem being a donor would cause you physical discomfort and distress at the time but that will quickly pass knowing that you have made a difference to someones life will stay with you forever browny points in heaven you will get no thanks from the rest of society people in fact may look down on you for selling your kidney rather than giving it away would taking money cause you problems with your conscience that may be hard to deal with if the person has money to spare and is in no hardship after giving you the money then since you would be the only available candidate you are giving this person a chance to live a gift that has such a high value no amount of money in the world could buy it if it is not an offer induced as an act of desperation or if the person offering is alright with it and you are not prompting them for the amount of money then i would say go ahead but make sure you and the person understand there may be medical complications for either party and what happens if your kidney fails once in his body does he still pay you Organ transplant Theory of conduct Kidney National Kidney Foundation Singapore Organ donation Health insurance Divorce Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Poker jargon Life insurance Microeconomics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Contract Urinary incontinence Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Infantilism Estoppel Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Diabetes mellitus Pitaten Annuity Social rule Supply and demand Hypoglycemia 401(k) Mutual fund Sant Thakar Singh Abortion debate Pneumonia Prostate cancer Trust (Law) USA Insulin Dialysis Blood transfusion Stomach cancer Utilitarianism Nicomachean Ethics Insurance Blood Flat tax Unemployment Breastfeeding Glycogen storage disease type I Atkins Nutritional Approach Kidney transplantation Justification (theology) Socrates Knots Landing American Red Cross Coercion Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Bond Wealth Humphrey Bogart Alcoholics Anonymous Live 8 Simone Weil Babe Ruth Surveillance Electrophysiology PE ratio Panic attack Economy of Russia Capitalism HIV test Jon Secada Monetary policy Elections in the United States Edward Gibbon Wakefield Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Economy of the United States Mojave people Deflation (economics) Dieting The nature of God in Western theology Psychosis Turner syndrome Sleep Sola fide Folic acid Inflation Heaven MMORPG Panay incident Property (ownership right) Blood donation Humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Diabetic nephropathy Canadian federal election, 1993 Mortgage Campaign finance in the United States Charles Ponzi Spanking Personal finance Anarchism and capitalism In vitro fertilisation
