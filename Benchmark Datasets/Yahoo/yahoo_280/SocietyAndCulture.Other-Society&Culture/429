how to gain some confidence and be a good leader every single time i really want to run for being a president of a club at school or just live my life i always think what if people don't like me what are they going to think about me will i actaully be a good leader and these thoughts and questions always get in the way of me reaching my goals i also have a naturally small voice so i guess that contributes to my lack of confidence also or is it that my voice is small because i'm unconfident oh i don't know truthfully i feel really stupid that i let these thoughts get to me and i really want to change myself and the image of what other people see me as because i'm pretty sure i come off as a shy and unconfident person please give me some advice d being a good leader to me means being committed being willing to take responsibility and being true to one's own ethics regardless of popularity i am reserved and introvert myself but i found myself a leader in many situations it's easier when i see others afraid to take the lead i'm impatient so i would take on the role of a leader just to get things going in group sessions leadership like any other skill takes practice the more often you take on the responsibility of a leader the easier it gets with time you may be a leader already and not know it my twin sister is such a take no quarter person and was charismatic she was always a leader in sports in groups of friends in the workplace and clubs i didn't realize till later on in life that i had a leadership role in my family dynamics among my own group of friends and in my own interests remember that despite polls and the media driven democratic process a true leader does not care about being liked only doing what's right i've known people who ran for office in hs didn't get elected but the courage to try and learn something from unsuccessful opportunities made them a leader later on in life no leader becomes one without risk no great leader becomes one without taking something enriching away from every circumstance while i don't think a loud voice means confidence and it often means the opposite you can modulate your tone to express something with finality rather than with a question at the end ever hear someone whose every sentence sounds like a question makes me wonder if they believe in anything they say chin up if a soft spoken shy person like me can now enjoy the spotlike and the power of being a leader so can you Consensus decision-making Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Singlish Scientology beliefs and practices Plame affair Jon Secada Leadership Workplace democracy Ethics Time Out of Mind Social psychology Canadian House of Commons Kim Possible Theory of conduct Sharon Tate Milton H.
