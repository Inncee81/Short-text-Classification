how many of you are pro choice and feel that its a women's right to choose i believe it is a woman's right to choose because their is no reasonable way to stop them this may sound draconian so please let me explain abortion may be amoral but i do not believe that it should be illegal making abortion illegal does not stop abortions from being performed it just makes them more dangerous and more difficult to get if one is poor i believe that if a person wants to prevent abortions that person should work toward solving the issues which lead to unwanted pregnancies unprotected sex lack of sex education etc it is proven that the more education a person receives the more opportunities which become open to them the fewer children they have many tout adoption as a reasonable alternative to abortion i feel this argument is disingenuous to the reality of the state of foster care in america and the very real danger and expense of bringing a child to term most children adopted by americans are adopted from other countries very few american children who get put up for adoption ever get adopted orphanages are inadequately funded and probably understaffed or mismanaged most of the children growing up there will suffer from severe emotional and psychological problems it costs about to have a baby in a hospital in america today if the person having that baby cannot pay they become either indebted or the hospital state will defray the cost to everyone else through taxes and higher medical costs finally lets not forget that giving birth while natural can be very dangerous even if the baby is healthy the mother may suffer from lasting physical effects some of you may feel these women should suffer the consequences of their actions but don't forget that the child and the rest of society must suffer those consequences as well until more people in this country show a willingness and interest in adopting american born children until that problem is solved i don't believe we can reasonably suggest that adoption is a perfect alternative let's stop getting hung up on whether or not the practice is right or wrong and lets work together to reach a solution even the people who want the option of having an abortion don't actually ever want to get one Abortion debate Adoption Abortion in the United States Abortion Breastfeeding Divorce Transsexuality Infantilism Roe v.
