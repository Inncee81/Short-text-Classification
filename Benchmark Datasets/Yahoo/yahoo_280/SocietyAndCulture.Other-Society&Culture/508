does any one else feel lost i read answers and see questions and i can barely read them without crying so much hatred so much judgment why why do so many people want to hurt others or ridicule them is there only a small amount of love and kindness out there i love all of u like brothers and sisters and it tears me apart to hear what some of u say to others who only want answers does any one even feel how bad its become or are all of you immune to the unkindness in this world whatever u may say where ever or who ever u may be i will always love you guys but please someone tell me is there any kindness in this world any love yes gentle butterfly there is kindness i love you too there are many loving people in this world and many of my contacts are just such loving people of many different religions try to look at it objectively by their fruits ye shall know them in other words even those who are cruel and unkind are witnesses for the truth their inner pain lashes out to cause more pain in others their inner pain stems from the fact that they have lost connection with god's love because they disbelieve some of the deepest truths you know some very beautiful truths you know that everyone is worthy of love and kindness and respect there are many other people like you in this world sister hugs Theodicy Simone Weil Charles Darwin's views on religion Merit Evil Nineteen Eighty-Four Theory of conduct Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Stoicism A Course In Miracles Goodness and value theory Love Sola fide John Howard Yoder EastEnders Michel Henry Mahatma Gandhi Holy Spirit Ten Commandments W.I.T.C.H.
