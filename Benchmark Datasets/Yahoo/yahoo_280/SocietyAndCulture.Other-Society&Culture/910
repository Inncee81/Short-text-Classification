what do you think of stereotypes in general have you been a victim of one personally i think stereotypes are the domain of the dumb and ignorant i was at a pastors' home once and i was playing with their cat huge fangs lol i said to the pastors' wife i love cats i'm a guy and this dumb religous woman gave me this filthy look of disgust like as if i had pulled my pants down and crapped in their lounge room and said that's weird weird because a guy shouldn't like cats obviously by her dumbass religous conviction i'm a poof trouble is i also love black sabbath oh well one cancels out the other i was in hospital once and i saw a guy on an emergency trolley that was obviously a horse rider and he had pantyhose on no riding boots on and you should have seen his girlfriend wife absolutely drop dead gorgeous i'm no better sometimes at uni there was this guy who talked effeminately and i thought was gay however he was engaged to this really cute chic tell me what stereotypes you hate or have been subject to i've known big tough blokey guys that love to cook i've known women that love to work on their homes and work with manual power tools i've seen spoilt rotten poor kids and honestly raised hard working rich kids and sure i've seen the spoilt rich ones and the hard working poor ones i've seen tender emotional men and hard as nails women what i'm trying to say is that stereotypes of what i've seen are complete nonsense well we all are victims of stereotyping and i think that is what creates racism prejudice people find it weird that i listen to alternative rock instead of hip hop just because i'm black there is this idea in cultural groups that if you don't meet those stereotypes for ex talk like a black person that you just can't fit in i think the worst stereotypes are associated with race or religion and the media and statistics play a great role in stereotyping people hispanic maids black drugdealers asian scientists fashion conscious feminine gay men rich white people you know prejudice is a social disease and stereotyping even for fun is not okay it always ends up offending someone Gender role Physical attractiveness Married... with Children Sexual orientation The Fairly OddParents Human sexual behavior Bisexuality "Weird Al" Yankovic Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Little Britain Joke Grunge music Friends Sin City Garfield Political correctness Homosexuality Eminem Eric Cartman Media and ethnicity Stock character Kyle Broflovski Ren and Stimpy RuneScape quests The Marshall Mathers LP Gay slang Porgy and Bess Recurring South Park characters Fictional character Black (people) Hip hop music Boston Public American Psycho Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Blackface Asian fetish Phoebe Buffay's songs Transsexuality Pride and Prejudice Gender-neutral language Skinhead Great Teacher Onizuka Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Zoophilia Minstrel show Social rule Alcoholics Anonymous Effeminacy SpongeBob SquarePants Kylie Minogue White trash Moe Szyslak David Bowie Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Gay The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Something Positive 2000 Australian Grand Prix South Park Kim Possible Seven (film) Butch and femme Domestic violence Miss Saigon History of subcultures in the 20th century Trailer Park Boys Fred Phelps Political views of Lyndon LaRouche Beavis and Butt-head Dilbert The Young Ones (TV series) WNNX (FM) Feminism Yoko Ono The Jim Rome Show Johnny Cash Fruits Basket Death Hip hop culture Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Religion Jam (TV series) Moral Politics Internet phenomenon Aerial (dance move) Baldness
