a question about people human nature i've noticed just be studying people how people will divide themselves with certain people like all the latino guys girls with all hang out with the latinos allt he black guys girls are all in one group as well now it doesn't mean that they are racist because they like everyone but some how all the latinos will be on one side and all the blacks will be on one side i wonder why is human nature like that in people this is at my school places like that the something goes with other things like all the cute girls hang with the cute girls and the ones in the middle hang with the ones in the middle sorry y'all if i don't make no sense at all but i have a hard time trying to type questions to make it were people get what i'm trying to say o my gosh i'm so sorry that i have made several mistakes in my question but it wouldn't let me go back and edited it please leave nice answers please thanks don't worry about the mistakes it happens to us all as for the group thing yeah i've noticed that it happens a lot in some cases it might be some sort of prejudice but in most cases i think it's more like people like to hang out with others who come from the same background or have the same interests some are connected through association through their families and become friends that way i also think that it's easier to belong to a group that you can identify with instead of being the odd one out in a group you might get along with but that may never understand things totally from your perspective no matter how nice they are or how much they try to understand its little things mostly like if one person wants to just chit chat about an awesome dinner he had he doesn't want to have to explain what he's talking about such as a shwarma might have misspelled that a shwarma is a really great middle eastern sandwich type thing if person a wanted to tell his friend person b where he could get a really tasty shwarma he doesn't want to have to first explain what a shwarma is it is aggravating to have to explain everything before a person conveys the intended message and it can feel a lot like defending yourself and or your culture however if person a and person b were of the same cultural background he could just say hey man go to ali's they have great shwarma and that part of the conversation would be over and done with person b understanding totally what was being talked about with no further explanation i don't think its really anything wrong going on just being with others of your own culture is more comfortable and feels more secure it's usually easier for people to relate to others who have a similar background that's all anyway my opinion only but how i see it Theory of conduct Social rule Plame affair Philosophy of language Friends Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Sexual orientation Black (people) Theodicy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism Little Britain Meaning of life Social psychology The nature of God in Western theology Hiberno-English Avenue Q Extreme Programming Transactional analysis Goodness and value theory Free will Nicomachean Ethics Religion Transsexuality Blood on the Tracks Ethics Philosophical skepticism The Lovely Bones Intelligent design Creationism Deconstruction Internet troll Supernatural Cult Guns, Germs, and Steel Meaning Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Brian Griffin A Course In Miracles Evolutionary creationism Kodocha Scientific method God Emperor of Dune Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Causality Extras (sitcom) Dualism (philosophy of mind) Patriotism EastEnders Shaggy dog story Ludwig Wittgenstein Noam Chomsky Prostate cancer Science K' Donald Davidson (philosopher) Identity and change Epistemology Moral Politics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Socrates Discordianism The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Abduction Phenomenon Infant baptism Philosophy of mathematics John Wycliffe Opus Dei Hey Arnold!
