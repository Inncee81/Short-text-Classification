do you think the naked human body is disgusting please read because of recent debates on reporting graphic material on ya i had to ask this important question when i have encountered certain report content question people will say well that's just disgusting or i hate that and so on from there so my question is do you think that the naked human body is disgusting and or naked pictures of anyone is disgusting male and or female then i would like to hear from everyone who answers the educated answer why you have come to this conclusion about the naked human body i would ask that you think about this one before you answer please don't be a hypocrite regarding previous answers thanks being a nudist i am not ashamed or disgusted by nudity for pure nudity sake like groups of ppl being nude together or ppl at a nude beach or nude resort or nude exercising swimming socializing this i would say is not considered vulgar or perverted at least to me but what i would consider vulagar nudity is when being nude is when nudity in film photos or in drawing or in person is showing copulation or things in ofrices of the human body porn is not very appealing to me its vulgar but nudity in artistic depictions of the nude human is very acceptable and the human being is a beautiful creation that should not be concealed behind yards of unnecessary cloth early ancient ppls and civilizations had many forms of art sculpture drawings carvings paintings of the nude human figure and the religious places of worship had and continue to have nude works of art the only reason nudity is not allowed and more common in everyday life in the u s is because hollywood and the media have sensationized on strong victorian puritan based morals and laws that we inherited from europe that say nudity is sinful and wrong my augument is that ancient civilizations like the romans greeks chinese egyptian and even some modern day civilizations on the amazon had and have no problem with the nude human even the bible discusses how adam and eve were nude and happy and god was pleased that what he created was in the nude so all this adds upto is that nudism is not wrong at all its the religious right and media that continues to make nudism a crime and they continue to make or have made laws based on narrow religious views and make public nudity a crime of indecency when its not at all my being nude in public is not hurting anyone physically at all if done in a appropiate surroundings like hiking or swimming worshipping nature yoga in the nude at state and national parks or even local municipal parks but not being nude at places where the young are like kiddie areas playgrounds public pools etc Nudity in sport Child pornography Pornography Hentai Sculpture Religion Ten Commandments Video game controversy Pornography in Japan Creationism Human Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Original sin Art in Ancient Greece Origin belief Motion picture rating system Justification (theology) Indecent pseudo-photograph of a child Homosexuality and Christianity Adam and Eve God Nude beach Swimming pool Sharon Tate Social aspects of clothing Figure drawing Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion debate MPAA film rating system Religious conversion Homosexuality Modesty Zoophilia Simone Weil Sauna Sexual orientation Religion and sexuality Undergarment Property (ownership right) Swimming Infant baptism Paradise Lost Renaissance Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Separation of church and state Capital punishment Taoism Indecent exposure Soul Judaism Reincarnation Eastern Orthodox Church Modernism Censorship in Australia Idolatry Neopaganism Atomism Art Religion and sexual orientation Theodicy Teach the Controversy Alan Campbell (pastor) Theory of conduct Young Earth creationism Philosophy Charles Grandison Finney A Course In Miracles New Testament David Hume Puritan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Evil Same-sex marriage YMCA Trinity History of creationism Jewish views of religious pluralism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Philo Supernatural Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Appeal Satan EastEnders Consciousness State The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Swimsuit Clothing
