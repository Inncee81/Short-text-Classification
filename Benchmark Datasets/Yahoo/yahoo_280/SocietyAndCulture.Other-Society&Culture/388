do you agree with me on this i believe everyone is intitled to their own opinion but what really bugs me is when people start mothing off their opinions and are totaly ignorant about the subject at hand for instance i was watching wife swap the other night and the military mom traded place with the anti bush anti america family what really buged me was that the song of the antibush family was all like war is bad and at one point even stated war hasnt accomplished anything that really made me mad if you are going to start saying your opinion at least be educated of the topic you are arguing i mean we dont have slavery any more we have freedom we have rights we fought so he can have the right to run his mouth without being stonned to death it just bugs me how ignorant and how uneducated people can be about things if they are going to debate and make their opionions then they should at least have some knowledge of what they are talking about i am all for freedom of opinions but seriously yup i agree you can't argue debate or support your opinions without full knowledge of the subject i mean you could but you'd be making a fool of yourself Democracy U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Abortion debate Dred Scott v.
