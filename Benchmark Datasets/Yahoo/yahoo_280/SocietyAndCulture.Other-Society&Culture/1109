should family farms be saved i've heard a lot of people talking about how family farms are disappearing and being replaced by huge farms run by companies a lot of people talk about how we need to save the family farms however i've run across a rather disturbing statistic apparently the highest rate of work related deaths and injuries suffered by children are on family run farms it appears that having young children around all the powerful machinery used in modern farming is rather dangerous maybe farms should be run by companies that only use adult labor and not by families that have their children involved in doing work that can be so hazardous any thoughts on this subject no i am a firm believer in the family farm i along with my cousins have grown up on our family farm i think we are better people for that we understand a hards days work and that not every job is suppose to be fun or easy we along with other kids that grew up on farms have a better work ethic than some kids who didn't grow up on a farm because of this we learned responsibilty because well those h and ffa hogs and sheep and cows were ours and they weren't going to feed or water themselves i for one take from my farm experiences when it comes to something else while other people complain that something is hard i just think 'this isn't hard now halter breaking that calf that was hard' i'm not trying to say that it's not dangerous to have kids and even adults around farm machinery because it is i do feel though that todays elementary school age farm kids are being better educated on the risks around the family farm than when i was in elementary school last spring my ffa chapter did a farm safety presentation to the elementary school in our district that probably has the most farm kids attending it in a fun yet informative manner the kids learned about a variety of safety topics including tractor safety atv safety plant safety animal safety and general safety which included safe clothing for farm activities chemicals etc as an elementary student i'm an hs senior now i never had any kind of presentation like this in the years i was there they usually spent there time telling us to not smoke drink do other drugs and overlooked what was the danger to us farm kids farm accidents i'm glad that there are programs being presented like this now that i was able to be a part of presenting it in conclusion i believe that eliminating the family farm is not the answer but better informing the kids that live play and work on those farms is i think this might be group that we did our presentation through so if anyone's curious http www fs jk org Organic farming Livestock Agriculture Factory farming Milton H.
