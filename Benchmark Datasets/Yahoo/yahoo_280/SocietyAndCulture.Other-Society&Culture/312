when you was what time was you allowed back home after a day out answerrr sorry i meant when you were people on here are really quick to judge when people make mistakes but think about this im currently doing gcse's im expected to get a's and why are you going on about a curfew i have never got involved with the police most of my time i am at home studying or out with my friends and i stay out of trouble i posted this question out of pure curiousity and i would like to say dont judge a book by its cover and the people that made them comments to apologise i imagine that it depends on the child i was allowed out until whatever time i chose but i was always in the house before pm this was mainly out of respect for my parents because they had to work early now i did good in school and i was a very well behaved child that my parents trusted i have three brothers that skipped school stole money from my parents destroyed things and so on they were not allowed to go anywhere they also had to be in bed at a certain time and i did not i wouldn't push the issues with your parents because you are still a child parents do not make rules just to make rules if you had a job your parents might be a bit more lenient my point is your parents have to trust you once you honestly have your parents trust you'd be surprised by how much more authority over your own life that they give you Theory of conduct Social rule Polyamory 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Plame affair Blankets (graphic novel) Justification (theology) No Child Left Behind Act Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Alignment (role-playing games) Scouting Social Security (United States) The nature of God in Western theology Poker jargon Article One of the United States Constitution Social psychology James Bulger Kender The Catcher in the Rye Education in Germany Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Carl Barks Prince Edmund (Blackadder) EastEnders Eddie Guerrero W.I.T.C.H.
