what do you think of this my boss sent me this in an email i think it's very true despite the humor of it i'd like to know what you think obituary common sense today we mourn the passing of a beloved old friend common sense who has been with us for many years no one knows for sure how old he was since his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape he will be remembered as having cultivated such valuable lessons as knowing when to come in out of the rain why the early bird gets the worm life isn't always fair and maybe it was my fault common sense lived by simple sound financial policies don't spend more than you earn and reliable parenting strategies adults not children are in charge his health began to deteriorate rapidly when well intentioned but overbearing regulations were set in place reports of a six year old boy charged with sexual harassm ent for kissing a classmate teens suspended from school for using mouthwash after lunch and a teacher fired for reprimanding an unruly student only worsened his condition common sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doing the job they themselves failed to do in disciplining their unruly children it declined even further when schools were required to get parental consent to administer aspirin sun lotion or a sticky plaster to a student but could not inform the parents when a student became pregnant and wanted to have an abortion common sense lost the will to live as the ten commandments became contraband churches became businesses and criminals received better treatment than their victims common sense took a beating when you couldn't legally defend yourself from a burglar in your own home and the burglar can sue you for assault common sense finally gave up the will to live after a woman failed to realize that a steaming cup of coff ee was hot she spilled a little in her lap and was promptly awarded a huge settlement common sense was preceded in death by his parents truth and trust his wife discretion his daughter responsibility and his son reason he is survived by three stepbrothers i know my rights someone else is to blame and i'm a victim not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone cinnamon for president common sense died when political correctness was born sometime in the mid 's i hate that common sense has passed but believe that it still thrives in the heart and souls of many of us i think of common sense like i do jesus christ passed but will rise again political correctness is the anti christ and will someday be defeated and banished to hell i hope i am alive to see the day i partially blame bill cosby and the television shows created around the time of his cosby show yes they had good morals but the viewers took things way too far family ties mr belvedere diff'rent strokes and other similar shows gave birth to political correctness i give credit to new shows like my name is earl south park the daily show all try to show some form of common sense thinking in their writing and scripts perhaps they are giving birth to the next generation of people with common sense who can create a large enough army to defeat the politically correct Knots Landing Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Infantilism Hillary Rodham Clinton Church of Christ, Scientist Cultural Revolution Fred Phelps Theory of conduct Boston Public Intelligent design movement Insurance Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Charmed 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Age of consent Jon Secada Richard Littlejohn Spanking Ten Commandments Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Friends Scientology beliefs and practices John Howard Yoder One Life to Live Beavis and Butt-head Roman Catholic Church Abortion Sharon Tate Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Days of our Lives Separation of church and state Mystique (comics) Domestic violence Spidey Super Stories Marriage For Better or For Worse Sin Fahrenheit 9/11 Irna Phillips Coffee Mother Teresa Democratic Party (United States) Shaggy dog story Education in the People's Republic of China Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Divorce Abortion in the United States Royal Assent South Park Sexual abuse Charles Grandison Finney Eastern Orthodox Church Situation comedy Columbine High School massacre Original sin Appeal Child sexuality Affirmative action James I of England Only Fools and Horses Birth control Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword George W.
