why is it so bad to call highly controversial i know whys it so bad and malicious to call a black person black because thats what they are or if u call them the oh so horrible n word when i hear them call each other that all the time people call white people white and cracker and hoes all the time and we dont do anything but black people take advantage of their race i think they even say words like that in their rap songs im not racist its just something ive noticed and im not trying to offend anyone i actually have a few friends of different races than me all african americans as well i would like to hear your opinions nice ones please i have many friends of all colors but i am very tired of black people segregating themselves by insisting on being called something different i remember when negro was a term of respect then they decided they were black then they were african americans even though had never been to africa then it was people of color we're all people of color it's just that our color is not all the same then we owed them because their ancestors had been slaves in our area we had an annual miss black marshall county and a miss marshall county which was open to everyone we could not have a miss white marshall county it's always something for some of them if jesse jackson and al sharpton would go back in their hole in the ground and shut up it would solve a lot of problems for all of us it's not the color of the person that matters as mlk said it's the content of their character African American Black (people) Negro Nation of Islam Nigger Racial segregation NAACP Jesse Jackson Al Sharpton Racism Rosa Parks African American literature African American history Blackface Affirmative action Martin Luther King, Jr. Porgy and Bess White (people) Brown v.
