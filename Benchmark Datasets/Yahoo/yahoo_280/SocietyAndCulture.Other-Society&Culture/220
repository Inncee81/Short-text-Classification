have you noticed that in a small town when your're riding in a car and you pass somebody they always glare at you until you wave then when you wave they cheer up and wave back it happened to me yesterday it was funny small towns are just like that as a kid my father who grew up in a small town pop would wave at everyone as he passed them every time i'd ask do you know them nope just being friendly it's something i've adopted as an adult sure makes the trip better and keeps me more aware of my surroundings instead of getting caught up in a song or what happened at the office Pop punk The Marshall Mathers LP Shaggy dog story Cliff Richard Green Day Battles of Lexington and Concord New Wave music Kyle Broflovski Aladdin (1992 film) Remix Younger Than Yesterday Polarization Radar Olivia Newton-John Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Terry Bogard Hey Jude A Day in the Life American comic book Carpenters Octopus card Death rock Super Bowl XXXVIII Passenger car T.
