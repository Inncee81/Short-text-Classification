did you ever know someone who completely changed in looks and personality anyone ever knew someone as a preteen and early teen and then saw them as an adult who was compeltely different it's funny because people always tell me i look sooooo different like a whole different race different but then i'll run into someone i haven't seen in like years and they'll still recognize me so i don't know what that's about but yes i agree i look pretty different in terms of personality i'm more laid back the same as i always was but i don't allow people to see all of my nature so when they see me acting out of character they get surprised but that's because they don't know me Adolescence Theory of conduct SpongeBob SquarePants Infantilism Child Asperger syndrome Titans (comics) Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome Milton H.
