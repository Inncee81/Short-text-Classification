do you know what you like or do you like what you know a teacher once asked me this and i wanted to share it i mean when you hear a song on the radio for the first time how often do you really like it but once you get to know the song you may like it very much or with say beer how many young people like it the first time they try it but a lot drink it anyway and after awhile they begin to like it i dunno maybe a stupid question but what do you think i think you just answered your own question a lot of times people don't know what they like until they get to know it better also there is a lot to be said about the sheep mentality most people have they like what everybody else likes Little Britain Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Joke She Loves You Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Irony Prem Rawat Avenue Q Janet Jackson Radio Yerevan Pet Sounds The Beach Boys Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Marshall Mathers LP Australian words Liam Gallagher Muslim ibn Aqeel Asterix Red Hot Chili Peppers Year of the Spider University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point Homer Simpson Knots Landing Rich Mullins Theory of conduct Brian Jones (musician) Liza of Lambeth Sampling (music) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
