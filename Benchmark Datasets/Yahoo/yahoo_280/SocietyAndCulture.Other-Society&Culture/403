what would you do there is neither a right nor wrong answer to this question this is a situation i was in the other day and i made my own quick choice but i think it's a good question you are at a relative's nd birthday party and there are relatives there etc it has just started you are sitting in a chair with a can of pop sitting on the table beside you which is yours that you've been drinking a relative you are neither close to nor distant from meaning your relationship is good just not someone you tell very personal things to that you haven't seen in about months comes in he comes to give you a hug so you stand up and accidentally knock your can of pop over in the process it spills onto the table there is plastic covering the table which is what the pop spills on to none drips onto the floor just a drop onto your foot do you hug him first or do you quickly grab a napkin to soak up a little of the pop first why the hug can wait clean up the mess it would be the polite thing to do Social rule Menstrual cup Physical intimacy Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Poker jargon Goodness and value theory Dog training Nicomachean Ethics 2000 Australian Grand Prix Jennifer Lopez Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Piccolo Junior Saga Four square Rain Man Professional wrestling throws Birthday Professional wrestling match types Chair Blood Simple Diving Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Haven (TNG episode) Canadian Senate Dairy Happy Tree Friends Glen Jacobs Professional wrestling attacks Theory of conduct SAT Mark Calaway Current teachings of Prem Rawat Roman eating and drinking Mouse (computing) Charles Peace Milton H.
