why do people drive so fast when the light is red up ahead i can understand the thought process of a person trying to get through a green light before it changes but why do people floor it like ish in a mph zone when traffic is stopped ahead the light is going to be red for at least the next seconds so why do people weave in and out of traffic and try to get ahead of each other when everyone is going to end up at the same place anyways would you be wasting gas by constantly doing this i live in california yes that is wasting gas acceleartaing and slowing repeatedly does just that the purpose for this is to get ahead of the traffic they are trying to beat the odds that their path will remain open and they will get ahead of others it is also a move for attention seekers thrill seekers power seekers and morons it is dangerous even getting ahead by a couple cars is considered a victory by them i consider it to be a temporary victory against death who will inevitably will catch up with the person doing this and unfortunately to everyone near him my personal favorite is the moron who weaves in and out of traffic succeeds in getting ahead and then i pass him later down the highway he has slowed up because he is now on the cell phone and you guessed it a few minutes later he flies by the same people again thus putting them in harm's way again and no we do not all end up in the same place he will be going somewhere very hot and meet someone holding a red pitchfork for killing people lol i know what you are asking yes and for some reason getting there second before the rest of us do is important to these people Traffic light Toyota Prius Drag racing Interstate Highway Formula One regulations Tag Railway signalling Vehicular cycling 2000 Australian Grand Prix Speed limit Daylight saving time Spider Fast bowling Poker jargon Dog agility Warning sign Rules of the road Transportation of Los Angeles Road safety Hurricane Rita TGV Rescue of Giuliana Sgrena Freeway National Football League Lore Bike lane debate Road traffic accident Airport Team Fortress Classic Billboard (advertising) 24 Hours of Le Mans USS Tunny (SS-282) Traffic sign Fuel efficiency Renewable energy Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Past teachings of Prem Rawat Internal ballistics Nuclear power The Contender (television series) Hybrid vehicle Tenshinhan Gekisou Sentai CarRanger Tour de France Fire fighting Automobile 2005 European Grand Prix Ben Johnson (athlete) U.S. Highway 66 Light rail Motorway Sun Ravi Shastri Interchange (road) Action potential Jet engine Welding Elis Prefecture Autoroute Grand Theft Auto (game) Kitchen Radioactive waste Autobahn Volleyball Lane Knots Landing Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Collectibles in Bionicle 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Entropy Jiddu Krishnamurti Stop sign The Suffering (game) Level crossing Zeno's paradoxes Glossary of partner dance terms Thief (computer game) Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Ayrton Senna Chris Amon Hiawatha Line Road-rule enforcement camera G-Man (Half-Life) 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Swingout 2005 Iditarod Automatic number plate recognition Blood (computer game) Iditarod Public transport CPU cache 2003 North America blackout Drunk driving (United States) Highway Aerial (dance move) Hydrogen economy Internal combustion engine
