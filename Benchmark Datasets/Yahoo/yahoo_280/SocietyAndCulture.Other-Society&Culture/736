do you ever get sick of laws i know that law and order is supposed to help us get along with one another but do you ever think that someday we won't have any rights any more because of all the laws that are made abm well i was thinking about how everything is structured in society so that everyone is the same it is kind of annoying laws rules whatever it just seems like i pay a lot of tax money so that i can pay people to tell me what to do even if i don't agree with how it is being spent i don't have a choice i do my part by voting and paying attention to the political system i just find it a waste of time because it doesn't matter what i think someone else is going to make the decisions and then tell me that is what i have to do it just doen't make sense to me why can't our provinces just be self governed okay how about the gun registry program in canada estimated cost of the program billion that is right i said billion dollars dollars is it right that some farmer who has had his shot gun for years should now have to go and register it just so the government can make some extra cash and find out who has guns in their attic i agree that hand guns and semi automatic weapons should be registered because why do you need a handgun isn't there something that the citizens of canada could have their billion dollars worth of taxes find better uses for what is happening to our rights canada isn't a free country i pay plenty of money everyday and on every check and once a year just to live here i should be able to have more say in where my tax money is distributed and before stupid laws are put into place the citizens should have say in wheather or not the law is passed it shouldn't be voted on by senators sanators are appointed by the prime minister okay how about the
