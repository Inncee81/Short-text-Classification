is it true that skydiver have a lot of faith in their parachute before they make a move why is this so explain you deliberately jump out of the plane to die you have faith in god and because god is more powerful than the parachute you jump i have been jumping for two years and have made jumps i trust my equipment and inspect and maintain it i have two parachutes when jumping and i have had a malfunctioning main parachute cut it away and used my reserve i do not jump to die i jump to live for the time i'm in the air i get to fly with my friends and enjoy something that few have i get to take my life in my own hands and i am responsible for myself i do believe in a higher power but skydiving gives me a chance to determine my own life if i had to bring god into this which i'm not so sure is needed i figure the ability and opportunity to jump was given to me so i should and will take it if a higher power feels it is my time then i might be in a car on the road in bed sleeping or in the shower i should hope that i would be with my friends and doing something i love the sport is about living not dieing no skydiver has a death wish we jump because we love life and want to live it to the fullest Parachuting Parachute BASE jumping Paragliding The Amber Spyglass Paratrooper HALO/HAHO Free-fall Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Suicide methods Cliff Richard Equine conformation Tank The Parachute Regiment Joseph Kittinger Space Shuttle program Volleyball Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Sin Incarnations of Immortality Summa Theologiae Meaning of life Operation Market Garden The Bionic Woman U.S. 82nd Airborne Division Kakapo Diving Worms weapons and tools Structure of the British Army Gliding Religious Society of Friends Socrates Radio controlled airplane Penda of Mercia Sonic the Hedgehog W.I.T.C.H.
