could you please give me your honest opinion about this question at this mental facility a consumer patient attacked a man hurting him really really bad he had fractures to the head and face all together the man that got attacked was in nursing there was a man and a woman in a different department that yelled for people when this consumer attacked the man the two workers said they didn't try to stop it while this man was getting a beating because they didn't want to get hurt themselves they were afraid of losing their jobs and they were not in the same department as the man getting beat up this work place is bad about firing people if you interfere with matters that don't pertain to you especially when it comes to the consumers it seems like the system is on their side no matter what the two worker's that witnessed the attack was a man and a woman and now half of the building won't talk to them and they blamed the man more than the woman because he is a man and should have stepped in what do you think sorry this is so long but i had to explain thoroughly for you to understand what happened and give an honest opinion honestly the right thing to say was the should've jumped in and helped but until you're actually in the situation you can't really judge but i'm going to try i can see if they feared for their lives yes it's good they called for help but fearing for their jobs seems a little selfish to me but then again who am i to talk maybe if i was in their situation my actions might suprise me how severe was this man's mental illness was he coherent enough to be held accountable if not i can see how they couldn't hurt him in a perfect world they should have helped and honestly i don't think fear of losing a job is a good enough excuse when someone is getting very hurt however fearing for your life might impede your interference and that's just a natural instinct so i guess they can't be given too much blame if fearing for their own lives was the reason they didn't help they did call for help however if they were only looking out for their jobs maybe they do deserve blame i'm sorry i just don't think there's a total right answer here Theory of conduct Simone Weil Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Transactional analysis Free will Merit Rich Mullins Insanity defense Sydney Riot of 1879 Theodicy Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Goodness and value theory The Apprentice 2 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina The nature of God in Western theology Social rule Nicomachean Ethics Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.
