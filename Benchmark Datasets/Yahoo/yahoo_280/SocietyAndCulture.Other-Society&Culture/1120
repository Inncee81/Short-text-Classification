if a pandemic swept the globe killing to billion humans would that really be such a bad thing of course at the time it would be a bit of a shame but concidering that we have no natural preditors we're living longer and the birth rate is rising would that not be better than a serious overpopulation problem possably resulting in the end of our species everyone dies but i'm sure that like me a lot of you would like humanity to live on which it could with a population of over a billion also other animals would benifit after the black death wildlife in europe flurished so concidering the bigger picture would it really be such a bad thing your thoughts i understand the spirit of your question and will attempt to answer forthrightly in the case of the black death there were positive benefits for humanity not just wildlife europe flourished after the plague because many literate intelligent people inherited money and property of the deceased victims it was the combination of widespread literacy because of the printing press money and freedom of thought that founded the renaissance the dynamic free market with all of its attendant opportunities was accelerated by greater separation from religious strangleholds on thought which in turn led to greater scientific enquiry survivors had money to invest and were of a universally anti religious pro scientific mindset art and culture fourished along side with increased freedom and business opportunities for everyone you also must remember that the plague was not artificially created by biochemists working for divisive governments looking for insidious weaponry if there were to be a worldwide pandemic at anytime in the future it is highly likely that whatever pathogen causes it will have been manmade intentionally introduced and certainly spread more widely by the greater traveling capacity of modern transportation there key differences between old plagues and potential new pandemics are modern transportation makes global dissemination of the pathogens possible not just regional or continental pandemic like the black death modern pathogens bird flu anthrax etc are all manufactured they were intentionally created by governments as biological weapons or are the result of mismanaged biological experiments those crucial differences hold horrifying possibilities far beyond the already awful consequences of deadly pandemics manmade pathogens usually have antidotes even if they do not have antidotes manmade pathogens are specifically designed to have a particular method of dissemination only those who have advance knowledge of these pathogens and their methods of deliver can successfully avoid contamination and therefore the deadly effects the only people who get these antidotes or avoid contamination are the wealthy the powerful those who commit the evil act and whatever populace those in power see fit to save if any future pandemic was intentionally delivered as a weapon by any government or government agent then it is likely that the evil people who created the pandemic would be the greatest benefactors that predicates a consolidation of power and ideological dominance that is the opposite of what happened in the renaissance after the plague the plague killed anyone and everyone from all social strata it did not discriminate there was no cure antidote or sure method of avoiding the naturally induced disease as such the plague was a precursor to intellectual freedom and scientific advancement because it redistributed wealth from the wealthy to the poor a diverse population that was less fettered by political dominance social ideology or religious doctrine that is not likely to be the scenario of a future pandemic in this nightmare scenario the governments and gigantic international corporations of tomorrow conspire to create one world government only those in power would benefit and their power would be amplified by technological influences such as radio id chips and electronic surveillance these insidious pernicious misuses of technology will create an imbalance in the natural checks on concentrated power with the advancement of world air travel television and the military misuse of biological weapons only those who have the wealth and power and whatever populations they deemed necessary to enslave would be able to survive that is the opposite effect of
