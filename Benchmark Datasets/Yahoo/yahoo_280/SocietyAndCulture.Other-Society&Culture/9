is it hard to understand others because we don't understand ourselves actually i don't really believe that i think sometimes as we keep growing and experiencing more and more we discover so much about ourselves that we become more and more intune with ourselves so when we find differing opinions views or outlooks on life we understand them but perhaps certain experiences have taught us to feel a certain other way not in an obstinant conflicting way just in a way that reflects your values and beliefs i think i understand myself too well i know that the way i see things aren't like the majority of people so i know that they won't understand me and yes this can often be a problem for me when i get very very close to someone but i believe it is for the opposite reason it is because i understand myself much too well sigh Creationism Religion Moral Politics Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Karl Marx The nature of God in Western theology Meaning of life Kender Human Soul Supernatural Transactional analysis Goodness and value theory Epistemology Franz Boas Current teachings of Prem Rawat A Course In Miracles Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Liberal Christianity Philosophical skepticism Religious Society of Friends Deconstruction Polyamory Pentecostalism Criticism of Mormonism Therianthropy Prostate cancer Subud Social psychology Philosophy Drama Gospel of Thomas Church of Christ Simone Weil Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of language Abduction Phenomenon Intelligent design Evangelicalism Jiddu Krishnamurti Reiki The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie God Narcissism Culture David Hume Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Atheism Biblical inerrancy Christianity and anti-Semitism Ontological argument Deaf culture Cultural relativism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Bertrand Russell Rudolf Hermann Lotze S__ren Kierkegaard Conservatism Francis Crick Psychoanalysis Karma Trinity Transsexuality Socrates Science Michel Henry Atomism Carl Jung Inflation Dualism (philosophy of mind) Storytelling George Fox Aesthetic Realism Nuanced voices on the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Near-death experience Fundamentalism Objectivist philosophy Empathy Arthur Schopenhauer Color Philosophy of science Cyberspace Existence of God Charles Grandison Finney Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Presuppositional apologetics Karen Horney Bernard Williams Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Evolutionary creationism Canadian federal election, 1993 Economics Traditionalist Catholic Belief Relativism Enneagram Homophobia God and gender
