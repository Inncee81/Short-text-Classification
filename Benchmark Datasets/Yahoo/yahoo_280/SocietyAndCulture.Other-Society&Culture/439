how do you take risk with the little money you have and not worry so much about being back in the poor house im not rich i have a little something from a divorce i grew up poor i have to stop being so cheap i cheat myself in alot of ways like i have money to enjoy life but i dont because something keeps telling me im going to be broke and i cant get over that feeling why is this i'm the same way i also grew up poor when you have nothing for the most part and then have the opportunity to actually get something now and again it's hard to choose because you realize how little you actually do need or your afraid to spend it because you think you should save it because you know how bad it can get but even though i have been poor for the most part i always like to think of helping others because no matter how bad we got it someone out there has got it worse Deflation (economics) Knots Landing Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Procrastination Eddie Guerrero Incarnations of Immortality Conker's Bad Fur Day Charles Ponzi Poker jargon Professional wrestling slang Phoebe Halliwell Kodocha Dead Like Me Fiddler on the Roof Newcastle United F.C.
