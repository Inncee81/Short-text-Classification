why do some people attack a person's bad spelling when they raise a good point a question raising a good point was asked by some guy and or posters decided to attack that person's spelling instead of answering the question why do some people do this ksoileau i agree with you if someone brags abut being know it all or attacks someone's spelling first then they deserve to have it done back at them because they don't have a real answer to a question it might also inflate their ego making themselves feel better and thus superior to that person ultimately people do this when a person's views on a topic are implied in a question if the poster doesn't agree with the implied positions and the poster doesn't have a rational rebuttal then the person attacks the only things they can rationally if i write 'tha sky iz blu' or 'i am wite' it makes no difference how i spelt the words the fact of the matter is that the sky will remain blue and i will remain white regardless of how i wrote the words the truth of a statement is not contingent upon the personality education position in life etc of the person saying it but upon whether or not their statements reflect a truth in the world no amount of arguing against a person's grammar or personality can change that Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Meaning of life Ethics Theodicy Philosophical skepticism The nature of God in Western theology English grammar Atheism Abortion debate A Course In Miracles Truth Philosophy of language Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Trinity Rei Ayanami God Biblical inerrancy Existence of God Moral relativism Plame affair Microeconomics Friedrich Schleiermacher Modal logic David Hume Deconstruction Simone Weil Inflation Dualism (philosophy of mind) Transactional analysis Philosophy of mathematics Free will Presuppositional apologetics Objectivist philosophy Yusuf al-Qaradawi Utilitarianism Fahrenheit 9/11 Meaning Past teachings of Prem Rawat Lie Infant baptism Reality Ontological argument Agnosticism Labor theory of value Acts of the Apostles Supply and demand Falsifiability Morality Jacob Neusner Bernard Williams Nicomachean Ethics Fallacy Summa Theologiae Maimonides Aesthetic Realism Donald Davidson (philosopher) Human Victor Cousin Intelligent design movement Originalism Evil Japanese grammar Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Final Fantasy magic Hiberno-English Logic Justification (theology) Keynesian economics G__del's incompleteness theorem Teach the Controversy Soul Economics Intelligent design Estoppel Social rule Avenue Q Immanuel Kant Predestination Creationism Strong atheism Lincoln-Douglas Debate Vacuous truth Altruism National Kidney Foundation Singapore Criticism of libertarianism Determinism Esperanto grammar Philosophy of science Philosophical Investigations Scientology beliefs and practices Merit Charles Darwin's views on religion Sola fide Propaganda Bill Maher Logical argument
