why must the weak prosper everywhere i look i see cowardly weak curs growing like fungus on an ovrturned boat why is this how the wolrd has become and why am i troubled by the uncontrollable urge to crush them because in reality you're weak yourself if you cannot stand alone all alone on your own power then you have weakness and eventually something stronger will crush you if you have to have friends or lovers sex or family or tools or machines or vehicles or food or drink or to sleep breath urinate and defecate and any other dependency you can think of then you have weakness without those things you can't exist and cannot live or reproduce survival of the fittest is a myth this world never ran on that principle alone it runs in concurrence with protection of the weak this is where love comes from born babies are helpless and absolutely weak without protecting them the species dies out elephants take care of their infirm elderly just like we do the old are a drain on time resources sanity and patience yet we keep them around don't we and we're supposed to weakness is why you have laws codes ethics and the whole nine someone has to protect the less able from the more able in order to allow the species to flourish a chain is only as strong as its weakest link you strengthen the link if you're smart survival of the fittest rewards the most cutthroat cunning strong swift craftiest intelligent ones around the btk killer and son of sam would better reign in this environment because they exemplify some of those traits sociopaths have no respect of bonds or feelings to love is to be weak to be attached is to be weak the ones who can kill as if a mere routine would rule superior in a survival of the fittest regime this popular darwin tale is actually known as anarchy mankind is evil as is the universe itself and mankind as a whole will more seek destruction of others and self before trying the options of construction for others and self this is in the programming for some reason a sabotaged species with so much promise you can destroy the weak sure but one day you will be the weakest among the strong and they will destroy you too this paradox is why we love the winners but still root for the underdogs the first is the reflection of the natural universal design of might makes right the second is the realization that our might isn't the mightiest among mights somebody else will be right and we want to preserve our weaker selves maybe this is why you're troubled you realize the duality inside yourself john lucas Human Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eugenics Extinction Immortality Alaga__sia Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Abortion debate The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Bene Gesserit Alignment (role-playing games) Hulk (comics) Elephant Natural selection Darth Vader Simone Weil Races in the Warcraft universe Pitaten Capitalism Humphrey Bogart Transformers: Energon Objectivist philosophy The Origin of Species Intelligent design Piccolo Junior Saga Competition Ayyavazhi mythology LaVeyan Satanism Sub-Zero Franz Boas One Tree Hill (TV series) A Course In Miracles Animal rights Paradox Kain (Legacy of Kain) Atheism YuYu Hakusho Supporting Characters (Xenogears) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Angel Sanctuary Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Tamriel Zerg Evolution Copyleft Morality Ethics Vegeta Force (Star Wars) Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Origin belief Dragon Booster Age of Mythology Liberalism Friends Sexual selection The Death Gate Cycle Rule of St Benedict Value system Inception of Darwin's theory Victor Cousin Trigun characters Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Vulcan (Star Trek) Bird World government Dilbert Conan the Barbarian Narcissism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Nicomachean Ethics Meme Characters of Naruto Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Biodiversity Nietzschean Friedrich Schleiermacher Cat God Emperor of Dune Roman Republic Thor (Marvel Comics) Noah's Ark Anarcho-primitivism Uzumaki Naruto Grimke Sisters Wu Hu The Authority Theodicy Social Darwinism
