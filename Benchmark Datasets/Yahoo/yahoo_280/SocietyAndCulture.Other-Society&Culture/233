should the terminally ill be required to tell relatives of coming death if they tell them the family can start acting weird but also might appreciate them more if they don't tell them they can save some of the emotional people from grieving and can see how people truly act around them what is your view in most cases if the ill person is told by a doctor of their terminal illness you can assume that the doctor has already told the relatives or an appropriate party of the medical problem it is then up to the the relatives or appropriate party ies to decide whether or not to inform the patient of their medical problem the medical industry has skirted the patients right to know by enacting laws that make it legal to not tell miss inform the patient in minnesota the statue number for this law is which was mandated by the minnesota department of health this allows the doctors and or providers to give the patient no information miss information or out right lies and still charge big bucks the statue states that this law takes away the rights of patients but as in the case of aids it helps to protect the person who gave the patient aids but this is only partially true and is not the stimulus for the statute common sense tells you that they should be protecting the masses not an individual that alone should hint that there is a hidden reason for this law this type of law is only in a handful of states different states may have different laws concerning patients rights the real reason reason behind this law reads like a mystery novel but let me assure you it is true check it out if you have questions email me Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Medical record Abortion in the United States Mental Health Act 1983 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Medicine Involuntary commitment Euthanasia Abortion debate Publicly funded medicine Divorce Medicare (Canada) Plame affair Contract Theory of conduct Insurance Hearsay Health insurance Ethics Partial-birth abortion Lawrence v.
