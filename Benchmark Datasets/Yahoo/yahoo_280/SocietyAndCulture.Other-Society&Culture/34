why do americans want their freedom right away after the age of i mean can't they study first well and get good job as well as life if you are talking about american girls then here is my answer what basically goes is this when a girl turns she gets a job in some kinds of store then get a boy friend while she just turns go to school for the day clubs at the night the more money comes in the less they will spend on condoms by the time she is or she would probably have some kids go to community college for the examples becuase most students there are either mothers or fathers they would probably end up not leaving with that same guy for couple months or so and then they are back together popping out kids if someone be mother at or how much is that child going to know about the world its american culture you know most teens are never with their family they are either having sex in the two door cheapest car or in clubs some girls even stop studying after so they can get enough time to enjoy life then they go back to college at the age of i have never seen any american girls except on tv wearing good conservetive clothes they all try to show their to the public or what the older they get more boys come in and the clothes start to become shorter and shorter wt some american girls don't even know who bill clinton was and is not all girls are like that there are some good girls too who would take care of the family first and then have their own balanced life who wouldn't just get a guy from a bar or something About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Married... with Children The Catcher in the Rye Friends Good Times Kodocha The Ashlee Simpson Show The Human Stain TLC Good Morning, Vietnam George Costanza Teen Girl Squad Humphrey Bogart Pitaten Miss Saigon Avenue Q Trailer Park Boys WNNX (FM) Empire Burlesque Silent Night, Deadly Night Doug Marilyn Monroe 11:14 Blur Sin City Springfield Elementary School Neighbours Saved by the Bell Napoleon Dynamite Culture of the United States Recess (TV series) Cliff Richard Gender role Child sexuality The O.C.
