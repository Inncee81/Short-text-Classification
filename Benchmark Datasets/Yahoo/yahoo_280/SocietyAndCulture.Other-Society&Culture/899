why is it that everytime a person is multiracial mixed with even just a little bit of black they are always considered to be just black e g halle berry is considered to be a black woman alicia keys is too kimora lee simmons tiger woods other mulitracial celebrities i've heard some pple categorize mariah carey as black too cause she has like black in her or something what that's nuts i always thought alicia keys had some asian blood in her and mariah carey doesn't look african american to me i guess maybe it's because of the genes i learned two years ago in my bio course that if you mix black and white person for example the child may come out white however these are very low possibilities because black gene is much stronger than the white one but even if the child comes out white he she still has the black gene in them only this gene is hidden because of this there is a high possibility that next generation will be black even if both parents are light colored so basically once you get the black gene it's really hard to get rid of it unlike white gene which could be lost with just one mix i always think of it as making a painting you start out with the white piece of paper then you take your black color pencil and color the entire surface with black color pencil now try applying white color pencil over no matter how hard you try to make your paper white like it was before it will never be the same and even if you do succeed in making the paper completely white it will still have black underneath it this is not applied to only white color but any other color as well so if you mix black with any other color black will always win because of its nature maybe this is the reason why these celebrities are considered black i personally believe that skin color doesn't mean anything what is the difference if hally berry is black or half black half white or if mariah is white or black what does black and white mean anyway i believe that person is chinese because he she comes from china and follows its traditions it's not about color it's about culture people grow up differently because of their surroundings their religion their language and their influences i think it's great that there is such diversity on this plannet even though sometimes we disagree about life and the way the world should be run like muslims and westerners disagree now can you imagine what would world be like if there was only one color one religion and one opinion some might say that it would be perfect place to live in but i don't think so maybe in the begining it would be fun but eventually it would get borring people need to be different so they could learn from their differences i hope i didn't bore you with this i just wanted to tell someone the way i felt about this specific topic that i never got chance to discuss before White (people) Human skin color Theory of conduct Black (people) African American The Emancipation of Mimi We Belong Together Emotions (album) Mariah Carey (album) Traditional animation Color Nature versus nurture Honey (Mariah Carey song) Pottery Sexual orientation Single certification Turkic peoples Billboard Hot 100 Ontological argument Color theory Hip hop collaborations Black Whose Line Is It Anyway?
