i wanna sell chinese product on line what should i do i wanna sell chinese product on line could anybody give some suggestion about the basic preparation i am not a business people just feel it interesting thanks my suggestion is to open a store on ebay the name alone brings the customers and the volume of traffic ensures hits the costs are up to you to a degree because you pay a percentage as opposed to a flat rate for sales and the system is user friendly the very smart people at ebay seem to be constantly making shopping on ebay easier all payments can be done electronically eliminating the wait for a snail mail payment i make payment as soon as i learn i've won a bid hope this helps Network effect Internet fraud Amazon.com Electronic commerce Wal-Mart Management information system Live 8 Credit card Bulk vending Islamic banking Insurance London Congestion Charge Online shop Web traffic FairTax Spice Girls Copyleft Agricultural policy Advertising Publishing Auction Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Online marketing Neopets Commodore International Illegal drug trade CPU design Octopus card Gross domestic product Amway Retailer Apple II family EFTPOS Capitalism Toll road Whitney Houston E-mail spam Dot-com Gmail Economy of Russia Customer relationship management BAE Systems Skype American individualist anarchism Flat tax First-sale doctrine Ashton-Tate Digital rights management Video game publisher Business process reengineering Best Buy MAME MTR RFID Student loan Bond Capital accumulation Health insurance Unemployment Acorn Computers Mutual fund Jon Secada Taxation in the United States Price discrimination Online auction business model PayPal Call centre Electronic toll collection Fry's Electronics United States Postal Service Tax Sears Holdings Corporation Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Life insurance Microeconomics Monetary policy Open-source software Investment bank Apple Computer Video game crash of 1983 Public transport Mortgage Primerica Financial Services Day trading Economy of the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Argos (retailer) Contract bridge Vending machine Economy of India Smart card The Apprentice 2 Electronic money Costco Publicly funded medicine Western Union Anarchism and capitalism Hard disk Surplus value Bank
