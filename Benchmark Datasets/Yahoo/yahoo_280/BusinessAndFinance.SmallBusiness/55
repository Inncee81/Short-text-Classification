any ideas on how to buy out another person's business operating in the negative i have an acquaintance and long time rival who owns two nail salons recently i joined her after her entire staff walked out of one of her salons she has relocated to an old location after being evicted from her previous space initially my thoughts were to serve in a capacity to help her rebuild her clientele and make some extra cash but she is now asking for my assistance with managing and financially supporting her business the biggest concern is that i know that she has not been paying creditors on time the landlord came by to collect rent month not including utility and supply expenses she assured me that the equipment in the salon is paid for it would be great to get into this business but it could be months maybe even years before it is ever profitable like it was she is in debt and at risk to lose everything what would be a good way to acquire the business and with out creating any type of partnership simple you offer her a sweet deal and you pick up a sweet deal at the same time she is bout to go belly up can't pay bills is behind to close her doors will destroy her life even personal life and she will have to go find a job something that is not easy to do today you seek to remove your competition to gain that much more business yet don't have the cash flow to buy her out but she's not a threat if she is in the negative so offer to just absorb her company as is bills and all of course sit down and check them all out first take some hits but make sure no hidden owed somewhere but as you absorb her and her bills she is no longer the owner nor partner nor any ownership at all but is now your employee or even head nail tech sounds like she is a good nail tech to get the business but is not a business person who can run the numbers aces in their places put her where she belongs doing nails now you have help assistance still the only owner have doubled in size for almost nothing down removed the competition and even better absorbed them and the customer count also she can do nails and you can go grow the business more instead of being stuck doing nails yourself saves her from bankruptcy and allows you to grow win win Credit card Enron Corporation Warren Buffett United Kingdom corporation tax Capital accumulation Microeconomics Bank Donald Trump Security (finance) Corporation Great Depression FairTax Bond Privatization Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mergers and acquisitions Money Mortgage Dot-com Corporate finance Deflation (economics) Poker jargon Annuity Mutual fund Airline Corporate governance Economy of the United States American individualist anarchism Investment bank Debt Blackjack Estoppel Leasing Outsourcing Delta Air Lines Supply and demand CPU cache Bankruptcy Air New Zealand Taxation in the United States Berkshire Hathaway History of the United States (1918-1945) Aerial (dance move) Bulk vending Oakland Athletics Arbitrage Gambling Canadian National Railway Interest Stock Economy of Africa Finance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Betting (poker) Derivative (finance) SCO-Linux controversies Commodore International Internet fraud AT&T Inflation Monetary policy Wayne Corporation Tax Temasek Holdings Venture capital Electronic commerce Keynesian economics Short selling Bank fraud Hercules Linton Ford Motor Company Eric Bischoff Personal finance MCI Natural monopoly Toronto-Dominion Bank Mach kernel Concurrent estate Economy of Russia Income trust Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Rupert Murdoch Cooperative Boston and Lowell Railroad Amway Boston Red Sox Information Technology Infrastructure Library Surveillance Citigroup Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code
