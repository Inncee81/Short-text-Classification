what is the best way do sell or market domain names i own i own several domain names and i know alot of people park their domain and try to collect ad revenue off of it there are a couple of domains i own that i know are worth alot because of the rights to the books and a movie company buying the rights to the film series has taken place tunnels is a book series that is due out in january in the us and already released in the uk it is being billed as the next harry potter i own the domains tunnelsbook com and tunnelsmovie com how can i market them to sell them to someone who wants to develop them to cash in lots of domains are bought and sold on ebay you might also try searching google on domain for sale or something similar i do not advise you to use adwords or any other expensive paid advertising for this purpose since there are established online marketplaces for domains you shouldn't have to pay per click for advertising which is the case with adwords on ebay or some more specific service that you may find you will pay a fixed listing fee and or a percentage of the sale price that's a much better outcome Google Web traffic Internet fraud Search engine optimization AdWords Amazon.com Microeconomics Mutual fund Trademark Tax Online marketing Network effect Dot-com Supply and demand Auction Click fraud AdSense SCO-Linux controversies Neopets IPod Topps Insurance FairTax America Online Online auction business model Best Buy Credit card Apple Computer Google search PE ratio Life insurance UK Singles Chart Bulk vending Gmail Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Pixar Bond Commodore International Mortgage Advertising Marketing Taxation in the United States Mozilla Firefox Cable television United Kingdom corporation tax Finance Stock Spyware Citigroup Privatization Video game crash of 1983 Pharmaceutical company Housing cooperative Monopoly (game) Illegal drug trade Real estate broker Publicly funded medicine Video game publisher E-mail spam The Walt Disney Company Capital accumulation Micropayment Telstra Arbitrage Retailer Movie studio Asset Leasing Naming rights MMORPG Virtual economy Password Microsoft Computer and video games MPAA film rating system Broadband Internet access Spam (electronic) Monetary policy Harry Potter Nintendo GameCube Philatelic investment ITunes Music Store Advance fee fraud Fair use Price discrimination Publishing Service economy Public transport Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Predatory lending RKO Pictures Security (finance)
