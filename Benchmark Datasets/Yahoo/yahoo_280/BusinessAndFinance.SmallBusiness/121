hi how do i legalize a name for a business to make it my own and make sure nobody has it already thanks the most common way of doing this is through filing for a dba stands for doing business as in your county part of filing for the dba includes doing research on whether anyone else is using the business name s in which you're interested and in what capacity getting your dba and business name is usually separate from and done before you get a business license at the city or county level i'm assuming that you don't want to incorporate here as that is more complicated as somebody else mentioned you can use a name that somebody else is already using as long as you are not selling a competing or similar product service in the same market area so for example is you want to name your sandwich shop the red onion and somebody else has a produce stand called the red onion you're cool however i suggest that you name your business differently if possible to avoid any possibility of litigation some businesses especially the big ones will go after you with corporate lawyers and deep pockets and even if you're in the right it's not worth the fight you can get somebody to file your dba for you online in many cases try http www filedba com good luck Trademark Copyleft Attorney at Law Apple Computer Stardock Microsoft Lawsuit Retailer Free trade SCO-Linux controversies Hamburger Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Electronic commerce Mediation Warez Lawyer Nuclear power IBM Insurance Natural monopoly Corporation McDonald's Pretty Good Privacy Enron Corporation Unix Software patent debate Oracle database Tort reform Recording Industry Association of America Citigroup Court system of Canada SCO v.
