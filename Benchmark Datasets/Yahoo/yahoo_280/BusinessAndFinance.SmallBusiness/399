start my own hair salon i live in wichita ks and want to open a chic hair salon i have a great idea for it it would totally take off how do i go about opening a salon i don't have any money to start firstly if you have no direct experience in the hair salon business i'd advise that you work in one for the next six months or so doing everything from cutting hair to buying supplies and everything else possible so that you can get some of the experience you'll need to understand and run a hair salon profitably if this is your first business venture i would strongly recommend that you talk to a business counselor before you do anything especially spend money i'd call the local office of score go to http www score org and input your zip code to find the chapter nearest you the advice is free ask for someone who has a background in the services business and they'll try their best to match you with the right counselor the counselor at score will most likely advise you to write a business plan which is very good advice because it will force you to dig out all of the start up details and the costs of starting a hair salon and force you to also understand all of the aspects of this business including the customers you'll concentrate on your market and how you'll get them to find out and want to come to your fabulous hair salon the location of the salon is important but doesn't make it successful to prove that all you have to do is walk down a street in your town where there are several hair salons not far from each other and you'll find one or two that are empty while the others are very busy it has to do with ambiance and your reputation at the beginning and over time you also have to have the right registration from your state the right zoning the right city and county licenses and permits and you have to be skilled at negotiating with your landlord about who'll stand the cost of the build out or the changes to the premises to make it ready for your look and feel you also have to worry about the normal business planning and management issues related to starting up any business take a look and read some of the articles at http www ychange com small business consulting articles html especially the ones about a business plan and starting a business also try their blog and their bulletin board hope this helped Economics Privatization Domain Name System United States Postal Service Cross site scripting Electronic commerce Extreme Programming OpenDocument Thomas Paine X Window System World Wide Web Mutual fund Information Technology Infrastructure Library Mozilla Firefox Karl Rove Strategic management Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Prostate cancer Salon.com Common Unix Printing System Microeconomics Breastfeeding ZIP Code Software patent debate Public domain Wal-Mart Melvin R.
