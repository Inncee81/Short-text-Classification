i don't want them to get away with what they did to me i use to be a security officer for a small security company in town the only security company in town it was my dream job and one night while i was waiting for my partner to show up to start the shift i was already to work the trainer came out and told me to ring the boss i did and he fired me i didnt work that night when i finally got him to tell me why he said the trainer does not think you are right for the job and that was it i only worked there weeks i want to know is that unfair dissmisal and if it is what can i do about it it depends on where you live most states are what's called at will meaning the employers can hire and fire for whatever reason they want and the employees can quit just because they want to for no reason my guess is that you probably live in an at will state so no that would not be considered unfair dismissal Freeters Employment The Apprentice Knots Landing Efficiency wages Social rule Labor theory of value Eric Bischoff The Apprentice 3 Michael D.
