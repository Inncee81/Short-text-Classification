if you sell something on ebay and the buyer will not speak to you after they win your auction they will not pay you do you think if you went through all of the proper channels that you would give the non communicating non paying buyer negative feedback i would think that if you left them negative feedback even if they deserved it they they would leave you negative feedback and if you had positive how would that make you feel i have and would like to keep it that way but out of respect for other vendors who might trust the non paying buyer i had to go through proper channels first and then i felt it only right to file a negative feedback so that people would know how this person conducts business i had two non payers in one week and i gave them the days to pay like i said in my auction emailed them and said they have whole days to pay or atleast contact me to let me know how they plan to pay or when when i had no contact after that nd day i filed an unpaid item dispute against them in order to get your refund on listing the item you have to wait i believe it's days after that you can close the dispute and in the comment part i put no contact and no payment then i go to leave them negative and be specific gave x amount of days and no payment or contacting happened and so forth that way if they do leave you negative then people can see why and then see your side of the story and then it makes sense when i do shop for things and they have negative i always check out both sides of the story and you can tell when someone is being honest about their negative or not back on the story the that i did the unpaid item dispute when i went to leave them negatives they had too many strikes or whatever and i ended up making them unregistered ebay members so that saved me a negative but usually if they don't pay or contact you and you leave a negative bout half the time they won't even respond back to their feedback good luck hun Internet fraud Auction Taxation in the United States PayPal Advance fee fraud Neopets Negative feedback Live 8 Something Awful Plame affair Electronic commerce Reputation management Social rule Progressive tax Amazon.com Electrophysiology Transactional analysis Mortgage Theory of conduct Real estate broker Poker jargon Online auction business model Estoppel Customer relationship management Wal-Mart Islamic banking Tax Microeconomics Adoption Operational amplifier Extreme Programming Price discrimination Commodity markets Bond Web traffic The Apprentice 2 Advertising Online marketing Something Awful Forums Gmail Surveillance Bulk vending Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Phishing Security (finance) Happiness Feedback Credit card Oil-for-Food Programme Contract United States Postal Service Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act FairTax Child support Copyleft Octopus card ITV ROM image SCO-Linux controversies Electronic amplifier Surplus value Warranty Ra (board game) MapleStory Mouse (computing) B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Deflation (economics) Logo programming language Transistor Appeal Short selling West Indian cricket team Coercion E-mail Chess strategy and tactics Jizya Health insurance Publicly funded medicine Getting Things Done Mutual fund Sit-up Ltd Otakon Brit Hume Chess terminology Trademark Option Vending machine Measures of national income and output Annuity 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Ocean's Twelve United Kingdom corporation tax The Amazing Race Topps Abramoff-Reed Indian Gambling Scandal Nine Inch Nails Arbitrage
