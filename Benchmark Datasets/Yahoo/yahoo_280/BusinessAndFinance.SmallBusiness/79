your opinion jewelery auction i own some jewels with high estimation i was considerin to put them for the first time to an auction one of the auction houses in uk with the money i can buy on a great price some other pieces and resell them in auction there is room for profit i just never participated in auction what happens if something stays unsold what are the chances to stay unsold iam worried about this only how do you handdle that i would suggest you go to several of the auction houses and ask them how they handle their auctions what percentage do they take how do they handle what doesn't get sold generally you get the item back do they charge you for the auction even if the item doesn't sell be sure you go to at least reputable auction houses before making a decision good luck Auction Ra (board game) Internet fraud Monopoly (game) Online auction business model Neopets Gross domestic product Grey market Shill Bond Islamic banking Animal Crossing Supply and demand Final Fantasy XI Live 8 Surplus value Philatelic investment Overclocking RuneScape economy Health insurance Microeconomics Keynesian economics $ale of the Century Consensus decision-making Jewellery Deflation (economics) Mortgage MMORPG The Ersatz Elevator Great Depression Electronic commerce ITV PE ratio Newstead Abbey Textbook Loss leader Technical analysis Amazon.com Mutual fund Say's law The Apprentice 1 Retailer Wal-Mart Poker jargon Fence (criminal) Gaia Online Bulk vending Insurance Video game crash of 1983 Network effect Variable pricing Winner's curse Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Aldi German-style board game Reverse auction Short selling Inflation Diamond Autograph Capitalism Virtual economy Bill Gates Phoebe Halliwell Economy of Russia Blackjack Privatization Banknote Security (finance) Tsunami Relief Cardiff Art theft ROM image EverQuest Price discrimination FairTax Mail fraud Contract bridge Amway Sears Holdings Corporation Finance Commodity MapleStory Initial public offering Clarice Cliff Abebooks Diseconomies of scale GunBound Babe Ruth Experimental economics Luck Call option Speculation Donald Trump Citigroup Sit-up Ltd Minor characters in Morrowind The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Craps
