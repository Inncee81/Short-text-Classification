i need to find out how i can get grant money to start a teen outreach program in my city can anyone help me or give me an idea of where to start i am assuming you are in the process of filing your corporation papers and applied for non profit status with the irs if you havent you will need to begin the process of applying for a c with the irs and file an incorporation paper with your local state the foundation center has a website that lists all the foundations that give grants as well as their specifics area of interest and giving since there might be a cost online it is best to go to the local branch of the foundation center in your area you can find your local branch on the website searching and locating grant monies is free at all branches of the foundation center including going to the actual foundation center in washington dc it is well worth a trip most branches are in local libraries once again the grants are allocated for non profit organizations churches and church ministries however if you are savy some non profits will do a flow through where you write the grant and they use their non profit tax status on the application and the grantor awards the grant to the non profit who in turn gives it to you sometimes the non profit will do it for a small fee written into the grant proposal budget and sometimes they require nothing they will take their fee off the top upon reciept of the grant check they also may decide to administer the grant monies and make sure you manage the grant money properly sometimes not however it must be indicated on the grant application or proposal that it is a flow through in most cases it is best to contact the individual foundation's office and get pre approval for the flow through churches can also do a flow through for you but most tend to oversee the allocations of the grant after they give it to you as well as most need to know the purpose and character of the grantee they may also disburse your grant in payments to see if you management properly either way you will at the end of the grant period need to present written accounting of the grant as well as an accounting of whether the intended purpose of the grant was accomplished Corporation Taxation in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tax protester Trust (Law) USA United States Postal Service Public domain Coalition Provisional Authority Corporate finance Bank Charitable trust Food Stamp Program Student loan Microeconomics Enterprise content management Life insurance Church of Scientology United States Constitution Insurance SCO-Linux controversies 401(k) Business ethics Open access Oil-for-Food Programme Immigration to the United States Bretton Woods system Tax Trademark Flat tax Patent application Copyleft CPU cache Personal finance Politics of Russia Economics Credit card Finance Intellectual property Scientology United States Senate Capital accumulation Federal Reserve Annuity Patent Social Security debate (United States) Non-profit organization Administration Compiler optimization Octopus card Graduate school ITV Separation of church and state Software patent debate Copyright Amazon.com Software engineering Natural deduction PRINCE2 Mutual fund Education in England BASIC programming language Benny Hinn Accountancy Marshall Plan Economy of the United States Anarchism and capitalism C programming language Risk management Tennessee State Constitution Bank fraud Software patent Monetary policy Education in the People's Republic of China Canadian Senate GNU General Public License Open source culture Mergers and acquisitions Prices of production Buffer overflow Publicly funded medicine Charter school Scholarship Economy of Russia Universal Life Church United States Department of the Treasury United States House of Representatives Genetic algorithm Government of France Economy of India Constitution
