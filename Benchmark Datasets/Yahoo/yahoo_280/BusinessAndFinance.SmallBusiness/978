how can we start our own small business bar ok this is our problem we are a big family and we are all thinking about opening a bar but none of us knows anything about opening and new business and we really dont have too much money to do it we want to know how do we start can we get financial help and if we can from where we all have ideas on how but we are not sure can anybody help firstly if none of you have experience in the bar restaurant business i'd advise that you work in a bar restaurants for the next six months or so doing everything from bussing tables and washing dishes to waiting tables and cooking if they'll allow you back there and if you have the skills this will give you some of the work experience that you'll need to understand and run a bar profitably if this is your first business venture i would strongly recommend that you talk to a business counselor before you do anything especially spend money i'd call the local office of score go to http www score org and input your zip code to find the chapter nearest you the advice is free ask for someone who has a background in bars restaurants and they'll try their best to match you with the right counselor the counselor at score will most likely advise you to write a business plan which is very good advice because it will force you to dig out all of the start up details and the costs of starting a bar and force you to also understand all of the aspects of this business including the customers you'll concentrate on your market and how you'll get them to find out and want to come to your fabulous bar restaurant the location of the bar restaurant is important but doesn't make it successful to prove that all you have to do is walk down a street in your town where there are several nice bars all in a row and you'll find one or two that are empty while the others are very busy it has to do with drinks menu ambiance and your reputation at the beginning and over time you also have to have food handling licenses the right zoning the right city and county licenses and permits and you have to be skilled at negotiating with your landlord about who'll stand the cost of the build out or the changes to the premises to make it ready for your look and feel you also have to worry about the normal business planning and management issues related to starting up any business take a look and read some of the articles at http www ychange com small business consulting articles html especially the ones about a business plan and starting a business also try their blog and their bulletin board hope this helped Restaurant Extreme Programming Economics Mozilla Firefox OpenDocument X Window System Coffeehouse Strategic management The Apprentice 2 United States Postal Service Software engineering Electronic commerce Information Technology Infrastructure Library World Wide Web Expert system Microsoft Citigroup Kitchen Unicode Mozilla Application Suite Common Unix Printing System Cross site scripting Wal-Mart Thomas Paine HTML element Privatization Avenue Q Bulk vending Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Software patent debate Scientology beliefs and practices RuneScape quests Transformation problem Warren Buffett Prostate cancer Alcoholics Anonymous SAS System Shaggy dog story Copyleft Mutual fund CPU cache W.
