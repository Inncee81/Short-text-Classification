honest opinions about selling mary kay i am thinking about becoming a mary kay rep and i love meetng people and doing makeup and such but i have heard both good and bad what is your honest opinion plus it would just be a pt thing so i can have a little spending money i'm going to some meeting with my consultant tonight so i was just wondering what everyone thinks thanks i m looking for constructive criticism so if i do sell i want to know what people like and what they don t like i will be honest up front that i work for mary kay have you had any good experiences or bad ones let me know i m all ears also im a stay at home mom a full time college student i have done my research it's not like avon nor is it like that melaluca stuff wow um i talked to several directors and it doesn't cost to start holy cow i'm starting to think that some people have just had bad experiences w it and therefore don't like it i am a mary kay sales director and wouldn't do anything else i am typically very shy and have never been the pushy type and was able to earn two free cars and become a director working that way i agree with the previous post make sure you like your consultant and are willing to work very closely with her as your recruiter ask questions before you sign this will make your experience a postive one ask their thought on inventory activity level communication throughout your career do they contact you on a regular basis or is the ball in your court the reason i say this is because there are several directors out there that expect you to start with a large inventory which is fine if you feel comfortable with that and will only help you if you are doing a certain amount of activity don't get me wrong there are a lot of us out there that do not treat our consultants this way but as a brand new recruit you have no idea i am always open for questions i've been a consultant for seven years and a director for of those years i've worked my business while working a full time job while going to school and now as a stay at home mom i love it and if you have the right people to get you started it's an awesome company to work for Theory of conduct Economics Karl Rove Poker jargon Time Out of Mind The Emancipation of Mimi Alcoholics Anonymous The Apprentice 2 U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Plame affair Mutual fund W.
