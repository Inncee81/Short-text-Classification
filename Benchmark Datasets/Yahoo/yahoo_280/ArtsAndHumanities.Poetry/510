knight errant what do you think my dreams grow darker as the night continues on its journey towards dawn i hear the approaching thunder of my knight in shining armor his quest it seems is as much a mystery to him as it is to me i always believed he d come to take me to the world of ever after but as my lonely days wander into years his image grows dim in my magic mirror my heroic knight has become lost in the forest of my nightmares does he hear me call does he know it s my voice he hears or does he think his own madness mocks his failure to find what he seeks as the dark moon sinks slowly below the horizon i sit helpless in my empty room no tower no rapunzel long hair to guide a prince to me only dismal reality for company i turn my silent mirror face down and stare out the window watching for the dawn which unlike my knight is sure to come i saw a starfall made a wish the one that helps me to survive sometimes i want her be my friend but now i need her be my wife Rapunzel The Shining (film) Link (Legend of Zelda) Parsifal Waking the Dragons Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Blood (computer game) Final Fantasy IX Night (book) The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Arthas Menethil Characters of The Sandman Knight Rider Quest for Glory Siegfried Schtauffen W.I.T.C.H.
