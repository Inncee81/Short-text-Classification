do you like my poem please be honest love love is a bluebird singing in an apple tree the wind whishing through the trees a dog prancing threw an orchard watching the sun rise in the peak of the morning a day of relaxation and a warm bath love what is love i like how you think to express yourself in images rather then in abstract ideas about love i do however think you need to give serious thought as to what those images are supposed to convey about love love is a bluebird singing in an apple tree ok love is happy the wind whistling through the trees love is what does this add to your idea of love a dog prancing threw an orchard love is happy watching the sun rise in the peak of the morning what does this add to your image of love a day of relaxation and a warm bath love is relaxing a warm bath also gives a sensual sense to love this is a good image a day of relaxation adds nothing that a warm bath doesn't give you love what is love don't end like this you needed to tell us what love is to bring it back to a question tells me you didn't do what you set out to do think of more original and unpredictable images that still ring true let's take your dog image i'm not saying that this is the best just an example love is a puppy fuzzy and cute a golden retriever that you come to care about sometimes it craps in the living room sometimes it gets rabies i hope some of that helps take care Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Johnny Appleseed Blood on the Tracks Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Care Bears Garfield The Ashlee Simpson Show RuneScape quests XML The Twelve Labours Frankie Laine Abstraction Sydney Riot of 1879 One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q The Amber Spyglass German grammar Paul Is Dead Love and Theft Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sauna Apple Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blur Global warming Adjoint functors Lauren Bacall Blonde on Blonde Social rule Time Out of Mind Happy Tree Friends Customs and etiquette of Japan Night (book) Friends Quentin Tarantino Bhajan Quarashi Hey Jude English grammar The Rutles Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Pilgrim's Progress Aphrodite Futurama (TV series - season 2) Miss Saigon Spot the Dog Golden Retriever Extraordinary Machine Ranma __ characters Roxette Shrek 2 The Emancipation of Mimi Pok__mon Live!
