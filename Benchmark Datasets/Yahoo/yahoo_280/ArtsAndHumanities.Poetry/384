what do you think of my poem about my family's true experience god's mercy god is all around us but does he save our souls god is all around us but does he save our lives god is all around us but does he answer our prayers he saved our daughter from suicide but did not save our son i prayed for him not to die the lord decided to take him anyway so he could no longer with us reside and for all who loved our son there was no more joy inside although god took our son away he must have had a purpose to relieve our son from his pain if we see his death in this way inner peace we may regain c thank you all for you're beautiful and uplifting responses i find it hard to pick a best answer because they were all so good and kind so i'll leave it to be voted by others this is a very deep and personal poem with a lot of meaning this comes from the heart and is beautiful out of Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eastern Orthodox Church Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Prayer in Christianity Virgin Mary in Islam Holy Spirit Duties of the Heart Meaning of life A Course In Miracles The Pilgrim's Progress Mortification of the flesh Amidah Sola fide Rich Mullins Salvation Yehuda Halevi Kain (Legacy of Kain) God Save the Queen Charles Grandison Finney Bhajan Prayer Jewish Messiah God Past teachings of Prem Rawat Simone Weil Purgatory Vishnu sahasranama Mother Teresa Merit Requiem Noah Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Martin Luther Mary, the mother of Jesus John the Baptist Israel ben Eliezer Reincarnation Jewish eschatology C.
