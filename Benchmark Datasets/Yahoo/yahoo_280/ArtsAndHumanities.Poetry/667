poem named lady in shadows what do you think immaculate body of mist appearing glorious to all eyes dismissing mistress of all sins forever married to no love provoking presence of mankind approaching eager crazy sights away getting from all that s lust for still does vanish she from love thanks for any comments it's got some pretty vague imagery in it for example what do you mean by the words immaculate glorious sins love etc these are the types of words that should be shown to the audience describe them don't just name them a couple of your sentences are very awkward syntactically especially the line that's second from the last i get the gist after reading them a couple of times but it would be easier to understand if you were to use proper sentence structure finally i think the last line of the first verse makes little logical sense again i know what you mean but try to find a more logical way to say it Philosophy of language Eastern Orthodox Church E.
