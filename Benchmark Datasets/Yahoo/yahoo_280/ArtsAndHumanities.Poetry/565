someone help me in understanding this lyric poem how do i love thee by elizabeth barret browning how do i love thee let me count the ways i love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach when feeling out of sight for the ends of being and ideal grace i love thee purely as they turn from praise i love thee with the passion put to use in my old griefs and with my childhoods faith i love thee with a love i seemed to lose with my lost saints i love thee with the breath smiles tears of all my life and if god choose i shall but love thee beter after death the first stanza means that the persona loves her lover with every inch of her soul hence the depth breadth and height thing she says that her soul is capable of this much love for hum when it is groping in the dark sightless it implies that the love she feels for him would be much greater if her soul was not constrained the second stanza says why she loves him 'for the ends of being and perfect grace ' it means that she loves him just for existing and for the ideal way that he is made she would not change any bit of him even if he could then she says that she loves him with both purity and passion in the third stanza the persona talks about lost saints if childhood in childhood wee often love things with a purity and acceptance that is missing form our later loves so she loves him in the way that a child loves with all its heart finally she says that she would love him even more after death god willing what she means is that she would probably love him more in heaven because things are perfect and full of joy in heaven unlike earth however she and her lover can only go to heaven if god wills it Elizabeth Barrett Browning Love Duties of the Heart Ten Commandments Merit Eastern Orthodox Church Mary, the mother of Jesus Christian eschatology Virgin Mary in Islam Summa Theologiae Mortification of the flesh Justification (theology) Religion Reincarnation Divine grace The Amber Spyglass Contrition Jon Secada Purgatory Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Matthew 5 Hell Past teachings of Prem Rawat Prayer in Christianity Fallen angel Original sin Origin belief Shakespeare's sonnets Sant Thakar Singh Four Quartets Sri Aurobindo Jewish principles of faith Qiyamah Idolatry Vishnu sahasranama Baptism Simone Weil Paradise Lost Hymn Book of Isaiah Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology In Memoriam A.H.H.
