evanescence lyrics how do these lyrics sound in a poetic sense i linger in the doorway of alarm clock screaming monsters calling my name let me stay where the wind will whisper to me where the raindrops as they're falling tell a story chorus in my field of paper flowers and candy clouds of lullabies i lie inside myself for hours and watch my purple sky fly over me don't say i'm out of touch with this rampant chaos your reality i know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge the nightmare i built my own world to escape in my field of paper flowers and candy clouds of lullabies i lie inside myself for hours and watch my purple sky fly over me swallowed up in the sound of my screaming cannot cease for the fear of silent nights oh how i long for the deep sleep dreaming the goddess of imaginary light in my field of paper flowers and candy clouds of lullabies i lie inside myself for hours and watch my purple sky fly over me your chorus has a very catchy quality to it but sky fly over me doesn't work for me usually a chorus will rhyme even when the verses do not and i think in this case they should do the same let's take a look in my field of paper flowers and candy clouds of lullabies i lie inside myself for hours and watch my purple sky fly over me it's that last line that needs work how about as over me my purple sky flies or as over me a purple sky flies the verses are a little uneven and might benefit from editing after you have someone else read them to you out loud so you can hear how they sound as written it's tough to do in your head because you cheat we all do good images love the chorus The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poetry Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alice's Adventures in Wonderland The Legend of Zelda series enemies American Beauty (album) Paul Is Dead Sin City The Marshall Mathers LP Roxette Song Milton H.
