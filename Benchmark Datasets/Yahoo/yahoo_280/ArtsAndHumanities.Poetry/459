poem up for review mist the delicate haze looks like it could be twisted like a sheer skirt if there were fingers ghostly enough instincts fragile enough to not abuse their stays in the very space that they take up to not go right through the fog like a pure shriek stabbing through a soft purr is that what could happen if there were oh sinewy fairies i beg you shape my fingers please and the twirling rings of mist will rest around the fingers from which they were created ah how the quiet interrupted power not of moving something huge but something light is underrated well of course there are bad poems i know you were trying to be nice but i don't need to hear someone say they like my poem if they also say they have no standards whatsoever that is meaningless well i do have consistency in my poems they're just hard to understand thanks for reviewing though thanks bodacious sorry what does heavy handed mean this is the second poem i have critiqued tonight so here goes and just remember anything i suggest is just constructive criticism let me start off by saying you have an excellent sense of words but you do something i did as a young poet and a lot of young poets do i mean you can put some great sounding lines together and everything seems to make sense until you stand back and look at the entire poem there really isn't any idea or theme carried throughout the poem so when you're done reading it and someone asks what the poem was about all you can say is i don't know but it sounded good the real challenge for me was to be clear and direct in the message i am trying to get across in my poems and describe things and make it sound good now if you are just writing for yourself or boyfriend or whatever you can forget about what i just said and write just however you want please keep writing you are on the right track Blood on the Tracks Poetry Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Time Out of Mind Heavy metal music Social rule Emily Dickinson Hiberno-English Storytelling Milton H.
