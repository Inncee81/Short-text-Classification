opinions pleeze its kinda sad tho if you saw me walking down the street i d be a perfect stranger to meet and greet i wear bright colors and do my hair my pants are clean without a tear i have plenty of friends and know the new trends but deep inside i m a real mess full of pain depression and a lot of stress i go home and deal with fight after fights and my life is full of lonely nights but hidden underneath my fake little smile my heart is mangled and left in a pile because i m hurting you see deep down inside and fixing things with my parents ha i ve tried all it does is get me in trouble and leave my emotions in a pile of rubble so a long time ago i did something bad i couldn t take anymore of that man called dad so i pulled out a razor and did something i thought id never do i rolled up my sleeve and cut what i thought was just a few now that same little girl you saw walking down the street no longer looks so innocent and sweet ive become a stranger to even myself at times omg i love it i can really see what your saying it is sad but who said poetry should be happy little ponies and butterflies prancing around in a field of golden flowers poetry is about whatever we want it to be about sure but poetry is always something we feel if you dont feel what you are writing then you just cant write it with any conviction and you cant convince the reader it is real and poetry is real it is about life but life is different for everyone most peoples lives arent like little ponies and butterflies life is dark life is sad cutting yourself is something real people in the real world do even if its not right fights hapen abuse happens evrything happens this peom is awesome it is one of the best i've seen it's so real i've tried to write poetry like this myself but my poems are always lighter than what you wrote thats because my take on life on poetry may be lighter than yours but its still real if you know what i mean the only thing i would fix would be punctuation but those could be typos its like somthing my friend told me smiles are like bandaids they cover the hurt but they dont stop the pain Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Blood on the Tracks EastEnders Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart The Inside K' The Amber Spyglass Social rule Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) RuneScape quests Futurama (TV series - season 5) American Psycho Jon Secada The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Nineteen Eighty-Four Theory of conduct Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Ranma __ characters Time Out of Mind Characters in the Smurfs Scenes from a Memory Negima Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Knots Landing The Ashlee Simpson Show Atomic Kitten Fruits Basket Boston Public Dead Like Me Rich Mullins Rent (musical) Daredevil The Human Stain Phoebe Buffay's songs Leonard Cohen Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Customs and etiquette of Japan Sinfest Past teachings of Prem Rawat Marilyn Monroe Blonde on Blonde Beavis and Butt-head Carrie Jacobs-Bond Yoko Ono Self-harm Fernando Pessoa Teen Girl Squad Salad Fingers Taxi Driver Pip (South Park episode) House of Leaves The Emancipation of Mimi Paul Is Dead The Catcher in the Rye Johnny Cash Shen Gong Wu My Sassy Girl Battles of Lexington and Concord Horse Emily Dickinson The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Poetry Anne Boleyn The Tale of Genji Happiness Kurt Cobain Waking the Dragons The Wall Dean Koontz Madonna (entertainer) The Beatles discography The Shining (film) Tori Amos The Death Gate Cycle Shawn Michaels Scarlet's Walk Fight Club Oh My Goddess!
