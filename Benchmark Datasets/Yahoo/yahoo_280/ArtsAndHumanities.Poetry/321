think you want to read be my guest my beloved across the endless sea you've gone across to heaven's shore i cannot feel your silken touch i'll see your face no more for now i'll miss you next to me and have for several years my sorrow that you're gone from me has caused me many tears i miss the way you looked at me i miss your nose so cute i miss the sunlight in your hair i sometimes feel i'm mute the years i had so fleeting few to gather next to me the memories of a lifetime so in my mind i'd see the sparkles in your eyes so blue the golden hair so fine the perfumed scent i loved so much when you were only mine i must stay here yet for a time but there will come a day when i will meet you by the gate and then with each we'll stay no more to part nor turn our backs our spirits will entwine as one we'll spend eternity for you i'll cease to pine yes sad but sadness always makes beautiful poetry it was i who was lucky a beautiful poem well written and with pretty consistent meter and rhyme stanza line try sometimes i feel i'm mute or sometimes i'm almost mute this would change the last line so it wasn't as predictable by moving i into the phrase instead of at the beginning of it look at line in stanza and consider truly instead of only only works but it implies that now she belongs to someone else and you whereas truly would imply that she was more than just a memory that she was physically spiritually and mentally yours the next stanza again fourth line and then with each we'll stay perhaps where together forever we'll stay or when reunited forever we'll stay and finally too good to pass up consider revision of the last line where pine seems a little archaic try when again you'll truly be mine whether you choose to edit as i've recommended or not your poem is a lovely one and a very heartfelt one indeed may all your poems know such heart Four Quartets Time Out of Mind Pitaten Eugene Onegin Hymn The Hunting of the Snark The Amber Spyglass Poetry Jon Secada Shakespeare's sonnets Waka Dean Koontz Das Lied von der Erde Meter (poetry) The Tale of Genji Scenes from a Memory Church of Christ, Scientist Characters in the Smurfs The Raven A Course In Miracles Cliff Richard Reincarnation Alliterative verse Characters of The Sandman E.
