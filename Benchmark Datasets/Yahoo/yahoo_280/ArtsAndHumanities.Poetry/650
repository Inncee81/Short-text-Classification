im what do you think of my poem when people say it will seem like nothing next year when you attempt to right your feelings down onto a blank page and all you can do is think about that one thing that one thing that turned into a million little things the pale grey colour that is your mixed feelings and not knowing what those feelings are only makes the fear of feeling anything deeper and deeper whether it is red with anger white with sadness or green with guilt and the longing to let everyone no your side of the story before that deceiving angelic face opens its mouth and recites words dripping with lies and over dramatic line s sounding so rehearsed but only you no the truth the deep emotions within your body wind up until they implode and sleeplessness can onley make your cuts that turn into scars seem so un important and all that happens is the big black hole gets bigger and wider sucking in every last emotion and once of energy that you had left to take that deep breath in that made you feel just that much better and all you have to hope that the black hole sucks up every last bit of those emoticons that you are so longing to get rid of whether you did do something wrong they still top it but those with a face of an angel often turn into a black muddy puddle with the ripples of trouble effecting everyone that hears the story but you no the truth all you wish for is that it will all end all end and go away for you no running from the black hole will only leave it there waiting for your return waiting to see what you have become waiting to judge you with snaring eyes and a curled lip but you have no control over what this black hole will do next all you can do is sit in the dark and wait for it sit and wait alone hmm to adolecent if you new the things i have been through you would not of said that but thats just it lol you dont no thankyou for your answer though i can definitely identify with the emotions in your poem and by the way your feelings are your own and they are valid no matter what your age is in fact writing down your feelings is one of the first steps in dealing with them and that is a mark of maturity i would suggest that you use spell check and work on possessives capitalization and punctuation in other words grammar and spelling i know those things seem boring but grammatical errors can prevent people from immersing themselves completely in a poem keep writing that's the best way to keep improving Religion The Amber Spyglass Poker jargon Drill bit Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Emoticon Blood on the Tracks Color Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Force (Star Wars) Bong Poetry Origin belief Emotion Daredevil Social rule Scientology beliefs and practices Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mosquito Diving Theory of conduct Breastfeeding Domestic violence Scenes from a Memory Leet Captain Thunderbolt One Tree Hill (TV series) Snooker Saruman Transformers: Cybertron Deconstruction Blonde on Blonde EastEnders Shen Gong Wu Milton H.
