why does the world look down on children poems my little sister sent the same poem to contest she faked her age as on one then said her real age of on the other they sent her a letter about how good her poem was but they only publish real poets while she came in rd in the other contest my question is why do they not take children seriously matty stipanic was a real poet and his books were published before he died your sister needs to stop lying about her age your sister should work on a book of children's poetry and you need to buy the book the writer's market to shop the book to real publishers good luck and may god bless you Rudyard Kipling William Wordsworth Japanese poetry Poetry Emily Dickinson Alfred Edward Housman H.D.
