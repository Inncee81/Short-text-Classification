what do you think of this i think this poem will get you thinking it's written by danielle rosenblatt once i was a flower but now i'm just a stem i didn't like my petals so i did away with them i thought my colors ugly so i threw them all away wanted orange red and purple didn't like my shades of gray to look like other flowers was all i really wanted like all the other roses who were never teased and taunted like the child who's picked last for elementary school athletics i thought that i was worthless and i blamed it on genetics i wanted to be chosen for a beautiful bouquet but i knew no one would want me for my ugly color gray so i tore petals out and i threw them to the ground with the wind they blew away and were never to be found now i stand here naked with all my petals gone for good and i wish that long ago i would have only understood that looks can be deceiving and that gray is not so bad now i know that i possessed more than i thought i had wow just a wonderful poem makes you take a good luck at yourself i think it hits alot of teens and how they look at there selfs and how they feel others look at them great just a very great poem thanks alot Flower Rose Pansy Dragon Booster Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an One Tree Hill (TV series) Chicago White Sox Orchidaceae Time Out of Mind Tournament of Roses Parade The Amber Spyglass EastEnders Satchel Paige Color theory Flowering plant Hair color 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kim Possible Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Tomato Babe Ruth Tris Speaker Marilyn Monroe Darwin from Orchids to Variation The Picture of Dorian Gray Hellebore Shaggy dog story Columbine High School massacre Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) Synaesthesia Kender Jon Secada Guilty Gear Ren__e Vivien Detroit Tigers Hip hop rivalries Humphrey Bogart The Ashlee Simpson Show One Piece minor characters New York Yankees Black Reggie Jackson K' Ultimate (sport) Ty Cobb Pysanka Goldenrod The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Horse 1957 World Series Characters in the Smurfs SMTV Live Teen Girl Squad Apple Color Wood carving Art Japanese tea ceremony Pikmin Roswell UFO incident Paul Is Dead Poker jargon The Legend of Zelda series enemies Dog Pasadena, California Blood on the Tracks Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Frankie Laine Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Contender (television series) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Parsifal She Loves You New York Mets Daredevil Zanpakut__ Piccolo Junior Saga Toilet humour AFI 100 Years series The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Charles Goodyear Haven (TNG episode) Nirvana (band) Floristry I Want to Hold Your Hand Shit Grey 2004 Republican National Convention Dodgeball Leaf Link (Legend of Zelda) Narcissism The Ugly Duckling Eric Cartman PH indicator Orc Matoran Charles Bukowski
