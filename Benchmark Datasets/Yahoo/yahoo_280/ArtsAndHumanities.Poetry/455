can you help me analyse this poem please analasye this poem eg the poetic technique style tone meaning etc thank you forty two years ago to me if to no one else the number is of some interest it was a brilliant starry night and the westward train was empty and had no corridors so darting from side to side i could catch the unwonted sight of those almost intolerably bright holes punched in the sky which excited me partly because of their latin names and partly because i had read in the textbooks how very far off they were it seemed their light had left them some at least long years before i was and this remembering now i mark that what light was leaving some of them at least then forty two years ago will never arrive in time for me to catch it which light when it does get here may find that there is not anyone left alive to run from side to side in a late night train admiring it and adding noughts in vain the tone in the first stanza is reminiscent in the second reflective contemplating the rhyme scheme is rather loose giving the poem a contemporary feel and perhaps giving us the rhythm of the train or of the speaker's thoughts in the first stanza the speaker observes that the stars are beautiful because of their appearance and their mystery also notably commenting on the fact that light takes a long time to travel from the stars to us on earth the parenthetical in the first two lines also creates an aura of solitude and of intimacy with nature in the second stanza we are told that some of the light probably meaning some stars are farther away than others still has not reached the speaker and that furthermore there may not be time for the light to reach the speaker ever will never arrive for me to catch it this could mean that the speaker is dying and this notion of death is possibly confirmed with when it light does get here may find that there is not anyone left alive the last line admiring it and adding thoughts in vain suggests that perhaps the speaker acknowledges that he or she is entertained by the idea that only he or she can enjoy the beauty of the stars after all there is no one else on the train the westward train was empty and in the end there is not anyone left alive lastly the speaker's identity is only adorned with the line there latin names and partly because i had read in the textbooks meaning that he or she is probably a young student probably at a university though possibly at a high school Poetry John Berryman Novel Italian literature Black hole Meter (poetry) Christopher Columbus Das Lied von der Erde Miguel de Cervantes Non-native pronunciations of English Socrates Rhyme Proven__al literature The Raven Augustan poetry Rudolf Steiner G-Man (Half-Life) Gamma ray burst Beowulf Extraterrestrial hypothesis Piccolo Junior Saga Opportunity rover Eugene Onegin Four Quartets Samuel Wesley (poet) Ginny Weasley William Shakespeare D.
