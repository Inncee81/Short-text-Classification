i've seen a lot of poetry here at yahoo 's q a site in the past few months so i am currently considering launching an online ficition poetry magazine i had a pair of printed out small cirulation magazines between any interested parties let me know if i can find oh at least it will be out by the summer of next year the small circulation magazine doesn't have a name not yet therefore from now until the final friday of november the rd i will consider suggestions via email the person whose suggestion i wind up taking is guaranteed of publication in the premiere issue be sure to ask for complete guidelines when you submit your suggestion if i might make a suggestion or two or a dozen as someone who has done this endeavor i think it is important that you have a pretty clear vision upfront of what you want your magazine to look like there's about a half a zillion web magazines already out there so you need to think about how you will distinguish yourself from the others that first issue needs to have some impact and needs to generate for you the sort of buzz that will bring you quality submissions it is quite possible that you may be asking for authors to send you work for quite a few issues moving forward you should have a list of authors you really admire and would like to see your magazine reflect the kind of quality you envision your magazine offering the biggest mistake most web magazines make is to include too many authors in every issue less is better try to keep your authors down to or less you don't want to be the magazine that opens the floodgates and has so much work that no one ever bothers to read any of it because it's overwhelming concentrate on select pieces and don't be afraid to say no to work you don't like it's your magazine's reputation at stake always this also means you may have to say no to friends acquaintances idols and heroes they will send you crap especially if you let them you should announce your issues and submission calls go to the online workshops like alsopreview com and the writer's block at web del sol and others like eratosphere make sure you post a call for submissions with allison joseph at crwopps you can also try sending a notice to verse daily for their web monthly feature you should also do it right and invest the money in a dedicated site many a time webzines have started on angelfire or one of the other freebie websites it look unprofessional to most writers to see a bunch of box ads for creepy ol' poetry com at the top of the page you'll lose way more writers than you'll interest keep your deadlines if you are a quarterly then come out quarterly and hit your release dates if you say you answer submissions in weeks then you better do it in weeks or less the above commitments are a sign you are in it for the long haul and if you are not then you need to make sure you have a plan in place for someone else to take over otherwise you won't project to writers that sense of commitment in your interactions and you may find writers thinking of you as a flake good luck Search engine optimization Open Directory Project Plame affair Literature Extreme Programming Google Craps Internet fraud E-mail spam DeviantART Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act The Standard Spam (electronic) Neopets Gmail The Chemical Brothers Theory of conduct MoveOn Poker jargon Wheel of Fortune The Apprentice 2 Web traffic Wikipedia Open access Crossword Nintendo Power Annuity On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Pretty Good Privacy Ken Jennings Stopping e-mail abuse Deconstruction Appeal Advertising Ajax (programming) Make money fast Legal research Crew Exploration Vehicle Corporate governance Peer review Monopoly (game) The Amazing Race Oxford English Dictionary Jennifer Lopez Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2005 MMORPG UK Singles Chart Slow Train Coming Opera (web browser) Kurt Cobain American Idol Parti Qu__b__cois leadership election, 2005 LiveJournal The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Billboard Hot 100 Erotic literature MTV2 Publishing Independent Media Center Chuck Palahniuk Surveillance Infantilism Kylie Minogue Religious Society of Friends The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Arianne Michael J.
