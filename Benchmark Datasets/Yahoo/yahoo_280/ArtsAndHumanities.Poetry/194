do you like my poem the flash of a lens the glint of your eyes the tears are a godsend compared to what you feel inside your heart is broken your spirit lies in pieces there are so many things unspoken the pain of it never ceases exhausted from thinking afraid to admit that you feel slowly yet surely your fire is shrinking at the same time everything and nothing feels real passion struggles inside of you anger and sorrow burst within yet you hold them back to make it through it s all under that china doll skin you keep your walls up and your spirit down too weak for smiles too strong for help so you struggle through without a sound when inside you melt you don t have to stand alone you don t have to do it by yourself you re walking into a whole world of unknown everyone s been there himself we ll all go hand in hand and your hurt will slowly pass away your shredded heart will mend strand by strand it might not happen tomorrow or today but eventually you can be that happy person buried so deep inside and then you will hold the golden key to everything in this life and it may seem totally bizarre and you might never agree but not so long ago that hurt person that you are was also me this is beautiful i like it more than the first poem u posted Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vegeta Cliff Richard The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Scenes from a Memory The Death Gate Cycle Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Dualism (philosophy of mind) Naruto jutsu The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sydney Riot of 1879 EastEnders Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Milton H.
