what do ye people think o' this poem i wrote this a few months ago i was just wondering who likes it who doesn't fog blankets the night co'ering the ancient shore of ol' kingsport town salt air and black water lurking beyond the beach out there lies the reef where the horrid things play fog blankets the night co'ering the eldritch shore of ol' kingsport town salt wind howls that ghastly song the mad idiot piping catching only glimpses of things fright'ning beyond the obscuring crags fog blankets the night co'ering the gateway shore of ol' kingsport town salt sea and unknown gods rapping upon the cosmic door that leads to the shore where the horrid things play fog blankets the night co'ering the ancient shore of ol' kingsport town now this is my cup of tea i love where the horrid things play and salt winds howls that ghastly song the structure is concrete the meter and flow are very readable most importantly the simply repetition like a band with a good rhythm section so far my favorite for the month Cthulhu mythos reference codes and bibliography Erie Canal Poetry Howl Great Lakes Desert Lake Erie Cthulhu USS Vestal (AR-4) Queen (band) Shiga Prefecture Kitesurfing Philip Glass Fog Surfing Lake District Origin belief Sodium chloride Time Out of Mind Hell Tennessee Shark Shipwreck Deluge (prehistoric) Louie, Louie Blood on the Tracks T.
