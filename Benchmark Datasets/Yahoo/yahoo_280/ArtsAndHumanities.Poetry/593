what do you think of this poem right now i feel like the world's most hated fated to stay dead with my heart deflated but i march on unabated so one day i can say hey look i made it to understand love you need hate and i appreciate it that you hate me for me and not someone shady i stay true to myself and i'm not jaded but for you i can only pray that one day pause one day you realize the real lies through your real eyes the same eyes i saw you through before other people got a hold of you took control of you had you doing things you told you'd never do i understand people change but it should come from within you burden yourself by playing pretend i feel sick knowing i once called you my friend because being two faced is a game you play to manipulate others so you can have it your way through the bullshit i've put up with i have one thing to say go yourself and have a nice day it's meant to be spoken like poetry slam style with my voice and cadence everything rhymes and it flows nicely i was just wondering your thoughts opinions or comments thanks this is deep and i absolutely love it wish i could write like this i would love to read more because you definitely have a gift that can take you very far i love this style of poetry i love the fact that you made it your own you got a serious future ahead of you keep it up i believe in you because i know you believe in yourself keep on going and keep on writing you're a star Hip hop rivalries Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Poetry Samurai Deeper Kyo Avenue Q Ten Commandments Novel John Berryman Ludwig Wittgenstein Theory of conduct Sin City Hey Jude The Marshall Mathers LP Shaggy dog story Jiddu Krishnamurti John Howard Yoder EastEnders Nineteen Eighty-Four Bullshit Socrates Humphrey Bogart Recurring South Park characters Days of our Lives Negima Anne Rice The Amber Spyglass Ranma __ characters I Want to Hold Your Hand One Tree Hill (TV series) Phaedo Simone Weil The Catcher in the Rye Augustan poetry Social rule A Course In Miracles Blood on the Tracks Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sharon Tate Kodocha Roxette Incarnations of Immortality Dean Koontz God Emperor of Dune Kill Bill Jean Grey W.I.T.C.H.
