this is the last time i will post this todd kind king of the pile of answers are you still around i'm sure it still needs work but i think i'm getting closer any advice on stanza breaks how like voices the rain sounds tonight like the hard whisper of prophets the truth of the finite in each breaking drop how sobering to feel yourself at the center of this blossoming death how strange to be within that which grows within you and the scent is not sweet the whole reach of death the slipping of skin the cracking of bones the accumulation of creases between the burden of knowledge and the terror of mystery we in darkness lie what words are there for a mother who must release her child she sits even now empty open arms longing to embrace that which left them empty to hold it gently there was a bird fallen and you held its shivering flesh in your child hand too young to know what name to give this sadness but alive enough to feel the change when the small body stiffened you knew you had touched something more permanent than life you learned of burial and gravestones that day your empty hand a child s no more and something was left behind as you moved from this moment a passing your passing into this knowledge my last revision though a good exercise didn't feel right or authentic i think i salvaged some of my original ideas from the clumsy words they were trapped in i also included more than the savagely cut last version todd my most recent edits were almost exclusively due to your time and tolerance spent on my work thank you ever so much your critique was excellent you may plant a kiss on your computer screen hassan i'm sure it will reach me some how also you needn't be todd to comment on the poem i'm glad you found it interesting enough to read i can see someone's been editing and doing a good job at it the first stanza is very very well done i'd look at breaking though maybe fragile do drops break you might be able to find a better word but the stanza flows very well nicely done line breaks in the nd stanza need work try this how sobering to feel at the center of this blossoming death how strange to be within that which grows within you and the scent is not sweet this mirrors more closely the pattern of the first stanza and by dropping yourself which is unnecessary here you bring the beats back in line stanza three has similar problems maybe this might work the whole reach of death slipping of skin cracking of bones accumulation of creases between burden of knowledge and terror of mystery we in darkness lie again it better mirrors the previous stanzas although the th line takes the place of the rd line in beats dropping of the the s helped remove the repetative sounds and more focus on the beautiful counterpoint you thought up without distraction finally the last stanza try this what words are there for a mother who must release her child she sits even now empty open arms longing to embrace that which left them empty the poem is beautiful really it is my editing recommendations are just that recommendations but i believe they keep your poem true to itself and resolve some of the line break issues you'd been wrestling with or at least i hope they've pointed you in the right direction again beautifully done keep writing The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Whose Line Is It Anyway?
