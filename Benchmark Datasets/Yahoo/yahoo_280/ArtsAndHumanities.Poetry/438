a poem comments or thoughts would be welcome i'm still planning to edit and the punctuation is probably off i just wrote this a few minutes ago pondering apology maybe i was the silly fool to try to make you stay my friend perhaps the best has been fulfilled though you don't care to make amends maybe i was always the one condescending proud and vain oh knowing i'm sorry or knowing i'm right doesn't always ease the pain thinking back on what has happened thinking of all the things i've revealed interrupting your slight remarks or unconciously ignoring your tiny appeals well here is my apology dear friend for everything i've ever done wrong i hope you never know this hurt and never have to sing this song though it's not this is based off something real i was really upset last night poetry sure helps relieve feelings doesn't it i've read a lot of poems but never one about apology that's pretty unique yes i agree that creativity is a great emotional outlet the poem needs a little polishing but all in all it does express your true feelings Jon Secada God Emperor of Dune Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Shaggy dog story Nine Inch Nails Theory of conduct Blood on the Tracks Humphrey Bogart The Amber Spyglass Sharon Tate Pok__mon Live!
