what do you think of this poem i can't see the darkness is around me where is the feeling of hope what did i become after i left that place to what have i succumbed fear is the best ally but how did it swap sides my people are now being crushed tossed and destroyed but we stubbornly survive the life we can now see ending shall not release its grip today but out of the ashes many wont pray today shows the beginning of the end and yet the start i will not give in take out my heart for forever i shall burn one thousand deaths my sentence because i chanted to the unholy and was swept away to carry his minions i died that night i lost my soul but to return it i must drop more blood in cold the artifact that shows my debt has been erased to that my heart paced is it my turn to fall i just want to go escorted to the gates before i see the creature itself in front of me he stomps the ground and awake i am above the hole that people call hell but once above i see my fear the truth is it is much worse up here to the oven it seems for me i can hear people singing or shouting for me away i must go to sleep forever this fire isn't as bad as the people who surrender i cant take the heat i succumb to the pain is it over o god i look drained away i go into the wind spread over the water and land awake i become the people are staring what have i done they look at me in disbelief this man was gone but now he breathes how can this be a miracle or curse back into the pit i burst out of the flame i shoot soaring across their sacred hurst in there remains family in there i go i scream and i shout listen they must do for i have come i am back stronger than one the scarring on my chest gives me courage the scarring on my rest fuels my pain to free my people i will distain my wings seem to grow as i show fire within i knew i was always the special kind of kin my breath becomes fierce as i find a way to express the anguish i feel the people who have been killed why did you have to leave my life feels like its been cleaved clearing my throat of that distain emits a roar the roar tells them i am here to stay there is nothing you can do or say that's right get out of my way my pain will prove to be deadly my fear will not fall on def ears your pain will cause your end run and live why you still can i won't toy with my captors anymore away they go riding the train i was aboard what seemed like months ago their trip will not end like mine theirs will be worse their course is layed deep into their own hearts they will not return until my time has passed thousand of generation will prove true to this task the game is over i may now sleep dormant i may now become if only my wounds would heal if only my pain wasn't so real my time has come so dormant i may become if you need me burn through tackle my fear and push me out into a world that has begun restarting my cycle and never for fun my time has come so dormant i have become what's up i think this is an amazing poem your poetry has a very unique style like some of the others i've read on the site and that's a great thing your poem is very creative and well thought of i didn't mind the length of the poem at all it was terrific and you should keep on writing you are talented and i believe in you you can go very far keep your head up and keep on going this is the beginning of something special writing is a great gift god has given you keep your gift and keep writing superstar Blood (computer game) Kain (Legacy of Kain) Tenshinhan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amber Spyglass Races in the Warcraft universe The Death Gate Cycle Jon Secada Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Professional wrestling throws Link (Legend of Zelda) Book of Isaiah Transformers: Cybertron Piccolo Junior Saga Naruto jutsu Phaedo Darth Vader Sin City Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Sacrifice (computer game) YuYu Hakusho The Inside EastEnders Milton H.
