attention all past present xlon tax software users hi i have nearly scored myself a new job that i am very eager to start however the one condition that will keep me from getting this job is that i have never used xlon tax before i currently use handisoft i would like to know your opinions on xlon is it fairly user friendly and do you think the basics could be picked up fairly quickly does anyone know if there is a demo vresion i can download from somewhere i used the predecessor of this version years ago called xlon ceedata and it was my favourite tax software to use very user friendly and easy to navigate i also used solution which was the most annoying clunky dinosaur tax software i ever used i think solution took over xlon and this is the product you have now if it's based on ceedata then it should be nice to use you may be able to get a demo from solution so google them but really if you've used handitax and know your way around a tax return then with a little computer savvy it's not going to take you very long to get the hang of other tax software they're all based on the same tax return forms tax staff are hard to find so i'm sure the employer will be happy if you say you know handitax and are confident as a quick learner to use xlon i've never had any trouble learning new tax software and currently use elite which is the best in my opinion if this job doesn't work out and you're in sydney then contact me i might need you HyperCard Computer virus System/36 Commodore 64 OpenOffice.org Linux Expert system Extreme Programming Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Common Unix Printing System Mach kernel Microsoft GNU General Public License BASIC programming language Windows XP Enterprise content management Outsourcing Microsoft Windows IPod Machinima BitTorrent Wiki Mozilla Firefox Common criticisms of Microsoft Copy protection Mac OS X v10.4 Database management system Game programming System 7 (Macintosh) GIF AmigaOS Software engineering Apple Macintosh Software testing Bluetooth Genetic algorithm IBM PC compatible Mouse (computing) Gross domestic product Object Desktop Intuit, Inc.
