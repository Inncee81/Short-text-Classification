what would be possible innovatory ways of teaching physics to day teaching physics has become a real challange how to teach physics interestingly is very important this depends on how well we use avilable resources effectively your english is terrible ways to teach physics well use real scenarios do a bunch of roller coaster problems for kinematics and then go to cedar point and take data doing the math and problems can be tasking for some kids so make it fun two ways to do that are to make problems violent and gruesome darts being thrown at puppies or to use whiteboards in classes for some reason students love doing problems on white boards instead of paper and pencil you can make whiteboards using tile board or marker board from home depot lowes it's about for sq feet then just cut it into squares x good lab equipment can help if you can do lab experiments to verify equations and also to verify realities friction error measurement precision it can make a problem real to a student any form of creativity i had th graders make treasure maps for displacement and distance differences use nearby universities they allow high schoolers to go on tours of the labs have you ever seen a piece of polystyrene attached to a dna strand and then controlled by a laser or have you seen a quantum computer the kids will like it and they won't learn how a quantum computer works even though they try very hard to explain it but they will hear things that they recognize and they can see applications of stuff that they know Mathematics Quantum mechanics Determinism Physics Scientific method Gravity Richard Feynman Geodesy Laser Quantum computer Floppy disk String theory Interactive whiteboard Renormalization Normal distribution Aikido Central processing unit Tide EPR paradox Explosive material Quantum chromodynamics Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Dynamical system History of science Homeschooling Transformer W.
