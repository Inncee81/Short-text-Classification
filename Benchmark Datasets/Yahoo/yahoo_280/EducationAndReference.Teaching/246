what time to buy college books hello i am going to a community college in san diego and i've already choosen several classes the question is when do you buy books for the classes do you buy them ahead of time i still don't know what books that i'm gonna need or do you wait until the professor to tell you what to buy thank you for answering i teach english at a community college and i know that i and my colleagues expect our students to have their textbooks on the first day of class or by the end of the first week at the very latest it's no mystery to find out exactly which books and which editions are required and or simply recommended by your instructors we submit that information to the bookstore each semester go to your campus bookstore and have them take you to the section that contains the textbooks for your class and your instructor it should be very clear exactly what you will need we never require books and then simply do not use them if you wait you can expect to be behind on your homework and you should not expect your instructor to give you a break just because you decided to wait good luck work hard and have a wonderful time in college Textbook GED Graduate school Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Education in the People's Republic of China Intelligent design movement Academia Theory of conduct University of Massachusetts Amherst Drill instructor Extreme Programming Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Lesson William A.
