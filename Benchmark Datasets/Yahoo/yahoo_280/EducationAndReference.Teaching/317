to all teacher pls help me it is really needs to evaluate my academic credentials before i teach here i came from philippines and i graduated as teacher there i want to continue my teaching here i went to community college and talked to one of the councilor and she said it needs to evaluate first all my credentials to acei how much that will cost for all of it it is really and how's the teaching here give me some idea or scope how's the teaching level here when you are going to teach is your specialty subject only you can teach or you can also teach some subject that they need just in case you applied to the school that your specialty subject is not available you've made a good start by going to a community college to have your credentials reviewed i'm not familiar with this process or how credentials from other countries are reviewed so i cannot help you with that what i can tell you is that a bachelor's degree and a teaching certificate are required for any teaching job in the us however there are some other options to you that you can still work with children either while your credentials are getting reviewed and or you are completing the necessary requirements to become a teacher often childcare facilities often do not require college degrees but the laws vary by state so you would need to check into this for your area childcare facilities take children typically from weeks of age to years of age of course the school age children would only be at the facility afterschool and during the summers and holidays so this may not be a full time job simply look up childcare or daycare in the phone book where you live and give them a call if you are interested personally i have been a childcare director and i liked having people from different countries working for me at one place i worked i had two employees from the philippines and two from india it was very cool another option is to be a teaching assistant for a public school these jobs have a variety of duties and responsibilities and you might even be able to help the school district out with some translating in a pinch i teach english as a second language in texas and i had a student from the philippines last year i could not communicate with his mother at all i don't know much tagalog and neither does any other teacher in my district luckily he had a cousin that was fluent so i could communicate with the family that way again simply contact your local school district to see if they even have assistant jobs available i know we do where i live and a lot of them as far as the rest of your question typically teachers teach all subject areas math reading science and social studies at the elementary level grades k but middle school and high school teachers grades teach one or two subjects Graduate school Education in the United States Education in Germany High school No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China GED Education in Portugal College Education in Japan Education in Romania Master's degree Education in Australia Teacher Nurse Education in Hong Kong Professor Education in Taiwan Education in France Education Juris Doctor Grade (education) SAT Secondary education in France Librarian Homeschooling Physician Education in the Republic of Ireland Paralegal Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Multilingual College admissions Secondary education in the United States Rabbi Secondary education in Japan Education in Sweden Kindergarten IB Diploma Programme Doctor of Philosophy Law school Medical school Chinese University of Hong Kong City and Guilds of London Institute A-level Culture of the United States Columbia University Education in Singapore Franklin W.
