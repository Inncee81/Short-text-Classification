need suggestions for worksheets for a high school writing class my students will be working on improving their writing i would like to give them worksheets that will also allow them to continue practing on their writing skills any suggestions or websites i can go to one idea i had were a worksheet of a paragraph full of errors for them to correct i like to be creative too so please share any ideas you have you could start with the details from this question and let them find mistakes and correct them for someone with an english degree you made a surprisingly large amount of mistakes i don't mean this to be offensive although i realize it will come across that way but if this is standard for you you need to up your game before you can start teaching writing i also think you should avoid worksheets in a writing class unless the worksheets are handouts about grammar or contain vocabulary words to help enhance writing instead you should focus your efforts on creative writing prompts and go from there give students the opportunity to write and revise and then let them exchange their writing with their classmates their classmates can then make suggestions and find mistakes you could even give students a form to fill out when critiquing work that makes them think about why something is written well or poorly this will be far more constructive and beneficial for students because everyone starts on a different level in writing it's hard to give cookie cutter worksheets that will actually help everyone it's better to focus on individual needs it's more time consuming but it really is the best way to help students best wishes Second language acquisition A Course In Miracles Quizbowl GED Education in Japan Tai Chi Chuan Extreme Programming Slot machine No Child Left Behind Act Franz Boas Mutual fund Non-native pronunciations of English Korean language Scientology beliefs and practices Esperanto as an international language Translation memory Indian English Translation Chinese language Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Education Education reform IB Diploma Programme Graduate school Linus Pauling Austrian School Gifted Law School Admissions Test Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Francis Crick Capitalism Keynesian economics Medical prescription Japanese tea ceremony Intelligent design movement ISO 9000 SAT Rudolf Steiner Chinese character Multilingual Martial art TOEFL The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex American and British English differences John Lott African American Vernacular English Table tennis Danish Folkeskole Education Master's degree Education in Australia Alexander Technique Quattro Pro Education in Singapore Scientific method Gender-neutral language Education in India The Book of Five Rings Hong Kong English Blackjack Ultimate (sport) Condon Committee Grade (education) Independent school (UK) Deconstruction New Testament English language Vladimir Nabokov Neuro-linguistic programming Yearbook Political correctness Ludwig Wittgenstein Open access Cornish language Art Game programming Ido Typewriter Inflation Education in the People's Republic of China Creation science Eye Liberalism Milton H.
