having a teaching degree in the us but moving to canada if i have a teaching degree in the us when i move to canada can i still teach or do i have to enroll into a canadian college to gain my degree there and no a new draft hasn't happened i asked because i always wanted to live in canada good news it's unlikely that you will have to take your whole teaching degree over if you have one from a fully accredited college and are certified within your state bad news you'll probably have to take some courses over to be certified where you are going to teach education is the perogative of each of the separate provinces within canada there are historical reasons for this you really don't want the details the upshot of this is when someone graduates with a teaching degree in one part of our country and moves to another part of the country that province's department of education frequently deems some part of the teacher's training credentials as insufficient and requires it to be upgraded it's a turf warfare thing it's unlikely that you will sneak in under the radar dependent upon which province you move to things may be different if you get a job in a private school rather than in the public system in my province manitoba all teachers are required to be fully credentialed whether in the public or private system there tends to be a grace period within which you can hold a job and get the required coursework done once you have landed a job or if you already know what part of the country you are moving to contact that province's department of education for details about certification you will need to send them a copy of your university transcripts and your certification papers to have official word and receive the written documentation of what they are requiring you to do do not leave this to chance or rely on somebody else's say so even if it is your employer welcome to the country Teacher Graduate school Education in Portugal Education in the United States Education in Australia Education in the People's Republic of China College Education in Hong Kong Education in Germany Education in Malaysia School accreditation Juris Doctor GED City and Guilds of London Institute Paralegal Professor Nurse Lawyer Education in Canada Grade (education) Community college University of Houston Architect Electrical engineering Master's degree Librarian Pretty Good Privacy Education in the Republic of Ireland Education in Japan Software engineering Student loan Reliability engineering Separation of church and state Trinity College, Dublin Ryerson University Columbia University Public education California Baptist University Education in France Physician American University University of North Carolina at Charlotte Pennsylvania State University Higher education in Japan Medicare (Canada) Same-sex marriage in Canada Academia College admissions Dentistry Green Party candidates, 2004 Canadian federal election Medical school King City, Ontario Public-key cryptography Bachelor of Arts Midwifery School counselor Distance education Jaime Escalante Athabasca University Associate's degree Diploma mill Oregon State University Middle Tennessee State University New York State Department of Education Patent Rabbi Charter school University of the State of New York Memorial University of Newfoundland General practitioner Secondary education in Japan Multilingual Doctor of Philosophy Chinese University of Hong Kong Florida State University Law school Advance fee fraud IB Diploma Programme Far Eastern University Medical Assistant Education in Austria Physical therapy Education in Qu__bec General Certificate of Secondary Education Education in Taiwan Air Education and Training Command University of Central Florida Trade union New Brunswick Politics of Canada A-level Unemployment benefit Immigration to the United States Freedom of information legislation
