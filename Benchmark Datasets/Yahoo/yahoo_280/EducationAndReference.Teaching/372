which is the best route to get into teaching pgce or bed can someone please tell me the advantages disadvantages of both ways thankyou in advance it depends on your circumstances you have to have a degree to do the pgce if you already have one this is probably the best route it's certainly the quickest route if you are just starting it could depend on how commited to teaching you are if you are really set on teaching as a career bed will be the best preparation because you spend three or four years developing your understanding of children and the craft of teaching if you think you might like to teach it might be better to do a non bed degree and then the pgce that way you have wider options if you find that teaching is not for you when you actually get into the classroom another point is where you might want to teach there is some validity in the previous respondent's comments about primary and secondary but i have employed and trained both bed and pgce teachers in primary if your interest is in teaching children and making a major contribution to their overall development you might be better suited to primary teaching where you spend a lot of time with a class or children covering most or all of the curriculum a bed course might be the better route for this if your interest is more in your subject and you want to share and extend that interest you might consider secondary having followed a degree in your favourite subject and then taken a pgce if your subject is maths or a science you have the bonus of the government paying off your student loan if you stay in teaching for a number of years Teacher Postgraduate Certificate in Education Education in Germany No Child Left Behind Act Education in Japan Education in Portugal Education in Australia Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Graduate school Waldorf Education Student loan Homeschooling UCAS Secondary education in Japan Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Danish Folkeskole Education Education in England High school Education in France Master's degree Secondary education in France Kingston University GED Hogwarts subjects Education in the Republic of Ireland Annuity Asperger syndrome 401(k) Junior Certificate Education in Scotland College Nurse Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in Singapore Software engineering A-level Education in Malaysia Public transport Alexander Technique Philosophy of education Comprehensive school Principal-agent problem Top-up fees Primary education Experiential education Androgen insensitivity syndrome Church of Christ, Scientist Education in India Second language acquisition Grade (education) Tai Chi Chuan Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Juris Doctor Tripartite System Professor IB Diploma Programme Medical school Medicine Aikido Physician Intelligent design movement Kindergarten University of Pennsylvania Law School Jaime Escalante Secondary education in the United States Reiki Raffles Institution Standardized testing J.
