i curious im a teacher and another teacher asked me this i was like huh as the supply of teachers diminishes the demand on new and existing teachers increases as a potential teacher and educator identify two perceived challenges of the teaching profession that you may struggle with the most in contrast identify two opportunities you may have as a teacher when responding to a classmate s obstacles suggest a constructive way to address the challenges they present i would have to disagree with the last comment according to the nctaf in their recent policy brief the teacher turnover rate is spinning out of control the brief states that over of new teachers will change careers after years and within years this is alarming when i was first in teaching years ago we called it the year itch not the or year itch the demand for quality teachers is very high especially in high risk low income inner city communities this turnover has to do with the lack of support for teachers teacher morale teacher burnout and the fact that teachers are not seen as nor treated like the professionals that they truly are what is the old saying if you can't do teach this joke is qffensive and entirly untrue if you want to do something to help your classmates overcome these obstacles then be supportive teachers too often today have a competition based environment get away from the judging gossipy teacher's lounge and embrace new and innovative ideas lift up and support your colleagues and learn from them and above all tell them how they have influenced your teaching if we stick together instead of tearing each other down then maybe we will be able to save the teacher Education Crime prevention through environmental design Unemployment Capital accumulation Teacher Charter school Alexander Technique Intelligent design movement Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Inflation Efficiency wages Supply-side economics No Child Left Behind Act Microeconomics Strategic management Economy of Russia Controversies in autism Homeschooling Education in Portugal Reparative therapy Waldorf Education Kyoto Protocol Reaganomics Separation of church and state American Conservatism Information warfare Conservatism Education reform Welding Literacy Keynesian economics Education in the United States Aikido Dog agility Past teachings of Prem Rawat Culture Socrates Plame affair Monopoly Intellectual property Futures Studies Prime Minister of the United Kingdom College Martial art Technical analysis Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Homeopathy Asperger syndrome Hard disk Capitalism Experiential education Teach the Controversy Extreme Programming Reiki Organic farming Monetarism Principal-agent problem Transsexuality Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Tesco Liberalism Jacobo Arenas Second language acquisition Baseball Philosophy of education __mile Durkheim Spanking Climate change Shaggy dog story Monetary policy Computer-assisted language learning Education in Hong Kong Law of value Down syndrome Energy economics Motorcycle Pledge of Allegiance Mutual fund Life insurance Calvin and Hobbes Social justice Peer review Mahatma Gandhi Current teachings of Prem Rawat Adult attention-deficit disorder Urinary incontinence Neoconservatism in the United States Minimum wage Free trade Yoga Sutras of Patanjali SCO-Linux controversies Clothing Max Stirner Sex education Intelligent design
