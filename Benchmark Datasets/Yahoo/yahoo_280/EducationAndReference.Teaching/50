what is ur opinion on corporal punishment do u thnk it is necessary fr schools i thnk teachers shld be very friendly da students rather thn optin fr harsh methods corporal punishment is an abuse fr da whole teachin facility so friends pls post in ur views n say whether it is rite fr our nation corporal punishment is not just hitting corporal punishment these days is almost any disciplinary action a teacher takes if you yell at a child that is considered corporal punishment if you separate a disruptive child from the rest of the class by sitting him to the side that is even considered corporal punishment if you have a child write i will try to work on my behavior times that is corporal punishment it is so easy for people to say a teacher should be friendly but it is obvious they have never been teachers teachers are dealing with more than the old class clown we are physically and verbally assaulted every day we are treated disrespectfully by students and their parents we are underpaid and overworked and yet we are still dedicated to teaching kids i don't believe in paddling or smacking or physical abuse but if i want to remove a disruptive student from the group why is that wrong instead of saying teachers should be friendly how about saying students should be respectful obedient cooperative and ready to learn how about saying parents should be cooperative supportive and ready to listen and help i wish every person who thinks of this question would go and spend a week in a school and then rethink their answer i almost agree with horse except for the hip hop gangsta bit all kids act up preppy kids rebels druggied rockers punks grunge skaterboarders there are all kinds of problematic groups of kids its not just a hip hop gangsta issue thats a bit stereotypical in my opinion basically if students go to school and act respectfully and do their work they wont have any problems from a teacher Spanking High school subcultures Theory of conduct Corporal punishment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Socrates Alexander Technique Dog training School discipline Capital punishment Punishment Education in the United States Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hazing Hip hop music Coercion Adolescence Social psychology SAT Saved by the Bell Scientology beliefs and practices Education in the People's Republic of China Abortion debate Divorce Domestic violence Teacher No Child Left Behind Act Motivation Moral Politics Separation of church and state Drug addiction Philosophy of education Columbine High School massacre Confucianism Aikido Status of religious freedom in Sudan Catechism Human sexual behavior Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Teach the Controversy Ludwig Wittgenstein Drama Abortion Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Milgram experiment W.I.T.C.H.
