teachers coming to your house ok i have kids i just registered for school and was informed that the teacher must make a home visit wtf why all of the schools in my area are doing this now it is my home and i dont want them here i dont ask to go to there house and check up on them where is it said that this is ok i live in ky no i have nothing to hide but i see no reason for them to be at my house or anyone elses teachers should be in the classroom teaching thats it wow that is a bit funky i am a teacher and we do home visits but that is only for bad reasons unfortunately like a child getting in trouble all the time not performing at grade level being unclean all the time etc it is my guess that they are trying to be proactive in your child's education to meet the parents and kids before hand so that the first month of school starts off on a better note we are asked to make a phone call or to send out welcome postcards to our new students are these public schools if so they cannot keep your child from coming to school if you refuse a visit every child is entitled to a free public education and it would be illegal to refuse if so if they are private or religious you are out of luck they make their own rules period they can refuse to take your child if you don't comply if it is a public school and they insist you can talk to an educational lawyer or go straight to the superintendent of the school district i understand your issue and that it makes you uncomfortable however you must ask yourself if it will be worth all the hassle to fight them only you can make that decision i am sure they are doing this for a positive reason even if it is annoying they should at least be able to tell you why it might not be such a bad thing for your kids sake to meet their teacher beforehand it will ease some anxiety for sure and as a teacher i ask you to remember things like this are never the teachers fault we are told what they expect us to do and we have to do it or we risk fighting our own battles with very little support i hope this all works out for you in the end Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Boston Public Pledge of Allegiance French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools School choice Intelligent design movement Charter school Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Germany Education in Japan Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Teachers (film) Education Homeschooling Springfield Elementary School Theory of conduct Teacher Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Education in the People's Republic of China Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Public education Education in Hong Kong Kindergarten Separation of church and state Teach the Controversy Kitzmiller v.
