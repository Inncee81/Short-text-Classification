whats a good class activity for college students my organization has classes that you must attend before you join at the last class i want there to be an activity to have them look back on the classes six weeks long all the classes have an activity but we dont have one for the final class any ideas we have a strich no alcohol policy with our orgnization and our school and seriously that wasnt a very good idea we want to make leaders out of students not drunks a fellow teacher does this with her juniors in high school but i think it would translate she has them write a letter to themselves she holds the letter for one year and then mails it to them she provides the stamped envelopes and she has been amazed by some the things her students have said after hearing their thoughts from the year before if you want something with more immediate impact perhaps you could have them make posters detailing their favorite parts of your class these could then serve as visual aids or at least decorations for the next group that comes through it's hard to come up with more specific ideas without knowing more about the nature of your class good luck Yearbook College Mail Education in Germany Student Community college Postage stamp Education in the United States Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Graduate school Lynbrook High School Grade (education) Hunter College High School James Ruse Agricultural High School Undergrads Education in Japan College admissions Alcoholics Anonymous Angela Davis Education in the People's Republic of China Secondary education in France Teen Girl Squad Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Homecoming (tradition) Extreme Programming Envelope Glenbrook North High School Intelligent design movement Columbine High School massacre One Tree Hill (TV series) Surveillance Friedrich Schleiermacher Mail art Socrates Education in Romania Negima Fraternities and sororities Lyndon LaRouche Plato Carnegie Mellon University Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Prom Hopkins School Aesthetic Realism Walt Disney World College Program Teach the Controversy High school Marshall McLuhan Marching band Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Alan Watts Independent school (UK) Ludwig Wittgenstein Twelve-step program Franklin W.
