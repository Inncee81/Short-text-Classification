i am en english teacher how can i use a wiki in my class i have been thinking about this since last semester i too am looking at using this in the classroom for those who do not know a wiki is the style that wikipedia publishes in you start with blank pages and the users create the content the idea in a classroom is that your students would create the content a powerful benefit is that sites that host wikis keep all prior drafts within their system you can refer to any previous drafts easily a teacher can see what a student wrote and have the entire draft history available i have thought of one thing i might try this coming year i will do the pre work to create pages for each class and each student within the class for small assignemtns i will post a general question on the front page students are to answer on their individual pages for a longer assignment i plan to have them write up their lab reports in this manner i look forward to seeing others who have better ideas than this i really want to try it out it does seem like i will have to do alot of training of my students for this to work good luck Education in Romania Extreme Programming Wiki Education in Germany Independent Media Center Plan 9 (operating system) Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Teach the Controversy Expert system Experiential education Education in Taiwan Graduate school Wikipedia University of Massachusetts Amherst Japanese tea ceremony Website Stuyvesant High School Education Logic GED Education in the United States Many-worlds interpretation Webcomic Yearbook Visual Basic King George V School PHP Blog Intelligent design movement No Child Left Behind Act Meme Center for Science and Culture ITunes Homestar Runner Wiki Professor Aikido Education in the People's Republic of China Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Columbine High School massacre Alexander Technique Uniform Resource Locator RSS (file format) Cascading Style Sheets HTML element Internet troll Plame affair History of Wikipedia Socrates Uncyclopedia Gwinnett University Center Podcasting Lisp programming language Smalltalk WikiWikiWeb Massachusetts Institute of Technology Conscription Model United Nations Juris Doctor Bristol Grammar School Open access Jimmy Wales Wiki vandalism Standardized testing GameFAQs Education in Portugal TikiWiki Blended learning Plato Current teachings of Prem Rawat Green Party of Canada Living Platform Republic (dialogue) The nature of God in Western theology Starfleet ranks and insignia Teacher Secondary education in Japan Password H2G2 SAT The Hidden Curriculum Hopkins School Hyperlink Python programming language John Wycliffe Catechism Ken Wilber Scalable Vector Graphics Philosophy of education Education reform Bridgewater State College MediaWiki Web hosting Pittsburgh Steelers Forth programming language Tcl A Course In Miracles LaTeX Roman law Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
