any other teachers dreading the return to school i have taught for years the first year was tough naturally the second year was horrible the third year was awesome like i have found my purpose the kids were great and we really had a bonding experience i am dreading this year i don't know what to expect i am so afraid it will be like the second year they say it comes in cycles does this mean i'm in the wrong profession does anybody else get that sick feeling in their stomach when school is about to start back personally i'm still in denial i still think there's lots of summer left hmm maybe that's because my calendar is still on july anyway i do know how you feel i'm a college professor and i still feel that way some times i get especially nervous after i've had a bad semester there are good groups of kids there are not so good groups of kids it varies year to year but i wouldn't say there's any predictable cycle i think after you've been teaching a little longer things will be easier especially after a few more good years and you'll have lots of them trust me i don't think you're in the wrong profession at all one thing i know that helps me is being able to talk with other educators something that can be hard to do over the summer maybe you should call up one of your fellow teachers and invite her him out to lunch before school starts talking with other educators always helps invigorate me helps me remember why i love teaching Social rule Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Kodocha Time Out of Mind Current teachings of Prem Rawat Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist 2000 Australian Grand Prix Teacher Theory of conduct Graduate school The Adventures of Pete & Pete One Tree Hill (TV series) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Year of the Spider Education in Germany Academic term College Shaggy dog story Experiential education A Course In Miracles Education in Portugal Education in Romania Pitaten Professor Empire Burlesque Stomach cancer Boston Public Treehouse of Horror V Juris Doctor Ashton-Tate John Howard Yoder Past teachings of Prem Rawat Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Francis Crick Great Teacher Onizuka Theodicy Sant Thakar Singh Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kender The Death Gate Cycle Philosophical skepticism Blood on the Tracks Honey and Clover Avenue Q Futurama (TV series - season 2) Socrates Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Aerial (dance move) Professor X Christian eschatology Sola fide The Ashlee Simpson Show Leap year William James Alexander Technique Education Piccolo Junior Saga High school Hey Jude Fertility awareness Teachers (film) Karma Goodness and value theory The Beach Boys Hogwarts subjects Pregnancy Lauren Bacall Lance Armstrong Ethics Norway national football team Church of Christ, Scientist American University Humphrey Bogart Phoebe Halliwell W.I.T.C.H.
