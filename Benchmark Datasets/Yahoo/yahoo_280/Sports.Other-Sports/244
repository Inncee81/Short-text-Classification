stress out watching sports i stress out a lot when watching tennis or basketball some people do too but is it common and is it also really unhealthy also when the person or team i was rooting for loses i just automatically cry not for long though does that happen to you wow that's deep i definitely think that's not normal to cry and stuff especially if its just a casual game i think its okay to stress out when your watching the world series or somethin like that where you've waited a hundred years for your team to win but they blow it you should just try to relax because its like when i'm tired or want to wind down i watch baseball and that does it for me even if i'm up and out of my seat wondering what the heck my guys are doin its still comforting and relaxing Playoff Tennis Playoff format Sports timeline Wild card Badminton San Francisco Giants Georgia Institute of Technology Sport World Series Say Somethin' National Basketball Association The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Major League Baseball Philadelphia Phillies Chicago White Sox Urinary incontinence Sandy Koufax New York Yankees Al Michaels Major League Baseball television contracts Drag racing Boston Red Sox Bowl Championship Series 2005 World Series Time Out of Mind Atlanta Braves St. Louis Cardinals Andre Agassi Mario Superstar Baseball ELO rating system Sam Barry Reflexology Norway national football team Cranford, New Jersey Tris Speaker Torquay United F.C.
