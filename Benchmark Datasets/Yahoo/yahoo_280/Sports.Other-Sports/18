should steroid use be legal one of the greatest and worst moments in canadian sport was in seoul south korea in when ben johnson blew away carl lewis and the rest of the field to run an amazing in the m for days the entire country was on an amazing high until news of the positive test hit us with so much money involved in pro sport and size strength and speed playing such a key role in how well one performs why not just legalize and let those who wish to take the risk take it i think that users are much more educated now about what harm is being done to their bodies and the risk of being significantly harmed is lowered greatly with education i can't think of a better way to completely and utterly rape the game when it comes to sports we shouldn't be so eager to evolve the game if we are to fully appreciate it before you know it everyone will be using steroids and it will become a necessity if you are to win and compete with the rest of the crowd then there are those fans who see it as a 'cheat code' for sports for example the whole bonds thing now with steroid allegations rampant in the media and amongst fans and non fans alike not many people are excited for his record breaking homeruns infact many like me are happy that it's out and done with if it was someone who i was confident wasn't on steroids then i would actually be happy about it instead of indifferent the only thing i can say i'm happy about now is that with bonds breaking the record finally baseball is no longer taken hostage and we can move on to bigger and better sports news but i digress i'd much rather see a highschooler go to college get recruited learn all the proper skills and be a motivated player than some dullard who's looking for an easy way to get recruited finally it will only be beneficial while people still dont take roids but as everyone starts to get encouraged to so they can keep up it will be balanced again and completely unnecessary just my take on it though Barry Bonds Ben Johnson (athlete) Major League Baseball Babe Ruth Professional wrestling slang Baseball History of baseball in the United States American football Australian rules football Weight training Cincinnati Bengals 1957 World Series Boston Red Sox Jos__ Canseco Olympic Games Summer Olympic Games Volleyball Andr__s Galarraga Toronto Blue Jays Los Angeles Dodgers Home run English cricket team 2000 Summer Olympics New York Yankees Microeconomics Plame affair Ty Cobb Norway national football team Lou Gehrig Baltimore Orioles Gary Sheffield Queen (band) Chicago White Sox Extreme Programming Sumo Illegal drug trade MMORPG Knots Landing Indianapolis 500 Tour de France Hulk Hogan GoldenEye 007 Hikaru no Go America's Cup Toronto Raptors Sandy Koufax Tennis Golf The Ashes Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Cricket Counter-Strike Seventh Sea (collectible card game) St. Louis Cardinals ESPN25 Badminton Competition History of rugby league Affirmative action Carolina Panthers Michael Jordan StarCraft 24 Hours of Le Mans Troy Glaus Rugby union Free trade Ted Williams Satchel Paige Anabolic steroid San Francisco 49ers Seattle Mariners Marching band Tris Speaker Kansas City Chiefs Sports timeline Brian Close Vince McMahon Fanny Blankers-Koen New England Patriots Pittsburgh Steelers Asian financial crisis Miguel Tejada NBA Finals Confidence trick Dog agility Jason Giambi Mike Tyson
