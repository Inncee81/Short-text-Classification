scared to tumble i need help i have been able to tumble for about two years on a spring floor i can do round off three most days and i'm working on round off tuck but this year i am a high school cheerleader and we tumble on the gym floor i am absolutely terrified of it i only have to do a round off back handspring and i even did it at tryouts i am so scared to do anything on the floor i feel like i am going to be soon pulled from the routine we have because i do not throw it most of the girls have been tumbling for years and some throw series with layouts i feel so bad that i cannot just throw it i have done it before and continuously been spotted but that hardly helps me anymore i want to do it by myself with out being frightened so if you can help me you would be greatly appreciated thank ya'll oh so much it is nice to hear from other people that you can do it especially if they have been there themselves your answers have helped me even today i did my backhandspring and it was so pretty i had a girl spot me one time and she didnn't even touch me thank you again so much sounds like this a mental block the only thing i can say is that you have to want it more than you fear it if you do it enough times the fear will subside because you have proven to yourself that it is ok Cheerleading Gymnastics Aerial (dance move) Avenue Q Kim Possible Shaggy dog story The Parting of the Ways Professional wrestling attacks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
