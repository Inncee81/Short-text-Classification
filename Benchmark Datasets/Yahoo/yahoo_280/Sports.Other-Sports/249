frontflip or backflip i can do them realy good on the tramoline and have been for several years ready to learn on ground now and i was just wondering is it easier to learn a backflip or frontflip on ground i think it probably just depends on the person it is easier for me to do front tumbling then back tumbling i would say a front flip but a back flip could be easier for you i think you should see on the trampoline which one is easier and then do that one unless they are both the same then you can do both lol make sure you use a mat or something incase you mess up the first time have fun be safe and i hope this helps gymgirliexox Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling aerial techniques Moonsault Professional wrestling attacks Gymnastics Trampolining Powerbomb Skateboarding trick Badminton DDT (professional wrestling) Parachuting Breaststroke Piledriver (professional wrestling) Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers IBM PC compatible Social rule Mixed martial arts Trampoline Motocross Dropkick Kitesurfing Cheerleading Marching band 2000 Australian Grand Prix Autogyro The Invisibles Backbreaker Shawn Michaels Paragliding Dog training Backstroke Neckbreaker Textile manufacturing Anchor Table tennis Carbine Floppy disk Shen Gong Wu Pitaten Sento Richard Feynman The Ashlee Simpson Show BASE jumping Peter Cook Wind turbine Bicycle Coin flipping The McGuire Sisters Motorcycle Girls Aloud Golf club (equipment) Car handling VHF omnidirectional range Softball Sant Mat Knife Escape from New York Shooting star press B3ta Alan Arnett McLeod Battle of the Somme (1916) Orange Order Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Atmospheric reentry Skateboarding Mat Hoffman Front crawl Mario Bros.
