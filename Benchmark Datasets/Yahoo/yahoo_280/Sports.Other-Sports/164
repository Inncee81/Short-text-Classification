what's a good gun for a beginner that's trying to learn to shoot is desert eagle good okay i know nothing about guns and got the name desert eagle from one of my co workers i am planning on going to a shooting range to learn all the basics and everything and i was wondering what's a good first gun to own for a beginner i swear i am not going to rob murder pistolwhip or do anything other than defend myself if need be with the gun so please don't think you are giving answers or advice to a psychopath lol i had no idea where to post this but the sports section came up and i went with it sorry if its' the wrong category that sort of depends on your size and your weight and your physical condition among other things i am ' and weigh around or so and i have been shooting since i was very small and i wouldn't use a desert eagle unless i wanted to defend myself against bears with a semi auto and by the way i have some of the largest mits of anyone i know and the desert eagle fills my hands quite well if you want to only purchase one gun then go to some of the gun stores or even better if there are any ranges that rent firearms near you go to one of them then look at smaller caliber firearms like mm and if you are brave or are able too go shooting with someone you know then you could consider something wit more power like a or but if you don't know stick with the mm it will kill a human at a reasonable range with minimal felt recoil and although it doesn't have the stopping power of the larger commonly used self defense calibers it will hold more rounds there are rare occurrences where people survive multiple shots with the mm the rapper cent being the most notable with shot being taken at close range but the majority of his wounds were sustained to the hand arm and legs with some others hitting the torso and one hitting his left cheek but he doesn't say that he didn't feel anything and i bet that really ruined his day if you are accurate and hit vitals with multiple shots it will put anyone down you need to know what you are going to use the gun for what i mean by this is that you need to know if you will be using with a concealed carry permit or if it will sit in the drawer of your night stand beside your bed you don't really need to worry about weight or size if you don't plan on carrying and you shouldn't carry if your not sure you will shoot when it is necessary also you need to stay familiar with the weapon if you are carrying but that is something you can get into with an instructor if you want to learn to use a handgun as a self defense tool then you should first learn to shoot or at least find an instructor that will be able to help you find something that will work well for you the number one rule in choosing a self defense firearm is that you need to be able to fire it competently and accurately for your own safety and for the safety of those around you other than the assailant in other words it needs to fit you and help you i will tell you that you should stick with the more major brands and they are generally easier to find holsters and accessories for and though they cost more they generally have a proven product and will stand behind their warranty if their product does malfunction for some reason i personally am looking to get the springfield xd due to the way it seems to fit my hand like a glove but the model as well as the browning hi power its mm brother are both good guns i am fond of the glocks are good but seem to keep getting more expensive and the sig p is good along with some of their other offerings i can't shoot the sig p very well do to my hand covering the grip so completely that i depress the magazine release a problem that makes follow up shots difficult i also like the taurus millenium which is offered in mm as well as other calibers and makes a good concealed carry weapon if you have the necessary permit and it is legal where you live but my mother who's hands are quite smaller than my own has the same problem with the magazine release on it although i do not like i said before your weapon needs to work with you otherwise you will not be comfortable and therefore will endanger those around you when you fire GLOCK Machine gun Terminal ballistics Internal ballistics Semi-automatic self-loading pistol M1911 Ammunition M60 machine gun Stopping power .357
