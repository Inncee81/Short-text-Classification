i dont know if i should play football this season girls question for you too ok i really dont know if i want to play football im not sure i dont want to go to the pratices and sometimes i dont even know what they are doing half the times on the plays i never get them down the only reasons i want to play is because ill miss going into prep rallys wiht the football teams and jv teams dont play on friday nights we play on mondays when nobody is there also we do go to friday nights games we just stand there on the bench to make the varisity team look bigger and everyone is friday games and the girls i liked i told them that i played football and now if they dont see me with the uniform this girl idk what they will think of me im so indesicive and im really going to miss the events and all that but at the same time i dont want to go to pratcies everyday and saturdays i got so many other things i can do instead of playing it my heart is really not into the game i dont know what to do please any advice also if you girls like a guy would u stop talking ot him because he doesnt play football also does it matter what sport the guy you like plays too you what sport do u girls like best for guys in your school football or high school wrestling i think that you just answered your own question when you indicated that your heart is not in to it it seems that the only reason that you are staying with the sport is simply for the parties ya sure it's great to be part of the center of attention but if all you are is a bench warmer and you're not in to it then give it up let someone else who really loves the game and who really wants to play your playing time i'm kinda in the same boat as you are the only difference is that i play on a womens professional team and i love the game problem is that i can hold my own on the field but i don't get that much playing time it's the off season for us and i'm debating on if i should play next season or 'hang up my cleates' i love the game i'm just not being played and to just ride the bench is not worth it to me so i have just as much soul searching to do as you do good luck National Football League Football (soccer) American football Cincinnati Bengals Major League Baseball television contracts Atomic Kitten New York Giants Baseball Sport Lynbrook High School Bowl Championship Series Canadian football Al Michaels Cleveland Browns 1957 World Series Babe Ruth New York Jets Canadian Football League Clemson University College football Quizbowl 2005 NFL season National Football League Lore Rugby union Sydney Riot of 1879 Brett Favre Rugby football Jennifer Lopez Playoff St. Louis Cardinals Comparison of Canadian and American football Carolina Panthers World Football League New York Knicks American Football League Torquay United F.C.
