girls lacrosse team hi i'd like to play lacrosse next year i'm very small which posistion do you think i could do i'm getting in shape i don't have much experience though i have an old stick though i'd love to make the team but what do you do for tryouts thanks don't worry for a second about your size the best player i know who captained a national championship college team and just toured europe with the us lacrosse team is ' she was a defensive star at point in high school and led the offense as an attack wing in college i'm a goalie and i'm ' i know my size intimidates shooters but i have seen many a quick smaller goalie and i have no doubt that their size helps them not just in quickness but in their being underestimated by shooters lacrosse is not really about strength or size it's about skill quickness and positioning our field and our game is so large and long that a few inches in reach will not make a huge difference beyond the middle school level try outs will involve a lot of catching and throwing shuttle passes partner passing you'll do some ground balls probably against two or three people there will probably also be some scrimmaging some opportunities to show you defensive skills your attack skills and your ability to see the field and recognize where you need to be to make an impact i might also expect some sprints and distance running all depending on your age level definitely get in shape try to run with a ball in your stick as often as you can there is a real range in how much the different positions run as a goalie i'm pretty much stationary but i need a lot of strength in my thighs to maintain proper stance and movement the close defense point cover point and third man and close offense first second and third homes always stay back behind the restraining line and don't do all that much running the attack and defense wings and the center are all over the field and need to do a lot of sprinting through the mid field lacrosse is a game of quick transitions across a long field followed by slow pretty stationary play if you can really run you can play absolutely anywhere if you aren't a runner look at the close positions but in the end it's really going to be your coach who places you work on your stick skills try to find a brick wall you can throw a ball against try to get catches in a row to either side high above your shoulder and low around hip level being able to switch hands is critical at the high school varsity level and incredibly valuable at the junior varsity level work on ground balls running at the ball at full speed and while it is rolling away from you make sure you get down low that is what makes the difference you can run into a group of four trying to get the ball and if you get lower than they do it's scrape those knuckles on the ground work on getting some quick feet especially if you are thinking about defense you'll need strong thighs to keep yourself low with legs bent jump rope work on lateral movement getting low and move to your sides don't hop and don't cross your feet i've often heard it said by coaches all the way through the college level that if you can run they can teach you lacrosse get in shape watch as much lacrosse as you can if you can show you are an athlete and that you are coordinated a good coach will snatch you up and teach you everything you need to know with hard work your skills will come Canadian football Aerial (dance move) Fast bowling American football strategy Rugby union positions Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling holds Fielding (cricket) Ice hockey Batting (cricket) New York Giants Swingout Basketball Badminton Comparison of Canadian and American football Dog agility Rugby union Ultimate (sport) Table tennis Billiards Cincinnati Bengals Rugby league positions Professional wrestling throws Cricket Pittsburgh Steelers Professional wrestling attacks Poker jargon Glossary of ballet terms Marching band San Francisco 49ers Football (soccer) positions National Football League Lore Offensive team Boxing Super Bowl IX Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl XXV Tag Natural Selection (computer game) Tai Chi Chuan Glossary of partner dance terms Field hockey Super Bowl XXVI Athletics Sport rowing Norway national football team Football (soccer) Team Fortress Classic Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Craps English cricket team Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers 1957 World Series Rugby league Wide receiver Super Bowl XXI Blitzball Super Bowl XXXVI Baseball statistics Super Bowl III Golf Naruto jutsu Paintball Mouse (computing) Laws of cricket Four square Goaltender Quake III Arena Defensive team Super Bowl XVII GunBound Mixed martial arts Tris Speaker Professional wrestling aerial techniques Yao Ming Dodgeball Wing Chun Reggie Jackson Internal ballistics Australian rules football Snooker Parade (military) Weight training Paragliding Suplex
