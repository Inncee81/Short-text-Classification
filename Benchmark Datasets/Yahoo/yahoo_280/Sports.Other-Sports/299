ok am i the only one who thinks cheerleading is a sport give me your honest opinion well again the little kids that cheer on the sidelines that say go and jump up and down screaming no thats not a sport but when you get older and you actually compete its a little better but i did acro for years and i competed in duets and solos and i can do basically of the stuff that they can do but then again i dont think dancing is a sport either and no matter what anyone says i will never think cheerleading is a sport it doesnt have any where near the physical level that sports have i mean i have been swimming running and doing trathlons for about years and cheerleading is nothing compared to that thats just my opinion sorry but i dont think cheerleading is a sport i think its more of an extra carricular activity or maybe a little more than that but not a sport and i know people say but ping pong and things like that are sports and i still dont think those are sports you dont have to train as hard as you do for other sports but its all my opinion and my one opinion probably counts for about nothing Cheerleading American football Sport Table tennis Teen Girl Squad Volleyball Turandot Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Paragliding Aikido Aerial (dance move) Fanny Blankers-Koen Roller skating Double the Fist Dog agility Gothic metal Beer Pong Tag University of Houston Sports timeline University of Kentucky Parkour Martial art United States Air Force Academy Triathlon Marching band Care Bears Carey Baptist Grammar School Physical education Michelle Kwan Parachuting Mahjong Atomic Kitten PONG George School Thom Yorke Jennifer Lopez Diving Fukuoka, Fukuoka Minnesota Golden Gophers National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) Winter Olympic Games Kim Possible Lance Armstrong Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Gottfried Leibniz Swimming Porsche 911 Randy Jackson (musician) Ultimate (sport) RuneScape Mini-Games WZZM Playoff Texas A&M University Competition Secondary education in the United States Saved by the Bell Exercise Bristol Grammar School Billboard Hot 100 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Cardcaptor Sakura Athletics University of San Diego Tennis Lindy Hop Scouting Adventure racing 2004 Summer Olympics Pump It Up Roger Federer Atari 2600 Ryan Leaf Game Obedience training Color Iraq War The Chemical Brothers Bj__rn Borg Computer and video game genres 2005 United States Grand Prix Cranford, New Jersey Scream (film) Drinking game Summer Olympic Games Amateurism Video game music Sport in Ireland Pascack Valley High School Super Mario 64 United States Naval Academy Professional wrestling attacks Mies Beavis and Butt-head Parapsychology Stanford Band Joe Pass Pittsburgh Steelers Sports medicine
