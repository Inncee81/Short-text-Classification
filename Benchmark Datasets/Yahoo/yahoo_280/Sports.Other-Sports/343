do you think that it is irresponsible for a famous radio jock to say to compete you have to use steriods i heard a famous early morning black radio jock say that the only way to compete in high school college and the rpofessional level the athlete has to take steriods i find that irresponsible and incomprehensivable that statement is as bad or worse than don imus using racial slurs the racial slurs hurt emotionally and you learned to forgive for sake of ignorance and god but steriods can not only kill an inspiring athlete but can maim him and destroy their bodies forever ask him does his wife take steriods since she is a fitness expert i am tired of these so called ordained leaders in the black community sitting on a righteous stump and keeping blacks down now he telling us how to kill ourselves or destroy our ability to have little black babies because the side effect of steriods is sterilization tell this morning jock to shut up and get the facts right and better yet tell his sponsors to shut him up get the facts mr jock before you speak again you are all wet without getting into the racial angle i think the statement has some merit it you're talking about professional sports or at least it did if everything that is being said is anywhere close to true close to half of all major league baseball players were using some form of steroids if you're someone trying to make it in the league it's difficult to say no when many of the people you are competing with against are using if the radio jock was directing his comments at high school or college kids then yes it was irresponsible but when you're talking about professional athletes i don't think it's that simple Don Imus WFAN (AM) Shock jock Amateurism Volleyball Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma National Football League Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Alcoholics Anonymous St. Louis Cardinals Baseball Can't Hardly Wait Sydney Riot of 1879 Columbine High School massacre Jim Thorpe Ben Johnson (athlete) The Death Gate Cycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chicago Cubs Sola fide University of Houston Saved by the Bell Summa Theologiae Tai Chi Chuan The Shining (film) American football University of Notre Dame History of baseball in the United States Shaggy dog story The Jim Rome Show Babe Ruth Plame affair Ty Cobb Lance Armstrong Rick Santorum Tiger Woods Autism rights movement Negro league baseball Beavis and Butt-head Social rule Anti-Defamation League High school subcultures Weight training The Brothers Karamazov God Emperor of Dune Infantilism University of Miami Opie and Anthony John Howard Yoder Sport Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Salary cap 2004-05 NHL lockout Cricket Avenue Q WQHT (FM) Muhammad Ali Laura Schlessinger Mixed martial arts Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Anabolic steroid The Amber Spyglass Arizona State University Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Triathlon Barry Bonds Professional sports Rush Limbaugh Hip hop culture Survivor (novel) University of Maryland, College Park Mickey Mantle Vegeta Abrahamic religion Florida State University Sport in the United Kingdom Nashua, New Hampshire Howard Stern Carpal tunnel syndrome Past teachings of Prem Rawat Deion Sanders Minor league baseball Tenshinhan Middle Tennessee State University Paul Is Dead Football (soccer) Justification (theology) College basketball Nation of Islam American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Satchel Paige Celebrity Jackson, Mississippi Rosa Parks Fast bowling Team Fortress Classic
