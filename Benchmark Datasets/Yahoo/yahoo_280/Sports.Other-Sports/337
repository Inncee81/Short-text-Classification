i need advice first of all i'm a girl and i'm a gymnast have been for years i'm i love being in gymnastics most of the time any gymnast knows it can be pretty hectic my gym mostly isn't so competitive but when compeition comes it's crunch time i have really good friends there one is quitting and the other is going to start coming less often and stop competing i don't want to quit but the days that she won't be there will be horrible i don't want to switch gyms either this is my th gym and that's too much but i kinda wanna do what my friend is doing come less and not compete but then i know i won't work as hard and i don't know how to talk to my parents about it they'll think that my friend is influencing me too much and they'll get mad like what's the point if you aren't competing i've told them i do gymnastics for fun and they say well you still need to do it well normally my parents are great and easy to talk to but not when it comes to this well what is important is what you want to do if your one friend was staying all the days and competing would you if your answer is yes then you should keep doing it do you like to go all the days do you like to compete it should really be what you want to do when i was in gym there was only girls on the whole team and they were two year olds one year old a year old and an year old and then i was so i did it for me not for anyone else also as the other person pointed out who knows maybe someone else will join later Artistic gymnastics Cliff Richard The Amazing Race Little Britain Sport Pok__mon Chronicles Pok__mon Live!
