what baseball position i just got into baseball like weeks ago im years old what position would be good for me i can throw pretty fast if that helps if you're a lefty try your hand at pitching anywhere in the outfield or at first base if you're right handed you can pretty much play any position i always liked being a catcher because you control the game and a strong arm is always good for that position Baseball Softball Baseball positions Randy Johnson Baseball statistics Tris Speaker Stolen base Sandy Koufax Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Babe Ruth 1957 World Series September 20 in baseball Ted Radcliffe Catcher Pitcher Chicago White Sox October 10 in baseball Moe Berg October 30 in baseball World Series Lefty Grove New York Yankees First baseman Detroit Tigers Marius Russo 2004 World Series Babe Ruth's Called Shot October 5 in baseball Reggie Jackson Los Angeles Dodgers October 20 in baseball Origins of baseball Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 October 21 in baseball Craig Biggio Nolan Ryan Baseball scorekeeping 1981 World Series October 4 in baseball 1919 World Series Andr__s Galarraga Ty Cobb New York Mets October 9 in baseball Interference (baseball) Johnny Bench Major League Baseball television contracts Umpire (baseball) Stan Musial Manny Ram__rez Atlanta Braves October 14 in baseball Bob Johnson (baseball) San Diego Padres Pete Rose October 22 in baseball Derek Jeter Mike Scioscia October 26 in baseball June 2 in baseball Major League Baseball Hank Greenberg June 11 in baseball Fast bowling Willie Mays Bo Diaz Wes Ferrell October 29 in baseball Knickerbocker Rules Pedro Mart__nez October 8 in baseball Gary Sheffield Tim Wakefield October 12 in baseball Toronto Blue Jays October 27 in baseball Boston Red Sox June 3 in baseball Cricket September 6 in baseball Baseball glove Carlton Fisk Bernie Williams Satchel Paige Jimmie Foxx Perfect game Baserunning Baseball Stars Alex Rodriguez 1991 World Series Houston Astros Balk October 18 in baseball Lefty G__mez Bert Campaneris International League Ichiro Suzuki Box score (baseball)
