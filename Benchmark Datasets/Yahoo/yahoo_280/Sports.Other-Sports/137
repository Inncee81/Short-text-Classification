question regarding a smart parts epiphany read description ok so i'm interested in getting a smart parts epiphany and before i by it i want to make sure i get a bang for my buck and not some piece of trash so what im looking for is someone who can relate to the gun by either owning it or working with them on a regular basis i want your feedback so i can make the best possible purchase if you dont have any clue what your talking about dont bother posting anything the smart parts epiphany marker is basically an upgraded version of the sp ion marker and shares looks and many part with the ion i have shot a few epiphanies and they are out of the box better than the ion out of the box but you do pay a good bit more for them the trigger is not nearly as good as many of the after market triggers that are made for the ion and the body looks tacky to me now when i first saw it i thought that it looked pretty cool but that wore off it's barrel system is way better than the stock ion and the reg isn't the same as the ion's reg i am pretty sure about this but i know wome people will swear that it is the same either way it doesn't matter cause the stock ion reg isn't as bad as most people say it is i would say that if you just want to buy something and leave it the way you bought it the epiphany is a pretty good choice i would chose the invert mini cause it is better and around the same price range or i would look at the proto matrix rail pmr is what it is commonly referred to around most places and i don't know as much about this gun and it may be a fair bit higher but i liked the one that a guy at the field let me use a little on the target range if you want a gun that you can keep tinkering with i would get the ion and purchase a trigger and some sort of drop along with a barrel and a qev helps with efficiency and then go online to a forum like pbnation com and look at some of the other thing that are available also there are very many body kits available for the ion and if you really don't like the looks of it there is everything from different colored sp style ones to milsim style bodies to crazy custom anodized milled aluminum ones and they come on every budget line too i will say this as well if you don't like the feel of the gun don't get it you probably wont like it any more if your in a uncomfortable position with more weight on the marker get the most comfortable marker you can find and if it doesn't perform they way you want there are always lots of things you can to that will improve any mid level marker's performance but there isn't a whole lot to fix discomfort Paintball marker Theory of conduct M60 machine gun Paintball Economics Microeconomics Airsoft Poker jargon M16 (rifle) Extreme Programming Social rule Equine conformation Surveillance Monopoly (game) The Amazing Race Plastic Blood (computer game) Supply and demand Neopets Singlish Beretta 92F/FS Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Toyota Prius Mattress Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Firearm Humphrey Bogart Mac OS X Advanced Squad Leader Drill bit Corporate governance Heckler & Koch G3 GunBound Bass guitar RuneScape High-voltage direct current Short selling 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pump It Up PE ratio Atari 8-bit family Publicly funded medicine Shit Internet fraud Floppy disk Computer role-playing game Apple Macintosh Capitalism RuneScape economy Xbox 360 Nuclear weapon design Nintendo Carbine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ford Motor Company Team Fortress Classic M82 (rifle) M240 Public Eye Kodocha Porsche 993 Internal ballistics United States Postal Service Keynesian economics RuneScape quests BZFlag Shotgun Diode Ion Particle accelerator Mutual fund MAME Opera (web browser) Gross domestic product Gas metal arc welding IBM PC compatible Passenger car Hiberno-English Carburetor Motion capture System/36 Rifle The Apprentice 2 Supply-side economics Milton H.
