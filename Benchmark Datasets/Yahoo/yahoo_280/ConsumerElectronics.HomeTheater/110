how do i set up my dvd player to show full widescreen on my tv when i play widescreen dvd's they show up on my widescreen tv with black bars on top and down how do i get the full widescreen view on a widescreen tv without the black bars this is a common problem and the answer is likely one of the following or perhaps a combination of the two check your dvd player settings note not your tv you should have an aspect ratio or tv output setting that lets you choose one of the following full screen widescreen select make sure your tv is in the mode not one of the expanded or stretch modes and you should be good to go if you've checked and found that this wasn't the problem or if you've checked found it was the problem but still see black bars on the top and bottom when viewing some movies then it is likely due to the aspect ratio of the original film films are shot in a bunch of varied aspect ratios some of the more typical are this is called academy standard and is most commonly referred to as full frame full screen or non hdtv television programs are displayed in an aspect ration similar to this and all films that were shot before the 's were filmed in this format when correctly displayed on a widescreen tv you should see vertical black bars on the left and right side of the screen after the invention of the television hello 's the exhibition branch of the studio system was in a downward spiral how do you keep audiences from staying at home and watching the boob tube why a new aspect ratio that is not available on the tv that's how enter the age of widescreen this aspect ratio is most commonly referred to as and many hdtv television programs are displayed in this format your widescreen tv is so films in this format will display without any bars whatsoever pop some popcorn and enjoy what's wider than widescreen why this aspect ratio which is commonly referred to as anamorphic widescreen or cinemascope special lenses are used to achieve this aspect ratio and many epics are filmed in this format think lawrence of arabia and it's sense of desert grandeur it is also commonly adopted by auteurs seeking to further accentuate their individual style think wes anderson's use of anamorphic in his films rushmore and the royal tenenbaums for example when viewing films shot in this format you will experience black bars at the top and bottom of the screen to help accommodate the wider aspect ratio this is normal and there is no way around this unless you gasp choose to use a zoom setting on your tv but this detracts from the viewing experience this was a little long winded but i hope it helps High-definition television Movie projector 35 mm film Letterbox Panavision Stereoscopy Cinerama Cinemascope Video Cinematography NTSC Beatmania IIDX 3-D film DVD Pan and scan IMAX Computer display standard Matte (filmmaking) 3-perf and 2-perf pulldown Digital photography Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Digital television Todd-AO Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Movie camera Sega Dreamcast Infantilism The Criterion Collection Digital cinema Pixel 16 mm film Panoramic photography Babylon 5 Tom and Jerry (MGM) Oscilloscope Mouse (computing) Digital cinematography Windows Vista ATSC Computer and video game genres View camera Photography Resident Evil 4 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Leica Redundant array of independent disks X86 assembly language Eye DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 70 mm film Dance Dance Revolution Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis The Ultimate Matrix Collection Poker jargon Liquid crystal display Bubble Bobble EIA-708 Screenshot C programming language Resident Evil: Apocalypse Color Graphics Adapter MPEG-2 Karaoke MP3 A Course In Miracles GunBound Amstrad CPC Computer animation Snooker Star Wars VistaVision Projection screen TGV DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Gramophone record SCART Inflation Textile manufacturing Marching band Gradius Bicycle X Window System Star Trek: Enterprise RGB color model Atari 8-bit family Unicode The Internet Movie Database Technicolor
