who's home theater book would you read if you had a choice on who you would want to write a book on home theater who would you choose i ask you to limit your submissions to those who participate in the home theater section robert i do take exception to an answer that is clearly wrong several times i do not understand how the rant i'll call it answers my question i did read your response with the included web page and i have to question the acuracy of any information contained since it has errors al over the place you'll notice that i rarely use sources like wiki to prove a point unless i would have wrote the same information the same way your statement about another guy saying a rms figure who will soon be familiarised with characteristic impedance as well seem childish the real reason for my inquiry was to see from other general askers who's informational delivery is the easiest to understand i was recently approched about a book deal for high end home theater and stereo systems i wanted to see about possible contributers and a popular writing style of information if i had a choice i would pick thinkenstien but i wanted to see what others thought thanks thinkenstien you really do get what i mean i rarley see an answer from you that doesn't contain at least one or three questions you really try to get to the bottom of the issue i doubt if you are fishing for compliments but i would read yours you have a good combination of technical education and practical experience and i find i agree with your opinions edit robert must misunderstand us i have heard no one suggest that components are not vital and i doubt if robert would trade his speakers in for a pair of fisher speakers having worked in audio for quite a while i had the opportunity to try different speakers with the same components and different components with the same speakers yes components do make a big difference we once hooked up a b k amp to some old fisher speakers and were quite surprised at the results nevertheless there are even bigger differences in the sound of speakers than there are in the sound of components speakers can not improve sound but some are more neutral than others try listening to some lousy bose speakers on the same amplifier and cd player as some monitor audio speakers i have done this and there really is a huge difference i have heard it every audiophile i have known acknowledges that speaker sound quality differs even more than component sound quality and every audio journal i have read acknowledges this those on a limited budget are wise to invest in a good amp and great speakers rather than a great amp and good speakers robert by your standards no one who has experience testing speakers and components is an audiophile since real world experimentation makes them recognize that speakers sound more different from one another than components do Audiophile Loudspeaker High fidelity MP3 Gramophone record Operational amplifier Electronic amplifier Bose Corporation Compact disc Vorbis Biblical inerrancy Extreme Programming Phonograph Stereophonic sound Sound recording XML Scientific method Bass guitar Laserdisc DVD Philosophy of language Redundant array of independent disks SAT Visual Basic Headphones Appeal Monty Hall problem Speech recognition Oscilloscope International Phonetic Alphabet Audio data compression Corporate governance Scientology beliefs and practices Enterprise content management Clarinet Impedance Contract Microphone Audio crossover Killian documents Psychology Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Gross domestic product Compact audio cassette Philosophy Super Audio CD Decibel Expert system Chinese character Esperanto as an international language Wikipedia Spanish language Hearing impairment Socrates GED Microeconomics Meaning of life Phoneme Supply and demand Quizbowl IBM PC compatible Economics Bicycle lighting Inflation Home cinema Debate Cultural relativism God Emperor of Dune Computer Finnish language Milgram experiment Transistor Past teachings of Prem Rawat Goodness and value theory Sound design African American Vernacular English Objectivist philosophy Geographic information system Epistemology Homeopathy The writing of Principia Mathematica Atheism Atari ST Consensus decision-making A Course In Miracles Stuttering Neuro-linguistic programming Jacob Neusner Debugging Impedance matching Non-native pronunciations of English Internet troll
