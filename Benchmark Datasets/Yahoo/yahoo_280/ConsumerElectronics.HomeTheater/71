best way to use speakers in a tiny house we have the standard speakers with a powered subwoofer great brand kenwood we've recently moved into a tiny house and i am at a loss about how best to arrange speakers so that two adjoining rooms can share sound is it possible to use the surround speakers as additional regular speakers ie left and right front how does one do that or how should i lay out the setup so that both rooms get good sound thanks you will need to check your owner's manual and see if there is a dual room room feature on your receiver this will allow you to turn two of the rear surrounds or back surrounds to stereo speakers for a second room this feature is found on some of the more expensive systems if you do have one then it will be easy to configure the surrounds for the second room you can also add a second powered subwoofer by getting a rca y splitter and hooking into the existing audio cable to the first subwoofer hope this helps email me if you need additional info Loudspeaker Surround sound Home cinema Car audio Laserdisc IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Digital Theatre System High fidelity Kenwood Electronics Bass guitar Microphone Motorcycle DVD Jack plug Stereophonic sound MP3 Electronic amplifier Universal Serial Bus Advance Wars: Dual Strike Sound Blaster Television Danger Hiptop AppleTalk Movie projector Xbox FM broadcasting SCART DVD-Audio Gramophone record Lamborghini Diablo German language Atari ST Bose Corporation Amstrad CPC Phonograph AmigaOS ATI Technologies Audio file format M16 (rifle) Table saw It's All Gone Pete Tong Redundant array of independent disks Pretty Good Privacy Dolby Laboratories Lincoln LS PC Engine Dolby Digital Dolby Pro Logic Compact audio cassette Renault 25 Nintendo DS Nintendo Entertainment System Bicycle Electronic organ Bicycle lighting Mazda Miata Mazda 323 Game Boy Dai dai shogi Mixing console Telephone exchange BMW M5 Toyota Camry Receiver (radio) Abbey Hard disk Synthesizer NTSC Vowel Karaoke Coaxial cable Mitsubishi 3000GT Mozilla Firefox Tai shogi Porsche 911 Taikyoku shogi Digital audio broadcasting Semi-trailer Teletext Traffic light Anchor Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting PHP Dutch language IBM PC compatible Impedance matching Panasonic OpenBSD De Lorean DMC-12 Toyota MR2 Emacs System 7 (Macintosh) DIN connector XERF
