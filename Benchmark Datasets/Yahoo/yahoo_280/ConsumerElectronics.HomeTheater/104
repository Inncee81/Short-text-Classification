projector or tv i'm looking to buy a lcd projector or a larger television set which one do you think is better for the money and what brands would you recommend i'm not looking to spend too much money but i want something nice this should depend on what other components you are using with your home theatre for example if you are very concerned about the quality resolution of your picture you would want to go with a regular tv set rather than a projector some projectors can produce the same quality as flat panel tvs but you would need to spend a large amount of money for one if you aren't so concerned about picture quality perhaps if you don't really have hi def inputs cable set top boxes blu ray ps etc you would be able to go with a projector and most likely get a bigger screen size for your money however projector screens generally don't perform very well in rooms that aren't considerably dark so if your viewing room is more lighted or you have windows in it you may want to consider a flat panel instead lcd flat panels are very good at handling reflective light overall my opinion would be that a flat panel tv is a better investment as far as plasma or lcd flat panels panasonic would pretty much be top of the line but samsung is good if you don't necessarily want to shell out too much cash and they are still very high quality tvs if you decide to go the projector and screen route sony projectors pretty much dominate as far as the screens it really doesn't make too much difference but draper is a safe bet hope this helps nick ryan Liquid crystal display Television Liquid crystal display television Plasma display Movie projector Digital photography Loudspeaker High-definition television Projection screen Oscilloscope PlayStation Portable DLP Poker jargon Solar power TFT LCD Digital projector Home cinema Widescreen Cathode ray tube Photography Movie theater Light-emitting diode IMAX Laptop IMac Gross domestic product Solar cell Lighting Panasonic SCART LCD projector Digital television Home Box Office Computer display Screensaver Betting (poker) Game show Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Slide projector Handheld game console Craps Inflation Sharp Corporation Stereoscopy Digital cinematography Paintball Color Mutual fund Digital Visual Interface November (film) ITV Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Laserdisc Digital cinema Teletext Theory of conduct Universal Studios High fidelity Textile manufacturing Windows XP Film Wood Xbox 360 Gameking Contrast ratio FairTax Floppy disk The Suffering (game) PLATO Samsung Nintendo Virtual Boy Mattress Gas metal arc welding Drill bit Sound Blaster Microeconomics Virtual memory Embedded system Wood carving Xbox Let's Make a Deal Bluetooth Blu-ray Disc Avenue Q Atari 8-bit family Mouse (computing) Dance Dance Revolution $ale of the Century Glass Headlight Marshall Plan Light rail
