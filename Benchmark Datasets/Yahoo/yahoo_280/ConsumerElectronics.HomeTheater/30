whats this piece of stereo equipment when your stereo is playing music is shows bars going up and down i think their for the different frequency's like when a symbol splash's one of the bars will shoot up what is this piece of equipment and what are the benefits of having one that is an audio spectrum analysis display you are right that each bar represents a frequency range with the far left bars indicating low frequencies and the right side bars indicating high frequencies the height of the bar at any instant indicates the volume level of the frequency range represented by that bar i'm not sure what the value of having one of these in an ordinary stereo since you really can't do anything about the information it provides in professional recording the analyzer is used to make sure that no frequency exceeds maximum recording level a single lever meter vu meter will indicate overall record level but sometimes a certain frequency will overload and that may not indicate on a single vu meter display Microphone Compact audio cassette Stereoscopy Gramophone record Transformer Oscilloscope Frequency modulation Amateur radio Digital audio broadcasting Solar cell Digital VHS High fidelity Movie projector Audiophile Sound recording Very high frequency Mixing console Sound Laserdisc Loudspeaker Subwoofer Transistor Digital audio Decibel Vowel TV-FM DX Federal Standard 1037C Sound effect FM broadcasting Citizens' band radio Multitrack recording SIGSALY Circuit design Transmitter Vacuum tube Kenwood Electronics Binaural recording Stereophonic sound NTSC Explosive material Psychoacoustics Wi-Fi Capacitor Digital-to-analog converter Bluetooth Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Sea level rise Audio level compression VHF omnidirectional range Time signature Radio International Phonetic Alphabet Radar Complex number Operational amplifier Frequency Sampler (musical instrument) Harp Digital circuit Diode Normal distribution Karaoke 8 mm video format Synthesizer Signal (information theory) Compact disc National Weather Service High-voltage direct current Super Audio CD Analog-to-digital converter Neurofeedback Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Audio mastering MIM-23 Hawk Huygens probe Ionosphere Acorn Electron Equalization Antenna (radio) Frequency spectrum Subcarrier Monochromator Permittivity Dolby Laboratories Laser Glider Big band Amplitude modulation Longwave Electronic organ Advanced Audio Coding Musical notation Rebreather Optical coherence tomography Joint (audio engineering) Amstrad CPC Audio data compression
