where is the best place to put a subwoofer in a room i know subs are louder in certain places when you walk around a room so im just wondering where i can put it to get the most out of it if you are a surround sound enthusiast then the best place for the sub is behind the tv its worth looking at the construction of your room do you have floorboards it may be worth placing a thin peice of foam under the sub to prevent feedback along the floor this also creates a sweeter bass note building a sub into coffee tables etc is not unknown but some people do not like cables hanging about the place and you are limited as to where to put the sub besides the missus might not like it most subs like the corner of the room about ten inches from each wall the bass will then resonate off each wall along the floor and fill the room if the sub is of the non passive type with its own amp built in set the volume to about half but this depends on your set up hope this helps to the poster below you above everyone else should know that in the audio visual world everyones requirements differ no two listening rooms are the same what may work for one may not work for another but all rooms have one thing in common they all have corners Loudspeaker Subwoofer Bass guitar Guitar Electronic amplifier Car audio Fire fighting Basement Audiophile Transformer Xanadu House Seismic retrofit Clarinet Surround sound Operational amplifier Stairway Timpani Dundas Square Stuttering Japanese tea ceremony Flute Wood Ethernet Out-of-body experience Home cinema Professional wrestling match types Authentic performance Insulation G-Man (Half-Life) Violin Mattress Casting Poker jargon Doom engine Solar power Audio level compression Geodesic dome Compact audio cassette Double bass Microphone The Dalek Invasion of Earth Stave church High fidelity Radar Vowel Glossary of partner dance terms Model aircraft Fischer Random Chess Timber framing Kitchen Gramophone record Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Thermal power station John Cage Naval mine The Wall Valve sound Bose Corporation MP3 Bristol Grammar School Low-pass filter Acoustics Echo chamber Nine Inch Nails Compact disc Electric guitar Electrophysiology Karaoke Circuit design Audi A2 John Frusciante Animal Crossing Submarine Strap-on dildo Sento Single Transferable Vote Paragliding Radio Stereophonic sound Cube (film) Lighting Antenna (radio) Billboard (advertising) Laserdisc Great Pyramid of Giza Hearing impairment Drill bit Office Chaco Culture National Historical Park Action potential Television studio Chatsworth House Movie projector Radar cross section The Doctor Dances Theater (structure) Pipe organ Oceanic trench
