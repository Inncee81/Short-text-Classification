i've heard blu rays can hold gigs per side but how many gigs does the average blu ray movie actually use blu ray was designed to hold just over four hours of high definition video when encoded at a constant bit rate of mbps onto a gb dual layer disc individual movies have different run times and the bit rate can vary depending on the choices made by the people doing the encoding so individual movies can end up using less than half of a blu ray disc's capacity or a particularly long movie encoded at a high bit rate can fill the disc to capacity referenced below is a list of the actual gb used on individual blu ray movies for example the blu ray version of good night and good luck uses gb for the movie portion and gb total including menus extras etc pearl harbor which runs over three hours and is encoded at a fairly high bit rate packs gb for the movie alone and nearly maxes out the dual layer blu ray capacity at gb total see a list of bit rates and capacities for individual blu ray movie titles in the wikipedia resource link below DVD MP3 Blu-ray Disc Floppy disk Laserdisc H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Movie projector Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Pump It Up Hard disk CPU cache PlayStation Portable Super Audio CD High-definition television CD-ROM ITunes Phase-shift keying Color Video codec Oscilloscope Resident Evil (video game) Analog-to-digital converter Addressing mode DualDisc Redundant array of independent disks ITU-T MPEG-2 Video CD IPod Compact audio cassette ATI Technologies Phase (matter) DVD-R Final Fantasy VI DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX UTF-8 DV Unicode Uniform Resource Locator Unemployment Modchip Blu Cantrell Modem XML SMPTE time code Ship ITunes Music Store Drill bit Baseball Stars Federal Standard 1037C Inflation Endianness RISC Scooby-Doo Unix time ALGOL 68 Internal ballistics Expert system Autodesk Media and Entertainment Wind power Solar cell Super Nintendo Entertainment System Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Original Amiga chipset DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution IS-95 X86 assembly language Digital audio broadcasting PlayStation 2 DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Macromedia Flash USS Tunny (SS-282) Nintendo GameCube Extended display identification data Atari 8-bit family Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hash table Casting Astronomical seeing Lossless data compression Information entropy Pentium 4 Explosive material Jet engine Nintendo DS Gramophone record Motorola 68000 Audiophile CD recorder IBM PC Apollo Guidance Computer Asynchronous Transfer Mode Communications protocol Digital audio Music QuickTime PC Engine Central processing unit
