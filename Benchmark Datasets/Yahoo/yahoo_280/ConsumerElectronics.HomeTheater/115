what do i need to do in order to hook my laptop up to my tv to watch movies i have an svideo hook up on both the laptop and the tv is there anything but an svideo hook up in order to get the video on the tv i will have to use a y audio cable for the sound correct we have a dvd player but this is a downloaded movie on my laptop i bought a svideo cord and already have a y rca cord for the audio i'll be trying it as soon as i get the tv which does have an s hookup on the back away from my brother these days most tvs have an s video port on the back but if yours does not there is a way to convert s video to composite not to be confused with component video by the way composite video is the standard yellow color coded rca type connector same type as the red and white audio jacks but not using the same cable for video you must use a coaxial video cable audio uses a non coaxial type have i made matters worse or better yet converting the s output of your laptop to the composite video your tv may require is not a simple affair there are adaptors for this but you may not necessarily find one at radio shack would certainly be worth the phone call though meanwhile your best bet would be to have a tv with the s video connector on it you can find one for cheap on craigslist in your area of this i am certain the other part of your question a y adaptor meaning a stereo mini plug coming from your headphone output to a pair of female rca red white jacks is the way to go for getting audio out of the laptop or you can also buy a longer y that has the stereo mini plug on one end with longer leads and male rca plugs on the other good luck and let me know how it goes Television Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis SCART RCA connector Jack plug IPod Universal Serial Bus DVD S/PDIF Xbox D-subminiature S-Video Laserdisc Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting RCA Nintendo Entertainment System Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Musical Instrument Digital Interface Laptop PC Engine Headphones Ethernet PlayStation Portable NTSC Loudspeaker Xbox 360 Copy protection Gender of connectors and fasteners Compact disc DIN connector Desktop computer AES/EBU Composite video Modem Oscilloscope Computer bus TRS connector Commodore 64 USB flash drive TIA-568A/B Coaxial cable Walkman Sega Dreamcast Sound card Personal computer Sound Blaster Game Boy Advance Component video Cable television Registered jack Gramophone record High fidelity Telephone exchange Atari 8-bit family Lighting Original Amiga chipset Karaoke Light-emitting diode Stereoscopy Archos Sound recording S-VHS Synthesizer Audiophile American Broadcasting Company Digital Visual Interface MPEG-2 NBC MP3 RGB color model BS 1363 Liquid crystal display Home cinema Game Boy ATI Technologies Poker jargon TRS-80 Digital photography Transformer IBM PC compatible Power cord Nintendo GameCube Apple Macintosh Radio Graphics card 25-pair color code Dolby Digital Nintendo 64 Amiga
