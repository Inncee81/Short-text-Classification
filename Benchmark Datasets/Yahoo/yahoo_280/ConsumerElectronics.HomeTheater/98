watts in house party alright first off i have two technics floor standing speakers with peak power how much is that in continuous rms power second off about how many watts are used in a house party lets say inside a garage or in the yard and last but not least considering the facts i gave about my speaker what amp would be good first off robert pay attention peak power is not twice the rms this will vary according to the frequency response of the speaker since we don't have the overall frequency range or a curve for calculation there is no way to calculate a rms figure or even to guess at one since the rating should be derived from hz khz you are better off looking up the model for legacy information by contacting technics directly but this number is not of any real use the peak rating is for at a maximum how much power you never want to exceed supplying to the speaker as far as a amp do you want a receiver or separates are you wanting to use these speakers for a dj set up for parties or do you want to have a hi fi set up just know you don't want any amp to exceed that peak figure in its rating your question needs a little more detail to properly recommend any types or brands of equipment also the tonal qualities of these will greatly vary the kind of sound you get so what do you like Audiophile Audio power Circuit design Decibel Bass guitar Alternating current Electric motor Cellular network Operational amplifier Transformer Antenna (radio) Impedance Audio system measurements Kenwood Electronics Psychoacoustics NTSC Oscilloscope Solar cell Transistor X10 (industry standard) Normal distribution Resistor MP3 Inflation Shortwave Solar power Parliament of Canada Subwoofer Hard disk Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Instrument amplifier Labor theory of value Electric guitar Action potential Armored Core Microeconomics Microphone British House of Commons Electrophysiology Electrical generator AC power Economics Global Positioning System Wind power Welding Impedance matching Insurance Wind turbine Color Amateur radio Violin Capacitor Fluorescent lamp Supply and demand Speed limit Analog sound vs. digital sound Effective radiated power ITU-R 468 noise weighting Movie projector Artificial neural network Gramophone record Modem Black body High fidelity Supply-side economics Lac operon Radar Transmitter Vacuum cleaner Radio Root mean square Bicycle lighting Credit card Citizens' band radio Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Diode Exponential growth Amplitude Low-pass filter Explosive material Modelocking Password Effects unit Tone (linguistics) Failure rate Unicode Marshall Amplification Digital-to-analog converter Super Nintendo Entertainment System Speed of light Keynesian economics Rigging Parliament of the United Kingdom Vorbis
