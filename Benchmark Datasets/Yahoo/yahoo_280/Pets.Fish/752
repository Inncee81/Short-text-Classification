did i beat the ich within the last three weeks or so i saw ich developing in my tank after the introduction of my pakistani loaches when i noticed it i turned the heat up to degrees but some still came back a bit in some of my fish i then turned the heat up to and for the last three days have not seen anything the strange thing is that one of my scissor tails developed dropsy very quickly on saturday and by monday he wasn't to save so we put him down humanely the other fish have not been reinfected and no signs of dropsy temps are back at did i beat the ich no meds only high temps gal cycling for over months for discus corydoras pakistani loaches siamese algae eaters now scissor tail rasboras and rummynose tetras sorry edit temps back at degrees c animalovingirl yes i know the tank is usually at but because of ich higher temps they are allactually trying to spawn at these temps but i assure you they are completely fine the ich parasite's life cycle is days at normal tropical aquarium temps as the temp goes up the life cycle is shortened as the temp goes down the life cycle is lengthened as far as beating the ich if you have had the temp at degrees farenheit for at least days and have seen no reinfestation of the fish for days you are safe the timeline here is very important dropping the temp too soon can allow reinfestation loaches are very susceptible to ich and they would be the first to be attacked again they are scaleless fish and the ich parasite finds them particularly delicious as far as all fish being infected with ich that is just not true one of the old wives tales from back in the 's i have recently discussed this with magicman who is very knowledgeable he teaches the subject in a college course on fish diseases and he told me there is no scientific evidence to prove that the ich parasite can exist in a cyst state for any longer than that part of their normal life cycle just a few days the main way the parasite is introduced to a tank is if an infected fish is added to a tank it can also come in water from an infected fish store tank this is why you should never dump the water from the fish store bag into your own tank or on plants from an infected tank the best way to keep it out of your community tank is to have a small or gallon quarantine tank always set up and running and put your new fish into it for at least weeks before adding them to your tank btw do not combine medication with the heat treatment medications drive the o out of the water as does the heat the combination of fish weakened by the parasite and less o in the water can be lethal always increase aeration when medicating or increasing the temp a small air pump and air stone is always good to have on hand for situations like this they are cheap email me if you still have questions Marine aquarium Aquarium Temperature Myxobolus cerebralis Sewage treatment Fish farming Autonomous building Toxoplasmosis Shrimp farm Ecology Solar power Thermal power station Cephalic disorder Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hydrogen economy Diseases of the honeybee Chagas disease Rabies Goldfish Fancy rat AIDS Fossil fuel power plant Vitamin C Energy development Ulcerative colitis Ocean thermal energy conversion Multiple sclerosis Quarantine Acne Ich Biodiesel Items in the Metroid series Nutrition Schistosomiasis Pneumonia Dairy Professional wrestling throws Medicine Hookworm Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Autism Stock car (rail) Asthma Carbon dioxide Dialysis Duesberg hypothesis Herpes simplex virus Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Environmental concerns with electricity generation Diabetes mellitus Hydroponics Rocky Mountain spotted fever E85 Brewery Sleeping sickness Carburetor Infantilism Breastfeeding Thermoregulation Glossary of wildland fire terms Anopheles Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Decompression sickness Sickle-cell disease Heinkel He 100 God Emperor of Dune Biology Chinese calendar Computer virus HIV test Gas compressor First aid Clown loach CPU design Water purification Pharmaceutical company USS Yorktown (CV-5) Entamoeba histolytica Zerg Bipolar disorder Weapon Common cold Diesel engine Equine conformation Acute respiratory distress syndrome Loach Stirling engine Hypnosis Crohn's disease Shark
