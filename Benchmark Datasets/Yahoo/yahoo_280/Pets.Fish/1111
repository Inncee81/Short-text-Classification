what is the minimum size of tank for breeding clownfish i will no longer ask this question if you give me the right answer i can't find it on the internet thanx depends on what species of clown if you get percula clownfish same as ocellaris just perculas are born in captivity you can get away with a gallon tank from all of your previous posts i know this is the fish you are thinking of if you want to have success breeding them you will have to buy a breeding pair clownfish for the most part only have one mate for their life so just buying a male and female doesnt mean they will breed if you buy a breeding pair you know these fish have already had babies together so you know they should mate again i would also reccomend not having any other fish in the tank this way they feel comfortable to breed and not feel there are any predators once they do have the babies you will need a seperate tank to house the parents in or the babies so the babies do not get eaten here is a site that may put you in the right direction read it and do more research on your own everyone does things differently and you will have to find what works for you and dont get discouraged if thiongs dont work out the way you planned http www reefsuk org articles captivebreeding breedclownfish php Clownfish Percula Clownfish Platypus Bird Biology Species Marine aquarium Symbiosis Red Squirrel Goldfish Extinction Cat Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Lion Leatherback Sea Turtle Infantilism God Emperor of Dune Domain Name System Sea anemone Aquarium House Mouse Fugu Tigon Albatross Kakapo Seabird Sexual selection Non-human animal sexuality Atomic Kitten Uniform Resource Locator Breastfeeding Mosquito Advanced Squad Leader Finding Nemo PHP HyperText Transfer Protocol Shark Ant Cheetah Liger Panthera hybrid Milk Koala Anopheles Nerpa Beetle Tasmanian Devil Coconut crab Animal communication Friends Fish farming Sexual dimorphism Dairy Eugenics The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Sea-Monkey Poker jargon Spider Pok__mon Gold and Silver Hybrid Biodiesel Hamster Extreme Programming Internet troll Emu Dolphin Salmon Deer Eusociality Rei Ayanami Garter snake Metroid (video game species) Giant Panda Halfbeak Domestication American Black Bear Elephant Rhea (bird) Orca Aphid Baboon Dragons (Pern) Murray Cod Mallard Heretics of Dune Agriculture Marine biology Artificial selection Falconry Anthroposophy Life in the Freezer Genetic algorithm Great White Shark Krill Graduate school Fauna of Australia Mountain Gorilla
