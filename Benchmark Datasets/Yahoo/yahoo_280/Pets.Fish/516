goldfish doesnt seem to want his pellets any advice we just put our new goldfish into his ten gallon tank last night we have had him for five days now and i havent really noticed him eating eagerly he is swimming around and active and seems very happy just doesnt swim right up to the top to eat when we feed him he had an old pellet floating in his tank last night and we watched and it kept hitting the current from the filter and rocketing down into the water where it would float around he would notice it and dart at it then he would suck it in and spit it back out repeatedly we figure he is just exploring and learning or maybe playing but he wont eat the pellets and watching him spit it out so many times made me wonder if maybe they arent too big for him to eat hes only about inches long a ruykin has anyone else had any similar experiences and any suggestions to help him eat we are currently giving him a pellet or two and some flakes at each feeding so he has a choice i would recommend that you put your goldfish in a bowl my sister had a goldfish and we put him in a tank the next day he was sucked up to the filter and died so i would recommend that you put him in a bowl also since you are feeding your goldfish flakes then i would recommend that you just stick to the flakes for now i hope that this answers your question thanks and good luck future vet Goldfish Sea-Monkey Atomic Kitten Guinea pig Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Shotgun New York Giants Samuel Goldwyn Aquarium Pikmin Axolotl Gar Jumpstart 3rd Grade Carburetor Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Bong E85 Fish farming The Strangerhood The Catcher in the Rye Thermal power station Unreal Breastfeeding Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Rocko's Modern Life P-47 Thunderbolt Swimming pool The Legend of Zelda series enemies Poker jargon Krill Conker's Bad Fur Day Flush toilet Iron Happy Tree Friends Brewery Shark Maize Past teachings of Prem Rawat Oral sex Boom Town (Doctor Who) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Avenue Q Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Tooth enamel English grammar Space Shuttle external tank GunBound Piccolo Junior Saga Olduwan Game show Galileo spacecraft Friends Tenshinhan Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Technology in the Stargate universe Antarctic krill Clownfish Textile manufacturing American lobster The Ashlee Simpson Show Bladderwort Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Domestic rabbit Have I Got News For You Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Dwarf gourami Futurama (TV series - season 5) $ale of the Century Meaning of life The Star Wars Holiday Special Space Shuttle program Siphon Snorkel Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Wheel of Fortune Tag P-38 Lightning Discworld gods 50 First Dates The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Novelty (locomotive) Ecco the Dolphin Beer Spirited Away Cosmo and Wanda History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Blood (computer game) Shaggy dog story Stanley Cup Mealy Parrot The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Swimming Crew Exploration Vehicle The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Diving Mattress About a Boy Koi
