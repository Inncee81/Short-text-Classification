cost of small fish tank setup and upkeep i'm interested in getting a fish but i was wondering what a new setup cost for a small fish tank and about what regualr upkeep is just looking for a ballpark estimate lets see the smallest i'd go with is a gallon unless you want something really small with a betta that would only be about the top fin gallon kit is the cheapest way to go cheaper then buying it all individually gallon kit with out heater made for goldfish gallon kit with heater for tropical fish gravel and decor at the least can be more if you want fancy decor and plastic plants fish depends on what kind you get community are the most colorful hardiest and cheapest depending on what you pick i wouldn't get goldfish for that small of a tank they grow big fast but if you did do goldfish i'd only get one thats the kit comes with all the chemicals and food you need to get started monthly cost chemicals and food not that much it's gotta be way less then the food will last you months if you feed appropriately the chemical's going to last a while too you only need to clean once a month one item that doesn't come with the kit that is a much have is a tank vacuum the easiest quickest way to clean your tank it'll cost less then for a manual one have a store employee show you how it's used it's simple good luck they aren't really that hard or too much work once you get the hang of it so adding it all up your looking at minimum can be higher with more expensive fish and decor ps make sure you research the kind of fish you decide to get there are simple steps to keeping the fish healthy some people think you just dump the water in and dump the fish in and they end up losing a lot of money patience that way just ask the employees at the store you go to on how to keep the fish healthy and how to take care of the tank good luck Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Goldfish Marine aquarium Biodiesel Aquarium Microeconomics Sea-Monkey Alcohol fuel Fish farming Paintball Japanese tea ceremony Dairy Solar power Domestic rabbit Thermal power station Wal-Mart Brewery Illegal drug trade Poker jargon Fossil fuel power plant Cannabis cultivation E85 Hydroponics Cruising (maritime) Bong Plastic Emergency preparedness Taxation in the United States Computer Tilapia Organic farming Strap-on dildo Reef tank Discus (fish) Nintendo Koi Fancy rat Health insurance Knife Welding Shrimp farm Chocolate Sewage treatment Coffee Energy development Dishwasher Tax Fugu Nuclear power Milk Social rule Galactic Civilizations Mutual fund Bulk vending P-47 Thunderbolt Carburetor Textile manufacturing Bonsai Diesel engine Toyota Prius Radio controlled airplane Capital accumulation Fasting Surplus value Filling station RuneScape quests Floppy disk Solar cell MAME Quicksort Organic food Axolotl Environmental concerns with electricity generation Yacht In-N-Out Burger Cable television El-Fish Diamond Solar panel Social Security debate (United States) Ra (board game) Tlingit Agriculture Redundant array of independent disks Credit card United States Postal Service Japanese toilet Volleyball Hard disk
