for my oscar fish should i have a pumpkinseed and jade eyed cichlid as my tank mates and maybe a catfish i dont know if i should do one oscar jack dempsey jade eyed and a channel catfish in a gallon tank i also want to do an oscar pumpkinseed and a jade eyed cichlid i think thesea re good tankmates but i need your help either one can work at least for the short term the only problems i can see are that both the pumpkinseed and channel catfish do better in cooler water than the oscar or jack but they can handle the same temperatures also a channel catfish will outgrow your tank within a year or so if well cared for my suggestion would be replace the channel catfish with a pleco and replace the pumpkin seed with another large south american cichlid mm Tilapia Discus (fish) Freshwater angelfish Live-bearing aquarium fish Jack Dempsey (fish) Oscar (fish) Suckermouth Catfish Fish farming Aquarium Zambezi Blue catfish Channel catfish Lake Malawi Hydrogen economy Timeline of alternative rock Catfish Gar E85 Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Goldfish Brewery Marine aquarium Autonomous building Lake Tanganyika Porgy and Bess Nile crocodile Adore Corydoras Cuisine of the Southern United States Fishing Murray Cod Flathead catfish The Den (television) Goa El Ni__o Pumpkin PID controller Ictaluridae Biodiesel Cessna T-37 Hamster Jade Goody Space Shuttle program Panama Canal Jack-o'-lantern Lake Texoma Copulation Gasoline Axolotl Clear Lake Bowen, Queensland The Smashing Pumpkins Cruising (maritime) Warm-blooded Pink Panther Mara Jade Thermal power station Sexual selection Motorcycle Anne Bancroft Fire fighting Refrigerator car Reef tank Houseplant Platypus Apollo 13 USS Catfish (SS-339) The Nightmare Before Christmas Pebble bed reactor Academy Award RuneScape economy Smoke-screen Vegetarianism Rift Valley lakes Computer bus Shark Oakland Athletics F1 hybrid Wine making Nuclear power Railfan AFI (band) Malachite green Hollyoaks Charles O.
