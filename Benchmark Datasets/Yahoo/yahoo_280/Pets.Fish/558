water change can somone tell me exactly what happens to the water and chemistry in the water if a tank does not have it's water changed for about six weeks or longer how does it affect the beneficial bacteria already in the tank does it make them stronger or kill them ditto to sir ghapy he's got the ba here i just want to suppliment one thing on his outstanding analysis in addition to the ph shifts and the lack of minerals from not having routine water changes you also are going to have extremely high nitrate built up assuming your tank is cycled out properly your beneficial bacteria should stay the same the bacteria all needs surface area to grow on and the substate usually gravel sometimes sand can house some but the majority of it will reside in your filter media i cannot think of anyone that has a home tank with actual dirt in it so analyzing this from that prespective wouldn't yield as good results though ponds and rivers that prespective is right on plants do not directly influence your ammonia levels but rather nitrate consumption as this is part of most fertilizers and an excellent fuel source to assist them in photosynthesis planted tanks are great because not only do plants help consume some of the nitrates it also puts oxygen back in in order to employ plants as a nitrate control measure though you'd have to have so many plants in there you'd probably not be able to even see your fish what will happen if you do not change water at that rate is you are going to have a massive nitrate build up again assuming your tank is properly cycled to begin with and like sir ghapy said the ph is going to begin to lower due to the compounds left in that tank decomposing nitrate when going above ppm begins to effect the fish's overall immune system and leaves them much weaker and susceptible to disease i am not sure why someone would let a tank sit like that for six weeks i feel bad if i let mine go for ten days and don't change i don't see this killing your beneficial bacteria it may cause your water to become cloudy as it would trigger a growth but no place to grow if your surface area is already occupied to capacity and those high nitrates in addtion to damaging your fish's immune systems would be a haven for an algea infestation jv Fish farming Explosive material Carnivorous plant Carbon dioxide Marine aquarium Eutrophication Soil pH Photosynthesis Bacteria Ammonium nitrate Ecology Global warming and agriculture Water purification Desert Chlorophyta Alkane Biodiesel Hydroponics Nitrogen cycle Hydrogen sulfide Water Energy development Ozone depletion Biogeochemical cycle Future energy development Shrimp farm Soil life Renewable energy Ultraviolet Organic farming Solar power Motorcycle Sulfuric acid Tooth Deforestation Water (molecule) Cyanide Microeconomics Soil Immune system 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Milk Psoriasis Environmental concerns with electricity generation Tooth enamel Cannabis cultivation Fertilizer Aluminium Dead Sea Tobacco Autonomous building Free trade Foodborne illness Nuclear power Weight training Houseplant Zerg Ice core Effects of global warming Protein Gasoline Anorexia nervosa Sulfur Methamphetamine Titanium Compost Uranium Fossil fuel power plant Omega-3 fatty acid Economy of the People's Republic of China Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Rebreather Ocean thermal energy conversion Chlorine Tide Acetic acid Drowning Sun Coronary heart disease Green Revolution Thermal power station Manitoba Hydro Coral reef Inflation DNA repair Salton Sea Insulin Climate change
