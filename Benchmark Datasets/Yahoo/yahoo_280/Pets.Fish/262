will two beta fish hurt themselves if they can see eachother i have this little bowl thing my sister kept her fish in it's basically two halves of the same bowl seperated i know that if you put the betta fish in the same tank they'll kill eachother but if i put two in the seperate sides without putting a divider i e construction paper between them are they going to hurt themselves by bashing against the wall or anything this is really not a good idea firstly yes they will hurt themselves if they can see each other all the time they may ram their heads against the wall or they may get stressed out and start tail biting also having to see another male betta all the time is extremely exhausting for a betta because he'll be flaring and patrolling his water all day and won't get the rest he needs what's more bettas are great jumpers and if one of them ever escapes over the divider into the other one's section it won't be pretty secondly the amount of water you'll have them in sounds tiny it's true that bettas can survive in small amounts of water but they certainly won't be happy bettas need at least gallons of water each and the water needs to be heated at a constant temperature of degrees f so you'll need to get a heater as well it's cruel to put a betta in such a small unheated amount of water Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Entropy Temperature Aquarium Autonomous building Marine aquarium Goldfish Brewery Furnace Equine conformation Pittsburgh Steelers Fire fighting Thermal power station Fish farming Diesel engine Shark Hydrogen economy HVAC Wind turbine Jet engine Carburetor Thermoregulation Terran (StarCraft) Battle of Tarawa Theory of conduct Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Tenshinhan Sun Wood Pink Floyd Elis Prefecture Solar power Items in the Metroid series Fossil fuel power plant Spacecraft propulsion 2000 Australian Grand Prix Phase (matter) E85 Apollo 13 Environmental concerns with electricity generation Fire extinguisher EastEnders Water heater Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Seismic retrofit Swimming pool USS Tunny (SS-282) Faster-than-light Japanese toilet Internal ballistics Corona Slayers Natural disaster Dog agility Energy development Mars Exploration Rover Japanese tea ceremony P-38 Lightning Glossary of firefighting terms Flood geology Microeconomics Explosive material The Wall Heat capacity Panama Canal Rugby union positions Diseases of the honeybee Steam engine Movie projector Bong Contrail Cube (film) USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Axial compressor BASE jumping Oxygen sensor Tacoma, Washington Pikmin Blood (computer game) Fast bowling Bladderwort Dam Project Orion Customs and etiquette of Japan Dragon Booster Final Fantasy magic Nuclear thermal rocket Hard water USS Taylor (DD-468) B-47 Stratojet 1957 World Series Sonar Heinkel He 100 Marathon (sport) PID controller Partition function (statistical mechanics) Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory USS Thresher (SS-200) Solar panel
