to remove or not to remove the under gravel filter ugf that is the question i clean and maintain aquariums for a living today i visited a new customer for the first time they have a gallon tank this is really deep x x it looks like two longs stacked on top of each other poor oxygen exchange is just the beginning of this tanks problems it has two filters one is an under gravel filter it also has a tetra whisper power filter similar to the current pf there's a large school of black neon tetras and black skirt tetras additionally there is a small school of three julli cory cats there were five originally but two died one black neon also died recently this is what prompted the call three deaths in a week the tank is in an advertising agency and they want it to look good they like the black and white theme the tank has a moderate amount of brown algae on the walls artificial plants and not much on the gravel a slight white haze indicated a bacterial bloom testing the water i found ammonia at ppm it was borderline definitely not ppm no nitrites the nitrates were at the thing that troubles me the most is the ph is very low even after a water change it still showed at best from the tap it was no surprise that i sucked enormous amounts of brown and black debris from the filter plate as i exposed a little at a time and cleaned of it it was the grossest thing i've seen smelled in a while i plan on doing the other half next week i didn't want to do too much at once and cause a mini cycle i also know there's plenty more filth down there and it will still be there after cleaning for a second time i want to avoid tearing down the tank and removing it it may very well pollute the water so badly i'd have to restart it obviously it would be bad for the fish do i clean it the best i can and let it be this is my first plan perhaps with regular maintenance the ugf will be fine i have customers with ugfs that are fine and would yield little debris if i cleaned the filter plate because of very frequent water changes ugfs do work if you take care of them this one wasn't taken care of at all i would remove the ug filter and have them get an aquaclear i know it sounds big but you can adjust the flow so that it is not so bad this tank needs a large filter since they aren't going to be giving it good care they should be able to get a for around i would run the little hang on the back filter while the larger one runs for the first or weeks you should just continue to clean the tank doing water changes once a week until nitrates go to near zero i would also make sure to place a large carbon pillow in the ac to adsorb all the funky smells and to clear the water up edit one of my tanks has a ug filter and it works great for me too but i also take care of it as you do Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Brewery Hydroponics Eutrophication Thermal power station Fossil fuel power plant Fish farming Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Water purification Aquarium E85 Hydrogen sulfide Nuclear power Carbon dioxide Carburetor Hydrogen economy Biodiesel Tank Biogeochemical cycle Cyanide Glacier Shrimp farm Extreme Programming Ocean thermal energy conversion Transformer Nuclear reactor Nutrient Dry cleaning Ammonia Carnivorous plant Poker jargon Diesel engine Pebble bed reactor Dialysis Motor oil Dairy Discus (fish) Water Hamster Desert Gasoline Reef tank Lake Motorcycle Sea-Monkey Ozone depletion Rebreather Tofu Energy development Bong Hard water Natural gas Dishwasher Goldfish Nuclear fallout 2000 Australian Grand Prix Chlorophyta Lighting Loudspeaker Japanese tea ceremony Air pollution Hard disk Moon Ozone hole Chernobyl accident Drill bit MS-06 Zaku II Solar power Sulfur Sugar beet Gas metal arc welding Geology of the Grand Canyon area Textile manufacturing Halitosis Mattress Swimming pool Water pollution Fancy rat Antarctic krill Heat exchanger Slow sand filter bed Alcohol fuel Theory of conduct Upholstery Welding Tooth Environmental concerns with electricity generation Terraforming Dodge Neon Hydropower
