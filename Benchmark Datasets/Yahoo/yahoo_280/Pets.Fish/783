saltwater to freshwater what are the steps that one would need to take to transform a saltwater tank into a freshwater tank how would i go about cleaning it before use what you'll need to do will depend a little on the material the tank is made of and the types of freshwater fish you plan to keep as far as the substrate this is probably a crushed coral or shell material this would be okay to rinse off through a strainer under hot water and reuse if your planned fish are african cichlids or other species that need a higher ph if you're not planning to keep any of these i would suggest changing to standard aquarium gravel or sand depending on the needs of your fish and your preferences you'll mosy likely need to clean the walls of the tank and if these are glass you can use a standard algae scraper and vinegar and hot water to remove any coralline algae or tube worms that have attached to the glass if there are stubborn spots you might need to use a razor to scrape them off be aware if the glass itself looks cloudy there may have been permanent etching from the high ph this won't be something you're able to get rid of because the glass itself has become pitted it doesn't look quite as bad when the tank has water in it but it may still be noticeable if the tank is acrylic you'll need to be more careful about cleaning the walls because this is more likely to be scratched use the hot water still but use either a pad made for cleaning acrylic and be sure no particles of the substrate get causght between the pad and the tank surface or use the edge of an old plastic card credit card type to scrape if there are heaters powerheads or filters that were for the tank these should be able to be used as well just clean with hot water and use vinegar to remove salt build up other than these specifics everything else would be the same as setting up a freshwater tank from scratch Marine aquarium Aquarium Reef tank Sewage treatment Brewery Dishwasher Casting Fish farming Printed circuit board Solar power Dry cleaning Thermal power station Fish Knife Vinegar Seismic retrofit Drill bit Biodiesel Fishing Laserdisc Angling Water purification Bong Corrosion Shrimp farm Tilapia Textile manufacturing Polymethyl methacrylate Chlorophyta Slow sand filter bed Discus (fish) Diatom Algae Irrigation Dice Mussel Glass Fly fishing Aquifer Swimming pool Lake Autonomous building Tank Antarctic krill Halfbeak Cathode ray tube Goby Eutrophication Dialysis Kissing gourami Menstrual cup Transistor Vacuum tube Coral Cookware and bakeware Jellyfish Fossil fuel power plant Explosive material Dead Sea Tofu Dinghy Gramophone record Hamster Solar panel Diatomaceous earth Basement Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Soldering Opportunity rover Mattress Motor oil Shrimp Diode Cheese Solar cell Brush Wok Dredge Lighting Welding Compact disc Ecology of Hong Kong Paint Freshwater angelfish Cyanide Liquid crystal display Olduwan Krill Fire fighting Plastic Water (molecule) Osmosis Cuisine of the Philippines Atlantic herring
