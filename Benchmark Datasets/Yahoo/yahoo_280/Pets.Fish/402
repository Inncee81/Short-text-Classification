i got some snails to help keep my tank clean but i think my pleco sucker fish is killing them are pleco's normally like this i was more worried about the pleco eating my other fish than the snales reproducing they're still in the shells when i find them it's almost like they are hiding and just die or something i have had plecos and snails in the same tank for a long time my snails are ruby ramshorn snails so they may be to big for my plecos to nibble on what are you finding when you see a dead snail is it an empty shell or is the snail still in its shell did you know that snails are very sensitive to copper if you are pretty sure that it is your pleco that is killing your snails then try feeding it a little more if i were you i would place some algae wafers in your tank so your pleco will stay busy with that check to see what kind of snails that you have some have very short lifespans and if you had some older snails then they may have died off naturally i'm not saying that a pleco can't kill a snail but i have never had that problem or even a problem with them messing with my other fish the only other thing i can think of is mabey the pleco is getting cramped for space and it is getting aggressive hope this helps am Snail Fugu Hamster Marine aquarium Discus (fish) Tilapia Franklin (television series) Solar cell The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sea-Monkey Octopus Cone Snail Animal Timon and Pumbaa SpongeBob SquarePants American lobster StarCraft: Uprising Slug Schistosomiasis Shell (projectile) Poker jargon Shark Suckermouth Catfish Remora French cuisine Minor Harry Potter Beasts Halfbeak Nile crocodile Fish farming Unreal Kodocha Coconut crab Discworld gods Mollusk Kenny McCormick Sex-determination system Social rule Digenea Fishing Space Shuttle program Chinook salmon AFI 100 Years series Sewage treatment Mach kernel Vampire Mountain Gorilla Frog Batoidea Gar American Alligator One Piece minor characters Fauna of Australia Novelty (locomotive) Tetrodotoxin Anti-tank Ecco the Dolphin Bedbug Conker's Bad Fur Day Leatherback Sea Turtle YuYu Hakusho Battery (electricity) Myxobolus cerebralis Computer numbering formats Schistosoma Six-Day War Immortality Augustus De Morgan Cantonese cuisine CPU cache Eucharist Great White Shark Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Crayfish Computer virus Hedgehog P-38 Lightning History of the tank Doctor Dolittle (film) Eutrophication First Battle of the Atlantic Stomach cancer Terminal ballistics Hydrogen economy Lobster Koi Transformer Operculum Money 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fancy rat Endangered Species Act Publication of Darwin's theory Dragon Ball W.H.
