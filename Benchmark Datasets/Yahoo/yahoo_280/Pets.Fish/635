snail from no where i just saw a teeny tiny baby snail in my bettas tanks i have no idea where it came from all i can figure is that it came from the live plants in his tank but ive had those for weeks where did the little thing come from and should i leave it there try and put it in my gallon community tank or dispose of it which i hate to do because it is quite cute and seems fairly harmless ive never had snails before and been told to avoid them and that they are just trouble any ideas right now it is in my betta's gallon tank when it gets bigger i will have to move it because he is in there with a ghost shrimp and i worry about there being enough space but for now it is about half the size of an apple seed i have no clue what kind it is other than that it is off white colored my gallon is a tropical tank with platies mollies and a pleco i didnt know they could reproduce like that yikes now i am kind of worried yup more than likely from your new plants it was still an egg and now it's hatched that's why you're only seeing it now and why i am extremely hesitant to suggest that anyone get snails and when i do it's for just one apple snail they're sneaky little critters snails are apple snails are not hermaphroditic which means they don't need another snail to reproduce but most of the rest are they can do the whole job all on their own which is why they're so much trouble Snail Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sea-Monkey Marine aquarium Knots Landing StarCraft Episode VI Brewery Social rule Tilapia Color Species Shrimp farm Rocko's Modern Life Johnny Appleseed Apple Computer Goldfish Discworld gods German cuisine Hermaphrodite Humphrey Bogart P-38 Lightning Dwarf gourami Flowering plant Plant Aquarium Donald Rumsfeld Cannabis cultivation Charles Ives Timon and Pumbaa Paul Is Dead Milton H.
