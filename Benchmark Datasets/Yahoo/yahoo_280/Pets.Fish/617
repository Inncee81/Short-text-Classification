i am looking to buy some fish for my tank iam in dc where schould i look hi ms dc i would strongly advise you go to a specialist aquarium store rather than petco or a general pet store for several reasons many general pet stores keep their stock in less than perfect conditions have little or no knowledge of specific fish care many will tell you myths half truths some blatantly lie just to get you to part with your money have no interest in the well being of either you or your new fish in contrast specialist aquarium stores are almost always staffed by people who also keep fish as a hobby therefore keep better healthier stock will not spin you a line i realise you may have a general pet outlet nearby but it will benefit you no end to find a specialist i would also recommend you join one of the many fish keeping forums on the internet that deal with whatever type s of fish you are thinking about keeping if you are unsure of anything always ask before doing good luck Aquarium Domestic rabbit Discus (fish) Marine aquarium Neopets Pet Clownfish Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Pet store Reef tank Wal-Mart Prostate cancer Insurance Theory of conduct Microeconomics Password Fish Stock Economics Zebra Danio Surplus product Contract Goldfish Sears Holdings Corporation Coin collecting Crayfish Omega-3 fatty acid Characters of Naruto Surplus value Friedrich Schleiermacher Internet troll Gar Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Care Bears Health insurance CPU cache Social rule Koi Infantilism Slot machine Lie Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RuneScape skills Live-bearing aquarium fish Orthogonal matrix Deflation (economics) Sea-Monkey Estoppel Motion picture rating system Inventory Insulin Animal Crossing Capital accumulation Fast bowling Vegetarianism Colorectal cancer Insider trading Final Fantasy XI Mutual fund Brackish water Productive and unproductive labour God Emperor of Dune Coral reef Advanced Squad Leader Fancy rat Breastfeeding Fish farming Annuity Orca PETCO Park Angling Law of value Nicomachean Ethics Internet fraud Surveillance Finding Nemo Plame affair Egg (food) Expert system Fishing Aristotle Dog Gaia Online Education Mythology Anchor Open access Cyanide California Academy of Sciences Hunter (World of Warcraft) Arbitrage John Wycliffe Economy of the United States Age of Mythology Dairy Fathers' rights Organic food J Sainsbury Enron Corporation
