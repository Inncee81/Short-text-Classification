goldfish question yestoday i got four fish and i put them in tank with a lid the lid has one small hole to put food in the tank next day one of my fish were outside of the tank dead can a fish jump that high and far since the food hole was opposite of where the food hole was and thats the only hole in the lid yes they are quite the jumpers all it takes is a little hole and they are through usually when they are stressed they start jumping a trip from the store to your home is quite unnerving for them we encountered that problem when we had to let a friend keep the fish for a couple days our oranda kept jumping out of the tank we kept putting her back in after a partial water change and some time to readjust she is doing great growing up and not trying to jump out of the tank anymore are you sure the hole in the back is not for a filter the food hole has a lid you lift to feed it's kind hard to get what you mean about the food hole anyway keep a check on your water quality and keep it as clean as possible by changing your filters often enjoy your new fish Sea-Monkey Discus (fish) Fish farming Brewery Marine aquarium E85 Thermal power station Goldfish Japanese tea ceremony Shrimp farm Motor oil Parachuting Hamster Aquarium Equine conformation Fujian tea ceremony Cannabis cultivation Piccolo Junior Saga Sushi Axolotl Aquaculture Dairy Seine (fishing) Caving Hard disk Textile manufacturing Poker jargon Professional wrestling throws Motorcycle Japanese toilet Sewage treatment High jump Parachute Reef tank Chinook salmon Items in the Metroid series RuneScape quests Clownfish Hydroponics Wood The Amber Spyglass Dog agility Windows XP Ecco the Dolphin Computer virus Water purification Bong Toilet Agar plate Danio Kitchen Autonomous building Cheese Solar power Dialysis Fugu Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Terran (StarCraft) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Knife Mitsubishi Zero Fish Angling Ecology Two-stroke cycle Zippo Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Koi Carburetor Water polo Slow cooker Jackass: The Movie Seabird Jumpstart 3rd Grade Energy development Tenjiku shogi Baby bottle Diving Fanny Blankers-Koen Battle of Tarawa USS Yorktown (CV-5) Glossary of firefighting equipment Figure skating Fishery Biodiesel Tlingit Drill bit Dragon Ball canon BASE jumping Chess strategy and tactics Nerpa Krill Diseases of the honeybee American lobster Coming of Age (TNG episode) Hey You, Pikachu! 1957 World Series Domestic rabbit Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics
