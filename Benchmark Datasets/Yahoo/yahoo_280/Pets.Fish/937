what other kinds of fish can live in a betta tank i have a small betta fishtank and my betta brucey recently died i don't think i'm ready for another betta due to the fact that they look identical other than colouring but i do want another fish just a totally different one i have a tank light and brucey was quite happy and alive until my dad let my cat into my room unsupervised and she killed him my cat is never allowed in my room without me in here i always shut my door when i leave but my dad can be a moron sometimes as i've realized so i'm going to be extra careful this time around so what other kinds of fish could live in my betta fish tank if any it's a one gallon fish tank bowls tend to be inadequate for fish keeping they are small require very frequent water changes and generally do not support steady water parameters would you enjoy living in a small room or even a closet even a smaller size aquarium such as or gallon makes a world of difference and are fairly inexpensive along with a small inexpensive but efficient filter your fish will thrive and love you for it the bigger the aquarium the more stable water parameters will be such as temperature ph etc and easier to maintain an investment in a small aquarium and filter goes a long way be kind to your fish and consider it bettas do not enjoy living in small bowls as it is commonly believed the most often misquoted fact is that in the wild and their natural habitat they live in small puddles of water the fact is they are largely found in asian rice paddies which are certainly shallow bodies of water but are by no means puddles rice paddies are huge areas of water so wild bettas actually live in thousands of gallons in the wild they are able to survive in small puddles of water but this only happens during drought which is not a natural condition and there is a difference between thriving and merely surviving so please free your betta from that tiny bowl and get him a decent aquarium you will come to find that they will be a different kind of fish altogether and will love you for it Aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Marine aquarium Reef tank Fish farming Brewery Goldfish Phase (matter) Autonomous building Shrimp farm Clownfish Welding Carburetor Fishing Rice Japanese tea ceremony Hamster Domestic rabbit Fish Leopard Cat Discus (fish) Sewage treatment Coffee Thermal power station Coral reef Energy development Cannabis cultivation Yacht Carnivorous plant Floppy disk Gar Southeast Asia Orca Shark Hydrogen economy Solar power Ozone depletion Flush toilet Toyota Prius Swimming pool Internal ballistics E85 Tetrapod Sento Microeconomics Gas metal arc welding Water Ozone hole Bottlenose Dolphin Nuclear reactor Mosquito New York Giants Chopsticks Fugu Loudspeaker Tank classification Normal distribution SS Andrea Doria Fire fighting Danio Drowning Sea-Monkey Bonsai Species Japanese toilet Puddle jumper (Stargate) Physical paradox Renewable energy The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Environmental concerns with electricity generation Polarization Angling Ecology Hard disk Steel Biodiesel Strap-on dildo Technicolor Global warming and agriculture Glass Diesel engine Poker jargon Lake Stone Age Stereoscopy Redundant array of independent disks Bong Jet engine Seabird Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Kitchen Synthesizer
