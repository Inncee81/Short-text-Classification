how do you tranfer goldfish into a new tank i have goldfishes since they were very little and now they are really big so i m thinking of switching and tranferrinmg them into a newer bigger tank however i ve heard that if you tranfer them like normally they end up dying and stuff can someone tell me how to tranfer my goldfishes i think it's great that you're making a new home for your goldfishes that have outgrown their old home for the bigger tank have you set it all up yet if you haven't you should use some of the items in your old tank to help set up your new tank what kind of filter system are you going to use undergravel or above gravel everyone has their own preferences but for me i prefer undergravel i believe they set up the biological cyle much better now if you do have an undergravel filter set it up in the new tank put in a few gallons of dechlorinated water dechlorinate the water before adding anything that's highly important you do not want to kill any of the good bacteria you add then you can take some of your gravel from your existing tank and put it in your new tank keep it wet though you want to maintain the bacteria colonies that are present on the gravel that will give you a headstart on setting up the bio cycle in the new tank then you can put your new gravel on top of the old gravel but remember to rinse the new gravel a couple of times until the water runs clear before putting it in the new tank once the gravel is in then you can add new decorations and also any old decorations from your existing tank and don't clean your old decorations unless they are really heavily covered in algae why there'll be good bacteria on them too and you want to transfer that to the new tank also now if they have a lot of algae on them just wipe it off with a clean paper towel don't use any cleaners with it just use the paper towel and your fingers hand that's all the good bacteria will remain in the nooks and crannies and cracks then you can move in your airstones and whatever else you have now the new tank should be about half full with water right because you added water earlier the next step is to add a couple of gallons of water from the existing tank why that water is what the goldfish are used to living in it has all the minerals bacteria protozoans phytoplanton algae etc and with a lower water level it will be much easier to catch the goldfish goldfish can be fast check the temperature of the new tank it should be within degrees of the old tank if not you can wait a bit while the new tank water adjust to the room temperature or you can add some hot or cold water dechlorinated to hasten the process while your waiting for the new tank's water to get closer to the old tank's water in temperature you can fill a large pail or a couple of pails with water you'll need to fill the rest of the new tank remember you'll need to dechlorinate this water too if you have city water if you have a private well you shouldn't have to dechlorinate because your water should not have chlorine in it like mine oh when you fill these buckets don't do all cold water nor all hot water mix it up so the water coming out of your faucet is as close to room temperature as possible getting the water ready now will save you time later when you want to fill the rest of the tank next catch the goldfish one at a time putting them in a one gallon baggie filled with a few inches of water the water level should be enough to cover them not enough so they can swim around why they are only going to be in the bag for a short time only until the water temp in the bag adjusts to the water temp of the tank it will be faster this way keep the baggies open with the tops upwards and monitor the bags and fish to make sure the fish don't get too stressed after about minutes you can began letting them go into the new tank water and all remeber this water came from their old tank it's safe for them then slowly fill the new tank to top it off start your filters and airstone put your light and cover on sit back and enjoy watching your goldfish explore their new tank and they will enjoy it btw how big are your goldfish now this past march i placed twelve inch goldfish in my new pond built last oct nov it was still cold and the goldfish immediately hid in the rocks they only came out when it warmed up they initially grew kind of fast growing quickly to inches they spawned and had babies that survived now the goldfish are about to inches in length and i have about babies that are about inches to inches in length i think i have some photos on my website along with my koi my koi grew fast started with three inch ones in april now they're to each amazing http yahoo com kenrnoto ken Sento Marine aquarium Goldfish
