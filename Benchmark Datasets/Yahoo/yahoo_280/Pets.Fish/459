phosphates i've been trying to lower my phosohate levels for about weeks now my tap water has about ppm and i tested some bottled water and some distilled water and they were ppm and or above ppm respectively phosphate sponges are a good temporary fix but i am looking for a permenant fix reverse osmosis isnt really an option for me any suggestions i feel obliged to answer seeing my name mentioned here yes you can get ro at superwalmarts it's the culligan water dispenser somewhere in the store you'll have to buy their refillable containers and i use the gallon sized which cost about each then you fill them at the self serve station the jugs come in different sizes but the containers get more expensive the larger you go i think it's about for the gallon container the price of the water varies around the us and i actually only pay for mine but other users have mentioned in their areas so i use the higher figure i don't think anyone will complain if something ends up less expensive than expected are you having a problem with algae in the tank that's about all the phosphate will influence i find it odd though that you got a measurable amount in distilled water that shouldn't have any in it Hydroponics E85 Water purification Microeconomics Ammonia Biodiesel Alcohol fuel Hydrogen economy Tax Autonomous building Supply and demand Nuclear power Carbon dioxide Liquid fuels Inflation Single malt Scotch Carnivorous plant Fish farming Parts per notation Digital photography Scotch whisky Hard water Gross domestic product Sewage treatment Bond Water (molecule) Wine Floppy disk Annuity Alcoholic beverage Water Panama Canal Toilet paper Milk Bottled water Moonshine Rational pricing Nuclear fuel cycle Nuclear power phase-out Health insurance Fossil fuel power plant CPU cache Water resources Rum Desalination Unemployment Solar power Filling station Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Inkjet printer Redundant array of independent disks Taxation in the United States Social Security debate (United States) Capitalism Broadband Internet access Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Monopsony Arbitrage Iron Monetary policy Hydrogen sulfide Cruising (maritime) Dairy Beer Plastic FairTax AIDS in Africa Energy development Ocean thermal energy conversion Fusion power Reverse osmosis Space Shuttle program Atari 8-bit family System/36 Brewery Lunar Prospector Homebrewing Toyota Prius Cyanide Hydropower Price discrimination Life insurance P-47 Thunderbolt Insurance Pebble bed reactor Castle of the Winds Privatization Irrigation CPU design Software testing Mutual fund Bretton Woods system Climate change Deflation (economics) Fuel injection
