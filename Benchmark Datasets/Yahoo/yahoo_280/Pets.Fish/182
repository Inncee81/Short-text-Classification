i want a friend for my beta fish what fish could live in his environment i wnat a friend for my beta fish something that could live in his environment and could you tell me how to take care of his friend like with a link or something thanx if your betta is in a bowl or a vase no other fish can live with it other fish require filtration and oxygenated clean water and most need a heater if you have a gallon tank with a filter and heater you could get some neon tetras but that is about it in a bowl or vase you could add some ghost shrimp but they may or may not be eaten by the betta be sure to avoid hyperactive nippy fish and fish that have long flowing fins if kept together permanently one will kill the other goldfish get more than a foot long and will only last a month or two in a bowl no goldfish should be kept with bettas nosoop u for more betta help check out the forum in my profile edit you cannot permanently keep male and female bettas together they should only be housed together for breeding purposes and they must first be properly conditioned to breed and then can only be together for a couple hours at a time until they spawn edit most plecos get about feet long so be sure to research each fish you plan to buy so you don't end up with a huge fish in a small tank Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Aquarium Goldfish Discus (fish) Marine aquarium Dwarf gourami Autonomous building Sewage treatment Brewery Sea-Monkey Koi Reef tank Japanese tea ceremony Shrimp farm Fish farming Murray Cod Tilapia Clownfish Bong Steam (content delivery) Kosher foods Apollo 13 Shark Dam Carburetor Fishing Coffee Fugu Halfbeak Thermal power station Gar Fossil fuel power plant Insulin Gmail Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Axolotl Seine (fishing) Cannabis cultivation Rebreather Humpback Whale Vacuum tube Livestock Hamster E85 Goby Marine biology Solar power Samovar Platypus Tetrapod Atlantic herring Water heater Whaling Lake Burley Griffin Cantonese cuisine Eutrophication Water garden Gaia Online Bird Helium Myxobolus cerebralis Water purification Zebra Danio Chinook salmon Dry cleaning Angling Biodiesel Hydroponics Decompression sickness Water resources Flush toilet MMORPG STS-50 Domestic rabbit Diving cylinder GunZ The Duel Whale Tooth Sushi Seismic retrofit Seabird Wetland Tidal power Acne Menstrual cup Salmon Customs and etiquette of Japan Fire fighting Fancy rat Veganism Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Canary Diabetes mellitus USS Tunny (SS-282) BZFlag Kakapo Nile crocodile Home repair
