saltwater aquarium salinity problem question i can't seem to get the salinity specific gravity up to i add more salt and it goes up for a bit but then settles back down to to i feel like i've already added quite a bit more than the cup per gallon as recommended on the instant ocean package that i used i have a gallon viaaqua tank a fluval canister filter pounds of live rock pounds of live sand and pounds of regular sand aragonite scarlet hermits and nassarius snails i'me using a red sea hydrometer swing arm my other water parameters seem to be okay ph about temp about f nitrates and nitrites okay i've been taking out gallons of water adding more salt to the bucket stir it up and then pour it back into the tank when it looks to be dissolved completely no air stone and its usually the next day when i notice the sg has gone back down again i don't understand it because i was expecting the salinity to go up as the water evaporates i understand the effect of sawter temperature on specific gravity and have made the necessary adjustments my concern is that the s g is not calculating the salinity properly i know my water is on the hard side maybe to ppm according to test srtips could this be affecting the s g don't pay attention to the cup per gallon given in the directions on the salt in my experience this is hardly ever an accurate measurement to get the salinity high enough for a tank with inverts if anything it usually works out closer to cup or more for me go by the readings of the hydrometer just make sure that there aren't any air bubbles attached to the needle if you use a floating needle variety and rinse the hydrometer well between and before each use to make sure there isn't dried salt making the float stick or weighing it down the glass floating hydrometers are more accurate but can be harder to read if there's any current they are also much easier to break take an average of three readings from different points in the tank and take an average if the readings seem to fluctuate the temperature would only affect the salinity by about for every of change in temp and the salinity should go down as the water evaporates hardness shouldn't be a factor if you have salt creep along the filter or rim this could cause the salinity to go down Dead Sea Explosive material Brewery Water (molecule) Anchor Carburetor Desert Sewage treatment Coffee Tea Fish farming Casting Sea-Monkey Hydrometer Carbon dioxide Salinity Fire extinguisher Weighing scale Dialysis Beer E85 Dairy Thermal power station STS-87 Hard water Soap bubble Tank Hydroponics Sea ice Ammonia Water STS-62 Tide Salt Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Dishwasher Autonomous building Concentration Ocean thermal energy conversion Dry cleaning Apollo 13 Sea level rise Mercury Atlas 6 Siphon Reef tank Electrophysiology Mineral Knife Biodiesel Eutrophication 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake First aid Water purification M60 machine gun Agar plate Lake Bong Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Nitrogen Internal ballistics Sea water Wave power Great Salt Lake Textile manufacturing Robot Master PID controller Bubble Bobble Geography of Africa Margin of error Loudspeaker Gaia theory (science) Coriolis effect Soil salination Collodion process Welding Sento Opportunity rover Equine conformation Salton Sea Alcohol fuel Glass Diving Fire fighting Concrete Global warming and agriculture Pacific Ocean Prostate cancer The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Gravity Pottery Big Bang Diamond simulant
