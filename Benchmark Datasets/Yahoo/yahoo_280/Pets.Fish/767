help is this normal i just floated the bag of my betta in my un cycled tank i decied to use him to cycle hes not gasping for air or anything but hes staying at the top of the tank is this normal and its a gallon tank should i turn the light of or what should i do don't worry so much a little betta in a gallon tank will cause such a small ammonia spike that you probably won't even be able to measure it if you want to play it safe buy a test for ammonia and test for it every day if you notice it start to crawl up past change a third of the water in the mean time go back to the fish store and ask them for a handful of gravel from one of their mature tanks ask them to bag it for you and then put this into your filter you will be introducing live bacteria and won't need to worry about the cycle at all a fishless cycle or exposing the fish to toxins is kind of pointless when you can just bypass the cycle altogether by doing this and the method is virtually flawless Marine aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sewage treatment Fossil fuel power plant Hydrogen economy E85 Sea-Monkey Autonomous building Jet engine Thermal power station Dairy Aquarium Refrigerator Biogeochemical cycle Cannabis cultivation Fish farming Fugu Toyota Prius Dialysis Menstrual cycle Tag GunBound Eutrophication Poker jargon Swimming pool Carbon dioxide Ultraviolet Dry cleaning Hydroponics Sun Brewery Carburetor Mattress Anchor Glossary of wildland fire terms Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster P-38 Lightning Goldfish Ocean thermal energy conversion Agar plate B-47 Stratojet History of swimming Backstroke P-47 Thunderbolt Tank Gaia Online Diving regulator Fischer Random Chess Cessna T-37 Ice core Solar power Coffee Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Dwarf gourami Breaststroke USS Yorktown (CV-5) Tour de France Milk Fuel efficiency Indianapolis 500 Tlingit PID controller Cruising (maritime) Ecco the Dolphin God Emperor of Dune CPU cache Motorcycle Discus (fish) Water Tilapia Golf Ammunition Hard disk Shrimp farm Front crawl Electrophysiology Diesel engine Rebreather Utility cycling Professional wrestling match types Biodiesel Reef tank Biochemistry Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Normal distribution Illegal drug trade Galileo spacecraft StarCraft Secret Missions Mercury Atlas 6 Doom enemies Escherichia coli O157:H7 Axolotl STS-62 Motor oil Diseases of the honeybee Vacuum cleaner Hypoglycemia
