we have a piece of coral my husband got snorkeling can we put it in a freshwater aquarium well yes you can but no you shouldn't coral even if boiled to a sterile salt free state will cause the water hardness to rise to levels unhealthy for fresh water fish this is due to the fact that coral is made up of calcium and that calcium will slowly dissolve into the water when the hardness reaches levels deemed unsafe the coral will have to be removed this is harmful because you will subsequently lose a substantial amount of nitrifying bacteria in your aquarium and this will cause an ammonia spike and possibly a nitrite spike afterwards if you have a high fish load which will be quite stressful to the fish in short coral is not a good idea as a freshwater decoration hope this helps you jason c Marine aquarium Aquarium Fishing Sewage treatment Coral reef Water purification Water (molecule) Eutrophication Hard water Cyanide Reef tank Coral Calcium Water Tooth Crayfish Fish farming 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Milk Carbon dioxide Fish Goby Fugu Tofu Ammonia Dead Sea Poker jargon Sulfur Desalination Disinfection Ecology Algae Geology of the Grand Canyon area Ich Freshwater angelfish Nuclear power Zambezi Chlorophyta Effects of global warming Cocaine Biogeochemical cycle Nitrogen Brewery Aluminium Nutrition Osmosis Sea-Monkey Bacteria Thermal power station RuneScape economy Tlingit Atkins Nutritional Approach Goldfish Sodium hypochlorite Insulin Iron Shrimp farm Dishwasher Octopus Hydrogen economy Methamphetamine Saltwater intrusion Salt Fjord Terraforming Tooth enamel Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Tilapia Bone Sulfuric acid Sea level rise Tattoo Swimming Drowning Pufferfish Hydrochloric acid E number Weathering Vegetarianism Jellyfish Ultraviolet Industrial wastewater treatment Soil pH Vitamin C Deluge (prehistoric) Dredge Cheese Great Salt Lake Titanium Soap Intravenous therapy Danio Hamster Wood Seismic retrofit Fly fishing Earth's atmosphere Food preservation Ozone
