my fish just died some questions my female swordtail just died i think it was ich because it looked as if it's body was covered in some sort of white powder and it's fins were folded i will clean the bottom of the tank and do a percent water change i am going to change the substrate from rocks to something smaller the rocks leave gaps for food and dirt to settle and make it harder to siphon out which probably is why my fish got ich from bad water conditions do i replace all the substrate at the same time will that be ok i know some beneficial bacteria grows on the substrate so i don't know if i should replace it all at once or gradually over a week also what do you suggest i replace it with it's a gallon with some moss and i'm getting a bigger tank in three months when i move apartments i was thinking some neon tetras or a single catfish or maybe even an oscar personally i prefer a fairly fine gravel over sand in tanks as the gravel is easier to clean assuming the tank is now empty i would suggest replacing all of the substrate at once to help eliminate the ich from the tank either wash out the tank well or allow it to sit without fish for weeks to be sure there is no ich in the tank before you add more fish ich is not caussed by poor water quality it's a parasite that is in the tank and needs to die off before you add more fish mm Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Tilapia Discus (fish) Brewery Aquarium Shark Milk Fish farming Wine making Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Goldfish Textile manufacturing Pachypodium habitats German grammar Goby Evidence of evolution Dairy Sea-Monkey Dam Tank Fugu Flush toilet Autonomous building Ich Japanese toilet T-34 Nuclear fallout Diseases of the honeybee Gravel Kissing gourami Sailfin Molly Mussel Thermal power station Shrimp farm Vinegar Sento M4 Sherman Dredge Japanese tea ceremony Hamster Mattress Dinghy Tooth Hydrogen economy Habitats of Pachypodium of Southern Continental Africa and Madagascar Houseplant Opportunity rover Foodborne illness Biodiesel Tetrapod Paint Dwarf gourami Flood geology Dry cleaning Cheese Axolotl Atlantic herring Malachite green Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Hydroponics Siphon Water purification Solar cell Carnivorous plant Menstrual cup Pachypodium Reef tank Sake American lobster Glucocorticoid Atlantic Ocean Lake Urinary incontinence Light-emitting diode Fish Insulin Soil life Bottlenose Dolphin Aerial (dance move) Myxobolus cerebralis Toilet paper Erosion Ecology Slow sand filter bed Sugar Alcoholic beverage Chlorophyta Poker jargon Tlingit Dune Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Anchor Novelty (locomotive) Cruising (maritime) Catfish Bladderwort
