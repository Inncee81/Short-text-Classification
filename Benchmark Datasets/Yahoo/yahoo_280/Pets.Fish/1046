do convict cichlids need to be a pair hi i was hoping to get a convict cichli ive read abotu them alot i like to educate myself but the info mentions a lot of tiem about a pair of convicts i was planning on gettoing one do i neeed to get two no you don't need to get two definitely get a male female pair though if you do you can have two males but make sure you have a large tank so they don't fight each other just in case you don't know how to do this the females are typically smaller and have red dots on their belly their fins are different but this is the easiest way to identify them convict cichlids breed very easily so unless you're prepared to use them as feeders give them away or whatever you probably shouldn't get a pair i'm talking breeding easily frequently with large broods cichlid breeding and rearing behavior is very interesting to observe convicts are about as easy as it gets if you want to watch this just make sure you have an empty tank b c they'll aggressively pursue other fish and probably kill them i had a gallon with a pair in it with catfish and plecos and they survived and had enough sense to stay away although it probably was a high stress environment for them one convict in a tank is kind of uninteresting though they're kind of aggressive so there are only a few types of fish of other species you can match them with Tilapia Cichlid Discus (fish) Fish farming Poker jargon Live-bearing aquarium fish Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Humpback Whale Theory of conduct Clownfish Oscar (fish) Gray Wolf Bottlenose Dolphin Sexual selection Domestic rabbit Elephant Albatross Fugu Zerg Tank Kakapo Platypus Mountain Gorilla House Mouse Species Shrimp farm Artificial selection Dog Jack Dempsey (fish) Catfish Freshwater angelfish Livestock Mallard Spider BZFlag Animal communication Gender role Africanized bee Honeybee Goldfish Halfbeak Protoss Monogamy Cat Sex History of the tank Tetrapod Whale Fishing Badminton Marine aquarium Gar Leopard Ant Lion Chicken Plame affair Vowel Dog training StarCraft Episode VI Leatherback Sea Turtle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Whale watching Hamster Non-human animal sexuality Battle of Kursk God Emperor of Dune Prairie Falcon Motorcycle DNA Marine angelfish James Hanratty Emu Sperm Whale Armoured warfare Lake Malawi Surveillance Borderline personality disorder Sharon Tate Manifold Eusociality Polish September Campaign Hydrogen economy Rape Bird Terran (StarCraft) Aphid Combinatorial species Motivation Zambezi Seabird Nature versus nurture Honda CX series Shark Messerschmitt Bf 109 Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Vampire Squid Wind turbine Monster Rancher monsters
