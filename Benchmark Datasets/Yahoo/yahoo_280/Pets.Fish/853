aquarium newbie advice i'm thinking of getting a small aquarium i'm an experienced pet owner but i've never owned fish before my wife got me a really pretty betta which i keep on my desk at work and he got me thinking i'd like to get an aquarium how do i get started i'm a beginner so nothing too complicated small apartment so nothing too big my wife likes colourful pretty fish i like strange and unusual suggestions i aquariums are not hard to keep as long as you know the basics the easiest to keep is a gallon but it sounds like you would prefer a smaller version no matter which tank size you buy you will need lights and a filter gravel usually pounds per gallon i e a gallon would take lbs i like backings on my tank pictures and there are many natural scenes to choose from at your local pet dealer if you want tropical fish you will need a heater and depending on the fish i keep my tanks at between and degrees make sure that after you set up your tank you let it cycle for at least two weeks a month is better before you add too many fish betas are hardy and would do well you need to get your biological filter up and running your biological filter is friendly bacteria that render harmless any fish waste products that will produce the ammonia harmful to fish live plants will help 'cycle' the tank more quickly and they help prevent algae you will have to stick with smaller variety fish your beta is perfect make sure any others will stay small loaches may be fun to watch and tiny when you buy them but some can grow to be several feet long betas are compatable with most other 'community' fish just not another male beta neon tetras are flashy as are many types of tetras make sure you don't buy the smallest ones because they are easily stressed and can die for no apparent reason dwarf gouramis are pretty and a fun fish these are all freshwater i feed my fish twice a day no more than they can eat in to minutes i feed them frozen food in the morning and flake at night it helps them to remain healty and makes their colours bright lastly please get a water test kit you can only really know your tank is ready for fish if you can test the water and then you should test on a regular basis you will need to test at least for ph and ammonia the smaller tanks are a little harder to keep stable but it can be done with regular water changes only about once or twice a week 'bog log' is decorative wood that you can put in your tank to help keep it stable get a siphon and vaccum the gravel when you change the water it will only take a few minutes with a small tank make sure when you replace the water that the temperature is similar and it is conditioned with a dechlorinator i know this can sound complicated but it really isn't just take it a step at a time and your fish will love you for it there is nothing more eye catching than a well cared for tank with happy healthy fish good luck Aquarium Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sea-Monkey Discus (fish) Sewage treatment Reef tank Goldfish Autonomous building Fish farming Tilapia Ecology Brewery Illegal drug trade Clownfish Hydrogen economy Biodiesel Dwarf gourami Water purification Neopets Kissing gourami Eutrophication Shrimp farm Domestic rabbit Clown loach Tlingit Textile manufacturing Water (molecule) Cruising (maritime) E85 Water Dairy Refrigerator Nuclear power Coral reef Cyanide Thermal power station Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Axolotl Insulin Gaia Online Tofu Krill Chlorophyta Halfbeak Carnivorous plant RuneScape skills 2000 Australian Grand Prix Guinea pig Dry cleaning Cocaine Knife Bottlenose Dolphin Antarctic krill Gas metal arc welding Unreal Electrophysiology Mattress Carbon dioxide Motorcycle Microeconomics Welding Fossil fuel power plant IBM PC compatible Fish Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cannabis cultivation Hypoglycemia Zebra Danio Diabetes mellitus GunBound Breastfeeding Shaggy dog story Fishing Weight training Fancy rat Planetary habitability Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Sento Vegetarianism P-38 Lightning Chinook salmon Coffee Fusion power M60 machine gun Tag The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Agriculture USS Tunny (SS-282) Craps M16 (rifle) Capercaillie
