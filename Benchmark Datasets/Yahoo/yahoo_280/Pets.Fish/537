what kinds of plants can i put in my reef tank to lower nitrates and phosphates i would agree with the caulerpa and needing to prune it if you don't it will take over your tank some states may not allow all types of caulerpa because of it having been found in coastal waters where it's not native but is competing with native plants another choice is chaetomorpha which is a good phosphate absorber if you don't want to put the algae into your tank if you can find an old aquaclear filter and a decent light you can make a mini algae scrubber refugium yourself that hangs on the tank and your water circulates through it http www wetwebmedia com hagenrefugart htm even these plus water changes may not be enough if your source water contains nitrate and or phosphate you can use reverse osmosis water available at target and super walmart stores which has neither or get a phosphate removal pad you can cut to fit your filter Marine aquarium Water purification Sewage treatment Fish farming Rebreather Fossil fuel power plant Carnivorous plant Eutrophication Solar power Ammonium nitrate Aquarium Photosynthesis Biodiesel Nutrient Coral reef Sulfuric acid Algae Reef tank Uranium Dialysis Brewery Water Plankton Desert Solar panel Irrigation Water resources Reverse osmosis Scuba set Phosphate Soil pH Pruning fruit trees Tank landing ship Turquoise Fire fighting Autonomous building Common Unix Printing System Ecology Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Tobacco Plant Charcoal Tank Air conditioning Cannabis cultivation Cell (biology) Sugarcane Carbon dioxide Ice core Nauru Thermal power station Shrimp farm Mattress GunBound Fertilizer Mineral Ocean thermal energy conversion Acid rain Veganism NEWater Sugar Motor oil Nuclear power Sulfur Hydrogen economy Discus (fish) Coffee Osmosis Diatomaceous earth Hydroponics Green Revolution Nephron Biochemistry Coral Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Phosphorus cycle Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Ammonia Scrubber Cruising (maritime) Stoma Town gas Battle of Tarawa Biogeochemical cycle Water (molecule) Fume hood Vacuole Nuclear fuel cycle Rum Filter (optics) Light pollution Sugar beet Fusion power Internal ballistics Beer Introduced species Kidney Cross site scripting
