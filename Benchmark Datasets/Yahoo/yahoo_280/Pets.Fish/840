ryukin being silly bear with me because this is going to sound like a worthless question but i am getting at something my ryukins filter in his gallon tank empties into the tank from about an inch above the water level and creates a current under water where the bubbles are pushed in just today i noticed my ryukin swimming into the current and then stopping and trying like mad to swim up the current at first i thought he was just playing as may still be the case but then someone suggested that perhaps he was doing it because there was more air where the bubbles are entering the water he doesnt stay in it just swims in it for a second or two and then goes off exploring his rocks and plants and then a few minutes later he is back in it it has also occured to me that he could just be swimming through a stronger part of the current since he is swimming closer to the top than he was before he has only been in the tank for about a week and getting stuck the reason i ask is that i would like to determine if there is a lack of oxygen in the tank so that i can take measures to correct it he is in good health and eating well the tank he was in did not cycle for months as recommended but as i said he is doing well and we are closely monitoring his ammonia levels has anyone else had experience with this behavior in their fish and if so can you give me any insight into what may be causing it is he just being playful he looks to me like hes just being silly and playful and in my experience goldfish are quite the little jokers but i just wanted to make sure nobody had had this be a bad sign or a sign of a problem in the water btw hes a tiny fish still but will be upgraded to a asap anyway so dont worry about tank size hes got a good few months before he outgrows it you didn't mention anything else wierd i know you monitor your ammonia good you have a good filter water quality should not be a problem how do you feed him flakes on the surface or do you sink his food this is important beacause that and stress are two main contributors to swimbladder disease our shubunkin acted 'funny' as well he was stressed a move and it was a couple of weeks to a month before he died it sucked if you haven't been feeding him on the surface and he is not stressed then he is probally playing they really are quite the entertainers just keep an eye on him and enjoy him Thermal power station Goldfish Fish farming Drowning Swimming pool Water (molecule) Sea-Monkey Swimming Eutrophication Ammonia Rebreather Little Britain Marine aquarium Carbon dioxide Shrimp farm Sewage treatment Aquarium Fire fighting Urinary incontinence Ecology Decompression sickness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Brewery Atlantic herring Bong Hypoglycemia Carburetor Krill Axolotl E85 Solar system Tank Loudspeaker Autonomous building Seabird Galileo spacecraft Childbirth Livestock Insulin Water Carnivorous plant Ecco the Dolphin Dog Myxobolus cerebralis Traumatic brain injury Cognitive science Antarctic krill Shaggy dog story Stomach cancer Sea level rise Ozone depletion Origin of life Chernobyl accident Quarashi Welding Anorexia nervosa Electrophysiology Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sun Equine conformation Motorcycle Hamster Siphon Fossil fuel power plant Apollo 8 Asthma Hard disk Clinical depression Breaststroke Dog agility F-16 Fighting Falcon 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Ozone hole Orca 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Prostate cancer Bottlenose Dolphin Boom Town (Doctor Who) GunBound Economics Space Shuttle external tank Scientology beliefs and practices Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Jumpstart 3rd Grade P-47 Thunderbolt Dwarf gourami Aluminium Schizophrenia Myocardial infarction Extreme Programming Dialysis Glacier Tide Chronic fatigue syndrome
