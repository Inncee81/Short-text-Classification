our fish died what's the reason for it i cleaned the tank last night and put the anti chlorine and dr wonder fish disease specialist then i found our fishes dead this morning and when i took them out their fins and tails are almost melting and some of their body parts are falling like leaves what's wrong what is the dr wonder stuff too much of the wrong thing could kill a fish instantly like that i suspect the dr wonder i do not beleive in medicating the tank with water additives anti biotic food is best all meds added to the water kill the biological filter for one you really need the use of a microscope to diagnose exactly what ails your fish so you don't medicate with the wrong stuff if you do not know the exact amount of water in the tank you are likely overdosing for example my gallon tank actually holds about gallons of water the rest is taken up by substrate and large river rocks if i dosed for all gallons i would be putting in too much medication the trick to keeping any fish is consistancy consistant regular water changes that also keep the water temperture consistant as well as ph to some degree keep the ammonia and nitrite at zero and nitrates under ppm at all times consistant filter cleanings about once a month and refurbish carbon regularly keep everything the same as you can and the fish will live long happy lives if fish get sick the first thing you do is change water of the time the illness is water related fish health is totally dependant on the health of the water foul water equals stressed or sick fish learn to watch the fish's behaviour when they are healthy if they stop acting that way and start acting differently then suspect the water needs a big changing hope this has shed some light Marine aquarium Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ammonia Dairy Aquarium Common cold Fish farming Water purification Chronic fatigue syndrome Ecology Brewery Insulin Discus (fish) Hydrogen sulfide Hypoglycemia Water Omega-3 fatty acid Biogeochemical cycle Dry cleaning Eutrophication Clinical depression Decompression sickness Rabies Prostate cancer Folic acid Bipolar disorder Shark Cyanide Vitamin C Fugu Sea-Monkey Medicine Marathon (sport) Cocaine EastEnders Sodium chloride Biological warfare Diving The Amber Spyglass Health insurance Healthy eating Whale E85 Stomach cancer Tocopherol Duesberg hypothesis Quarantine Foodborne illness Textile manufacturing Lake Acne Hamster Disease Charles Darwin's illness Chlorine Poker jargon Tooth enamel Urinary incontinence Abortion debate Multiple sclerosis Dietary fiber Thermal power station Orca Gasoline Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Reef tank Swimming Pneumonia Hydrogen economy Swimming pool Autonomous building Electrophysiology Diabetes mellitus Caffeine Air pollution Hard water Escherichia coli O157:H7 Utilitarianism Water (molecule) Coronary heart disease Sexual orientation Drowning Nutrition Nitrogen Cancer Fire fighting Drug abuse Asthma Nutrient Fish Radiation poisoning Biology Biodiesel Nuclear fallout
