i have a goby dragon fish how often do i need to feed it and what is best i 've been breaking apart algea tablets for it and doing that once a day is that to much or not enough my goldfish seems to get to it faster though so i feed it flakes and sneak a tablet in on the side is this ok or should i do something else and what about water temp my apartment gets hot should i be worried about the dragon fish any ideas would be wonderful thanks the dragon goby or violet goby loves blood worms adult brine shrimp and flake food they need salt in their water to stay healthy about teaspoons per gallon or you will lose them also remember salt does not evaporate so only add salt when you actually remove water to do your weekly partial water changes not when you replace evaporated water i would get rid of the goldfish and keep the goby they are much more interesting fish maybe even get a couple more as far as temperature you need to get a heater and keep the tank between and degrees do not worry about the dragon the goldfish are the ones that suffer in the higher temps the goldfish are coldwater fish and shouldn't be kept above i hope you have a filter runnning in the tank Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Sea-Monkey Autonomous building Brewery Goby Dishwasher Shrimp farm Apollo 13 Thermoregulation Cantonese cuisine Thermal power station Gobi Desert Edible salt Fish Coffee Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Temperature Water (molecule) Axolotl Dead Sea Dwarf gourami Salmon Cannabis cultivation Dairy Krill Hydrochloric acid Sewage treatment Koi Desert Reef tank Evaporation Clownfish Tilapia Water Biodiesel Angling Fossil fuel power plant Tofu Great Salt Lake Porridge Sauna E85 Zebra Danio Air conditioning Lake Food preservation Discus (fish) Water purification French fries Nerpa Twelve leverage points Degree Fahrenheit Rammstein Kashrut Magnesium Dry cleaning Rum Soy protein Stock car (rail) Ketchup Cocaine Shark Guqin Warm-blooded Halfbeak Boiling point Agar plate Seabird Fishing Wetland Arizona Ozone depletion Kosher foods Fish and chips Solar power Desalination Swimming pool Murray Cod Hydrogen economy Vermicompost Symbiosis Water heater Aluminium Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Dehydration American Dad!
