salt water fish i have always been interested in salt water fish and the tanks are so colorful and great i have a couple questions for people who have saltwater tanks is it hard to have how much does it cost how much work do you have to do what is the smallest size tank for a nemo fish to live in and if you have more info on them please tell me thanks there are many different types of setups for saltwater fish it all depends on what you plan to keep in the tank the cheapest setup will only allow you to keep fish no inverts or corals the larger the tank the less work it is you can house a nemo fish in a gallon tank but with not many other fish in there btw nemo is a oscellaris clownfish or a percula clownfish the onjly difference is the oscellaris is wildly caught in the ocean where the percula is bred in captivity you will need cleaning supplies live rock and live sand for substrate you will need a hydrometer to measure saltcontent of the water as well as marine salt to add to the water you will need a test kit to measure ph nitrite nitrate and amonia you will also need an aquarium light if you plan to keep corals you will need to upgrade your lighting but as a beginner to keeping a marine tank i will only talk about a fish only tank for it is the easiest setup and the cheapest you will also need a filter thats rated for your size tank freshwater filters are the same as saltwater then youll need a heater to maintain the warm temperatures clownfish need a protien skimmer is another filtration device that i strongly reccomend but i know of people who dont use themk and they have had great success for years with out one so just due to supplies the price is pretty hefty for maintenence you will have to do weekly water changes and daily feedings if you enjoy keeping it than it isnt hard its actually quite relaxing and addictive id be happy to answer any other questions if you care to email me hope this helps and good luck Clownfish Fish farming Sewage treatment Percula Clownfish Fish Shrimp farm Coral reef Finding Nemo Hydrogen economy Brewery Solar power E85 Biodiesel Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Autonomous building Fly fishing Strap-on dildo Sea-Monkey Thermal power station Hard water Tank Cyanide Eutrophication Seabird Tilapia Nuclear power PID controller Carburetor Swimming pool Fauna of Australia Goldfish Microeconomics Goby Marine biology Transformer Fishing Dishwasher Krill Hard disk Coral Water purification Fire extinguisher Dry cleaning Hamster Cruising (maritime) Fish migration Carnivorous plant Antarctic krill Monterey Bay Aquarium Koi Japanese toilet Angling Dead Sea Shark M60 machine gun Lake Opportunity rover Coast Gasoline Sea anemone Hubble Space Telescope Digital photography Radio controlled airplane Welding Dairy Fugu Loudspeaker Ice core MS-06 Zaku II Illegal drug trade Anchor Biodiversity Saltwater intrusion Water Uranium Japanese tea ceremony Gas metal arc welding Hydroponics Rebreather Crocodile Bong Water supply Diode Paragliding 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Economic history of Canada Solar cell Siphon F-16 Fighting Falcon United States Marine Corps Light-emitting diode
