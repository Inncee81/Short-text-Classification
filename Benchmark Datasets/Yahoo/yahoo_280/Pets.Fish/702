aquarium setup i bought a gal tank there is tank hoods one for each half and cutouts for the filter and heater does it matter if i put the filter on the left or right and should the heater be on opposite sides of the filter or same side put it where you want makes no difference as long as the filter is turning over enough water for your setup than it doesnt matter where it is just as long as it is there for the heaters i personally like using smaller heaters so the heat is eveenly dispearsed through thye tank so one goes on one side and one on the other if you already have the one heatrer that is rated for your size tank should be about watts per gallon than again it doesnt matter just spend like dollars on thermometers so you can measure temperature near the heater and another on the other side of the tank away from the heater or if you have one of those heaters that can be fully submerged than put it right in the middle against the back wall sideways so you can get as close to evenly dispearsing the heat hope this helps and good luck with the new tank addition if you have a canister filter you can have the intake on one side and the output on the other so you can be moving more water in different areas of the tank if its a hang on back style filter than it doesnt matter j e t s jets jets jets hahah nice screen name btw Brewery Marine aquarium Aquarium Reef tank Diesel engine Thermal power station Carburetor Tank Autonomous building Temperature Water heater Thermostat Fossil fuel power plant Solar power Apollo 13 Process control HVAC Biodiesel Loudspeaker PID controller Fire fighting Vacuum cleaner Cannabis cultivation Refrigerator Mars Exploration Rover Chevrolet Corvair Siphon Incandescent light bulb E85 Turbocharger Jet engine Transformer Glossary of firefighting equipment Furnace Textile manufacturing Ocean thermal energy conversion Solar panel MS-09 Dom Sewage treatment Energy Dodge Charger Samovar Motor oil Heat Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Water purification Cold fusion Welding Stereoscopy Taikyoku shogi Dairy Peltier-Seebeck effect Calorimeter Transistor Vacuum tube Alcohol fuel Hydrogen economy Rail terminology Tai shogi Atomic Kitten Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Dai dai shogi Light-emitting diode B-47 Stratojet Hydropower Dry cleaning Entropy Water supply Thermocouple Smoke-screen Circuit design Backstroke Butterfly stroke Fuel injection Wind power Electronic amplifier Renewable energy Swingout STS-87 Torpedo Gas turbine Japanese toilet Professional wrestling holds Swimming pool Hard disk Internal combustion engine Supercharger Gas turbine-electric locomotive Chevrolet Corvair engine Powder metallurgy Bong Portable stove Antenna (radio) Breaststroke STS-62 Oscilloscope Professional wrestling throws Air conditioning
