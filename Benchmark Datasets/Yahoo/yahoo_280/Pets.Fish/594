i have a vacuum cleaner fish why is my molly near the water surface constantly sucking in water or debris i know the oxygen level is not low because i have oxgyenator plants plus the light is on so the plants aren't using oxygen furthermore the filter and the airstone is in top notch condition and the guppies in there are happy and swimming the molly looks happy and healthy though it swims down sometimes and goes up sometimes and my water tests came out good no nh equals zero all that good stuff since the fish involved is a molly there could be a few reasons for this behavior mollies are surface feeding fish so it may be looking for food what's the water temperature as water warms it holds less oxygen but with a filter in the tank the temperature would need to be very warm for the molly to be affected if the molly is newer than the guppies or the tank itself is new less then months running you might have a buildup of ammonia or nitrite if the guppies have been in the tank longer they may have adapted somewhat to the level but a new fish would not have it may also be more sensitive to the chemicals than are the guppies see ammonia poisoning and nitrite poisoning in this link http www fish disease net diseases htm the solution to this is a larger partial water change of about if you're unable to test your water to rule this out Sewage treatment Marine aquarium Fish farming Water Water (molecule) Carburetor Autonomous building Ammonia Carnivorous plant Eutrophication Carbon dioxide Cyanide Hydrogen economy Hydrogen sulfide Brewery Solar power Sea-Monkey Ozone depletion Ocean thermal energy conversion Shark Explosive material Biogeochemical cycle Ozone hole Hydrogen Sun E85 Water purification Nitrous oxide Hydroponics Krill Solar variation Iron Thermal power station El Ni__o Drowning Tetrapod Swimming Vitamin C Welding Alternative biochemistry Motor oil Earth's atmosphere Mosquito Diseases of the honeybee Global warming and agriculture Coal Fossil fuel power plant Siphon Dairy Antarctic krill Dry cleaning Nuclear power Lake Gar Acetic acid Wetland Fishing Glossary of firefighting equipment Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Omega-3 fatty acid Haloalkane Soil pH Atlantic herring Helium Bong Nitrogen Decompression sickness Vacuum cleaner Photosynthesis Rocket fuel Nitric acid Ice core Ecology of Hong Kong Beryllium Dog Corrosion Origin of life Renewable energy Acne Vegetarianism Refrigerator Hamster Contact lens Coral reef Copper Hydrogen peroxide Incandescent light bulb Nutrition
