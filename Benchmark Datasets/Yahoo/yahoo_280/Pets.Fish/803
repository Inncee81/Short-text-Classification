water chemistry way off and water cloudy i have a planted gal tank with spotted gar a shovelnose catfish pleco and rosy red feeders did have days ago now down to about most died the tank has been established for months now and my chemestry has always tested in the norm days ago i noticed about dead rosy's then found about more hours later i quickly removed them but was out of test strips i got more and tested last night no ppm nitrites ppm gh always has been kh ppm and ph about i know these are some wild readings double checked got the same today i retested after installing additional filters all established from other tanks everything tested close to the same ph went down to but kh dropped to ppm and nitrites dropped to ppm my water is still cloudy and fish are dying like crazy have any cheap solutions or causes i am out of ammonia test strips i'm shure it's climbed from all the deaths but i don't think it's the cause my ph is generally about so it is low the tank is actually very well maintained on it's own i normally don't touch it except for a water change a month for the plants to get extra co buildup is and has been low the pleco does a good job very active if it helps my plants have been growing rapidly the past few days i'm assuming thanks to the added ammonia a don't play with the ph that's not the problem here something is off in your bio filter at six months there shouldn't be and prehaps when you clealed it just was over cleaned and wiped out too much of your nitrosomma's if it's just the feeders dying off the problem probably was that there were too many fish and the death of them combined with thier decomposition caused an influx of ammonia is what i guess here you already have a pleco and that population listing i don't think using cory cats is the way to go either it doesn't seem like this is excess food such as flakes or whatever secondary thing i see here is using test strips they are not that accurate and i'd urge you to get a liquid reagent tester they are more accurate and easier to read if your bigger fish are not having problems then do treat this like the other answerer said with a good sized partial water change for now and run a test specifically on your ammonia and nitrites you're ph is a little low but that's not a problem that is actually keeping your ammonia from being all that more toxic run your tests with the new kit after a water change and please let me know you can get better answers and superior service at fishless cycling com or just use the link on my profile jv follow up john has some good advice actually but when it comes to fixing your ph you really do not have to worry about this at you are quite well within an acceptable range and ph adjustments should be done prior to populating a tank shifts in ph levels with a fish population in the water can be just as damaging as ammonia and nitrites in the water i suspect that your ph is downing due to overpopulation with those rosies in and i like the idea of just keeping them in a seperate tank until you want to put some in to feed i think i know what you are doing putting that many in so you don't have to make continual trips for food and the logic isn't bad on that here is the problem with doing that though one of the first breakdown steps of the ammonia into nitrite is the production of nitric acid it will exist in the water while your nitrites are being formed and that presence of the nitric acid is what is lowering your ph it is being caused because of excess waste and ammonia present in the water for now to treat this don't fight the battle with the ph number but combine this with putting less feeders in the tank and raising your kh to give you a bigger buffer Sewage treatment Carbon dioxide Hydrogen sulfide Nitric acid Hydrogen economy Fish farming Eutrophication E85 Hydrogen peroxide Hydrogen Water purification Explosive material Nuclear power Haloalkane Carburetor Dairy Discus (fish) Water (molecule) Electrophysiology Poker jargon Cyanide Biodiesel Brewery Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Keynesian economics Debugging Thermal power station Nitrogen Ozone depletion Tank Cocaine Hypoglycemia Extreme Programming Microeconomics Ammonium nitrate Theory of conduct Shrimp farm Solar power Hydrochloric acid Internal ballistics Ozone hole Motor oil Hydroponics Organic farming Diseases of the honeybee Messerschmitt Bf 109 Nutrition Hard disk Hard water Sulfuric acid CPU cache Inflation Biogeochemical cycle Biochemistry Folic acid Hamster Technetium M16 (rifle) HIV test Autonomous building Aquarium GED M60 machine gun Nitrous oxide Veganism Ecco the Dolphin Urea Water FairTax Software testing Aldehyde Gmail Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Ultraviolet Unemployment B-47 Stratojet Jet engine Energy development Natural gas Supply and demand Town gas Protein Photosynthesis Poison Moon Iron Chlorine The Apprentice 2 Social rule Aluminium Rebreather Rocket fuel Cannabis cultivation
