why do my angel fish keep dying for no reason at all my angel keep dying but the other fish are fine whyis this angel fish are really gentle fish by that i mean slight changes can be detrimental which you have witnessed you should have either one angel to an aquarium or more than angels are cichlids and like most cichlids if you keep just or in the same aquarium the strongest one will make the others miserable angels do very well in a group with or more angels in a large aquarium with at least gallons of water that is at least deep angel fish like brakish water which is inbetween fresh water and salt water you should add a little salt to their water remember they are delicate and their water has to maintain stability in order for them to survive the disease that they get is called hole in the head unfortunately once they get it there really isn't a cure but since your other fish are doing fine this is probably not the reason they are dying unless you are noticing that they have holes in their heads also i suggest not wasting your money on water testing supplies if you have a petsmart in your area petsmart provides free water testing and if you have problems they'll tell you how to fix it most definetely the other type of fish in your tank could be a reason for their deaths as well be sure to pick the fish in your tank by their compatibility Aquarium Marine aquarium Tilapia Fish Reef tank Brewery Water Fish farming Fishing Goldfish Dairy Tofu Fire extinguisher Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Brackish water Live-bearing aquarium fish Shrimp farm Nuclear reactor Freshwater angelfish Jellyfish Ecology Lake Tanganyika Discus (fish) Lake Malawi Energy development Salmon Sea-Monkey Oscar (fish) Sewage treatment Poker jargon Shedd Aquarium Hydroponics Zebra Danio Microeconomics Thermal power station Cyanide Ozone depletion 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Hydrogen economy Crayfish Clownfish Gar Vitamin C Carburetor Carbon dioxide Fugu Textile manufacturing Drill bit Georgia Aquarium Ozone hole Wetland Autonomous building USS Wake Island (CVE-65) Biodiesel Jack Dempsey (fish) Dwarf gourami Fish and chips Condom Aquifer Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre Cessna T-37 Shark Monterey Bay Aquarium Aral Sea Transformer Water (molecule) Coral reef Opportunity rover Professional wrestling throws Kidney Equine conformation Vinegar Ich Vegetarianism Depleted uranium Seismic retrofit Cancer Blood Glacier Lake E85 Nuclear weapon design Dishwasher Pitaten Goby Food preservation Domestic AC power plugs and sockets USS Yorktown (CV-5) Whale Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Coffee Aquarium (album) Concrete Orca Environmental concerns with electricity generation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Movie projector Nuclear power
