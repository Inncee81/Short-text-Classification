tropical fish help have just bought some tropical fish have a small glass tank and they gave me small fish to start a few questions i have seen things that say need a pump as well as a filter but the women didnt mention it when i bought them the filter is only a small one for beginners but it does send a jet of water out and takes the fish on a little ride when they swim into it is that ok for the fish how hot should my tank be many sites say different things hope you can help xxxx as long as your filter is moving the water on the surface of your tank around a bit you really don't need an air pump as well you can use one for decoration but it's not needed for the fish it sounds like you have a fairly strong filter but to be honest there is really no such thing as too much filtration on a tank it's probably just fine most fish do best in a range of temperature around f some fall outside this range but that covered the majority of fish you find in pet stores if your tank is cooler than that you will want to add a heater mm Aquarium Brewery Marine aquarium Thermal power station Solar power Autonomous building Carburetor Coffee Swimming pool Sewage treatment Sea-Monkey E85 Reef tank Dry cleaning Motor oil Solar collector El Ni__o Water purification Discus (fish) Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Thermoregulation Diesel engine Fish farming Bong Rum Thermostat HVAC Air conditioning Japanese toilet Customs and etiquette of Japan Shark Glossary of firefighting equipment Loudspeaker Diving suit Solar panel Gas compressor Sonar Glass Danio Pump It Up Axolotl Water supply Irrigation Vacuum Beer Antarctic krill Fume hood Ocean thermal energy conversion Energy development Clownfish Gar Space shuttle main engine Jet engine Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Hard disk Drainage Fountain Mooney M20 Seine (fishing) Siphon Polyethylene terephthalate Turbojet Pump Heat pump Tank Dead Sea Dialysis Hydraulic machinery Convection Lifeboat Samovar Final Fantasy XI Dishwasher Dwarf gourami Water garden Analog-to-digital converter Refrigerator Rocket fuel Sun Seabird Filtration Atlantic Ocean Fishing National Weather Service Filter (optics) Incandescent light bulb Agar plate Gaia Online Water pollution Myxobolus cerebralis Environmental concerns with electricity generation Shrimp farm Axial compressor Spacecraft propulsion Thorpe Park Diving
