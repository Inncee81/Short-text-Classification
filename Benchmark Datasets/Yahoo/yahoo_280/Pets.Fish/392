my dragon gobies eyes hi i have a dragon goby and i have had it for about a year now in a gallon tank and i havent had any problems with my goby i came home from work yesterday to find that my dragon gobies had something wrong with its head i looked closer and i noticed that it has one eye missing and the other eye was pushed into its head the fish is still alive but all it does now is suck in water filter feeding and it rolls around on the bottom of my tank i dont want to kill the goby since it is still alive but idk if anyone has some advice for what i can do for it to help it live and i was wondering if its missing eye smased in eye will heal i do not have any decor in the tank that could result in my gobies injury all help is appreciated thanks something has plucked it's eye out i have had this problem with cichlids you would be rolling around too if you had your eye plucked out you didn't say what other fish are in the tank but i would try to find a new tank for him sometimes fish will survive with one eye and other times the injury is to great to recover from good luck Piccolo Junior Saga RuneScape quests Marine aquarium Brewery Axolotl GunBound Aquarium Shark The Contender (television series) Freshwater angelfish Kain (Legacy of Kain) Sea-Monkey SS Andrea Doria European dragon Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Sin City Hannibal Lecter Shaggy dog story Fish farming Discus (fish) Gobi Desert Super Metroid Sub-Zero Mandarin (comics) Goldfish Bactrian Camel Dragon Booster 1957 World Series Fugu Dry cleaning Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger King Piccolo Saga Three Stooges Griffin Ninja Scroll StarCraft: Uprising The Subtle Knife Characters of Lost Diving P-47 Thunderbolt W.I.T.C.H.
