rock for my aquarium i found a rock in my garden that i want to put in my aquarium i asked a friend about it and she said to boil the rock and then rinse it with cold water before i put it in the aquarium is this ok or is there another way to make this rock ok for my aquarium it's a gallon and it's not a very big rock any suggestions would be great too thanks generally you will hear that it is a bad idea to put anything like that into your tank this is a very broad statement however if you follow certain rules you can minimize the potential for problems firstly you want to remove the surface dirt and bacteria boiling is a good way to do this if you can fit the item into a pot then you will want to use the vinegar test on it as posted above finally you should submerge it in clean water overnight and the next day check for any oily residue on the water surface or discoloration of the water if you notice any residue floating on the water surface or discoloration with the exception of tannins from driftwood i advise you to not use it in the tank otherwise go ahead and try it monitoring closely your fish and water parameters for a few weeks i hope this helps you jason c Aquarium Marine aquarium Vinegar Sewage treatment Dry cleaning Thermal power station Hard water Dishwasher Renewable energy Poker jargon Fishing Brewery Gar Goldfish Clownfish Halitosis Sea-Monkey Reef tank Water USS Tunny (SS-282) Water purification Tilapia Autonomous building Crayfish Koi Tattoo E85 Houseplant Tea Betting (poker) Leather Water (molecule) Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Swimming pool Cyanide Bong Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Kosher foods Linear regression Textile manufacturing Welding Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Nuclear fallout Wine making Discus (fish) Dialysis Essential oil Soap Fire extinguisher Fish Insulin Monterey Bay Aquarium Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Dam Normal distribution USS Albacore (SS-218) Tofu Sulfuric acid Acetic acid C plus plus 2003 North America blackout Menstrual cup Japanese tea ceremony Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February M16 (rifle) Ocean thermal energy conversion StarCraft: Uprising Alcohol fuel Alcoholics Anonymous Sterilization (microbiology) Heinkel He 100 Siphon Fossil fuel power plant The Parting of the Ways STS-59 Fire fighting Acne Georgia Aquarium Hemp Space Mountain USS S-38 (SS-143) Mercury Atlas 6 Internal ballistics Drowning Frogman Pickling Food preservation Vacuum Diving regulator Eutrophication Glossary of wildland fire terms Nuclear power Contact lens Sodium hypochlorite Heat exchanger P-47 Thunderbolt Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans
