questions about my community tank i have a gallon that currently has fancy guppies mollies cory cats platies zebra danios neon tetras african dwarf frogs and about babies of a variety of sizes i'm not planning on adding more fish unless necessary females getting bullied lack of schooling etc if i change my mind am i safe to add more fish if so what kinds will nature takes its course with the fry or do you think i will have many fry growing into adults any suggestions for my tank best temp ph etc for my tank combos also i lost a guppy to a freak filter accident and they next day her mate died is this coincidence is it necessary to put netting over the filter please give me any info you think i need ty things i already know so please don't give me these answer or anything completely basic like do water changes ty if you think something is basic but unique feel free to let me know my tank is not overstocked fish eat their fry proper general maintenance there is no need to get rid of certain breed i have done a lot of research and as you can see i have top mid and bottom swimmers as for the guppies i realize they are the million fish basic info about guppies i'm not concerned about too many guppies that's the goal they will be moved when they are large enough i will be moved only fry in the community tank i have many live plants aeration filtration this is considered basic types of info not unique don't take me wrong i appreciate all comments i just wish people would read more carefully and specific i am talking about my fish when i say fish eat their fry the large majority of the breeds i have eat their fry most of my fry are guppies i have some platy fry that were just born but have only seen at once culling will begin to occur once they get the majority of their color they will be used for food for convict and oscars owned by friend and others will be given to friends with other community tanks all has been arranged you could buy more fish since most of yours are smaller but make sure you have more filtration than you need i would add some different tetras they come in so many colors and sizes the mollies will prolly eat the fry unless you have good hiding places hard one to call without a picture i'd say keep the tank about f and a ph of about lower ph will help keep amonia down if it becomes a problem but only so much if you want the fry to live i'd place a fish net over the filter intake other wise don't worry about it a pain to clean it's probably a coincidence about the guppies mate but we don't know what fish think yet i would also suggest doing some research into planted tanks it could really increase the look of your tank as well as water quality extra oxygen will increase the number of fish you can have but it does take work to do it right hope i helped Brewery Fish farming Discus (fish) Sewage treatment Marine aquarium Hamster Tofu Shark Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tilapia Sea-Monkey Yerba mate Dairy Goldfish God Emperor of Dune Thermal power station Fugu Shrimp farm Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Hydrogen economy Theory of conduct Fancy rat Poker jargon Carburetor Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Tank Salmon Social rule Autonomous building Folic acid Domestic rabbit Houseplant Energy development Milk Coffee House Mouse Dwarf gourami Seabird Biodiesel RuneScape quests Ecology Hydroponics Nuclear power Solar power Boeing 747 Live-bearing aquarium fish Danio Water purification E85 Elephant Vegetarianism Zebra Danio Little Britain Tocopherol Fishing Dry cleaning Gaia Online 2000 Australian Grand Prix Spider Motorcycle Potato Dog Education Digital photography Diving Abortion debate Plant breeding In-N-Out Burger Domesticated turkey Infantilism Green Revolution Veganism Weight training Chinook salmon Clownfish Atkins Nutritional Approach Koi Reef tank Eutrophication Saturn V Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Tooth Apollo 13 Biodiversity Laserdisc Monopoly (game) Animal Species Nutrition M60 machine gun Fish and chips Philip J.
