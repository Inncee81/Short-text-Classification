my goldfish what exactly happened a couple days ago i came home from my relatives to find my goldfish laying on it's side and constantly trying to keep it's balance the bowl was fairly dirty but my mother insisted that she cleaned it yesterday anyway i scrubbed the bowl clean replaced it with fresh water and put my goldfish back in it still was having issues swimming i just left it in the bowl and left the room after i came back an hour or so i was shocked to see my fish swimming around happily and not tipping over once on it's side i could clearly see patches of red at the end of it's tail fin though which i'm guessing are broken blood vessels also it may be worth to note that while i was cleaning the bowl i saw a ton of fish food like pellets at the bottom even though my mother once again insisted that she didn't put that many pellets in i'm guessing that maybe he was having defecation problems or maybe he didn't eat them was it the pellets causing the dirty tank or something else there shouldn't be any food laying on the bottom of the tank all uneaten food should be taken out so even though your mom may have believed she was not overfeeding she was the food was rotting and causing the water to become toxic thus causing the fish to start getting sick from the toxic water changing the water removed the toxic environment and thus made the fish happier you're lucky that you caught it so soon yes the red streaks at the ends of the fins are from stress and or septicemia which can be a result of poor water quality these will go away when the stress and or poor water quality is eliminated but if allowed to continue will kill the fish bowls are not the best environment for any fish but especially a goldfish i would highly suggest saving your allowance to buy at least a gallon tank and a very very good filter trust me your fish will be much healthier and live much longer in the meantime because of the excessive levels of waste goldfish create and because you have a bowl with no filter you are going to need to change the water at least times a week if not every day good luck and glad you saved your goldy in time Goldfish Aquarium Shrimp farm Fish farming Marine aquarium Bong Hamster Carbon dioxide Sewage treatment Shark Dairy E85 Dry cleaning Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sea-Monkey Biodiesel Nutrition Hydrogen economy Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Japanese tea ceremony Cannabis cultivation Orca Brewery Shaggy dog story Domestic rabbit Pitaten Eutrophication Fugu Menstrual cup Guinea pig Ecco the Dolphin Foodborne illness Diseases of the honeybee Cat Whaling Tea Dialysis Ecology Weekly World News Kosher foods Tag Fishing Toilet humour Fin Whale Environmental concerns with electricity generation Equine conformation Whale Lake Burley Griffin Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Water purification Folic acid Dam Alcohol fuel Poker jargon Kashrut First Battle of the Atlantic Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Humpback Whale Coffee West Indian cricket team Veganism Laserdisc Hormone replacement therapy (trans) EastEnders Rebreather Predestination paradox Motor oil Salmon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Oily fish Bread Kodocha Gar Koi Mercury (element) Tetrapod Welding Characters in the Smurfs Water The Perishers Panama Canal Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Futurama (TV series - season 2) Iron Swimming Pebble bed reactor Sin City Chopsticks Insulin Unemployment Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Cleveland Browns Vegetarianism
