would the way someone dresses change what you think about them i mean i know its not good to judge people but could someones appearance change your intitial thoughts about some one i'm not talking about prices i'm talking about style and stereotypes in clothing of course we say it is not nice to judge by appearances but most of us do at least at first glance i know a lot about a woman who buys her raggedy clothes at the goodwill but dresses her kids in shiney expensive clothes don't you how about a girl who is overweight and wears daisy dukes and her belly hanging out don't you i know a lot about a guy who will not shave even to go to a funeral how about a guy who wears his pants down the crack of his butt and is pushing or how about a lady who has teenage girls and dresses just like them how about a girl who wears high heels on a camp out writers depend on people jumping to conclusions by adding just a couple of details like the man who is wearing his tie sideways and his hair is rumpled what's going on there what about an old man in a diaper if you met me you'd see a short senior female with glasses and a thick waist you'd think grandma you'd be right but you'd also be wrong i am also living in sin with my bf studying tao and buddhism and write for my company you might not imagine that i am an old hippie and have weird ideas about a lot of topics you might be surprised to know that i love motorcycles rock and roll music and dancing i was in the navy for years too see how much you miss if you take your first impression as gold Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
