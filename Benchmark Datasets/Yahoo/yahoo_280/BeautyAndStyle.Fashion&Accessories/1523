fake sterling silver bracelet i bought a bracelet whilst on holiday in tunisia which l really liked because i got it engraved with my name in arabic but now when i have come home it appears that it was not actually silver even though it had the stamp on it it appears it is copper and turns my wrist green so i have questions really is copper a good thing to have on your wrist i have heard copper is good for you can i get a sliver coating placed on the bracelet so that it looks silver again because at the moment it looks horrible if so where can i get this done what you bought was something called coin metal it is a mixture of silver with other alloys have you tried a cleaner like tarnex any metal polish should clean it up as far as silver plating it you could do that hotels have a big tub of little silver balls that vibrate and thats where they replate their silver plate flatware you may try calling a place that sells flatware and ask if they know a business that replates Student Okashina Okashi Lee Soo Man Kare Kano Soo Line Railroad Azumanga Daioh Can (band) Vera Lynn Misty (Pok__mon) Samurai Girl: Real Bout High School Bradley Nowell Casper the Friendly Ghost Physical attractiveness Polycythemia Hollister, California LeBron James Bradley John Murdoch Omar Bradley Advanced Placement Program Frosh Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology M__laga CF The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps Fecal incontinence Butler County, Ohio Real Betis G__tz George Dazed and Confused (film) Tooting Plane (tool) Steve Prefontaine USS Utah (BB-31) Sault Ste.
