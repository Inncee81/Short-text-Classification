wearing thongs hey until recently i have been wearing cotton briefs for years of my life now i want to start wearing some sexy underwear so the other day i bought myself a black thong from la senza with a butterfly up the top i've worn it about three times but i can't get used to it at the moment i can't feel it when i sit down it's just when i stand up and walk is this just because i'm not used to it and need to wear it more is there any tips or information on how to get used to it thanks even though i m a guy i'm going to give you some very good advice about thongs this comes from my own experience wearing them an ex girlfriend got me into them as well as what i've learned from women online and friends in real life i ve help change women s minds about hating thongs i think that most people who hate thongs do so because they didn t pick the right type and were not constant at wearing them some thongs are easy to get used to and some thongs are not i m talking about when you are starting to wear them once you get used to them you can wear most with comfort so picking the right thongs will make a huge difference when it comes to getting used to them and how long it will take you this is my suggestion go to the store and buy some thongs that are comfortable see bellow wear them non stop for about five to seven days every day if you want to get used to sleeping with them wear them to bed too i ve never gotten used to wearing them at night and i know a few girls that have the same problem we can wear them all they long and not have a problem with them but sleeping with them it s a little different for some people not feeling the while you are sitting and feeling them while standing or walking is very common i actually think that that s the norm a way to help you get over this problem is by wearing them while exercising hiking and doing physical activities the more time you spend doing this activities while wearing thongs the easier and faster you ll get used to them for two reasons this activities will help you keep your mind preoccupied and will keep you from thinking too much about the sensation of wearing anytime you catch yourself thinking about the sensation refocus on whatever physical activity you are doing doing this while help you get used to them very fast in as little as days but keep wearing them for the whole week to break in the sensation good if you wear them on and off while you are trying to get used to them it s going to be a long time before you get used to them stick with thongs for a while the longer the better eventually you ll be able to wear any style of panties without a problem i've asked women the reasons they like or dislike wearing thongs and i don't mean just the typical well they feel like a big wedgie answer i mean i want details baby i want to know why where when and how before i do i have to warn you that i'm going to get a bit graphic here i don't mean to discuss anyone one of the biggest mistakes that women do when picking underwear thong in particular is that they often pick them based on looks cute sexy etc vs comfort picking the right size cut style and material can make all the difference in the world one of the problems that women have is picking the right size most women wear a size too small i realized that long ago and when i asked several fashion design students at a school about it and they totally agreed with me the same way that most women wear the wrong bra size i'm sure you have heard that before the cut and style is very important thongs now come in different styles some thongs are a bit more roomy than others what i m talking about is the material that runs down the front over the pubic bone and over you lips the problem is that women come in different shapes and sizes down there some have a lot and some pretty much nothing just like a slid down there the problem comes when you pick thongs that are very narrow i ve seen some at stores that are so narrow that it makes you wonder what were they design to cover and with some of those thongs if you are between average and really full size down there you are going to run into problems add to that problem the problem of picking a size too small and you have a bigger problem the width of the back strip is also important too wide and thick make you feel like you have a big wedgie too thin like some that are just like a string going down may not hold the front part in place especially when that string is made out of elastic and if you are a bit on the full size down there the other thing to consider is the material thongs are worn in very tight places places with a lot of movement movement that comes from bending at the hips walking running or even just sitting wearing thongs that are made of a soft and stretchable material that moves and flexes with you can makes a huge different when it comes to comfort the best material out there by far is called microfiber if you are not familiar with microfiber i d suggest that you take a little trip to your local dept store and take a look at some panties make of it it s a material that is very soft and stretchable for people who are just starting to wear thong or even the more experienced thong wearers i highly recommend thongs made of microfiber and stick with the traditional thong style and not with the ones with a little tiny string running down that back just used common sense and think about comfort rather than looks after all how often do you walk around in public friends or even family members in your underwear it s funny how some people buy their panties based on cuteness and or sexiness then they take them home put them on cover them up with more clothes and no one ever sees them i ve ran into six girls so far who have told me that they hated thongs once i found their size i went to the store myself and bought them a few pair of thong that i picked for them and asked them to wear them for at least five days straight so far not one have come back to tell me that she still hate thongs not one four out of the six wear them daily now and the other two wear them most of the time like my friend rose wrote in an e mail to another friend of mine wow it s pretty embarrassing that a man had to teach me how to buy my panties now i m hooked on them thongs and can t stop wearing them i would like to hear from you regarding your experience getting used to wearing thongs like the type style material brand etc of thongs that you started to wear if my suggestions helped you please let me know this is the way i learn what works and what doesn t work so far i ve received no complaints only compliments Ashlee Simpson The Ashlee Simpson Show Autobiography (Ashlee Simpson album) Single
