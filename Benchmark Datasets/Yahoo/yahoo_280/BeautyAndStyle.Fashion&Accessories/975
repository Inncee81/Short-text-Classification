ladies do you prefer to buy brand clothing or just make your own personal style i'm more of creativity i don't care if i use brand or not of course there is no problem at all if you buy branded stuff i enjoy experimenting with clothing and going to thrift shopping or sometimes mix and match with some branded stuff what about u thankz for being honest go with whatever looks nice sometimes havign a brand name thing on can make you feel good and look hot mix and match is the way to go all brand names and you look like a freak and a walking billboard but if you mean elegant stuff like dresses and evening wear i think check out the designer brand stuff and go get something that looks similar but you dont need a loan to buy Shit Brand Indian English Trademark Little Britain Marilyn Monroe Time Out of Mind Sauna Billboard Hot 100 Sampling (music) Shoe James Brown (musician) Jennifer Lopez Advertising Social aspects of clothing Donna Summer Ethics Mid-levels Upholstery Fashion Fashion design Neopets The Devil Wears Prada Japanese tea ceremony Mattress About a Boy Rod Stewart Clothing Jet engine Strap-on dildo Ethical consumerism RuneScape locations Sears Holdings Corporation World Championship Wrestling The Emancipation of Mimi Rat (zodiac) Breakdancing My Life as a Teenage Robot The McGuire Sisters W.
