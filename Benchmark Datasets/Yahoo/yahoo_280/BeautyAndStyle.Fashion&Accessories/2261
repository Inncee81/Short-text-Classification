first date i am taking a girl to a nfl football game i know i know just hear me out i mentioned that i had tickets and she wanted to go it will be our first date is it okay to wear a jersey for my team or should i go a little more i dont know what the word would be but not so casual thanks for all the great answers i think that is what i am going to do and special thanks to kayla i might just bring her one also not sure if she has one already but i will figure that out and if not there ya go thanks again everyone i would say go for it and maybe if shes cool then bring her a jersey to wear too it should not be what youre wearing to impress a girl wear what you want support your team and all that jazz what should matter is that you two have a good time it would have totally blew me away if one of my boyfriends took me to an nfl game on our first date now im not trying to be harsh but if shes more worried about how you look when youre with her thats shallow have fun Haircut Clothing Hair Characters in the Smurfs Kodocha The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Charmed EastEnders Tire Dragon Booster Japanese tea ceremony Upholstery Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
