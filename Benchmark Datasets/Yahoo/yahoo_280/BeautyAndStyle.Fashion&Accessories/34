brands without logos ok i really like holister abercrombie etc but people treat me like really cool or something when i wear that kinda stuff i want people to think that i am cool because of the way i act not because of the bird or moose in the corner of my shirt does anybody know of any stores that have the same style of clothes but dont have the bird or moose in the corner you are awesome i work at hollister and i feel the same way about logos i don't really know of any stores that have the same look fit or quality but they do have clothes with logos on the bottom corner of the shirts so they are much less noticable you don't have to wear the shirts that say abercrombie across the front but you shouldn't have to compromise for the look or high quality by shopping somewhere else Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
