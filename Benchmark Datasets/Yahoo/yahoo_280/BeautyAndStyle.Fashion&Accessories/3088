which dress sounds the best which is better a long silky blue dress with a low v with beads around the low v part or a short black tie around the neck dress with ballet shoes or a strapless red and black polkadotted with black high heels dress with well the blue dress sounds good for a more fomal elegant event and the black short dress would be good for a cocktail party or something like that and the polkadotted dress sounds good for a fun day something thats more casual it really depends on what your going to do you can almost never go wrong with black it also depends on how old you are in my opinion if i was older i would not want to look like a women in a midlife crisis so i would probably go for the black dress but if i was younger i would wear the blue dress its a toss up between the blue and the black if you are just deciding what to buy for no special reason then think about which one you would actually wear more one may look better buy if you never wear it whats the point get them all lol Academic dress Black Ozzy Osbourne Black tie Polka Dot Door Yakko, Wakko, and Dot Canadian Armed Forces Suit (clothes) Shirt Paul Is Dead Undergarment Mess dress Teen Girl Squad Sally Brown Clerical clothing Kilt Purple Morning dress Evening dress Aloha shirt Death rock fashion Beachwear Skirt and dress Tour de France Recess (TV series) The Warriors Crow Nation Pysanka Nakoruru (Samurai Shodown) Academic dress of Oxford University Padm__ Amidala Clothing terminology "Weird Al" Yankovic Maillot jaune Dress shirt Pac-Man Irish dance Urusei Yatsura Redshirt (character) Tallit Scrubs Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters References to Star Trek Light-emitting diode Clothing Mary Poppins Buttocks Characters in the Smurfs Military uniform Polka The Smurfs Play School Negima The Adventures of Pete & Pete Dragon Booster Clown Beret Hijab Gimmick (professional wrestling) Happy Tree Friends Heavy metal fashion Japanese school uniform Pantyhose Doctor (Doctor Who) Arsenal F.C.
