i'm a crossdresser m f and i want to go out dressed up for the first time what should i wear i'll probably just go to the mall or to a movie or something it should be something not too flashy so you can get comfortable going out in an outfit designed for a woman avoid any tops that are meant to show cleavage i always think crossdressers look nice in tops that are sleeveless yet still don't reveal too much chest also i would go for a knee length sort of flowy skirt like those tiered prairie skirts stick with flats unless you really want to wear high heeled shoes and if you do decide to go for heels wear some nice wedge heeled sandals not those godawful pumps that just scream drag queen i'm glad you asked i always think the biggest mistake men make when they wear women's clothing is by dressing too outlandishly flashy with sequins and stiletto heels just to go to the mall have fun with your style Shoe Puma Athletic shoe Michael Jordan Shaolin Soccer Badminton High-heeled shoe Catgirl Converse (company) A__rospatiale Puma Holes (book) Condorcet method Poker jargon Axiom of choice Ford Puma The Island (2005 film) Adidas Jay-Z Mallard Orienteering Allen Iverson Adidas-Salomon Plough Microphone Fell running Pumapard Softball Yoshi D.C.
