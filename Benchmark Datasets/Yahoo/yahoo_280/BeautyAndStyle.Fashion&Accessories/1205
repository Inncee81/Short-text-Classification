what is the style in middle school now besides clothes i'm so what's the style for the first day of school i am wearing a jean skirt with whatever other shirt i'm going to be buying i bought a jean skirt from limited and then i bought other shirts from n m if ya know wat that store is i went to chesterfield mall one shirt is pink and orange with buttons then the other one is all pink with the buttons then i have a green one with really small white and yellow stripes which shirt should i wear with my jean skirt also what color nail polish should i wear with whatever shirt u guys choose and should i have my hair down or up or whatever i have brown hair that goes at the end of my buds brests also i'm going shopping at like gordmans next week cause we didn't have enough time at the mall to find all the clothes i needed but just choose out of the shirts i told u bout i think you should wear the pink and orange one because i really like pink honestly though in middle school there isn't one particular style that's in it all depends on which clique you're in really but hollister and ae and abercrombie are really popular even though i don't buy them by the way limited too is only cool in th and th grade once you enter middle school people don't really shop there anymore but since it's only a denim skirt it'll be okay i think a french manicure would look so cute with that outfit and wear your hair down The Warriors Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
