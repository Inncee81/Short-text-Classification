this is a weird question about style my neighbor is a guy he wears the men's swears from abercrombie and hollister and ruehl but he rolls them up do guys do that does that look gay or is considered gay we are besties and i know i could tell him anything so i need an answers pronto i mean sweats not swears lol i think you should tell him that it looks a little degrading to see an abercrombie sweat being rolled up if it was the hoodie or sweater it would be okay i suppose but if we are talking about pants here i would ask him to not roll them up no offence to your bestie though please don't let him take it harshly it just seems that if men roll up their sweat pants if it is it seems a little disturbing if it were sweat shirts i suppose it may pass but you should tell him not to roll up his sleeves unless he was reaching for something wet or didn't want to get them dirty while eating go and tell him but be discreet to not hurt his feelings good luck Mario Shirt The Warriors Tour de France Skinhead Color Rainbow Islands Paul Is Dead Rainbow flag Canadian Armed Forces Snooker Clothing terminology Diamond Color blindness Kimono HyperText Transfer Protocol Poker jargon Rainbow Kilt Suit (clothes) Rainbow Brite World Wide Web Boston Bruins Chibiusa Wheel of Fortune Colours, standards and guidons PHP Arsenal F.C.
