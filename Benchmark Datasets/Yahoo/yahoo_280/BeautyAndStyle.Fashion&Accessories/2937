why is it that when i go clothes shopping i've been going school clothes shopping lately and i dont showing skin or anything im so i have to shop in jrs but everywhere i look i see only 'preppy' clothes clothes that consist of basically nothing hot topic is my favorite store but i cant get all my clothes there since its kind of expensive but everywhere else the jeans barely come above your butt the shirts are either skin tight or wannabe maternity clothes every store carries the same exact things but i'm not a clone can anyone tell me why 'fashion' people make clothes that way why everyone thinks teenage girls have to look the same why do they think we want to look the same all the girls that do look the same at school are just bitches jessicababe i dont give a rats ass about style if you havent noticed you are the exact example of bitch i was talking about sorry everyone else and did anyone hear me say i was a how did she put it goth freako i like to shop at hot topic so that makes me goth thats nice did i say you're a preppy bitch because your profile is covered with abercrombie crap no blonde chick the above goes to you too they want to create a certain image for teens they are only sending the message that in order to be popular fit in and get the attention of boys they need to look a certain way once a certain store set a popular style the rest follow and thats why we find ourselves visiting different stores and finding the exact same clothing item i live in canada but for the last year yes a whole year the in craze was a tight lace trim tank one store sold it and it became very popular withing a month i found other store sellign the exact same tank it really annoying and if you don't dress the part people judge it's hard to live if you can't be yourself and this results in so many problems for teens the clothing company might not realize it but once teens start learning to dress a certain way to become cool they then change their whole attitude and get involved in so many problems like alchohol etc HTML element HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Identifier HTTP cookie World Wide Web Uniform Resource Locator Web server Transmission Control Protocol JavaServer Pages Cross site scripting Phishing HTML Representational State Transfer Proxy server Hyperlink Common Unix Printing System Mod python Ajax (programming) Geographic information system Domain Name System Common Gateway Interface Web application Cascading Style Sheets Character encodings in HTML PHP HTML scripting Slashdot trolling phenomena Secure Shell Gmail Wget Apache HTTP Server Milan AOL Instant Messenger Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Film XHTML Server-side scripting THX 1138 MIME Bookmarklet Anamorphic widescreen CPAN Filename extension Denial-of-service attack Virtual hosting Website Abdullah __calan XML Web browser ASCII art Kansas President of the United States Plain Old Documentation Google Web Accelerator Pow-wow 3D computer graphics Computer animation Computer De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter Transport Layer Security XMLHTTP Resident Evil (video game) Slash (punctuation) I2P Sega Saturn Die Another Day Arizona Melbourne High School Tariq Ali Drill bit Computer-generated imagery Mozilla Firefox Chu shogi Donna Summer Kimono Chun-Li Suit (clothes) Dundas Square Squid cache Kylie Minogue Java Servlet Universal Plug and Play The Bund Tokusatsu Resident Evil 2 Hawaii Markup language Stairway Electronic Data Interchange California Garfield Britpop Saab 900 Rockers IMG (business) Maria Sharapova Zeroconf High-heeled shoe
