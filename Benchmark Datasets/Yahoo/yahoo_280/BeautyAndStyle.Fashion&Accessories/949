tobymac's hat does anyone know what type of hat tobymac is wearing in his boomin music video i really like it and would like one but i don't know what kind it is any fancy name or wat it really depends on which hat you're referring to as he wears a couple different types of hats in this video at the very beginning it appears that he is wearing a visor beanie or maybe a cadet hat as for the other hat i e the one that he is wearing on the stage the closest that i could come to for it was a fedora or one of the smaller cowboy hats but they are still a little different that what is in the clip i couldn't find anything else that was as close the only other thing that i would suggest would be to go to tobymac's community forums that he has on his site and ask around there they may know more about it hope this helps sorry i couldn't be more specific good luck in your search Hat Toby McKeehan Fedora Core Headgear Fedora (hat) Beanie The Ashlee Simpson Show Have I Got News For You Undergarment Whose Line Is It Anyway?
