to college hi everyone i start college next week and still haven't bought my clothes anyway my question is to those who are in college what do most people carry their books in i don't got a lot of time between classes and i need something but wasn't sure if i should go with a regular backpack messenger bag or maybe a tote thanks don't buy a whole lot of clothes before you go to college if you're going to school out of state you'll probably discover a whole new style trend that you want to get in on or shopping can just be a fun way to bond with new friends the option of carrying your books is up to you its whatever you feel comfortable with i always carried a tote in high school but when i went to college i bought a backpack i ended up using it for about a week and then switched to a tote because it was what i was used to figure out how many books you have to carry around and figure it out based on that enjoy your freshman year Horst P.
