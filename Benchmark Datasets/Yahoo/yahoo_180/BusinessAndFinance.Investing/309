whats the best way to invest funds for a h s scholarship tax breaks type of account ect my daughter recently died and i want to use her savings and establish a scholarship fund in her name at her school i'm not sure what type of savings account to set up i would probably invest the money in bonds and maybe a mutual fund not sure what's the best way to do this i want the scholarship to last forever i'm so sorry your daughter died it's a wonderful idea to set up a fund to honor her memory so many kids will be able to benefit from that in years to come i think the best person to ask would be a lawyer because you have stipulations you say that you want the fund to last forever the best way to do that is to make sure the principal is protected and only the interest or gains are distributed then you could let relatives and friends and the public know that they can donate money to the fund in her memory and it will grow even larger a lawyer would be able to handle the tax questions about what you are doing also if you just donate the money to the school then you lose the power to make the money 'last forever' for this reason i think a lawyer is your best resource a competent tax attorney perhaps get recommendations from people in the school administration and town tread carefully and discuss fees before making any commitments Mutual fund Annuity Life insurance Trust (Law) USA Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporation 401(k) Social Security debate (United States) Mortgage Social Security (United States) Variable universal life insurance Microeconomics Bank Income trust Supply-side economics Student loan Pension Lawyer Hedge fund Tax Bond Education in the People's Republic of China Taxation in the United States Keynesian economics Flat tax Bretton Woods system Monetary and fiscal policy of Japan New Deal Deflation (economics) Open access United Kingdom corporation tax National Kidney Foundation Singapore Capital accumulation Reaganomics Minimum wage Health insurance FairTax Plame affair Hillary Rodham Clinton Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Gross domestic product Monetary policy Retirement plan Intellectual property Ponzi scheme Government debt Toronto-Dominion Bank Finance U.S. public debt Boston Public Public domain Economy of Russia Scholarship Tort reform Treasury security Primerica Financial Services Microcredit London mayoral election, 2004 Mergers and acquisitions New Hampshire Supreme Court Michael Milken Stock Capitalism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Warren Buffett Security (finance) SAT Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Affirmative action American Red Cross SCO-Linux controversies Investment bank Sun Myung Moon Anarchism and capitalism Food and Drug Administration Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Theory of conduct Software patent debate Registered Retirement Savings Plan Copyleft Nuclear power Money supply Institutional fund management Education in the United States Unemployment benefit Politics of Canada Coingate Marshall Plan Municipal bond Confidence trick Eliot Spitzer Citigroup Free trade Privatization Bank fraud National Savings and Investments Inflation
