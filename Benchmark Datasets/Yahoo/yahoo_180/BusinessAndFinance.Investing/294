future value question get your calculator i have a simple future value question so i thought if you put in a savings account at the beginning of each year for years how much will be in the account at the end of the th year the account earns i put n i pv pmt and got as the future value however this is wrong that will be the value on the first day of the th year so then i changed n to and subtracted the payment on the first day of the st year by doing this i got as the value at the end of the th year is my logic right by doing it this way is that going to be the value at the end of the th year thanks in advance i think your logic works and the correct answer is another way to calculate it would be to take the that you got for the value after the deposit at the beginning of year and multiply it by to account for the interest it will earn during the th year to verify i used a spreadsheet to calculate for each year column a has the value of column b for the previous year to account for the deposit at the beginning of the year and column b has the value of column a for the current year to account for the interest during the year in year column b has which seems to confirm that your logic and my logic above are both correct ways to calculate it what the first answerer actually calculated was the value at the end of the th year which is not what you want Annuity Mathematics Calculator Scientific method Intelligent design Binary numeral system Bond Personal finance CPU design Hamming code Physics Mathematician FairTax Logic Philosophy of science Philosophy of language Database Microeconomics Social Security (United States) Bayesian inference Elementary arithmetic Credit card The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything Computer Maya calendar Gross domestic product Napier's bones Plame affair Gaussian elimination Philosophy of mathematics Monty Hall problem Jeopardy!
