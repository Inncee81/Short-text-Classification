do i have to use the services of a broker to trade or buy funds why can't i just buy directly from the company first of all i don't really understand how do you define fund are you talking about mutual fund or a common stock of a company if you are talking about you want to buy shares directly from a company rather than a stockbroker than the answer is yes you may purchase companies's stock through stock transfer agent what is stock transfer agent basically companies that have publicly traded securities typically use transfer agents to keep track of the individuals and entities that own their stocks and bonds how can i find a stock transfer agent for the company i want to invest usually you can find a stock transfer agent under the company's website and it is usually under the investor relations section or contact us section why should i buy stocks from stock transfer agent rather than stock broker the beauty of buy a stock from stock transfer agent is you can invest as little as with a very little fee for example if you want to invest in jpmorgan chase but you don't have a couple of thousand dollars yet an initial cash investment can be as little as with a small fee to own a company stock another feature is you can reinvest the dividends to buy more shares free of charge usually also you can invest additional shares as little as annually at last you can buy and sell your shares freely through stock transfer agent or transfer your shares to any brokerage firm than sell it Stock Mutual fund Stock broker Citigroup Short selling Insurance Warren Buffett Mergers and acquisitions Investment bank Stock market Hedge fund Financial services Dividend Exchange-traded fund Day trading PE ratio Security (finance) Financial markets Corporation Finance Real estate broker NASDAQ Annuity Income trust Stock exchange Microeconomics Corporate finance Closed-end fund Temasek Holdings Foreign exchange market Enron Corporation Taxation in the United States Margin (finance) Gold as an investment Individual Savings Account Bank Eliot Spitzer Stock market index United Kingdom corporation tax American International Group Capital accumulation Mutual-fund scandal (2003) Mortgage Morgan Stanley Institutional fund management SCO-Linux controversies Sears Holdings Corporation Dot-com Microsoft ETrading Surplus value Advance fee fraud Berkshire Hathaway Financial analyst Venture capital Arbitrage American Express Debt Lloyd's of London Wall Street Crash of 1929 Monetary policy Variable universal life insurance Harken Energy Scandal Wells Fargo Coalition Provisional Authority Conglomerate (company) Primerica Financial Services Outsourcing The South Sea Company Tesco 401(k) Publicly funded medicine Insider trading Employee stock option Option Internet fraud Donald Trump Corporate governance Income statement Ameritrade Investment advisor Cost of capital Free market Bank of America Amazon.com Wal-Mart Best Buy Michael Milken Tax Life insurance Short (finance) Mad Money Federal Reserve JPMorgan Chase & Co.
