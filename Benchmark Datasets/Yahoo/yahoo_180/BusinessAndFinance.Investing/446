is it impossible for someone to sell shares of a stock unless someone buys those shares i e is there never a time that a stock share is never owned other than perhaps during its ipo if there is a time when a share isn't owned then who holds it the exchange also if all shares are owned at any one moment what causes the price to change i'm not talking generally like earnings and growth i mean literally and specifically what causes the share price to change i always thought it was based on the amount of money people had invested in the stock but if all shares are always held how does the share price fluctuate if it's a bid for a stock at a certain price and people have to be willing to sell at that price why can't a put in a bid for a certain price i'm not talking about a limit order why do i have to wait until the share price gets to the price i want it to be that's a limit order right who or how is this price set thanks i've been scratching my head about this for awhile yes stocks are always owned by somebody in the very begining all the shares were owned by the company supply and demand if you go to wal mart to buy a sony playstation but they don't have any in stock then you can cross the street and go to target and if the have some in stock they will increase the price this is exactly the reason why sony playstation cost exactly the same everywhere on the other hand if sony sell its sony playstation for usd perhaps most people won't be willing to pay such a high price the price is not set by sony but by the users themselves if they don't buy the thing they will force sony to drop the prices on the other hand a cell phone costs usd but if everybody wants to buy your cell phone then you can sell it for as much as and this is exactly what keeps the price of the apple iphone high the price is not set by apple but by the users themselves if they don't buy the thing they will force apple to drop the prices if you need a more detailed answer about supply and demand then you can contact me right now an apple share is about usd let's pretend you hold shares of apple you can place an order to sell shares of apple at usd each but nobody is going to buy them this case is exactly like in the real world if you sell cars and you price a toyota corolla for usd then nobody will buy from you you can buy the same car at another dealership millions of shareholders are selling their shares of apple as we speak at usd and why would you pay for something you can buy elsewhere for the reverse is also true you can place in your computer an order to buy shares of aaple at usd each but who will sell their shares at such a low price that would be like going to a mercedes benz and offer for a car they won't sell you the car at that price Stock Microeconomics Supply and demand Mutual fund Monopoly (game) Neopets Mergers and acquisitions Stock market Temasek Holdings MMORPG Wal-Mart PlayStation 3 PE ratio Capitalism IPod Warren Buffett Dividend Closed-end fund Asian financial crisis Short selling ITunes Music Store Gross domestic product Inflation Monetary policy Bond Microsoft Insurance Acorn Computers Airline Law of value Auction Foreign exchange market Economy of Russia Berkshire Hathaway Surplus value Day trading Citigroup Mac OS X PlayStation Portable Nintendo Tesco Digital photography SCO-Linux controversies Income trust Final Fantasy XI Dot-com Video game crash of 1983 Sega Apple Macintosh Exchange rate Google Steve Jobs RISC Hyperinflation Octopus card Corporation Keynesian economics Economy of India Ford Motor Company Internet fraud Best Buy Enron Corporation Gran Turismo (game) Apple Computer Intellectual property RuneScape economy Eircom Nintendo DS Corporate finance Supply-side economics Price discrimination Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Mikhail Khodorkovsky Bluetooth Gold as an investment PlayStation 2 Debt Atari Insider trading Just In Time Technical analysis Monopoly USB flash drive Gold standard NVIDIA Public transport Xbox 360 Taxation in the United States
