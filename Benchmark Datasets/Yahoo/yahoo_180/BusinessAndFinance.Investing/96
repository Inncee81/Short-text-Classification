investment question i recently asked a question on this site about investing in a pacific rim no load mutual fund some guy who hoped to be my investment adviser broker advised me to stay away from the aim china a fund the no one performing fund and advised me to invest instead in a colombia fund who under performed the market for two straight years he said he had a more holistic approach to investing i this guy for real to be fair to the guy the above is not entirely correct after exchanging a few emails i had to ask him about the aim china a fund he had never heard of it look simply having the best or year return doesnt make a fund good i am not aware of the funds specifically but as a general rule the advisor may have been doing you a favor how much of your total did you want to put into one fund how else were you allocated was the columbia fund also a pure china fund or did he diversify you internationally columbia may have underperformed for years but historically how did it do during bad times as well will it be more stable and help you hold onto any gains you make what exactly does he mean about holistic and what were your intentions with aim i would need a lot more to tell you exactly if i agree with him or you my point is he could have done the absolute right thing for you and been wrong in hindsite that some other fund did better that always how it works eventually over concentration and agression go against you ever hear of munder net net you could have had consecutive years of returns and still be at a loss today due to some horrific years for comparison say you wanted to put your life savings on the lions winning the superbowl at to is that the right thing to do say then after being talked out of it the lions go on to win the superbowl you missed out but did you do the right thing hindsight is beautiful and perfect for investing because every option can be played back and compared cheers Mutual fund Hedge fund Insurance Financial services Short selling Poker jargon Capitalism Volleyball Capital accumulation Theory of conduct Citigroup Institutional fund management Gross domestic product Economy of Russia Income trust Social rule Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Annuity Gold as an investment Avenue Q Life insurance Investment bank Social Security debate (United States) Microeconomics Keynesian economics Law of value CPU cache SCO-Linux controversies 1957 World Series Advance fee fraud PE ratio Warren Buffett Ra (board game) Anthroposophy Contract Eugene Fama Super Bowl Blood on the Tracks Table tennis Stock market Economy of Colombia Stock broker Exchange-traded fund Eliot Spitzer Organic farming Bond Globalization Free market Bank 401(k) Corporate governance Japan-United States relations New York Giants Derivative (finance) Cincinnati Bengals Free trade Cleveland Browns A Course In Miracles Mediation Goodness and value theory FairTax Ecology European Union Toronto-Dominion Bank Evil Deflation (economics) Closed-end fund Empire Burlesque Passive management Family Guy Trust (Law) USA Supply-side economics Charter school Modern portfolio theory History of Microsoft Windows Kasparov versus The World ELO rating system Security (finance) Norway national football team Legal status of Taiwan Supply and demand Bretton Woods system Intellectual property Bank fraud American Broadcasting Company Sheikh Abdullah Coercion Transformation problem Labour economics Plame affair Advertising Virtual memory Friends Temasek Holdings Bechtel Corporation Spice Girls The Ashlee Simpson Show Green Party of Canada Foreign policy of Japan
