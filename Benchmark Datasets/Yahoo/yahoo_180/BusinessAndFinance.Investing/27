is it a good time to start building houses right now the house market is falling i've been wanting to get into the house construction business for the last year but its taken me all this time just to save up the seed money i needed i want to build termite proof non wood homes in florida that look just like regular homes they would cost about more because of the materials are much more expensive than old fashioned wood steel studs concrete beams etc but from what i've heard the miami condo market is crashing with prices down to from just a year ago and naples florida homes are almost as bad land prices are still sky high and if i buy a parcel for mil develop it then find years later that the same land selling for only mil i'm sunk as no one will pay me back for the price i bought the land for and with about new homes and condos just sitting empty on the florida market and another planned to come online in the next years do you think it would be wise to sink my money into this venture thanks i can't think of a worse time to start building most contractors i know are loosing their shirts i think we have to years to go in this slump Donald Trump Gross domestic product Pacific, Missouri Carl G.
