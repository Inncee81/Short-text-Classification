how can i rent my stocks i have a large portfolio someone mentioned i can rent these out to options markets can you provide more info your friend is talking about writing options easiest exlanation is an example if you own shares of company xyz and it is currently selling at per share if this is a large enough company and people are interested in buying options on it what you do is write an option for someone else to buy shares of xyz at per share in december what this means is someone will buy this right from you if when december rolls around the company is selling at say per share this person will buy your shares off you for per share you essentially lost because you had to sell your shares at when they were worth but when the person bought this option off you they had to pay probably also remember that when you wrote the option the stock was at per share so the portion of the runup from to you keep so you really made also suppose the stock had stayed at when december rolled around the person who bought the option had the option to buy the stock at but since the market only charged they would not exercise the option they'd be out the they gave you when you wrote the option essentially you just made for doing nothing i hope that helps a bit but you'd better read up on writing options specifically i'd do a google search on covered call writing anyhow though you friend is talking about writing options this will get you some income over time but i personally have not found the technique very useful maybe you'll have more success at it Employee stock option Stock Option Finance Mutual fund Put option Call option Annuity Stock market Black-Scholes Monopoly (game) Warren Buffett Taxation in the United States Arbitrage Short selling Put-call parity Executive compensation Security (finance) PE ratio Citigroup Enron Corporation Bond 401(k) Insurance Berkshire Hathaway Margin (finance) Option style Capital accumulation Life insurance Dot-com Day trading Health insurance Financial markets Internet fraud IBM PC compatible Insider trading Corporation Capitalism Derivative (finance) Timeline of the Enron scandal Economic rent Futures contract Dividend Social rule Temasek Holdings Poker jargon United Kingdom corporation tax Corporate finance Warrant (finance) Closed-end fund Gross domestic product American individualist anarchism Atari Leasehold estate Open access Tesco Harken Energy Scandal Mergers and acquisitions Hedge fund Wall Street Crash of 1929 Fixed income Blackjack Fuzion Search engine optimization Privatization Estoppel Communication skill Stock broker Long-Term Capital Management Sears Holdings Corporation Tax Google Video game publisher Stock market index BitTorrent Neopets Institutional fund management Rational pricing Surplus value Leasing Housing cooperative Technical analysis O scale Money Blockbuster Video Advertising Xbox 360 Steve Jobs Property (ownership right) Eircom Frank Herbert Gold as an investment Corporate governance New Coke Financial services Anarchism and capitalism Conglomerate (company) Financial analyst
