how do you get your yr old to brush and floss help my thirteen yr old's gums are swollen and red from not flossing i'm tired of telling her to go do it but she just won't listen i'm frustrated because i don't want her to get gingivitis when she gets older well i don't really know what to tell you except i'm and i was like that the more my mom told me to brush and floss the less i wanted to do it but when she stopped bugging me about it i realised she was right and did it and as long as she doesn't congratulate me on my good decision i'll keep doing it the same goes for anything the more you tell her to do something the less she'll want to do it and for the answer above me that would not work for me i would get pissed and embarassed and would never brush my teeth just to show my mom that i hate what she did Gingivitis Oral hygiene Dental floss Tooth The Contender (television series) Dental caries Rent (musical) Eric Cartman Glossitis American and British English differences Shaggy dog story Halitosis Calvin and Hobbes Ben Johnson (athlete) Toothbrush Red Vs.
