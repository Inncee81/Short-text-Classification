new dentist first visit was abnormall short should i change i have not been to the dentist in years i just got insurance and picked a dentist in my town the practice was beautiful and seemed to have many patient i went into the exam room and right away the dentist came in sat me back and started scraping my teeth pretty rapidly it didnt seem as thorough as in the past with other dentists after about seconds of scraping he cleaned my teeth with the scrubber machine thing and it was over the hygenist took my xrays and i was dismissed no one asked me if i floss or smoke or drink pop or asked how i brush my teeth or talked to me at all it was over with in less than minutes i am a little turned off maybe my teeth are in really good shape but they have been my whole life so i dont understand why this time my exam was so short did i get jipped it is always hard to judge another professionals actions but when i see a new patient it almost always takes me about an hour first you want to fully review someones medical history take xrays if necessary clean the teeth if you can achieve this in one visit based on patient need discuss all aspects of the patient's homecare routine diets habits and then go over homecare and answer any questions or patient concerns this is the most important time to get to know a new patient and find out what their concerns and wishes might be i feel it is always the best time to make a change in a patient's oral health care routine as well maybe your teeth are in great shape but if you were on time for your appointment not hour late which would then cause you to interfere with another patient's appointment time than it sounds like you got short changed i would probably get your xrays and find a new practice ask friends and co workers for a recommendation if the first visit didn't leave you with a positive feeling i am not sure the subsequent ones will either hope that helps jamrdh a dental hygienist Dentistry Tooth Oral hygiene Prostate cancer Tooth enamel Dental caries Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dental brace The Dentist Medicine Milton H.
