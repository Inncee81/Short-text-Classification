i'm getting my wisdom teeth removed i'm getting my wisdom teeth removed because one is growing in sideways and hitting my back tooth the other are sticking out and are straight but the dentist says they also need to be removed because they could cause infection or take up to much room but anyways i was wondering how bad does it hurt i'm really scared i'm going to be sedated but i will still be awake is it scary how long will it hurt and whats it like in surgery please anybody who has or knows someone that has let me know how it was for you thank you so much everyone first don't sweat it i had mine taken out like last month and i really worried over nothing the nurses will make you feel really comfortable and it's a really short surgery the first day will be the worst although its not bad at all stick to soft foods like ice cream and applesauce be sure to not use a straw for about weeks also have a parent stop at the store and buy you a baby tooth brush this is my own tip and i found it to be a lot easier for brushing my teeth the next day the first day you can't brush your teeth other than that its really basic and you'll be fine the doctor has some anti biotics that you will be taking also and about during the surgery you won't remember anything good luck i know everything will be fine heck i even got through it without the pain medication they gave me Tooth Knife Wisdom teeth Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dentistry Surgery Prostate cancer Childbirth Milton H.
