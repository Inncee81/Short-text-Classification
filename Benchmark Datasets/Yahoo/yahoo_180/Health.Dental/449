when the dentist decides to do an extraction instead of a root canal i'm in terrible tooth pain since yesterday i'm waiting for my dentist to call me to go to his office i know that i need a root canal in that tooth but i feel that i must have an infection because the pain just spread all over my face isn't it better to extract the tooth he is going to kill the nerve in the root canal anyways when is better one instad of the other i hate toothaches i had two root canals by the time i was years old mostly due to braces both teeth were in the very back well if you don't want your teeth to shift and perhaps grow together crooked if you extract your teeth try not to have it extracted unless neccessary but it's up to you and your doctor what ever is safer to your health once he drills into the tooth only then can he tell the severity of it if the decay has completely engufled your teeth and nurves there is little hope left for it and an extraction is necessary to get the decay removed an infection can easily be cured with antibiotics Dentistry Dental caries Root canal Tooth Chronic fatigue syndrome Dental brace Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wisdom teeth Methamphetamine Tooth enamel Surgery Intact dilation and extraction The Dentist First aid Bruxism Domestic rabbit Anesthesia Orthodontics Drill bit Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Carpal tunnel syndrome Diarrhea Maxilla Mouth ulcer Crown (dentistry) Cocaine Medical prescription Tuberculosis Herpes simplex virus Stem cell Procrastination Gonorrhoea Pneumonia Sexually-transmitted infection Ebola Conjunctivitis Traditional Chinese medicine Hepatitis C Hydrogen peroxide Malaria Abortion Intravenous therapy Fecal incontinence Fancy rat Endocarditis Guinea pig Common cold The Two Doctors Traumatic brain injury Lead Eczema Gingivitis Oral sex Trigeminal nerve Breastfeeding Medical cannabis Shaggy dog story Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Antibiotic Otitis externa Local anesthesia Endometriosis Kuja Lupus erythematosus Skin of Evil (TNG episode) Cephalexin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) YuYu Hakusho Syphilis Perfume Smallpox Oral hygiene Milton H.
