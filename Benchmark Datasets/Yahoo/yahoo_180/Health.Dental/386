root canal molar is a crown needed i am having a root canal on my st molar which is being done by an endodontist my dentist feels that since my tooth is healthy that he will just fill it instead of placing a crown the reason for the root canal is complicated i am wondering should a tooth that is root canaled be crowned since it is a molar i had a root canal on one of my molars a couple years ago and now my dentist wants to put a cap on it as well my dentist was a little confused as to why the endodontist didn't cap it or whatever at the same time or why my dentist didn't do the cap i would think you would want a cap just to make sure your molar stays safe and doesn't break apart since there is no nerve to it there is no way for nutrients to get to it and stuff so it's vulnerable to bacterias and such so i had the root canal on my molar and the dentist that i have now wants to put a cap on it that's so that way the tooth doesn't deteriate however you spell that and break into pieces and what not it's a shield for your molar basically a dental crown is a tooth shaped cap that is placed over a tooth covering the tooth to restore its shape and size strength and or to improve its appearance the crowns when cemented into place fully encase the entire visible portion of a tooth that lies at and above the gum line why is a dental crown needed a dental crown may be needed in the following situations to protect a weak tooth for instance from decay from breaking or to hold together parts of a cracked tooth to restore an already broken tooth or a tooth that has been severely worn down to cover and support a tooth with a large filling when there isn't a lot of tooth left to hold a dental bridge in place to cover misshaped or severely discolored teeth to cover a dental implant Dental caries Tooth Tooth enamel Dentistry Dental brace Crown (dentistry) Root canal Maxilla Mandible Hangul Bruxism Dental fillings Dentures Wisdom teeth Poker jargon Chronic fatigue syndrome Orthodontics Oral hygiene The Dentist Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Seismic retrofit Temporal bone Dental implant Gingivitis Hand grenade Evidence of evolution Methamphetamine The Legend of Zelda series enemies Naruto jutsu Hat Non-native pronunciations of English Domestic rabbit Drill bit Cocaine Amalgam Oral sex Combine (Half-Life 2) Chewing gum Equine conformation First aid Medical prescription Raisin Manual transmission Aluminium Panama Canal The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap Headgear Plastic Eucalyptus Cosmetic dentistry Theory of conduct Nuclear weapon design Endocarditis Fecal incontinence Stem cell Final Fantasy magic Gastrointestinal tract Carpal tunnel syndrome Rail tracks Certified Nursing Assistant Desert Evolution of the Horse Xenomorph Breastfeeding Singlish Face Electrophysiology Leaf Sawfiler Autonomic nervous system Surgery Nine Inch Nails Mattress God Emperor of Dune Hitler's death Bong Dental floss Sampling (music) Professional wrestling holds Computer security Ceramics Pitaten Serpent Society Negima Dentition African American Vernacular English Scientology beliefs and practices CPU cache Tyrannosaurus rex Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Place of articulation Overkill (band) Mercury (element)
