enamel erosion problems please help also monroe piercing basically i went to the dentist yesterday and he told me i have enamel erosion he has given me special toothpaste to do something to the enamel i have left he said fizzy drinks have caused this i was wondering is this common how can i reduce the loss of enamel i know not drinking fizzy drinks but that is impossible for me also i heard when you have a monroe piercing the enamel gets damaged would it make a difference know that i have enamel erosion problems anyways as i am thinking of having it done plus is there treatment when i am older to replace the enamel thanks once you have eroded away your enamel this will have affected your bite also when you look at your back molars you will see a whitish outer layer with a yellower centre and they will look pretty flat the only way to correct this permanently is to do a full mouth reconstruction of your mouth i e crowns on all your back teeth and probably on the front ones too very expensive you really do need to stop drinking acidic things and avoid eating them too google drinks that eat teeth and acid erosion to find out about your condition the drinks that eat teeth site is a list of carbonated beverages and gives the ph level acidity just bear in mind that neutral the level that does no damage is there are some new toothpastes that can help to strengthen the enamel that you have left and i assume that that is what you were given such as sensodyne's pro namel or enamel care by arm and hammer or mi paste good luck with quitting the pop you now need to make it your mission in life to read the labels on everything you eat and drink and avoid those that have any form of acid close to the beginning of the ingredient list n b if you absolutely have to drink fizzy drinks chug them rather than sipping them or drink through a straw to help bypass your teeth the idea is to limit the number of times acid is in contact with your teeth Tooth enamel Dental caries Evidence of evolution Fluoride therapy Bruxism Soft drink Mouth ulcer Hydrochloric acid Halitosis Coeliac disease Plastic Hypoglycemia Japanese tea ceremony Insulin Sake Toothpaste Gramophone record Fecal incontinence Tetrapod Fluoride Dentistry Maxilla Body piercing Drill bit Sherbet Corrosion Tire First aid Methamphetamine Rebreather Folic acid Social rule American and British English differences Titanium Explosive material Breastfeeding Alcohol Alcoholic beverage Urinary incontinence Acne Erosion Microeconomics Evolution of the Horse Hamster Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Cheese Ecology Wisdom teeth Opportunity rover Nutrition Alcoholism Coca-Cola Veganism Hearing impairment Unreal Hiccup Guinness Hard water Leaf Motor oil Drowning Stuttering Theory of conduct Tooth development Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Spark plug Loudspeaker Acid Cocaine Aspartame Sugar substitute Omega-3 fatty acid Nine Inch Nails Infantilism Cider Transformer Garlic Shark Chocolate Wayne Corporation Radiation therapy Alcoholics Anonymous Internal ballistics Fancy rat Happy Tree Friends Anorexia nervosa GunBound Alzheimer's disease Dental fillings Star Trek Customizable Card Game Benzene L__gion d'honneur Hangul
