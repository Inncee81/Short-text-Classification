dental generational change i took my yr old son to the dentist a year and a half ago and had to put in three stainless crowns as well as a root canal under one of them today i took my year old in for what was supposed to be a preventative filling on a sugar bug a spot which looked like it might turn into a cavity she required a baby root canal a pulpectomy or something with sedation it'a been explained to me that kids' teeth explode into cavities once the surface is broken so i didn't give my younger one the gummie fruit snacks or the sticky candies my older one had i have not been great with brushing but it's a battle every day and the dentists tell you not to traumatize them yet get it done my question is why did we the parent now generation have fillings and not all this reparational work i had cavities by the time i was or so but i ate lots of candy and brushed like crap why are my kids needing root canals and crowns before they're is it flouride in the water and it's not just my kids two of my friends' kids have had or mors cavities in the last year that required sedation for filling thanks i guess i'm frustrated because the only crown i've had was because i got my first crown in my 's when i cracked a tooth on popcorn what is up my friends are all die hard kid brushers and we all go to different pediatric dentists to lemoncake if you come back it was phrased to me to keep the tooth we need to clean out the decay and crown it i believe that because apparently the decay was so bad one they got in there was not enough tooth to just fill eeek dentistry has changed dramatioacally with an emphasis on prevention but i think it is important to let your dentist know your concerns and what you as a parent consumer are willing to accept don't be afraid to decline services that may not be absolutely necessary you can always change to a dentist who is more supportive of your views and concerns i am sure most dentists are scrupulous but like all service professionals dentists are looking for every opportunity to increase billings that's just the truth it may be 'advised' to purchase a certain service but is it really necessary ask lots of questions and don't be satisfied unless you get answers that make sense to you be a smart consumer Tooth enamel Dentistry The Dentist Fluoride therapy Bulk vending Methamphetamine Oral hygiene Dental brace Crown (dentistry) Root canal Dental fillings Procrastination Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Medical prescription Gingivitis Economics Electrophysiology Bruxism Dental floss Empire Burlesque Microeconomics Breastfeeding Poker jargon Password G-Man (Half-Life) Wood Drill bit Humphrey Bogart 2000 Australian Grand Prix Casting Raisin Ex-gay National Health Service History of the British constitution Plame affair Dentures Discordianism The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Surveillance Craps Flood geology RuneScape cheats Medicine Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Kyle Broflovski Glen Jacobs Peter Griffin Last Exit to Springfield Traumatic brain injury Hangul Milton H.
