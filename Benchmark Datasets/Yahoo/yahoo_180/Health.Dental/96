i have wisdom teeth that came out crooked should i get them extracted tell me your experiences the crooked ones are the bottom another one came out perfect and the th one hasn't come out yet and i'm when i was in my early twenties i had both my wisdom teeth taken out at the bottom of my mouth i was terrified to be honest but i was sedated and frankly i went straight to sleep and had to be woken up they give another sedative to knock you out until way after the operation is over with they also numb your gums before extracting so pain is not felt at all during the procedure or indeed for a while afterwards you will be given painkillers and antibiotics too for maybe a week afterwards basically don't worry mine was a very comfortable and positive experience and my gums had to be cut to remove the teeth because they were severely tilting onto my other teeth please don't worry you will need someone to take you home afterwards though and probably will just sleep for a while afterwards too but on the other hand if you need your wisdom teeth extraction is a simple manner of just local numbing and extraction then that hurts a lot less and heals a lot quicker also straight growing wisdom teeth are apparently quite easy to remove if needed to be that's what my dentist said last time i saw him need the tops one done soon most importantly though the age of extraction varies wildly from person to person and frankly if they will only be removed if they are causing a problem and in some people they never have to be removed just because they are there does not automatically mean they are a problem or indeed that they need removing let your dentists advise you on this good luck Tooth Wisdom teeth Dentistry Manual transmission Breastfeeding Chronic fatigue syndrome Dental brace Bruxism Dental caries Carpal tunnel syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mouth ulcer Theory of conduct Domestic rabbit Oral sex Oral hygiene Diving Cocaine Anesthesia Certified Nursing Assistant Dentures Adjustable gastric band Dialysis First aid Diazepam Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic brain injury Final Fantasy magic Chlorpromazine Grief Halitosis Sleep Bondage (BDSM) Methamphetamine Drill bit Endocarditis Social rule Female genital cutting Perl Hangul Hypnosis Guinea pig Socrates Milton H.
