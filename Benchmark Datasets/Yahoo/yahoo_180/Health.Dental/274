dental financing i haven't been to a dentist in more than years so i'm not really sure how any of this works i know i'm going to need lots of work done i have teeth that are killing me so i've gotta go soon i just got dental insurance at the start of this year but everything is still very expensive compared to what i make also i can't understand what anything means on my benefits list since it's all in dental terms but that's a diff question altogether so what i really want to know is if i have to have all kinds of work done are they going to want payment the day i get it done or do most dentists let you do payments is there financing if so is it hard to get approved does the work need to come to over a certain amount i've been putting off going cause i'm afraid they're going to tell me i need to pay them like a thousand dollars and i don't have that in the bank thanks i don't know if he's unique but my dentist allows his patients to make payments i was in a situation similar to your's some time ago i discussed it with him and he was good enough to allow me to make payments based on my budget have you tried that discuss it with your dentist or the person in charge of billing and maybe they'll let you make payments based on your budget for the first visit you'll probably have to make a co payment standard insurance procedure but it won't be a thousand dollars if you're unclear about your benefits ask your dentist or the person in his her office in charge of billing they'll explain how everything works i haven't heard of this carecredit so i can't comment on it my dentist just sends out monthly bills until you're paid in full Insurance Health insurance Dentistry Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Microeconomics Publicly funded medicine Canada Health Act Annuity Money Social Security (United States) Unemployment Government debt Tax Health care in the United States Contract National Health Service Credit card United Kingdom corporation tax Gross domestic product Oral hygiene Medical malpractice Social Security debate (United States) Mortgage Primerica Financial Services Monetary policy Tooth enamel Bond Medicare (Canada) Student loan Medical prescription Deflation (economics) Economy of Russia Division of labour Article One of the United States Constitution The Dentist FairTax Gold standard Dental caries Legal tender Crown (dentistry) Unemployment benefit Bank Mutual fund PE ratio Dental brace Copyleft Advance fee fraud Trust (Law) USA Dentures Taxation in the United States National Insurance Ponzi scheme 401(k) Tooth Wal-Mart Poker jargon Hong Kong Monetary Authority Dental fillings U.S. public debt Employment in Hong Kong Non-native pronunciations of English James Randi Economy of India National Kidney Foundation Singapore Little Shop of Horrors Hyperinflation Reaganomics Singlish Medicare (United States) Goodness and value theory Keynesian economics Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Credit score George W.
