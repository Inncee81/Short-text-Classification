help on plantar warts i have some lesions on my heel that aren't painful but i have some on the side of my foot that hurt a lot when i walk is there anything i can do to relieve the pain i had plantar warts with deep roots i've had them since i was very young and they wouldn't go away for love nor money no matter what i did i got rid of them by putting salicytic acid stuff on it it was the kind that comes in a solid stick and has a very high percentage of it check the labels the higher the percentage the better follow label instructions if it says to put a band aid over it put duct tape band aids never stayed on my feet but duct tape did when the skin gets all white and dead sand it off with a stone foot sander this should make it go away there is also the freeze away stuff you can buy now and it's at home cryotherapy it works for a lot of people so try it too it didn't work for mine so what i had to do was instead of sanding it with the stone foot sander i had to cut the dead skin out with a penknife i have to say it hurt there were days when i couldn't walk but it freed me from warts even a dermatologist couldn't touch but only use this as a last resort the other ways out there should work just fine if you can't get it gone by yourself see a dermatologist i was desperate and stupid and i'm surprised i didn't get an infection or worse Wart Plantar wart Self Portrait Prostate cancer Acne Malignant melanoma Theory of conduct Blood on the Tracks Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Human papillomavirus Equine conformation Skateboarding trick Shaggy dog story Keloid Time Out of Mind Woodworking Duct tape EastEnders Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina High-heeled shoe Year of the Spider Genital wart Babe Ruth First aid Blonde on Blonde Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tattoo Milton H.
