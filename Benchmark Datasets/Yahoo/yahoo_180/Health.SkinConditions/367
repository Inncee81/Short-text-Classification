steam burn blister to pinkie lid fell off a whistling kettle while pouring hot water and burned pinkie not sore but large blisters that are still intact that are turning reddish burn occured last monday almost a week and i am not absorbing the water in the blisters what do i do as a nurse know not to break the blisters as it may cause infection and i have to go to work tues with intact blisters which will probably break at work will go to a walk in tomorrow but do you think it would be good to take some time off work to have them heal or just keep it dressed i guess if i can keep it dry with a dressing it should be okay just have some redness around the border of the blisters and they don't hurt just can't believe i have kept them intact so long having a shower camping and cottaging this week any suggestions thanks as a nurse are you saying that you're a nurse and you don't know the answer that is nervous making i had a blister last week and i just let it be despite a bandage it broke on its own i don't really see how that's avoidable if you have a job where you work with your hands and i am surprised your lasted as long as they did also it doesn't really seem like its breaking was so disastrous sure i'll probably have a scar there and i had to be very careful to avoid infection but call off work and go to a clinic that seems a little a lot extreme would your boss actually accept that as a reason for calling off because mine would either laugh his head off or cuss me out or both then tell me to haul it into work on time if i wanted to keep my job Herpes simplex virus EastEnders Sauna Social rule Hip fracture First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hiking Breastfeeding Babe Ruth Psoriasis Group A streptococcal infection Brewery Humphrey Bogart Three Stooges Stomach cancer Ulcer Customs and etiquette of Japan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Conjunctivitis Dialysis Theory of conduct YuYu Hakusho Tattoo Spontaneous human combustion Wound Shaggy dog story Eczema Prostate cancer Time Out of Mind Childbirth Ocean's Twelve Common cold Big Brother UK series 6 Traumatic brain injury Certified Nursing Assistant Wound healing phases Cellulitis Dobermann Textile manufacturing Body piercing Acne Professional wrestling match types Japanese tea ceremony Marilyn Monroe Campfire Yom Kippur War Team Fortress Classic The Shining (film) Gaia Online White phosphorus incendiary Billboard Hot 100 Eddie Guerrero Sin City Charmed Diving Extreme Programming Coffee Wildfire Hydrotherapy Glen Jacobs Jon Secada Swimming Jackass: The Movie Code: Lyoko USS Trigger (SS-237) Tuberculosis Johnny Cash Friends Spidey Super Stories Stone Cold Steve Austin Syphilis Mouth ulcer Domestic rabbit Tea Radiation therapy Cephalic disorder InuYasha (character) Treehouse of Horror V Sunburn Burning Man Good Times Escape from New York Good Morning, Vietnam Chronic fatigue syndrome Charles Darwin's illness Nico Robin Ebola Blood II: The Chosen 28 Days Later Chernobyl accident Insulin Clinical depression First aid kit Pinky and the Brain Eastern Front (World War II) Abortion
