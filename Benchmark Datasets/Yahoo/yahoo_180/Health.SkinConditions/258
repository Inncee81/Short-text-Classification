can someone explain this to me please i've been using neutrogena acne wash and a rough sponge to get rid of the acne on my back it wasn't working but i kept using it anyway because i thought it just took time i ran out of the solution so i decided to use shampoo and the sponge until i had a chance to get to the store after one shower of using shampoo to clean my back my acne cleared up a lot then just to experiment i used the neutrogena again and with just one shower i had really bad acne again why is it that something specialized for back acne is making my back worse and something as simple as shampoo is actually helping can someone just explain this to me please i'm glad i finally found something that works but i just need to know why the difference is that sometime acne soaps especially those that do not contain benzoil peroxide cover the skin with a silght film usually from the oils that are used to make the base of the soap this can actually keep the medicinal properties of the soap from penetrating the skin in order for it to be effective shampoo doesn't contain any of these base oils and it is more effective in stripping oils from the body and drying out the skin thats why you normally get that squeeky sound when your hair is really clean because all of the natural oils have been stripped there could also be a very slight chance that you are allergic to something contained in the soap even though most promise to be non allergenic Shampoo Acne Dandruff Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sento Allergy Tattoo Cleanser Scar Puberty Hair coloring Rosacea Skin Urinary incontinence Soap Menstrual cup Hay fever Washroom Moisturizer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Urticaria Fecal incontinence Hydrogen peroxide Wok Androgen insensitivity syndrome Organic peroxide Baldness treatments Wound Asthma Benzoyl peroxide First aid Ranma __ characters Car washing techniques Minoxidil Theory of conduct Hydrotherapy Manicure Aloe Leather Procter & Gamble Textile manufacturing Body piercing Patent medicine Sponge Social rule Transformer Soap opera Soap bubble Hair conditioner Senescence Japanese toilet Yarrow Disinfection Sterilization (microbiology) Multiple chemical sensitivity Explosive material Jessica Simpson Motor oil Stomach cancer Glycerin Carbon dioxide Blood Simple Massage Old wives' tale Plastic Isotretinoin Extreme Programming Drill bit Strap-on dildo Luminiferous aether Dishwashing Birth control Second Battle of the Atlantic Clothing Sulfuric acid Otitis externa Sebaceous gland Dry cleaning Earwax Tarantula Nudity Seborrhoeic dermatitis Solvent Water (molecule) Chocolate Vinegar The Dalek Invasion of Earth Blackjack Iron Perfume Piccolo Junior Saga M16 (rifle) Cruising (maritime) Dialysis Philosophy of space and time Knife
