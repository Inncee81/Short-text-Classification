psycho blister i have this really bad blister under my big and second toe it had a lot of dirt in it and i managed to pick some out and i but this band aid disinfectant on it it is extremely sore but doesn't really look infected i need to know what i should put on it to make it heal faster if you can please suggest something other than poroxide and alcohol because they both burn and i'm wimpy but if i absolutely must i would rather something burn for a few minutes than have my foot fall off thanks for your help you must have it cleaned first it would have been best not to pop it but what's done is done and now it must be cleaned try regular soap and water such as an antibacterial bar soap like dial hydrogen peroxide may help pull the loose material out first due to the bubbles but will hurt and may cause more damage depending on the severity of the wound nothing with really make it heal faster you can prevent it from healing slower by preventing bacterial infection with triple antibiotic neosporin or something the doctor can prescribe that isn't over the counter iodine will sterilize the immediate area but for long term a few day i'd say go with the neosporin then cover with a bandaid or guaze something clean and dry if you are worried about the cotton like part sticking first place telfa or the johnson and johnson oil covered non stick weave thing you'll see it in the first aid section i forget what it is called exactly great stuff though between the wound and the dressing most bandaids have a minimum amount of telfa on them already though change dressing and gently clean at least once daily don't pick at it take your vitamins First aid Tattoo Textile manufacturing Antiseptic Wound Acne Disinfection Psoriasis Bacteria Body piercing Halitosis Mouth ulcer Hydrogen peroxide Eczema Fecal incontinence Agar plate Contact lens Swimming Conjunctivitis Group A streptococcal infection Herpes simplex virus Otitis externa Weaving Earwax Common cold Violin First aid kit Hiking Soap Equine conformation Skin Naruto jutsu Sewage treatment Wound healing phases Tocopherol Mattress Earring Breastfeeding Escherichia coli O157:H7 Dry cleaning Anthrax Stomach cancer Cirrhosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Electrophysiology Ulcerative colitis Chronic fatigue syndrome Veganism Diarrhea Explosive material Shampoo Energy development Water (molecule) Folic acid Bone fracture Pneumonia Water purification Kitesurfing Skateboarding trick Fast bowling Fire extinguisher Time Out of Mind Diving Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Gramophone record Ulcer Cellulitis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Antibiotic Aloe Aerial (dance move) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fancy rat Piccolo Junior Saga GunBound Urinary incontinence Characters in the Smurfs Social rule Upholstery Textile manufacturing terminology EastEnders Gangrene Gonorrhoea Diving suit Acetic acid Nutrition Methamphetamine
