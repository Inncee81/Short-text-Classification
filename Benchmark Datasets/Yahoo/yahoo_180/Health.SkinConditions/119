best over the counter acne solutions a product you can just buy at walmart kmart walgreens or rite aid that wont burn a hole in your pocket but i've been looking at some of these ingredients and they're the icky kind like propylparaben fragrance propylene glycol disodium edta sodium laureth sulfate etc these things are bad for your skin but i dont know why they put them in there but if you could find a good product that will help clear my skin and not mess it up with chemicals like that it'd be great thank you i will be picking a best answer to be honest since you are a female i suggest that you attack acne from inside out since it is a skin condition any topical solution that you put on the surface of your skin will only control it and most times they don't work and acne will still appear and your money will be wasted on a product that won't entirely save your skin that is why i recommend that you take birth control pills the last time i bought acne medication was in january and it was the whole clinique skin solutions set and spent around this was after i was using proactive for about yrs and my acne still would come back every now and then the clinique set worked but the acne came back anyway i decided to talk to a dermatologist and she said that a cheap and effective way to treat my acne was by taking birth control because it regulates hormones the reason why teens break out because theirs are raging that was in march and by the second week my acne was practically gone i haven't had an out break since and my clinique collection was given to a male friend of mine i suggest that you try this because as long as you use creams they won't stop your face completely from getting an occasional break out and removing acne scars cosmetically is expensive Scar Psoriasis Puberty Tattoo Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Isotretinoin Shampoo Rosacea E number Androgen insensitivity syndrome Baldness treatments Cosmetics Hydrogen peroxide Sulfuric acid Eczema Skin Wal-Mart Glycerin Hydrochloric acid Minoxidil Dermatology Urinary incontinence Naval mine Poker jargon Fecal incontinence Moisturizer Propylene glycol Microeconomics Prostate cancer Friends The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Circumcision Cancer 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Scarification Malignant melanoma Social rule Medical prescription Ozone depletion Hormone Organic peroxide Animal testing Soap RuneScape quests Sewage treatment Hypertension Tocopherol Dialysis Birth control Retinol Asthma Alcoholic beverage Antiretroviral drug Homeopathy Ammonia Anabolic steroid Michel Foucault Condom Swimming Nutrition Meat Loaf Economy of the United States Hidradenitis suppurativa Health insurance Chocolate Sodium hydroxide Keloid Medical analysis of circumcision Pharmaceutical company Endometriosis Phenol Samurai Deeper Kyo Edible salt Fire extinguisher H2G2 Amineptine Outsourcing Breastfeeding Second Battle of the Atlantic Wound healing phases Comfrey Plastic surgery Taxi Driver Tofu Avenue Q Ice cream Childbirth Turmeric Mercury (element) Organic food Iron Plutonium
