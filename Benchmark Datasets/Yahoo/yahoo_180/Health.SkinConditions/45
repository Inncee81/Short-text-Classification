can u tell whether your face skin is oily or not i was just wondering because i notice that alot of the times my face seems like its kinda greasy and oily and kinda shiny b i like put my acne cream stuff on then it gets drier inwhich it looks alot better if this is true would a astrigent like sea breaze be a good method for drieng my face and clearing my acne if i consistently use it also ive heard alot of people say that sea breeze makes your skin redundantly dry if this is true should i use like a cream over it if so what kind if in the description of your skin you used the terms oily and greasy its a safe assumption that yes you have oily skin if you have questions about mixing anytype of medication including acme creams and astringents best bet is to talk to a dermatologist sometimes combining medications can make issues worse instead of better Acne Scar Dandruff Dermatology Eczema Malignant melanoma Cleanser Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ice cream Shaving Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sebaceous gland Cosmetics Printmaking Ethics Skin Rosacea Keloid Tattoo Rash Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Use of poison gas in World War I Origin of life Theodicy Razor Medicine Dairy Diving suit Oral sex Nitroglycerin Scabies Transsexuality Jewish cuisine Rich Mullins Poker jargon Many-worlds interpretation Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Amphetamine Hair Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Polycystic ovary syndrome Tofu Sampling (music) Intersex surgery Hamster Tocopherol Logic Astringent Butter Dialysis Human physiology Urinary incontinence Cliff Richard Allergy Adrenarche Illegal drug trade Moisturizer Manicure Lupus erythematosus The Ashlee Simpson Show Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Identity and change Charles Ives Retinol Potato Gambling Bayesian inference Puberty Hearing impairment Blacks and Mormonism Depilation Captain Beefheart Blackjack Welfare economics Probability Adoption Oreo Physical attractiveness Cake Sento Hamburger Black (people) Isotretinoin Betting (poker) Dead Sea Insurance Prostate cancer Lanolin G-Man (Half-Life) Epistemology Horse Scientology beliefs and practices Software engineering
