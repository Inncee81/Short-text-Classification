i know alavert is supposed to be non drowsy but i've been sleeping all day i swear every time i don't take it for my allergies which i've never had until this summer by the way i'm awake all day but when i do take it i sleep the whole day away and i'm a beast seriously it makes me mean it's like the equivalent of benadryl for me makes me tired and cranky i don't think i'll take it anymore because it doesn't seem to help me congestion but does anybody else have these problems alavert loratadine is chemically put together so that it would not make the average person drowsy however everyone is different so what might not make me drowsy might make you drowsy and vice versa as far as i know it is the only medication on the market claiming to be non drowsy so anything is possible you are the exception to the rule i truly hope this has been helpful to you good luck and god bless Hay fever Sleep Loratadine Siesta Common cold Insomnia Doxylamine Narcolepsy Cannabis (drug) Urinary incontinence Reflexology Clinical depression Social rule Antihistamine The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Daylight saving time Sedative Alcoholics Anonymous Hell Chronic fatigue syndrome Diazepam Clomipramine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Theory of conduct Anderson Cooper Philosophical skepticism Dualism (philosophy of mind) The Fairly OddParents Oh My Goddess!
