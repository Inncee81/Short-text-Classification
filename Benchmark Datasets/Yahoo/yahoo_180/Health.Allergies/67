what type of allergic reaction to milk is this called first off i've been allergic to milk ever since i was born i just never learned the exact type of allergic reaction i've had yet and i hear there are several the symptoms i experience very shortly after consuming any milk containing products whatsoever are pretty severe and take at least hours to subside and weaken my symptoms from drink milk are major heart pain added heart pain from each breath in my lungs foaming of the mouth a lot of foaming i have to spit it out for awhile strange feeling in my blood flow tenderness and burning in my throat the worst is definitely the heart pain though i have to sit still for awhile i breath very slowly so it doesn't hurt worse any sudden movements or breaths causes double the pain what's the reaction called nausea is another symptom half of the time it causes me to throw up when i was a kid though it was every time a lot of people don't know the difference between a dairy allergy and lactose intolerance if you were diagnosed with an allergy by a doctor then what you have is not lactose intolerance i'm lactose intolerant and what you've described sounds nothing like what i get an allergy is when your immune system mistakes something completely harmless for a dangerous invader and attacks it it's usually in response to a protein lactose intolerance on the other hand means that the digestive system does not produce enough of the enzyme that breaks down lactose which is the sugar naturally found in milk sugars and proteins are different the immune system and the digestive system are different the two conditions are totally unrelated to each other lactose intolerance can be treated easily a common way is by taking pills that contain the necessary enzyme i'm not an expert on allergy treatment but my understanding is that the best and most common treatment especially for food allergies requires avoiding the allergen lactose intolerance is the normal state of the human species not being lactose intolerant is caused by a genetic mutation that originated somewhere in europe which is why it's very common in white european people and much less common among other ethnic groups an allergy on the other hand is a malfunction caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system it is not the normal fully functioning state of the species are you sure that the pain you feel comes from your heart pain in the lower esophagus is often mistaken for heart pain which is why it's commonly referred to as heartburn even though it's actually caused by small amounts of acid from the stomach getting into the esophagus by accident i don't know much about the specific types of allergies so i'm afraid i can't answer your actual question but the constant uninformed misinformation people spread about dairy allergies and lactose intolerance annoys me so at very least i've set the record straight on that Hay fever Psoriasis Hypoglycemia Biochemistry First aid Cheese Multiple chemical sensitivity Pneumonia Prostate cancer Aspartame Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Urinary incontinence Lac operon Vegetarianism Nutrition Atherosclerosis Cirrhosis Diabetes mellitus Soy milk Heartburn Traumatic brain injury Food Immune system Medicine Dairy Ulcerative colitis Yoghurt Conjunctivitis Stroke Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chocolate Tooth Sugar Helicobacter pylori Veganism Clomipramine Paracetamol Angioedema Decompression sickness Immunoglobulin E Guinea pig Rheumatoid arthritis Malaria Eczema Endometriosis HIV test Group A streptococcal infection Multiple sclerosis AIDS reappraisal Panic attack Anemia Cystic fibrosis Mouth ulcer Antiretroviral drug Controversies in autism Peanut Anxiety Insomnia Lactobacillus acidophilus Flatulence Raw milk Mast cell Gastroparesis Vitamin C DNA repair Charles Darwin's illness Herpes simplex virus Cocaine Cell (biology) Spider Common cold Bipolar disorder Leukemia Shock Tocopherol Drowning Glycogen storage disease type I
