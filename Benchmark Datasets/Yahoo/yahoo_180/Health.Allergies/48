bad allergies contact lenses i'm thinking of getting some theatrical lenses but i have really bad allergies to just about everything the pills stop most of the problems but sometimes my eyes get really itchy and runny do you think it'd be okay to wear lenses when my eyes are okay or would it just make everything worse thanks i experiance some of the same problems but it seems that the fresher is the best way to wear my lenses but also i've noticed that during high allergy season that my contacts start to lift from my eye it's an allergic reaction to the air and debris on my lenses i'm not an optrician or anything but it seems to me that those rewetting drops and stuff do not really do their job and it actually seems to irritate my eyes more but if it gets too bad you could always just wear ur spectacles if u got them Allergy Hay fever Conjunctivitis Contact lens Keratoconus Sunglasses Eczema Latex allergy Asthma Multiple chemical sensitivity Food allergy The Caves of Androzani Intraocular lens Eyepiece Volleyball IMAX Eye Tattoo Mast cell Myopia Hypersensitivity Invader Zim Immunoglobulin E Social rule Stuttering Psoriasis Apollo 8 Coeliac disease Floater Optometry Lens (optics) Sun Eyeglass prescription Telescope Apollo 15 Newcastle United F.C.
