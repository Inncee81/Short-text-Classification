keeping a bowl clean there are a few things i was wondering about water changes and stuff for my beta fish bowl first of all will changing all of the water in a bowl kill my betta fish secondly i have little rocks at the bottom of my bowl i'm just missing a fish now p how do i keep them clean i was planning to pour them out into a sand flour sifter and washing them with tap water but that would require dumping all the water in the tank out as well making partial water changes impossible which is why i ask thanks for the help water change are needed if you don't have a filter i do water changes on mine all the time and they're just fine right now i have males i do exactly how you said you will with a sifter so all the poop is shaken out just be sure the new water i treated and the same temp as the old water i suggest doing this twice a week if you have a bowl gallon or under or once a week if it's gallons i must point out though that bettas are tropical fish and will survive in a bowl at room temp but will only thrive in heated water f is good if the bowl is at least gallons i don't really suggest anything smaller they do not live in puddles you can get a watt heater if smaller a light would work but i don't like lights because they create temp fluctuations when you turn them off at night whihc you need to do the best environment is a gallon tank with a filter and heater Aquarium Marine aquarium Autonomous building Brewery Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fossil fuel power plant Sewage treatment Dry cleaning Coffee Reef tank Thermal power station Houseplant Bong Carburetor Fish farming Solar power Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Cruising (maritime) Biodiesel Customs and etiquette of Japan E85 Dairy Apollo 13 Tank Ocean thermal energy conversion Temperature Textile manufacturing Goldfish Opportunity rover Japanese tea ceremony Environmental concerns with electricity generation Second Battle of El Alamein Cannabis cultivation Sauna Water Sea-Monkey Nuclear fallout Glass Solar panel Casting Samovar Wind turbine Water heater Phase (matter) Flush toilet USS Tunny (SS-282) Dishwasher Diesel engine Fire fighting First Battle of the Atlantic Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Disaster Toyota Prius Rum Renewable energy Home repair Shrimp farm Transformer Glossary of nautical terms Derbyshire lead mining history Sento Dialysis Hydrogen economy Domestic water system RuneScape skills Electrophysiology Seismic retrofit Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Motor oil Dam Mining Wind power The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Orlando, Florida Potomac River Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Soap bubble Fire extinguisher Campfire Water resources HVAC Mars Exploration Rover Tea USS Thresher (SS-200) Thermal depolymerization Bottlenose Dolphin Light-emitting diode Third Battle of Gaza Three Mile Island Sponge The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Fountain Compost Glacier Gowanus Canal Dredge Rice Imperial stormtrooper
