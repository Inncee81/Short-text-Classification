do i have to treat the water in my teired fountain if i want to put coi and shabunkins i have large five or teired fountain and i bought six small coi some large goldfish and like a dozen large shabunkins and tossed them in its been one week and a few goldfish have died but most are seeming to thrive should i be treating the water well you have more than enough mechanical filtration the water falling off each tier will add oxygen into the water and keep the water from becoming stagnent you should however add dechlorinator to it although if it has been running for awhile befor you added the fish most of the chlorine should have evaporated out of the water do you know how many gallons are in it is it possible to add carbon filtration to it goldfish produce a lot of waste and that amonia will build up in in effect suffocate the fish in thier own waste carbon filtration will help remove some of that waste and once it cycles just like any body of water with livestock in it bacteria in the water will also help break down the massive ammounts of waste produced by goldfish Sewage treatment Aquarium Brewery Goldfish Marine aquarium Water purification Fountain Carbon dioxide Photosynthesis Dry cleaning Dishwasher Energy development Sea-Monkey Wood pulp Chlorine Fossil fuel power plant Filtration Anaerobic digestion Water pollution Eutrophication Water Homeostasis Environmental concerns with electricity generation Alkane Hydrogen Haloalkane Sugar Ozone Hydrogen economy Carbon dioxide sink Biochemistry Dundas Square Ozone depletion Permian-Triassic extinction event Acetic acid Gasoline Blood Thermal depolymerization Dairy Wine making Industrial wastewater treatment Terraforming Casting Water garden Ozone hole Renewable energy Fire fighting Bacteria Chlorination Alternative biochemistry Vermicompost Ozone layer Rebreather Nuclear power Factory farming Weathering Hard water Cryptosporidium Kidney Swimming pool Town gas Environmental engineering Cellular respiration Pebble bed reactor Disinfection Waste management Fire extinguisher Sodium carbonate Acid mine drainage Sulfuric acid Honey Hemoglobin Acne Autonomous building Bong Carnivorous plant Alcohol fuel Insulin Carbon cycle Compost Lake Redox Iron Circulatory system Fish farming Water supply Renal physiology Agricultural wastewater treatment Biodiesel Gas mask Hydrogen sulfide Biogeochemical cycle Carburetor Omega-3 fatty acid Nutrition Beer
