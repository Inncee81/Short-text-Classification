how do fish drown a fish can drown under two scenario firstly when there isn't enough dissolved oxygen do in the tank water as someone mentioned in a tank that have it's water heated either due to a pump or filter in the water or due to environmental factor will have the do in the water dramatically reduced this could cause the fishes in the water to gasp and eventually drown another scenario would be if something is preventing the fish from breathing properly eg would be a shark caught in a drift net some sharks need to swim to force water through it gills so that it can breath not being able to swim would cause it to drown another example would be a goldfish having a pebble stuck in it's mouth with the ability to gulp water and force it through it gills it'll also drown eventually air breathing fish like betta and some cory species need to access air pocket above the water to breath if the fish is kept in a bag of water without air pocket the fish might suffer serious distress i doubt they'll die in the short term but they might not do too well in the long term so fish do drown Drowning Rebreather Swimming pool Fish farming Swimming Aquarium Tetrapod Shark Fishing Sewage treatment Carbon dioxide Fish Hyperthermia Lake Burley Griffin Scuba set Orca Krill Scuba diving Jellyfish Gas bladder Firefighter Brewery Angling Hydroponics Diving Lung Great Lakes Coconut crab Ecco the Dolphin Whale Goldfish Whale shark Suicide methods Aquatic ape hypothesis Pulmonary alveolus Glossary of firefighting equipment Decompression sickness Sea-Monkey Gar Atlantic herring Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Tooth Waterworld Carnivorous plant Marine aquarium Batoidea Jaws (film) Water Lifeguard Autonomous building Siphon Octopus Chesapeake Bay Bottlenose Dolphin Biodiesel Pebble bed reactor Hypothermia Hydrogen sulfide Solar power Salmon Asthma Great White Shark Humpback Whale Personal flotation device Eutrophication Stingray Cetacea Sawfish (fish) Pikmin Carburetor Reptile Diver rescue Hiccup Gill First aid Front crawl Fugu Fuel injection Energy development Water (molecule) Shrimp farm Scramjet Bladderwort Water purification Nile crocodile Oxygen sensor Thermal power station Nuclear power The Legend of Zelda series races Dwarf gourami Backstroke Corrosion Tank Liquid breathing
