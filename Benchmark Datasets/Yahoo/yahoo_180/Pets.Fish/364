my golfish isnt eating well and has some black stuff on the end of his tail hey whenever i try to feed my golfish flake food he either eats it and digests it which is fine or he'll eat it start doing this wierd thing with his mouth then he'll throw it up again what else should i feed him also i just noticed that theres some black stuff right at the end of my goldfish and its not trailing crap because i know about that can anyone tell me what this it doesnt look like something that can come off just like its embedded into the tail like a design or something thanks in advance with all of that eating and regurgitation i am willing to bet that there is some waste built up in your tank just to be safe you should test for ammonia nitrite and nitrate if these come back at zero or close to it then i wouldn't worry about your fish too much if any of those three are high you need to siphon out your tank more often and go light on the food the black that you see could be genetic a fungus or chlorine ammonia burns i am leaning towards genetics until you tell me your test results Sewage treatment Marine aquarium Ammonia Biogeochemical cycle Goldfish E number Cat Fish farming Siphon Vomiting Ant Animal Aluminium Hydrogen economy Nitrogen Autonomous building Fugu Sea-Monkey Hamster Snake Craps Food preservation Aquarium Genetically modified food Eutrophication Insulin Flush toilet Carnivorous plant Mosquito Internal ballistics 1919 World Series Poison Cyanide Shark Reef tank Nitric acid Red Hot Catholic Love Factory farming Nutrition Hydrogen sulfide Food Explosive material Discus (fish) Soil life Shaggy dog story Fungus Organic farming Dry cleaning Digestion Koi Silver Sodium nitrite Termite Philip J.
