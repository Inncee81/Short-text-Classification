how long does it take for fish tank water to be dechlorinised if i am not going to use a dechlorinizer how long should i leave in order to make sure that it is safe for the fishes like hours for example allowing water to sit out only allows for the chlorine to evaporate there are other chemicals in the water such as chloramine that do not evaporate and need dechlorinators added to neutralize them so you need to let water sit for about hours to allow chlorine to evaporate but if you want your water safe you need to use a dechlorinator Sewage treatment Chlorination Polychlorinated biphenyl Water purification Chlorine Swimming pool Ammonia Sodium hypochlorite Wood pulp Hydrochloric acid Sea-Monkey Sodium chloride Evaporation Smoke-screen Brewery Axolotl Water supply Haloalkane Chemical warfare Bromine Mercury (element) Solvent Apollo 13 Bleach Instant coffee Air conditioning Water Hydrogen chloride Dry cleaning Hydrogen peroxide Dead Sea Titanium Dairy Phosphorus chlorides Swimming Incandescent light bulb Sauna Thermal power station Water resources Hyperthermia Ethylene glycol Alum Autonomous building Alkane USS Thresher (SS-200) Hydrogen Alcohol Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite Lake Rebreather Use of poison gas in World War I Aral Sea Sodium hydroxide Decaffeination Mineral Fugu Fountain Sugar beet Myxobolus cerebralis Trichloroethylene Edible salt Ethylene John Dalton Sandworm (Dune) Fossil fuel power plant Gilding Bottled water Textile manufacturing Concrete Motorcycle Perfume Neutrino Cookware and bakeware Ozone depletion Bathing Tetrachloroethylene Watercooling Kosher foods Ethidium bromide Warm-blooded Marine aquarium Mississauga, Ontario Explosive material Aquarium Desert USS Tunny (SS-282) Ozone layer Shoe polish Coffee Helium Phosgene Asthma Twelve leverage points Perchlorate SS Andrea Doria Fish Ozone hole Stock car (rail) Drip irrigation
