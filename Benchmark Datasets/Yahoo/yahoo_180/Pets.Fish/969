where can i find a page about betta splendens siamese fighting fish where i can learn how to tell the gender i first got a male betta no doubt about that then i got two females or at least what i think are females that's the problem one of the females could possibly be a male with short fins i think all was fine at first and then the male started looking run down i thought he'd had to much problems with the women and he did look better after a couple of days i've been busy and i haven't had time to look after them properly for a couple of days and the other day i found him really beat up i moved him to a bowl of his own and he seemed to get better then he died sigh i think one of the females is the cause of it all and now i'm not so sure that it is a female she's dominant aggressive and she has larger fins than the other female she also has much more color i've read a bout the betta males with short fins didn't know they existed before and now i'm wondering if the woman that sold me the females could have messed it all up i'll add more soon running out of space i've done a google search and found pics that illustrates what i'm talking about this is what the female looks like http www anselm edu homepage llaplante home images betta g jpg and this is more of what the one i'm wondering looks like http www siamsbestbettas com images betta jpg i know they are breeding females with more male qualities and colors but i don't think they'd sell them like just any other female it's sunday and i'm stuck waiting for monday so i figured i'd try to find out as much as possible by myself before i bring it up with the woman that sold them to me i've already been to the wiki and it gave me no information about the issue that i asked about some males does not have large fins and some females dose look like short finned males i need to know how to tell them apart i guess i could make this clearer this is what the female looks like http www anselm edu homepage llaplante home images betta g jpg no doubt that she's a female this is what the female that i'm wondering about looks like http www siamsbestbettas com images betta jpg this one was sold to us as a female and we never doubted it she's more colorful and has larger fins than the other female but we also know that they can become very colorful and she's the dominant one after reading about males with short fins i'm not so sure that she is really a she and i want to find a way to make sure the pics are from the internet and it's not really my betta's they only look the same and i use the pics to illustrate what i mean wooha i found the answer to my own question thanks to vicky w that gave me the name for short tails plakat i kept searching and this is what i found if anyone is interested that is females will also have an egg spot aka the ovipositor tube the egg spot is a good way to identify a female and tell her apart from a young male the egg spot is a white dot located near the base of the ventrals it is from this egg spot that eggs will be released by the female during spawning my suspect does not have an egg spot so she is a he no doubt i understand that it was an easy mistake for the woman that sold them to me to make but i still have to have a talk to her about her saying that we could keep them together females for male she said since the male will hunt only female to death nothing about not keeping them together all the time grrr thank you all for the help that second picture does look like a plakat short finned male some of the time when breeding halfmoon bettas or any other kind i suppose they may have a grandparent or even a great grandparent that was plakat so sometimes when they have babies you might get one or two that look just like all the females but are actually short finned males sometimes they are accidentally sold as females my point is yes i think your female was probably a plakat male but i do not think that whoever you got the fish from did it on purpose i would definitely talk to her but keep in mind that it was probably unintentional very sorry about your loss though best of luck in the future Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) World Wide Web Social rule Uniform Resource Locator Spider Theory of conduct Ontological argument Domain Name System EastEnders PNG CPU cache Opportunity rover Roswell UFO incident Whose Line Is It Anyway?
