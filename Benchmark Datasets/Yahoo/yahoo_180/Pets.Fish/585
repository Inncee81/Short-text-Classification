two part filter question the instructions on my filter says that i should replace the filter cartridge every four weeks i thought bacteria were supposed to develope in the filter so how can they if i replace the cartridge monthly the other day i fished something out the aquarium with my hand just then i realized that i had just washed them with anti bacterial soap can this act kill off the bacteria i am trying to grow spt you are right actually when you say it's supposed to develop there if you look at the different type of filters out there not sure what one you have but i like aquaclears myself they have three components to it the sponge activated carbon and bio max on the top i've found with these type of filters most of your beneficial bacteria grows in the sponge itself this makes sense from a different point of view if you think about it the sponge itself filters mechanically and strains out physical food and fish waste and that would be the point of ammonia introduction through the filter and also why you have some in your gravel as well bacteria like any other living organism will establish itself near food fuel source manufactuer's benefit if you replace parts sooner then needed and their motivation is pretty clear on that money it's really not necessary to replace your sponge or bio max components or whatever bacteria media you have as often as they say then you do have bio wheel type filters which you really don't want to replace at all there are also wet dry and cannister filters which work a little different but i'd assume you either have a component or bio wheel and you just ignore the manufacter instructions as far as replacing goes in fact when you do clean out your sponge portion use a bucket of the tank water you are replacing and that will help you retain somewhat your bacteria anti bacterial soap in theory would yes destroy some of that you have other bacterias some unwanted in your tank just having it on your hands technically would kill off some but most likely not nearly enough to effect the overall operation of your biological filtration now if you pour an entire dose of soap yeah it would but the soap itself in the tank would pose a much greater danger and kill the fish long before your bacteria dying would come into play if you need better answers and service check out fishless cyling com or just use the link on my profile jv Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Water purification Bacteria Aquarium Dry cleaning Agar plate Foodborne illness Brewery Biology Anthrax Dairy Common cold Tank Motor oil Compost Reef tank Carbon dioxide Car washing techniques Menstrual cup Many-worlds interpretation Ultraviolet Energy development Sterilization (microbiology) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Microeconomics Sake Cell (biology) Slow sand filter bed Sponge Autonomous building Tooth enamel Biodiesel Biodiversity Dishwasher Helicobacter pylori Bread Acne Renewable energy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Omega-3 fatty acid SpongeBob SquarePants Fossil fuel power plant Water Fish farming Hemp Modchip Soap Dialysis Water pollution Lac operon Anaerobic digestion Carnivorous plant Bong Ecology Motivation Flagellum Thermal power station Intelligent design Food preservation Hydraulic machinery Eutrophication Vermicompost Cyanide Coffee Yoghurt Hydrogen economy Hamster Vaccine Photosynthesis Disinfection Plastic Sugar Sea-Monkey Textile manufacturing Life Biochemistry Hybrid vehicle Biological pest control Political economy Liquid crystal Toilet paper Specified complexity Rebreather Flood geology Anti-Mormonism Menstrual cycle Theory of conduct CPU cache Irrigation
