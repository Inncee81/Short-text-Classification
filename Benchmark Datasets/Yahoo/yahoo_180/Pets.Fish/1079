saltwater tank im starting a salt water tank gallons i would like to know what things i need to purchase and how to keep the tank running smoothly please give me as much information on salt water tanks as possible as much as possible may be more than your bargained for i see you've already decided on a good sized tank so i won't go into those but here's a listing of other items you should get and some optional items that may make the tank maintenance a little easier filter you'll need to get one that's properly sized filters x x the tank volume per hour there are lots of choices and what you'll need will really depend on budget what you're trying to keep and personal preference i'd consider the best to be a refugium or wet dry trickle filter next best would be a canister followed by a biowheel then a standard hang on tank unless you're using a fine sand or oolite substrate you can also use an undergravel filter to supplement filtration but i'd suggest powering it with a reversible powerhead to blow the water up through the substrate prevents stuff from building up under the filter and clogging it if the tank is predrilled for an overflow the refugium or wet dry are what it's set up for but you can also do an over the rim for this because of the length of this sized tank if it's not predrilled you might want to use two hang on filters to make the distance from the filter to any point in the tank at less powerhead s to provide more water circulation in hard to get to places this also helps circulate dissolved oxygen to the bottom of the tank heaters for a saltwater tank i'd suggest getting and putting one on each end this will provide more even heating and your tank has a back up if one gives out figure the correct size as watts per gallon divided by heaters if you need to heat the water more than degrees above the room temperature go one size higher also plan on thermometers to position in the tank to check the temperature lighting if you never want anything but fish you can use the standard lighting and hood made for your tank you might want to upgrade the lamps to a k tube or a actinic if you're going to try corals anemones etc go with a compact fluorescent metal halide or combo system these will provide more intense light that they'll need for photosynthesis substrate you want something made of aragonite to help keep the ph from changing i like the smaller shell material that carib sea puts out it doesn't have to be live sand either some folks like crushed coral but the particle size is bigger than i like and it tends to have a lot of dust that never rinses completely out another very fine grained material is oolitic aragonite looks like small white balls and aragonite sand here's an idea of the materials available http www caribsea com pages products dry aragonite html while it's possible to keep a marine tank with regular aquarium gravel or no substrate the aragonite will keep the ph from falling below it should be figure at least a pound of substrate per gallon of volume salt mix if you're only keeping fish you can go with one of the less expensive brands of synthetic sea salt if you get any invertebrates shrimp snails crabs corals anemones etc switch to a better quality mix before you add them these cost a little more but you won't need to be using additives for the trace elements they need either hydrometer this measures the amount of salt that's dissolved inwater there are two kinds you can get one made of glass that floats on the surface more accurate but easy to break and a plastic container that has a needle that rises and falls as the amount of salt changes less accurate bubbles attaching to the needle gives false readings for fish only you want the specific gravity to read if you're keeping inverts you want it to be water testing kit minimum of ph ammonia nitrite nitrate cleaning supplies elbow length gloves gravel vacuum gallon bucket large plastic container and powerhead for mixing the salt to be done well ahead of water changes algae scraper razor blades for coraline algae and diatoms that like to attach to the glass water conditioner for removing chlorine or chloramine from your tap water unless you plan to use a reverse osmosis filter or buy ro water the following are optional but strongly suggested protein skimmer this removes dissloved and small organic materials that would normally contribute to the ammonia nitrite and nitrate in your tank not necessay for fish only tanks but will be handy if you have inverts to keep up good water quality by removing organic materials that become nutrients for algae glass cover this reduces evaporation and keeps the fish inside the tank although with a metal halide lighting system it can overheat your tank live rock this give the tank a more natural appearance provides hiding places for the fish and inverts and increases the biological filtration not to mention you get all kinds of cool critters that hitchhike into your tank you should purchase pound of pacific origin or to pounds of atlantic or carribean origin rock per gallon of tank volume the difference is that the pacific origin rock is more porous so it provides more surface area for the nitrifying bacteria to colonize so you can use less but still get the same amount of biological filtration chiller if you use metal halide lighting or the water temperature regularly gets above o for corals or anemones fish can take a little more heat you may need to invest in a chiller to keep the tank cool the water temperature should run of i'd also recommend a good reference book for saltwater tanks either of these would be a good one to start with the new marine aquarium by michael s paletta microcosm ltd isbn or the conscientious marine aquarist by robert m fenner microcosm ltd isbn some web sites you can check out for more info on keeping saltwater are the following http www peteducation com index cfm cls very basics http www
