livebearer fry tropical fish i have platy fry and guppy fry in my breeding box and i am just wondering if this will have any affect on the growth of the fry the tank is set up at degrees celcius and the fry do have plenty of space i have also noticed that the same platy looks pregnant again is this possible thanks danny could you tel me if this will have any difference on the growth of the fry and how long until they get mature enough so i can release them into the main tank personally i don't use these breeders instead i have a well planted tank where the fry can hide and usually of them always survive because they hide from the other fish i tried both methods and noticed that fry who grow up in the main tank grow much faster then the ones in a breeder if you have them in a breeder it takes usually about for guppies to be big enough and weeks for platy to be big enough to release the main rule on that is they need to be bigger then the biggest mouth of your fish in the tank not to be eaten hope that helps good luck eb Live-bearing aquarium fish Discus (fish) Goldfish Fish farming Sailfin Molly Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Tilapia Norman Borlaug Hamster Cuisine of Denmark Gray Wolf Hemp Fugu Southern platyfish Clownfish Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Cuisine of Malaysia Philip J.
