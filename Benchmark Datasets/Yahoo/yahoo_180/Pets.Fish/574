question about cycling i just asked a question a bit ago about fish recommendation and really started reading up on some of the answers thank you all by the way my goodness i didn't realize how complicated this could be p so here is my setup i have a gallon tank with a lid and light for heat i also have a filter thermometer ornament with a small pump for bubbles i also have gravel i filled the tank and used a packet of tetra brand water conditioner that is supposed to make my tank suitable for freshwater fish what do i need to check before adding my or little fish for cycling what should the temperature be how long do i need to keep the fish in my tank to cycle it before adding a third tiny little fish the tank is currently on with the filter running and bubble thingy going how long does it need to be doing this before i can add fish thanks in advance that second answer is a great example of why fishless cycling is recommended you are killing fish when you cycle with them and not killing them quickly either why that's okay with some people i can't understand look up fishless cycle and see if that's something you're willing to do it requires testing your water parameters regularly but it doesn't require water changes and it doesn't require torturing any fish as a bonus fishless cycling is quicker and more efficient than cycling with fish in a tiny gallon it shouldn't take longer than a couple of weeks Brewery Marine aquarium Aquarium E85 Sea-Monkey Reef tank Fish farming Thermal power station Autonomous building Carburetor Jet engine Goldfish Air conditioning Sewage treatment Hydrogen economy Extreme Programming Hydroponics Biodiesel Theory of conduct Motor oil Fusion power Diesel engine Fossil fuel power plant CPU design Swimming pool Temperature Dry cleaning Portable stove Coffee Nuclear reactor Hardware random number generator USS Tunny (SS-282) God Emperor of Dune Stirling engine Fountain Ocean thermal energy conversion Spacecraft propulsion Polymerase chain reaction Thermostat Immortality Motorcycle Nuclear power Turbocharger Dialysis Expert system Nuclear thermal rocket Welding Tire Tea Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) STS-59 GunBound Solar power Hydraulic machinery Fire fighting Houseplant Loudspeaker Drill bit Three Mile Island Cannabis cultivation Toyota Prius Alcohol fuel Renewable energy Flood geology Transformer Sterilization (microbiology) Electrophysiology Sonoluminescence Discus (fish) StarCraft: Uprising Quizbowl Marathon (sport) STS-62 Hard disk Beer Gas turbine Magnetic core memory Bubble Bobble Soap bubble Wind turbine Kitchen Watercooling Heinkel He 100 Password PID controller Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Heartworm Water purification Tidal power Microeconomics Hash table Compiler optimization Axolotl Lighting MS-06 Zaku II Apollo 13
