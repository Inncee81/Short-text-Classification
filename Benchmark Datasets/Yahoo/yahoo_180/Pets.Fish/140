choosing the right gravel my tank has corydoras neon tetras and a common pleco i'm looking into getting kuli loaches sometime in the distant future right now i have blue spectra stone gravel that i would like to change and an undergravel filter i understand that this is where most of the beneficial bacteria resides so i cannot change all of the gravel at one time without upsetting the tank i am looking for a substrate that would be better for the corydoras and would look better than this blue stone any suggestions tia check with your undergravel filter that it can withstand sand i know that mine recommends that i use a certain size stone so not to clog up the filter holes i have a natural looking gravel of different sizes my cory loves looking for food in it and is very active my tetra's glowlight neon's and black's do not bother about the subtrate at all infact that was one of the main reasons i introduced my cory and i am glad i did now all the little bits of food that sink get eaten Discus (fish) Marine aquarium Gravel Ultraviolet Water purification Tilapia Mining Tank Gas mask Radiation hardening Neon tetra Sea-Monkey Slow sand filter bed CPU cache PNG Aquarium Electrophysiology Coffee Tooth enamel Black hole Galileo spacecraft Dairy Link (Legend of Zelda) Sand Cardinal tetra Cheese Kissing gourami Open-pit mining Liquid crystal display Erosion Ecology Drainage Light-emitting diode Corydoras Technological singularity Antarctic krill Botany Phase-locked loop Color Red Arrows Groundwater Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina SETI Land mine R-Type Omega-3 fatty acid Fish farming Aggregate (composite) Acne Carburetor Hash table Hamster Low-pass filter Common cold PID controller Lac operon Information Awareness Office Water Sugar Shrimp farm RS-232 Princess Zelda Glass Drill bit Roman road Filtration Airport Final Fantasy IX Kidney stone Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Dwarf gourami Biodiesel Ventricular fibrillation Synthesizer Cannabis cultivation Vitasoy AGX-04 Gerbera Tetra Water supply Pavement (material) Graveler Filter (optics) Biological pest control American lobster Soil life Clown loach Motor oil Bloom filter Redundant array of independent disks Carnivorous plant Transistor Tofu Hydraulic machinery Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Flood geology Anti-aliasing The Shining (film) Methanethiol Pachypodium habitats
