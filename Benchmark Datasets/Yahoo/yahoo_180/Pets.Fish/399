what kind of fish can i add it is a gallon tank well filtered and taken care of i has a foot midas cichlid a large red snook and a large jack dempesy and a common pleco too big to be eaten and i would like to add one more nice sized fish but i don't know what to put in the tank i like oscars but everybody has one and cat fish would get beaten up so any help would be good and if i do find a fish where could i order it large enough that it won't be eaten every web site only sells the good fish as juvenilles i dunno any large cichlid you add to that tank is going to create major problems the midas and jack already have the tank staked out as their personal territory and any fish added will get beaten to death whoever suggested adding a flower horn is way out of line they are one of the meanest most vicious cichlids out there if the jack and the midas don't kill him he will eventually kill both of them the only possible way to add a big cichlid to that tank would be to wait until just before lights out for the night do a water change and move all of the rocks and decorations around to new locations acclimate the new fish and turn out the lights for the night the new locations for rocks and decorations will confuse the old residents and maybe allow the new fish to claim a territory the fresh water also makes it seem like a new location for all the fish sometimes this works sometimes it doesn't watch them closely all the next day for signs of agression sometimes the dominant fish is so agressive nothing changes his attitude toward other fish Cichlid Discus (fish) Tilapia Oscar (fish) Marine aquarium Aquarium Eric Bischoff Clownfish Freshwater angelfish Sea-Monkey Lake Malawi Brewery Hamster Lake Tanganyika Major League Baseball television contracts SS Andrea Doria Fish farming Roxette Shark Mick Foley Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shen Gong Wu Japanese tea ceremony GunBound Minor Harry Potter Beasts E85 The Lovely Bones Rum Animal Crossing Tofu Dionysus Reef tank Sin City USS Tunny (SS-282) Leopard Textile manufacturing Shrimp farm Theory of conduct Phrygia Goldfish Midas Pysanka Gar Gray Wolf Plagues of Egypt Sid Vicious World Championship Wrestling Flax Sheepshead Betting (poker) Fugu The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Homer's Enemy Tom Waits Yugo Battle of Tarawa Leon White Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ron and Fez Dodge Charger Creatures in Bionicle Paul Is Dead Characters in the Smurfs Rei Ayanami RuneScape Random Events Ecco the Dolphin Seine (fishing) Extreme Championship Wrestling StarCraft Episode VI Daredevil Kosher foods Chicago Cubs Spider Roman eating and drinking Miss Saigon Cantonese cuisine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jack Dempsey (fish) Death Note USS Yorktown (CV-5) Louis Agassiz Operation Market Garden Loudspeaker RuneScape skills Glossary of nautical terms Cruising (maritime) Live-bearing aquarium fish The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Torquay United F.C.
