rock testing for fish i was wondering if i used the vinegar method to test my aquarium rocks can i dip them into a bowl of vinegar and still get accurate results the reason that i would like to do it this way is because i am going to test about of them and it would be alot easier to dip em and look at the whole rock if anyone has done this am i looking for or so bubles or just a few thanks vinegar is too weak to properly test rocks to see if they will raise hardness i would pick up some muriatic acid from the local hardware store some rocks won't show a very strong reaction to vinegar and still increase hardness with the muriatic acid you will only need a few drops on top of the rock you will know within a few seconds if it is safe or not Hydrochloric acid Fish and chips Anchor Fast bowling Acid rain Tofu Acid Insulin Marine aquarium Acetic acid Password Nuclear weapon design Japanese cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Vitamin C Sulfuric acid Password cracking Sushi Ultraviolet Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Alchemy Explosive material Solvent Hydrogen peroxide Prostate cancer Vinegar HIV test Aerial (dance move) Casting Cheating in Counter-Strike In The Groove (game) Poker jargon Coffee Protein sequencing Carboxylic acid PH History of Test cricket (to 1883) One-time pad Unreal Shawangunk Ridge Volleyball Bayesian inference Cyanide Age of Mythology Ketchup Barbecue Aluminium Mnemonic Hard disk Polymerase chain reaction Chromatography Equine conformation Intelligence quotient RuneScape skills Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Digital circuit History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) French fries Cognitive science Cheese Fishing Floppy disk Otitis externa Gmail Benzene Skateboarding trick M16 (rifle) World War Three (Doctor Who) English cricket team Material properties of diamond Fugu Hydrogen Food preservation Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Redundant array of independent disks Overclocking Tilapia Tattoo Arsenic Cuisine of Malaysia Nuclear reactor ELO rating system Omega-3 fatty acid History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Citric acid Michael Bubl__ Haloalkane Chernobyl accident Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Invisible ink Organic food Combine (Half-Life 2) Rocket fuel Hypoglycemia Titration Large numbers Australian rock Stingray Backup
