my male betta's bottom fin is divided into two halves is this ok will it heal please help i'm worried i just got him days ago was it like this when you got him or is this a new thing could it have been that way when you bought it and you just noticed it now when he flared some bettas have split tails naturally and it's a genetic thing take a look at the link below to see pictures of some bettas who have naturally split tails they are called double tail bettas by the way if it's a torn fin and it's split all the way down to the base that's a pretty serious injury it may heal completely or it may not you should probably give him a salt bath to help stimulate the growth of his slime coat and help him fight off infection also if he tore his fin that bad check his tank for what he might have caught it on and remove anything sharp or dangerous in there Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Poker jargon 1957 World Series Xenomorph Docking Equine conformation Bone fracture Fish anatomy House Mouse Dog Traumatic brain injury Manx (cat) Prostate cancer Healing Anal sex Fancy rat Blue Whale Wound healing phases Chris Kanyon Characters of Lost Prolog Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Blackjack Scar Intersex surgery Fin Draw poker Foodborne illness Unclean animals Shrimp farm Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Ark in Space Slayers Cat Virus Barbed wire YuYu Hakusho Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Dobermann Eczema Strap-on dildo British Airways Earring Undergarment Terran (StarCraft) Chicken Hip hop collaborations The Blue Lagoon (1980 film) Shadow the Hedgehog Conker's Bad Fur Day Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder MS-06 Zaku II Stingray Mitosis Dead Like Me Bottlenose Dolphin Whale Hamster Sea-Monkey Swimming Creatures in Bionicle Comfrey Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Anal masturbation Whaling Computer virus Diseases of the honeybee Condom Jon Secada Characters of Naruto Natural health Negima Piccolo Junior Saga Hyperthermia Gears and Vehicles (Xenogears) The Contender (television series) Manicure Bathing Natural Hygiene Urinary incontinence Unreal B-47 Stratojet Kingda Ka Table saw Cosmic Era list of characters American lobster Stroke Sewage treatment Body piercing Fugu Gimli Glider Fish farming Childbirth Fin Whale Tlingit Sonic Adventure Species Discworld MUD Drill bit
