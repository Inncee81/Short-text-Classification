my snowflake eel is eating every fish in my tank i had him in the tank for a couple months now and i had about fish living in the tank before i moved him in the eel was fine with the fish and wouldnt bother them at all for the past months but now he has eaten all fish i tried to add a new fish in today and he ate it too i think i even overfeed the eel i feed him shrimp chunks sometimes times a week is there a way i can stop him from eating all my live fish i also brought a pipe fish into the tank today its about inches long and the eel still tried to eat him it didn't really work out for the eel though because the pipes got the bony plate i don't think it would matter how big the fish is he would still eat it that is what happens with snowflakes firstly you are not feeding him nearly enough food he needs and will eat daily not a few times per week you can purchase a box of squid keep it in the freezer feed him every day and he will leave your fish alone it is a myth that eels only eat once a week or twice a week eels hunt and feed every day in the wild they are not snakes feed him more and he will leave your other fish alone Sea-Monkey Fishing Fish farming Eel Cuisine of Denmark Japanese cuisine Kosher foods Taboo food and drink Gar Moray eel Discus (fish) RuneScape quests Shark Orca Cuisine of the Philippines Clownfish Sushi Salmon Fauna of Australia Seabird Snake Squid Cantonese cuisine Novelty (locomotive) Deluge (mythology) Eels Foie gras Livestock Tempura Octopus Lamprey Albatross Whaling Creatures in Bionicle Chinese New Year Frog Food preservation Sewage treatment Goldfish Axolotl Fish migration Shrimp farm Guinea pig Food storage Fish Minor Harry Potter Beasts Hamster London Congestion Charge Dolphin Sea turtle Tlingit Marine aquarium Dim sum Sea serpent RuneScape Mini-Games Eel River (Indiana) Bengali cuisine Actinopterygii The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Nerpa 613 mitzvot Cuttlefish Chinese cuisine Seafood Krill Bat Meat Eldfell Cuisine of Malaysia Domestic water system Eel life history Oily fish Chicken Nile crocodile Maize Animal Super Size Me Domestic rabbit Hunting Garfield Space Shuttle external tank Food chain Electric eel Aquaculture Chocolate Peruvian cuisine Agriculture American lobster American eel Diseases of the honeybee Shanghai cuisine Gray Wolf Orange roughy German cuisine Tobacco Frilled shark Thermal power station Chinook salmon The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie
