continuous duty solar pump circulation in my gallons tank i would like to pump lift its water to about ft high store in a tank and and then filter the water before it drops down by gravity into the main tank continuous circulation i am looking for a solar pump that can do this task and i will be happy if it can do a minimum of gallons per minute i have most of solar equipment only missing part is the actual pump need one to have nothing to ware out no diaphram no piston would impeller be the choice thaks chris i work for the solar center in denville nj and i got to be honest here i haven't heard of any solar pump out there it might be powered by pv photovoltaic cells but i don't know when i go into work tomorrow i'll ask some of the engineers about this and if they know anything i'll post you a follow up link also something that will really help find a suitable pump if there is one is getting pics of your tank layout to find where it should be emplaced properly one big thing about solar arrays is your best effeciency is true south oriented roofs i've submitted over permits since i've been working for the solar center and i do know the engineers need to know these things to draw up thier schematics pictures will help my engineers assess your mechanical capabilities as well if you could please post me some snaps of your tank set up from different angles as well as the orientation of the roof sir Solar power Hydraulic machinery Solar cell Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Brewery Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Autonomous building Tank Pump Carburetor Thermal power station Glossary of firefighting equipment Sun Cruising (maritime) Wind turbine Rail terminology Fuel injection Panama Canal Sewage treatment Siphon Hydrogen economy E85 Solar collector STS-61 Diesel engine Solar power satellite Power station Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Steam engine Combine harvester Gas compressor Apollo Command/Service Module Passive solar Vacuum Dairy Energy development T-72 Automobile Wave power Newcomen steam engine Marine aquarium Tiger I Propeller Stirling engine Fossil fuel power plant Electric boat Aquarium Planetary orbit Biodiesel P-61 Black Widow Trench warfare Laser Grid energy storage Cassini-Huygens Saturn V Engine Jet engine Irrigation Spacecraft propulsion Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Motorcycle Galileo spacecraft Operation Market Garden Electrical generator Pebble bed reactor Internal combustion engine Clementine mission Locomotive Motor oil B-47 Stratojet Syphon Filter Mooney M20 Diving Turbine Circulatory system Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends Space shuttle main engine 24 Hours of Le Mans Aircraft engine Crofton Pumping Station Solar car Air conditioning Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Filling station Liquid crystal display Seismic retrofit Helicopter Dialysis Fuel cell Hubble Space Telescope Space opera in Scientology doctrine Hydrogen vehicle Water purification Discovery One
