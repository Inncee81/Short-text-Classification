what kind of filtration system should i use for my gallon aquarium hi i was just wondering if anyone out there could help me with picking a good filtration system for my g aquarium right now it is empty but i am getting ready to cycle it i plan on having a few small driftwood logs and branches flat and square river rocks for more caves a pretty thick planting of aquatic plants and small tropical community fish so with all of that what would be a good filter for an aquarium with all of this would a hang on filter do any good with all of this stuff in there and what is a good way to clean the gravel with all of these obsticles thanks in advance if you are planning on using live plants do not go with an undergravel filter i would use a hang on rated for gallons per hour about times the volume of the tank if going with plastic plants you can use an undergravel filter alone and it will work great personally i'd go with the live plants and use a hang on also if you do make a very easy co generate with a liter bottle sugar yeast and water and your plants will do much better make sure to spend the money for a good light bulb that will encourage plant growth good luck Aquarium Brewery Marine aquarium Reef tank Sewage treatment Wine making Tilapia Dry cleaning Autonomous building Fish farming Cannabis cultivation Rum Beer Hydroponics Hydrogen economy Homebrewing Coffee Yerba mate Water Wood Slow sand filter bed Solar power Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Energy development E85 Potomac River Japanese tea ceremony Cruising (maritime) Goldfish Carbon dioxide Houseplant Sake Coral reef Fishing Axolotl Sugarcane Bladderwort Kissing gourami Incandescent light bulb Textile manufacturing Alcohol fuel Aquatic plant Hamster Carnivorous plant Kidney Cell (biology) Ocean thermal energy conversion Filtration Jellyfish Eutrophication Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Shrimp farm Fish Hydroelectricity Brewing Illegal drug trade Bonsai Clownfish Cider Halfbeak Sugar Glass Wheat beer Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre NEWater Sugar beet Koi Great Lakes Desert Swimming pool Flowering plant Wetland Green roof Shedd Aquarium Kelp forest Crayfish Knife Fume hood Water pollution Cholera Chlorophyta Economy of the People's Republic of China Hemp Irrigation Biology Dwarf gourami Tidal power Tax Ecology Environmental concerns with electricity generation Dairy Gasoline
