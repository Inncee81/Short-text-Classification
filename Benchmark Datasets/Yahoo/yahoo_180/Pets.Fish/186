why do people keep their beta fish in such a small bowl it seems cruel to me it seems cruel to me the fish can't even swim around they take them home from the pet store and keep them in the same small bowl pet owners should educate their customers you are right the small cups and tiny bowls often used fr display of bettas in shops makes a horrible home for a betta it is a fact that those cups and bowls were never intended to be a long term home for the betta just a holding place until it is sold which is usually less than a week if the store orders correctly it would be nice if stores would educate people buying bettas but that would require the stores to be educated and that's not the case in too many stores really it's up to the buyer to educate themselves and too many will not do so all you need to do is look at some of the answers you have gotten before mine to see how many people don't bother to educate themselves about bettas while a batte can be kept in a gallon bowl and most breeders like myself find that to be the best way to handle large numbers of bettas a filtered and heated tank is certainly far better for the typical pet betta owner mm Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Dairy Discus (fish) Domestic rabbit Pet store Goldfish Gaia Online Aquarium Brewery Orlando, Florida Coffee Hamster Commodore 64 Japanese tea ceremony Bong Pet skunk Marine aquarium Password Sea-Monkey Sears Holdings Corporation Microchip implant (animal) Billboard Hot 100 CPU cache Supply and demand Microeconomics Stanley Cup Dog Real estate broker Argos (retailer) Floppy disk Shopping Database Carburetor Swimming pool Inventory Bikini Bottom Dilbert Tea Dwarf gourami RuneScape economy Bayesian inference RuneScape Random Events Atari ST Sento Atari 8-bit family Starbucks Cigarette Fast bowling ITunes Music Store Animal Crossing Retailer Solar power Oakland Raiders Cricket Taxicab Software testing Dobermann Vehicle registration plate Quizbowl Bulk vending RuneScape locations Customs and etiquette of Japan Pet Uranium DirectShow Steam (content delivery) Puppy mill Nuclear power Internet fraud Best Buy CPU design The Pet Sounds Sessions Game show UK Singles Chart Cat Pysanka Fish farming Guinea pig Expert system Dot-com Supermarket Labrador Retriever Filling station Ernest Harmon Air Force Base Hydrogen economy Leicester City Centre Chopsticks Warranty Ramen Pet Sounds Compact audio cassette Laserdisc Dog training Tesco Contract Bird Animal euthanasia Pixel Brassiere
