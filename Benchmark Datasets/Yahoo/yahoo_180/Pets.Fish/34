how do you clean calcium off the side of a fishtank i have a fishtank with maybe fish in it some are big some are small i've had calcium or white stuff on the outside of the tank cover for a while now and i didn't think it would be a big problem but now it's all over the outside of the tank my co workers have said that the fish splash water over the side how do i keep the calcium off thanks take a clean cloth with a little white vinegar on it and rub the calcium deposit with the vinegar making sure that none goes in the water the calcium will dissolve and you can then polish the glass with dry kitchen paper towel please be carefull to do this only on the outside of the tank as the vinegar will affect the ph of the water if it gets into it i own a pet store and we clean the outside of the display tanks this way http www artsaquaticsandanimals co uk Dishwasher Vinegar Aquarium Gilding Sento Hamster Marine aquarium Tofu Tooth Acetic acid Dry cleaning Hard water Thermal power station Upholstery Manicure Dairy Sulfuric acid Brewery Sewage treatment Jellyfish Domestic rabbit Japanese toilet Calcium Menstrual cup Carbon dioxide Acid rain Towel Fish and chips Otitis externa Sushi Calcium chloride Sugarcane Sugar beet Tattoo Mineral Insulin Plaster Water purification Clothing Citric acid Paper Barbecue Ham Soap Reef tank Carnivorous plant Food preservation Sodium hydroxide Textile manufacturing Limestone Hand washing Cheese Toilet paper Electrolyte Bone Water Japanese tea ceremony Discus (fish) Paper towel Tooth enamel Karst topography Crayfish Plastic Ketchup Eifel Aqueduct Dead Sea Corrosion Hemp Japanese cuisine Car washing techniques Hardpan Hydrofluoric acid Fancy rat Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sears Holdings Corporation Haggis Energy development Speleothem Soil pH Milk Hydrogen economy Jewish cuisine Seine (fishing) Calcium carbonate Professional wrestling attacks Sauna Cuttlefish Glacier Edible salt Weathering Hat Psoriasis Fluoride World War Three (Doctor Who) Gelatin Desert Carbon cycle Black smoker Organic light-emitting diode
