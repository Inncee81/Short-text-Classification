can bettas be in the same tank with goldfish and guppies do you actually have your goldfishes with your guppies i raise mine in seperate tanks i've tried unsuccessfully in the past to combine them in the same tanks but goldfishes are pretty aggressive to fishes other then themselves they nonstop harrassed my guppies and my betta to death i have since raised the goldfishes and guppies in seperate tanks it wasn't always like that when the goldfishes were about the same size as the adult guppies they were fine but as the goldfishes got steadily bigger they got more aggressive so be wary of that in the future i've also unsuccessfully raised male betas together with my guppies they leave the females well enough alone but do nip and tear my male fancy guppies tails i have also seperated them thankfully the guppies tails are growing back i bred them for their coloring and was really disappointed when half of their tail was gone male betas are very much independent breeds of fish they do in fact do fine with bottom feeders such as a pleco if you have female betas you can place them in the tank i had my friend raising his female beta with his mollies he was also unsuccessful in keeping his male beta with the mollies as it incessently harassed them also just place your beta in a pretty tank it can be small a one gallon's plenty suitable good luck with your fish other people's comments were also on the money goldfishes do well on their own diet whereas guppies thrive on tropical fish food and betas have their own as well goldfishes do prefer colder temperature of water whereas tropical beta and guppies prefer warmer temperatures besides that goldfishes are the dirtiest fishes to raise they secrete a slime that other fishes won't be able to survive for long as in past a couple of months ever try to clean their filters cleaning the goldfish tank's filter is like ugh the grossest work i do ever happy fishing Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Goldfish Aquarium Discus (fish) Fish farming Tilapia Gray Wolf Brewery Clownfish Guppy American lobster Seabird Antarctic krill House Mouse Poker jargon Dry cleaning Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Platypus Pocket cruiser Bottlenose Dolphin Hamster Shrimp farm Mosquitofish Social rule Samuel Goldwyn Dog Marine aquarium Nuclear fallout Sexual selection Murray Cod Biodiesel Thermal power station P-38 Lightning Autonomous building Swimming pool Live-bearing aquarium fish Fugu Garfield Pet skunk Goldeen Diseases of the honeybee Hydrogen economy Tuatara Leatherback Sea Turtle Humpback Whale Gay slang Reef tank Nile crocodile Orca Krill USS Tunny (SS-282) Houseplant American Alligator Halfbeak Tigon Myxobolus cerebralis Dairy Xenomorph Tank locomotive Striped bass Pittsburgh Steelers Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Kakapo Lake Burley Griffin Peafowl Stereoscopy Geography of Chile Brave New World Cloud 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fish Sea-Monkey Dwarf gourami Tank Guinea pig Bird migration Bread Zebra Danio Seine (fishing) Canary First Battle of the Atlantic Gaia Online The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Chicken E85 Ecco the Dolphin Fin Whale El Ni__o The Perishers Textile manufacturing RuneScape locations Chinook salmon
