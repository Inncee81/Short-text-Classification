moving goldfish so come payday my black moor goldfish and my fantail goldfish are going to get a lovely new larger tank i've heard some horror stories about losing fifty percent of the fish in a move and i don't want to only have one fish left how i can i ensure a successful move i know how to set up the new tank for the most part but do i put any of the old water in the new tank how long should i let it sit cycle before putting the fish in how do i put the fish in when it's finally time a detailed step by step response would be awesome thanks hi demon no problem i've done it myself so have several people in my forum this is how it goes assuming the tank you are transferring your goldfish to is no bigger than twice the volume of their old tank it's easy because in effect you will simply be doing a water change so there should be no cycling issues before you begin make sure the new tank is filled with water allowed to stand for a couple of days to test it do this even if it is brand new you cannot be too careful then clean it thoroughly with luke warm water salt finally rinse with clean water calculate how much more water your new tank holds than your old one prepare slightly more than this amount for example if your present tank is a gallon your new one is gallons prepare gallons of treated water allow to stand until it reaches room temperature then you are ready for the move draw off buckets full of your old tank water then using a small net guide each of your fish into a small container or bag transfer each individual to one of the buckets then transfer all your ornaments plants airstones other decorations plus filter to the other bucket these all have the healthy bacterial colonies on them which preserve the cycle if you have a canister filter simply unhook it from your old tank transfer the remainder of your old tank water into your new tank until you have just a couple inches left in the old the gravel can now be rinsed in the remaining water transferred to the new tank leaving the loose debris gunk behind in the old tank this residue is great for the tomato plants arrange your decorations plants airstones etc in your new tank fix the filter then gently introduce your fish to the new tank one by one in the same way you put them in the bucket once they are in their new home the bucket of water they were in can also be added along with the one the accessories were in which should bring the water level in the new tank to at least half way slowly top up with the new treated temperature matched water switch on your filter airstones you are done depending on the capacity of your filter the capacity of your new tank you may need a bigger filter but running your old one in conjunction with the new one for several weeks will ensure a smooth transition keep a daily check on your parameters for a couple of weeks do regular partial water changes as normal job done finally if the tank you are transferring to is a whole lot bigger than twice the volume of your old one you may need to cycle it from scratch in which case i recommend a fishless cycle link below for several reasons firstly you have no urgency to transfer so a few more weeks will not hurt second a fishless cycle is almost always quicker more controllable than using live fish which brings me to arguably the most important reason no poor fish have to suffer the stress torment of being used in this way simply because they are unfortunate enough to be regarded as 'hearty' whatever that means or cheap good luck with your endeavours Brewery Goldfish Dairy Bong Thermal power station E85 Entropy Marine aquarium Japanese tea ceremony Carburetor Menstrual cup Sento Sewage treatment Nuclear power Aquarium Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hash table Textile manufacturing Yerba mate Betting (poker) Poker jargon Hard disk Cannabis cultivation Fire extinguisher Jet engine Loudspeaker Fire fighting Fish farming CPU design Hydrogen economy Dishwasher Shrimp farm Mercury Atlas 6 Vacuum cleaner CPU cache PID controller Microeconomics Dialysis Rebreather Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Biodiesel Carbon dioxide Three Mile Island Energy development Water Ocean thermal energy conversion Water purification Hydroponics Diseases of the honeybee Redundant array of independent disks Halitosis Electronic amplifier Hamster Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Water (molecule) Hebrew calendar Quicksort Philosophy of space and time Alcohol fuel Electrophysiology Fancy rat Vitamin C Urinary incontinence Toyota Prius Tea STS-61 Internal ballistics Coffee Elis Prefecture Nuclear reactor Single Transferable Vote Sake Contact lens Motor oil Artificial neural network Normal distribution FairTax Floppy disk Axolotl Dodge Charger Panama Canal Fischer Random Chess Tidal power Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Autonomous building Extreme Programming First aid Polymerase chain reaction Domestic rabbit Fast bowling Web crawler
