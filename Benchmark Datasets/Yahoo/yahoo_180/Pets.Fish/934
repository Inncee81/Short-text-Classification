snails okay my parents bought a snail to go in with our goldfish and some sucker fish since our goldfish ate the last snail this snail doesn't stick to anything he just floats at the top he's not dead b c when we take him out and touch the little foot thingy he pulls it back in why is it floating why won't it stick to anything i say its cuz he dont wanna get eaten lol its a snail that belongs in fish tanks lol it's not big and idk i just wish it'd stop floating the snail probably has nothing to eat try placing a piece of romaine lettuce into the tank and see if it will come out then you will need to feed the snail especially if you have a pleco because the pleco has already eaten all the edible algae Goldfish Fugu Snail Tilapia Sea-Monkey Water garden Lettuce The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie One Piece minor characters Garfield Gar Discus (fish) Discworld gods Doctor Dolittle (film) Hamburger Animal Franklin (television series) RuneScape quests Jaws (film) American Alligator The Strangerhood Cantonese cuisine Confidence trick Koi Samuel Goldwyn Conker's Bad Fur Day Digenea Slug Aquarium Roman eating and drinking Treehouse of Horror IV Skateboarding trick Fishing Piccolo Junior Saga Swimming pool Kenny McCormick Pop Will Eat Itself Marine aquarium The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Finding Nemo The Cure Hamster Hansel und Gretel French cuisine Mario series enemies Kodocha The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Professional wrestling match types Baldrick Seine (fishing) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Beetle Red Vs.
