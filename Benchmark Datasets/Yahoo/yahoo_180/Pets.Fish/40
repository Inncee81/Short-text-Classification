is there anything else i can get for my pond other than goldfish hi i've got a pond in my garden made from an old water tank its quite deep and narrow though reasonably long it siits above ground against a wall shaded by trees surrounded by bricks with potted ferns around its edge it contains a lily and a papyrus in pots and some floating oxgernators as well as a filtration pump with the outlet at the surface to splash the wateer and oxygenate it a bit it is currently home to goldfish one inches one and another inch one that has a problem with swimming he sits on the bottom all day i was wondering if there are other smallish fish we could get for other than the goldies or if we could put newts in as well i heard that frogs eat fish sometimes and besides i dont think it would be very good for them cos' its a big drop to the paved ground on one side and we have a dog we live in london uk it doesnt get that cold in winter though the pond surface freezes i think minnows would be cool theres a upturned pot with little holes in the tank that i think they'd like to dart in and out of dont they need running water though our pond has some circulation but its not great no offence but koi are just big goldfish to me pretty but i'm after something different no one has newts then i'd love to put some axolotls in but i think they're carnivorous and would probably munch my fish that depends in large part on where you live since this pond is above ground it's really influenced strongly by air temperature and unless you live in southern fl or points south you can expect it to freeze some during the winter i would loook to native species of fish from your area small minnows darters sunfish and the like if you do live in a fairly southern region you could probably add something like white cloud mountain minnows with no problem at all mm Goldfish Aquarium Koi Water garden Frog Brewery Solar power Irrigation Sea ice Axolotl Water (molecule) Climate of the United Kingdom Lake Dead Sea Carnivorous plant Smelt Drill bit Danio Severe weather terminology (United States) Coffee Great Lakes Bladderwort Sewage treatment Fishing Thermal power station Ice cream Swimming pool Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Poker jargon Seismic retrofit Ozone depletion Ecology Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Geography of Chile Hydroponics Glossary of firefighting equipment Lake Burley Griffin Ozone hole Swimming Water Houseplant RuneScape quests Quang Ninh Province Thermoregulation Sea-Monkey Tag Rebreather Grand Teton National Park Spark plug Yosemite National Park Hamster Fog Elis Prefecture Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Fish farming Motor oil Diving suit Gar RuneScape Mini-Games Pond Shark Fire fighting Weather lore Mario series enemies Bong Geography of Africa Ozone layer Carburetor El Ni__o Tea Pacific Ocean Bocas del Toro Province Professional wrestling throws Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Tetrapod Dinosaur Dam Rathfarnham Aquaculture Sundial Space shuttle main engine Zion National Park Lighting Bird migration Equine conformation Krill
