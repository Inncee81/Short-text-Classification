platie fry i platie fry had between and babies the other day wednsday i wasnt expecting so many i only have a spare gallon set up and cycled with only apple snails in it i am planing on puting about in there is it true that bigger fish will eat babies if so do i just take them out the breeder box and put them in the tank with the big fish or do i put one of the big fish in the box with the babies thansk yes platies can reproduce like rabbits and have alot of fry babies i would suggest asking the pet shop if they want the fry or they may give you a small amount of cash or store credit but if you dont want to do that then the babies provide protein for larger fish tasty i would suggest picking the most heathlyest ones and puting them in your gal with a sponge filter the power filter will suck them up gg Marine aquarium Domestic rabbit Hamster Discus (fish) Biodiesel SpongeBob SquarePants Poker jargon Tofu The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Fish farming Potato Doughnut Fugu MapleStory Cuisine of the Southern United States Guinea pig Fish and chips Hamburger Snail Timeline of alternative rock Fossil fuel power plant German cuisine Aquarium Care Bears Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) RuneScape Random Events Brewery Goldfish Sears Holdings Corporation Loudspeaker Chinese cuisine Sea-Monkey Timon and Pumbaa Pizza French cuisine Autonomous building Hedgehog Egg (food) Spider Cuisine of Denmark Patrick Star Milk Axolotl Bikini Bottom Oral sex Cantonese cuisine Southern platyfish Clownfish French fries Tlingit Chicken Octopus Taboo food and drink McDonald's Breastfeeding Salmon Pet store Sponge Reef tank Japanese cuisine Aqua Teen Hunger Force Animal Chinese New Year Roman eating and drinking Live-bearing aquarium fish Cat SpongeBob SquarePants (character) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Toyota Prius Electronic amplifier Seafood Crayfish Sailfin Molly Fancy rat GunBound Nuclear power Menstrual cycle Myxobolus cerebralis Hard disk $ale of the Century Let's Make a Deal Apple Computer Mario Surveillance Dairy Deep frying Rabbit Cuisine of Thailand Cessna T-37 Thermal power station Sewage treatment Thanksgiving Chinook salmon Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Japanese tea ceremony Fishing U2 (band) Wheel of Fortune Dieting The Rutles
