i need help picking out a clown fish so i work at a fish store so i can order all my dish at whole sale here is the question that i have should i order a mated pair of true percula clown fish or should i just buy two true percula clown fish i know that in the wild the larger one of the two will become the female and so forth so do i need to buy a mated pair when they are supposed to do this sex change thing are you planning on mating them or are you just worried about about them fighting if you are looking to mate them then you have a better chance of them mating if you get a breeding pair the price is heft but if you work at a fish store you may be able to sell off the off spring and make your money back realize there are no guaruntee that they will mate when you put them in your tank if you are just lo oking for them to peacefully coexhist with eah other order jueveniles and raise them in the same tank together and you most likely wont have a problem with them fighting as they grow older not to say that its that they wont fight but many people have success keeping clownfish together that were raised together hope this helps and good luck Clownfish Percula Clownfish Discus (fish) Gray Wolf Poker jargon Platypus Fish farming $ale of the Century God Emperor of Dune Hamster Dairy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Marine aquarium Charmbracelet Clown Humpback Whale 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule Great Depression Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Microeconomics Bird Short selling Domestic rabbit Spider RuneScape economy Internet fraud Kylie Minogue Law of value Species Avenue Q Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Shark Capitalism Shaggy dog story Mutual fund Chess terminology Lionel Corporation Mobile Fighter G Gundam Sears Holdings Corporation Electronic commerce Seymour Cray Bulk vending Neopets Non-human animal sexuality Extreme Programming Cruising (maritime) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Supply and demand Kakapo Betting (poker) Tarantula ITunes Music Store Heretics of Dune Battle of the Bulge Friends New York Giants Hip hop rivalries Inventory Surveillance Pack (canine) Porsche 911 American lobster Therion (band) Tigon Finding Nemo Monogamy Wal-Mart Ecco the Dolphin Fugu Confidence trick Chess problem terminology Hard disk Minor characters in Morrowind Transsexuality Taboo food and drink Hermaphrodite Animal communication Hyperinflation Commodity Sea-Monkey Chinatown Eaton's Drosophila melanogaster John Kerry Game show Viz (comic) UK Singles Chart Ant Rei Ayanami Aquarium Chopsticks Dragons (Pern) Infantilism Baseball Stars Red Squirrel Deflation (economics) Chess strategy and tactics Criticisms of socialism
