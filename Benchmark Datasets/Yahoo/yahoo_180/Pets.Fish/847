something wrong with my betta fish i have this male betta who is in a half years old i go to look at him and he has like this big junk of orange something coming out of him its huge is this suppose to be like poop from him is where they go to the bathroom underneath him in the front he is swimming aroud i just never saw anything like that from him that big is this normal he eats every other day but this thing is like a huge orange round ball it does sound like he's just pooping but it's hard to tell without a picture it could be that he was a little bit constipated and is just now getting over it which is why his poop is so large and unusual looking do you feed him the same thing all the time fish that have high protein diets may tend to get constipated especially as they get older as they mature and age they don't need quite as much protein as they did when they were fry especially if you are not breeding him try giving him a little bit of the mushed up inside of a thawed frozen green pea or a canned green pea this will help him if he has been constipated or help him pass whatever it is that's making the large poop and will not hurt him a bit if it's not the problem try feeding him a little bit of pea every other week or so it will help his digestion good luck with your betta and i hope it's nothing more serious Pea Hamster Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Spider Salmon Social rule Peanut Guinea pig Antarctic krill Piccolo Junior Saga Shark Clownfish Breastfeeding Cat Dietary fiber Japanese toilet Toilet humour Tofu Adjustable gastric band Fishing The Adventures of Pete & Pete Feces Shit Discus (fish) Constipation Cuisine of Denmark Porridge Capercaillie The Legend of Zelda series enemies Dieting Dog Food Tomato Cuisine of the Southern United States Goldfish Mosquito Pitaten Domestic rabbit Cuisine of Malaysia Stomach cancer Ferret Equine conformation Carnivorous plant Tlingit Poker jargon Fast bowling 2000 Australian Grand Prix Common bean Chicken Albatross Creatures in Bionicle Domesticated turkey Livestock Veganism Crohn's disease Tarantula Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Soul food Seabird Fancy rat Raw food diet Sea Otter Pizza Tasmanian Devil Milk Egg (food) Douglas Adams Maize Peafowl Laxative The Wack Pack Elephant The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Price Is Right Seed Shaggy dog story Food preservation Koala House Mouse Krill Cuisine of the Philippines I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Diving Bladderwort Obstetrics Dwarf gourami The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hypoglycemia Life in the Freezer Hamburger Acorn Kakapo Fugu Vitamin C Philip J.
