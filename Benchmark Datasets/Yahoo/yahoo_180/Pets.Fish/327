brine shrimp i raise freshwater fry and fish and i wanted to feed them live brine shrimp to the adult and fry is there a hatchery where you can grow brine shrimp to feed both the adult and fry you see i think i found one but i am not sure if you can feed the adult and also the fry visit this website http www thatpetplace com pet group product web if it does not work for both adult and fry do you know another one that feeds both fry and adult thanks i actuallly have one of those and i didn't find that it was very helpful i raise bettas and they thrive on the brine shrimp and it makes the colors brilliant there's actually one that's round and has a hole in the middle that is one of the best i've ever seen and used see link below they also have a great faq section also as long as you get the shrimp early you can feed adults and fry at the same time i love watching my bettas dive for those teensy little shrimps they love them but if you're trying to feed them at the same time the adults will gobble the shrimp and the fry might not eat also adults should only have the shrimp for a treat or if they need a color boost like bettas for the fry the newly hatched is best adults can eat the adult shrimp though for adults i'd stick with standard food and just treat them with something live they can chase Shrimp farm Brine shrimp Salmon Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Dwarf gourami Krill Nerpa Clownfish Chicken Tilapia Great Salt Lake Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Denmark Shrimp Discus (fish) Goby Halfbeak Mono Lake Cuisine of Brazil Bengali cuisine Freshwater angelfish Hamburger Tofu Fish farming Smelt Cuisine of Malaysia Cantonese cuisine Murray Cod Shark Cajun cuisine Japanese cuisine Grunion Korean cuisine Fishing Agriculture Peruvian cuisine Ant Cheese Goldfish Domestic rabbit German cuisine Livestock Tarantula Crustacean Fishery Axolotl Philip J.
