how do i get my water in my fish tank to clear up it's always cloudy is this a tank you've recently set up cloudiness is natural for the first few months what's happening is your tank is cycling when your tank is mature you'll have bacteria that will break down the wastes your fish produce one of these wastes is ammonia which is poisonous to your fish one type of bacteria will use the ammonia as it's food source and convert the ammonia to nitrite which is also toxic then another type will take over and convert the ammonia to nitrate which is nontoxic in moderate amounts but right now you don't have the amount of bacteria to convert these completely so the bacteria are in a rapid reproduction mode to take advantage of the extra food sources it's this bacterial bloom that makes the water appear cloudy once there enough bacteria that all the ammonia and nitrite are being converted the tank will clear on it's own but until then you'll need to do partial water changes in order to keep the ammonia and nitrite at levels the fish can live in rather than doing large changes it's better to do small frequent ones about twice a week or once a week using a gravel vacuum to clean all the debris out of the gravel you'll also need to be careful that you don't overfeed your fish only give them what they can eat in minutes twice a day if any food is left after the minutes are up use a net to remove it decomposing food also produces ammonia you should be aware of they symptoms of ammonia and nitrite poisoning so if your fish start to show these you'll know to do a water change when the levels get high enough the fish will start swimming at the top of the tank and look like they're gasping for air they may also sink to the bottom and be very inactive staying in one place they'll stop eating and with ammonia poisoning the fins may spilt and look frayed here's some additional info for you also see the rest of these sites there's a lot of good info for new fishkeepers http www fishlore com cloudywater htm http www fishlore com nitrogencycle htm http www firsttankguide net cycle php Sewage treatment Eutrophication Biogeochemical cycle Nitrogen Bacteria Cyanide Hydrogen economy Ammonia Foodborne illness Fish farming Rebreather Brewery Diseases of the honeybee Fugu Carbon dioxide Ecology Carnivorous plant Energy development Water purification Autonomous building Nitrogen cycle Biochemistry Nutrition Shrimp farm Biodiesel Alcohol fuel Ocean thermal energy conversion Sodium nitrite Dairy Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Tooth Refrigerator Carburetor Nuclear power Ice core Cellular respiration Water pollution Hamster Food preservation Photosynthesis Soil life Fossil fuel power plant Chlorophyta Sake Town gas Escherichia coli O157:H7 Dialysis Methanol Amyl nitrite Plankton Nutrient Aquarium Domestic rabbit Water (molecule) Swimming pool Domain Name System Bong Solar power Tooth enamel PHP Scuba set Ozone Tofu Omega-3 fatty acid Ozone depletion Toyota Prius Hemp Algal bloom Menstrual cup Mercury (element) Orca Thermal power station Cloud Swimming Shark Insulin Seine (fishing) Helicobacter pylori Aluminium Compost Waste management Dry cleaning Agricultural wastewater treatment Ozone hole Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9
