green fern in tank we have a tropical tank with no live plants in but there is something growing on the ornaments like a green fern plant it grows quickly and spreads any ideas what it is and how to get rid of it thanks the fern like appearance is a give away that's often called black beard algae and is very difficult to get rid of in a tank the best option is to remove all items it is growing on and treat them in a weak bleach solution then scrub the items well under running water to remove any remaining algae and to wash away the bleach then allow them to dry well before returning them to the tank event his is no guarantee of completely removing the algae from your tank but it will remove the majority and with several such cleanings you may be able to eliminate it entirely algae killing chemicals will possibly kill it but not entirely and it will certainly come back futher they are harmful to the tank and will in the long run only make matters worse please avoid them entirely mm Water purification Plant Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Coral reef Biodiesel Dishwasher Polar Bear Dishwashing Textile manufacturing Sugarcane Wood pulp Menstrual cup Devonian Disinfection Carbon dioxide Fern Photosynthesis Embryophyte Sea-Monkey Fossil fuel power plant Chlorophyta Washing machine Sodium hypochlorite Sugar beet Eutrophication Hydroponics Reef tank Fish farming Irrigation Ecology Geology of the Grand Canyon area Hydrogen peroxide Hamster Houseplant Chinook salmon Sterilization (microbiology) Brewery Alternation of generations Bong Weed control Kryptonite Thermal power station Gilding Shrimp farm Film developing Dairy Coffee Black pepper Gaia theory (science) Agriculture Snowball Earth Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Coral Leaf Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nutrient Dry cleaning Diaper Gypsy moth Cyanide Ricin Comfrey Autonomous building Mach kernel Jute Hemp Gal__pagos Islands Green alga Marine biology Aquarium STS-114 Final Fantasy XI Bhopal disaster Extinction Chlorine Single Transferable Vote Kissing gourami Mosquito fern Lake Renewable energy Epiphyte The Legend of Zelda series races Lichen Water garden Coir Hydrogen economy Organic peroxide Cannabis cultivation Ozone Cyanobacteria Sugar Flue gas desulfurization Biological warfare Algal bloom Carnivorous plant Florida Keys StarCraft: Uprising Terraforming
