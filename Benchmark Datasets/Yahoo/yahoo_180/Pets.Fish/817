i am trying to breed betta fishes does anybody have a clue on this after all the eggs had been opnened and the very tiny fishes were swiming up and down for about two to three hours they all died when i came to check on them they were all dead in spite of the efforts of the male to keep them safe in the bubble nest and so if they were still swimming vertically then there could be any number of things that could have gone wrong not eating is not one of them they don't eat until they are free swimming around day when they start to swim horizontally for the first days they are still absorbing their egg sacks either the water parameters were not fry friendly even the tiniest bit of ammonia or nitrites would have killed them or there is a parasite in the tank i always treat spawning tank with fungus and parasite meds as a preventative or the temperature fluctuated more than one degree in either direction or a draft got in i keep my spawning fry tank covered with saran wrap betta fry are very sensitive conditions need to be perfect for them to make it obviously your breeding pair like each other condition them for another weeks and try them again Shark Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Snake Clownfish Sea-Monkey Frog Sewage treatment Solar power Platypus Hamster Krill Goldfish Myxobolus cerebralis Chicken Albatross Dwarf gourami Diseases of the honeybee Fancy rat Zerg Triathlon Schistosomiasis Anopheles Fugu Marine aquarium Fishing Ant Tilapia American Alligator Brewery Capercaillie Swimming pool Live-bearing aquarium fish Thermal power station Halfbeak Cantonese cuisine Conker's Bad Fur Day Grunion Dog Freshwater angelfish Leatherback Sea Turtle Bread Items in the Metroid series First aid Explosive material Bird Danio Gypsy moth Oyster Plastic Egg (biology) Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Biological pest control Egg (food) Jellyfish Foodborne illness Malaria Nile crocodile Antarctic krill Xenomorph Bee Rebreather American lobster Carnivorous plant Compiler optimization Seabird Hyperthermia 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Dumpling Cat Pancake Ammonia Emu Equine conformation Animal Cuisine of the Philippines Seismic retrofit Gray Wolf Bacon Autonomous building Swimming Sea Otter Menstrual cup Stephen Fry House Mouse Apollo 13 Pneumonia Fish and chips Agar plate Water purification Natural Selection (computer game) Guinea pig Diving suit Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Pikmin
