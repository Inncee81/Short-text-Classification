do you give to cancer charities as a disease that effects a large percentage of the population i have many many times given money towards research into this however i have been watching news reports that state cancer patients are having to pay for cancer treatment drugs out of there own pockets as the goverment claims the cost of giving them on the nhs would be too costly i know that i was donating into the research side of it but why should people with cancer have to pay for these drugs when so much money is put towards cancer charities yes good for you for donating to cancer research don't ever stop that in itself makes you part of the solution rather than part of the problem unfortunately our elected officials don't consider cancer to be the problem that it actually is our children can't vote they can't defend themselves from the ravages of cancer yet they will ultimately suffer from the budget cuts and general apathy that exists our gov't has slashed pediatric cancer funding while our children the most vulnerable sector of our society continue to die at a rate of more than every hours from cancer and cancer related side effects that's every hours of every day of every week of every month you will read about improved survival rates what you usually do not read about is that a high percentage of these cured children have life long disabilities as a result of their toxic exposure to outdated chemotherapies and radiation many of them will die from those exposures without people like you helping to support the research necessary to undertake clinical trials there can be no new therapies and these kids are caught in a vicious balancing act of how to kill the cancer without killing the patient it's not getting better the incidence of these pediatric cancers has gone up every year since the 's in children will eventually contract some form of cancer before their th birthday in will die this has to stop and if our gov't has decided that it is more important to stockpile missiles than to save our children then who will step up and fill the void you will this is critical this is not something that just happens to someone else this will eventually catch up with all of us it has already caught up with my family we lost our year old son months ago to wilms' tumor kidney cancer Radiation therapy Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Lung cancer Publicly funded medicine Mesothelioma Breast cancer Oncology Colorectal cancer Folic acid Psoriasis Multiple sclerosis Palliative care Growth hormone treatment Chemotherapy Duesberg hypothesis Health insurance History of cancer chemotherapy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Bone marrow transplant Alternative medicine Chernobyl accident Stroke Thimerosal Experimental cancer treatment Medicine Wilms' tumor Soft tissue sarcoma Metastasis Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Clinical depression National Kidney Foundation Singapore Food and Drug Administration National Institutes of Health Chronic fatigue syndrome Psychiatric hospital Brain tumor Autism Hepatocellular carcinoma Medical analysis of circumcision Haloperidol Crohn's disease Asthma Tocopherol Divorce AIDS Malignant melanoma AIDS reappraisal Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mother Teresa Ovarian cancer Cryptorchidism Medical cannabis Hypoglycemia Tobacco smoking Hodgkin's lymphoma Migraine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus DNA repair Autism epidemic Baldness Hypertension Esophageal cancer Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Herpes simplex virus Cervical cancer Multiple myeloma Alcoholics Anonymous Breastfeeding Barbara Boxer National Health Service Adverse effect (medicine) Renal cell carcinoma Chlorpromazine Transsexuality Radiation poisoning Diabetes mellitus Androgen insensitivity syndrome Testicular cancer Antiretroviral drug Theory of conduct Vitamin C Organ transplant
