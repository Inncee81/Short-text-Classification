has anyone else used chantix to quite smoking i have it took away my cravings and i also noticed i wasn't over eating or drinking as much i had great luck what about you i used chantix for months but i didnt stop smoking it is a good drug and will help you stop but for most people you must be ready to quit and meet it half way you have to try to obstain from smoking starting one week after startin the chantix first try i was going though a lot of stress with my sister and her death with cancer and stopped but plan to try again and have set a date to start date to quit i think the buddy system will work the best and even though chantix cut cravings a lot i learned you still got to be willing to really stop and make an effort as it can't make you stop all by itself usually one girl at work stopped days after starting chantix and has not smoked since and she was a heavy smoker pray for me to succeed this time the only side effect i had was nausea when i would take it with a cup of coffee in the morning best to drink big glass of water and eat something before you take it Tobacco smoking Stomach cancer Alcoholics Anonymous Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma EastEnders Cannabis (drug) Bong Cocaine Cigarette Alcoholism Friends 2000 Australian Grand Prix Cancer Norway national football team Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Oasis (band) Liam Gallagher Charmed Marathon (sport) The Smoking Room Medical cannabis USS Trigger (SS-237) Cancer of the larynx Battle of Kursk Spice Girls The Contender (television series) Hangover Breakfast Lung cancer Blood on the Tracks USS Wasp (CV-18) The Notorious B.I.G.
