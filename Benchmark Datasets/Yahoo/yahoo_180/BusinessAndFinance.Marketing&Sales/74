is the following a true factor to being top in sales i think to be a great sales person you need to know your product inside out you need to be able to answer all objections concerning your product you need to know the proper steps to a close but most important you must know how to prospect knowing all these things verbatim permits you to know how to touch the right buttons to close the sale so what is left the desire to do it all and reach the top i think you hit the nail on the head you're absolutely right in everything you say but i can go one further not only should you know your product inside and out so you can answer questions about it but you should also sell a product that you believe in for example i can sell beer and answer questions about hopps barley and yeast but i don't like beer however i love milk and if i were trying to sell milk i believe that my love for milk would emit as passion and belief in my product beer and milk are silly examples but the point is the same regardless of the product when a salesman not only knows his or her product but believes in it that belief is a reassurance to the potential buyer and perhaps what will convince them to close the sale not the door Objectivist philosophy Goodness and value theory Jennifer Lopez Brewery Epistemology Alcoholic beverage Beer Phaedo Spice Girls Coercion Advertising Sales Real estate broker Floppy disk Jon Secada Socrates The Apprentice 2 God Joke Marketing S__ren Kierkegaard American Broadcasting Company Prohibition Guinness Philosophical skepticism Wheat beer Summa Theologiae Theodicy Mariah Carey (album) David Hume Determinism Microeconomics Billboard Hot 100 Phil Collins Roxette Martin Luther Brewing Tina Turner Supply and demand Milk Kit Kat Little Britain Infantilism Shinto Bong Supernatural Free will The nature of God in Western theology Manifold Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Toyota Prius Philosophy of mathematics $ale of the Century Law of value Religion Sexual orientation Expert system Tofu Muslim ibn Aqeel Queen (band) Human Chevrolet Camaro Sin City Hip hop rivalries Illegal drug trade Meaning of life Deconstruction Shaggy dog story A Course In Miracles Theory of conduct Genesis (band) Plame affair Eastern Orthodox Church Infant baptism Intelligent design movement Atheism Dodge Charger Ale Faye Wong Estoppel Existence of God Jumpstart 3rd Grade Gravity Edsel Station wagon Elvis Presley Avenue Q Contract Homebrewing Team Fortress Classic Whose Line Is It Anyway?
