river rats are killing me in poker ok so i lost about the other night with buy ins now im not one to really believe in luck steaks since the cards lack the muscular strength to reposition themselves in someones favor but every single time i was all in this stupid fucking idiot dumbass would call with the worst hands ive ever seen anyone play im talking suited offsuit offsuit everytime i went all in i had him dominated yet every single time he got extremely lucky and beat me there was one time where i moved all in with pocket aces and hit an ace on the flop the only out he had with his offsuit which he called for pre flop in a blind game was for him to hit a and a queen to make his straight for the flop was a j so automatically i think im going to take it with trip aces yet once again he fucking drew out and hit running q now he is honestly the worst player i've ever seen but how can i beat someone who has the worst hand everytime and still wins by the river i've seen the same number hit times in a row on a roulette table that's a in it's not that surprising that someone can hit a lucky streak pushing in with junk anyway you're still going to beat that guy in the long run i understand your frustration but take solace in the fact that in the long run that guy's going to blow his whole bankroll times over and eventually he'll have to learn to play or quit the short term answer is easy move to a different table you're obviously playing online and there's probably other tables with those same limits you could sit at otherwise just keep playing smart and wait for his luck to run out it may seem like you're going to lose everything you have but keep in mind if you were going to play 'professional' poker at that table you'd need a total bankroll of somewhere in the range of to even out the highs and lows you could also move to a limit or pl table where you can't bust out your whole stack so quickly Texas hold 'em Blackjack Draw poker Omaha hold 'em Betting (poker) Poker Stud poker Community card poker Pai gow poker Craps Cheating in poker Game show Sheepshead Egyptian Ratscrew Draw (poker) Roulette World Series President (game) Backgammon Hand (poker) Chicago White Sox Snooker Billiards Doomtown Big Two Hearts (game) Four square Online poker Bad beat Skat Poker tournament New York Giants Tournament Poker strategy Andre Agassi Wayne Gretzky Dominoes Finesse Mike Matusow The Contender (television series) Pete Sampras 24 Hours of Le Mans Magic: The Gathering Spades Ace-to-five low Card game Team Fortress Classic Press Your Luck Detroit Tigers Slot machine Shuffle Caribbean stud poker New England Patriots Mahjong 2005 English cricket season Eight ball Table tennis Canasta San Francisco Giants Pinball Euchre Maverick (film) Monty Hall problem Video poker Playing card Ken Jennings Harmonica Norway national football team ELO rating system Doyle Brunson St. Louis Cardinals Oh Hell Zerg Cincinnati Bengals Toronto Blue Jays Extreme Championship Wrestling Limit Break High card by suit (poker) World Poker Tour Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Orders of magnitude (numbers) Tilt (poker) Paul Morphy Seven-card stud San Francisco 49ers Tenshinhan Atlanta Braves New York Mets
