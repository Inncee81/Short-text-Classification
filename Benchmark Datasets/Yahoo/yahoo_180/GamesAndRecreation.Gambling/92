question about poker i'm brand new to this when does it become too late to fold in a game like texas hold'em is it after the first round of betting is over please forgive my ignorance i'm trying to learn well essentially there are two kinds of games when it comes to poker not two kinds of poker but two kinds of games cash ring games and tournaments they differ greatly a cash game is a game you can sit at as long as you have money and every hand you win wins you money you can sit in one hand go all in win and double up and then say sayonara and you've walked away with a profit or go all in and lose everything you have in just one hand in those games the ante never goes up so there's no pressure to hurry up and get a big chip stack as long as you have more than what you started with you win in a cash game it's never too late to fold in a tournament you could arguably say there is a time when it's too late in a tournament the purpose is to work your way up the ladder and place well to do this you need a big chip stack to see you through the increasing antes what happens often is one player makes a bad move or gets unlucky and his chip stack shrinks like a kmart t shirt after about washes if the blinds are up to not real money chip money and he has only it's going to cost him or his stack just to call i've been in many situations where i've had marginally good hands with only blinds are and i was forced to a decision use of my stack on a shakey hand or try my luck in the next round if i tried my luck and it didn't work out i'd be wiped out with the small blind that's the rest of my chip stack so usually i would go for it so if i have like queen ten offsuit and i call and the flop comes a t well i have a decent hand and if i fold i'm going to be out with the next hand so in that case i feel it's too late to fold i'd go all in Poker tournament Poker Draw poker Craps Cheating in poker Blackjack Tournament Stud poker Slot machine Community card poker World Series of Poker Mahjong Baccarat Omaha hold 'em Sandbagging (poker) Bluff (poker) Game show $ale of the Century Poker Superstars Invitational Tournament Roulette Poker strategy Maverick (film) Sheepshead Video poker Gambling Press Your Luck Guilty Gear Doyle Brunson Ra (board game) Magic: The Gathering Microeconomics Sears Holdings Corporation Doomtown Wheel of Fortune Backgammon Bad beat Jeopardy!
