freiberg's disease and cross country i am years old and was diagnosed with frieberg's disease about a month ago sort of like osgood schlatter of the foot the blood circulation to the growth plate in the second metatarsal gets cut off and causes the joint to collapse i didn't know what was causing the pain during the spring track season so i kept running one pediatrist and my pediatrician said running wouldn't damage the condition it just might be painful another pediatrist suggested that i take the whole year or the cross country season off because it might hurt it and cause arthritis sometime in my later life i am getting orthotics and have been resting it the whole summer its been feeling a lot better i think by the time school starts i could be ready to ease back into running i really really don't want to give up a whole season i love running so much i was thinking of doing light training with the team a few times a week when i'm feeling good and not doing meets what should i do thanks wow i am also in cross country and don't like it all that much but am the top runner on my team my dad loves it and makes me do it but i am learning slowly to enjoy it i recently had some foot problems and went to the podiatrist i got orthotics as well and i am doing better the podiatrist says i am alright to run so i am continuing to do it i feel awful that you love it and are worried to keep running i think you should do the light training with the team if it starts to bother you then you should stop and go see the podiatrist again good luck in the season Podiatrist Shaggy dog story Equine conformation Breastfeeding High-heeled shoe 1957 World Series Pittsburgh Steelers David Beckham Pain Callus Prostate cancer The Contender (television series) Ben Johnson (athlete) Pediatrics Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sandy Koufax Babe Ruth 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blood on the Tracks Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Marathon (sport) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Ty Cobb Marilyn Monroe Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gout Paget's disease of bone John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Rheumatoid arthritis Tai Chi Chuan The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.
