how can i make myself enjoy running i've heard people say that they love to run why i would love to enjoy it more because it would be so so so good for me start running all the time it's like potato chips i could go a year without eating one but once i do i'll want to eat more same with running if you don't run you won't feel a need or want to do it but once you start running for like weeks straight you'll turn it into a habit this isn't a good analogy because it would take more than just one jog to get you hooked whereas with potato chips you'd only have to eat one but you get the point a good way to get started is to run the same distance everyday and use a stop watch track your times and you'll want to beat them when you notice you've been running in shorter times as time goes on it will encourage you to keep running and give you something to look forward to it will be like answering the what's in it for me Poker jargon Potato Shaggy dog story Boxing The Amazing Race Friends Potato chips Ben Johnson (athlete) Running Drag racing New York Giants Kodocha Hiberno-English Fecal incontinence Social rule The Joker's Wild The Ashlee Simpson Show English grammar Trailer Park Boys Kender Shit Knots Landing Fish and chips Sprint (race) She Loves You Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Taikyoku shogi Game show Snooker The Time Machine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Current teachings of Prem Rawat New Zealand English Dorama Maka dai dai shogi Milton H.
