the big question walking or running what are the benefits of each i know they must be similar but to me it seems that running is the better one to chose i do both but i'm wonder which is best in the long run pros cons obviously there are no true cons of either but i'm talking in muscle size areas that are targeted overall health etc thanks okay well running is much better for your health depending on your curent situation if you were to have hip problems artheritis or other joint pain then walking would be better however running is better because it gets your heartbeat going faster and it trains your body to circulate oxygen through the blood better this is also known as cardiovascular or cardiorespratory training both exercises work in different zones so depending on what your goal is either could be more beneficial walking is in the fat burning zone because of the pace you are going and the heartrate you maintain while walking running moves up to the next level of cardiovascular training but it does burn more calories because you have to work harder at it Weight training Exercise Aerobic exercise Tai Chi Chuan Circulatory system Cardiovascular disease Heart Osteoarthritis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Obesity Atkins Nutritional Approach Diabetes mellitus Stroke Tocopherol Growth hormone treatment Atherosclerosis Medicine Prostate cancer Coronary heart disease Milk Aikido Energy development Cancer Breastfeeding Babe Ruth Meditation Growth hormone Aspartame Dog Insulin Traumatic brain injury Marathon (sport) Massage Stem cell Triathlon Cholesterol Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anorexia nervosa Running Cocaine Decompression sickness Brain Dietary fiber First aid Scientology beliefs and practices Low-carbohydrate diet Blood (computer game) Puberty Nutrition Folic acid Calorie restriction Osteopathy Muscle Qigong Anxiety Chinese martial arts Super Size Me Horse gait Physical therapy GunBound Blood pressure COX-2 inhibitor Vegetarianism Fibromyalgia Cardiac arrhythmia Eye Cannabis (drug) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Thermoregulation Tobacco smoking Fast bowling Pneumonia Malaria Stomach cancer Explosive material Childbirth Archery Ecology Reflexology Baseball Redundant array of independent disks Expert system Angina Heart rate Sleep Human physiology Methamphetamine Clinical depression Word of Wisdom Growth hormone deficiency Local anesthesia Coffee Dinosaur Carburetor
