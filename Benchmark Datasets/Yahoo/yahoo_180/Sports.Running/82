i'm scared for cross country season i love running i just don't really i am mostly doing it to keep healthy and to beat this one girl that i beat all the time last year i'm super scared that she is going to get better than me i complain to my mom all the time but she won't listen anymore because i bother her so much about that some one give me some good advice or quotes to make me feel good about running and stop worrying if she beats me or not no person maybe i didn't understand i love doing cross country i love the fact that i can run that long that far in that time i just have an obsession with winning all the time oops u didn't understand very nice tom but i don't really think of cross country as a team sport if we don't have enough girls to make a team i consider running a sport for oneself not for the team i don't care if the team wins just as long as i come out victorious i'm happy here's a quote for you the unexamined life is not worth living basically dont run cross country you can still run to stay healthy without running competitively if you run because you love the sport then go ahead but if you're only running to satisfy a vendetta thats doing it for the wrong reasons and you wont enjoy it if you've beaten her already then great bow out while you're ahead and never give her the chance to show you up and ask your mom to help you get over your sense of obsession with this other girl no good is ever going to come of that and your mom certainly doesnt deserve to have to hear you talk about it all the time Theory of conduct Pok__mon Live!
