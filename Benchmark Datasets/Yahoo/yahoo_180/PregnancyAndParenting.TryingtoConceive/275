how can i convince myself to not get my hopes up about my next pregnancy i know this is a bizarre questions i'm aware i've had two failed pregnancies miscarriages before months gestation back to back and i'm planning on trying to conceive again in september is it possible to be apathetic until my husband and i learn it's a viable pregnancy is so how thanks my heart can't take anymore cracks i had a baby last year weeks along still born cord knot then i had miscariges now i'm weeks along i agree the st weeks is ruff but to be honest it does not ever get easy you'll never get to be like other pregnant women who are carefree and get to complain about how pregnancy sucks you'll charish each day of your pregnancy and when you go to the doc even for a regular check up you'll prepare yourslef to hear i'm sorry there's no heartbeat but after your weeks each week gets better i knew in my heart i was going to have baby no matter what so get your hopes up expect good things to happen to you look at what all the preg women you know and see each day and remeber that that's possible for you to what your expericening now is antiscipitry greif it's that thinking if i don't get attached it won't hurt as much but you will be attached anyway literrally the baby is a living part of your body there's a reason the windshield of your car is so big and the rear view mirror is so small because where you are going is much more important than where you've been so go for it all the way don't hold back i'm glad looking back that i got my hopes up for all the babies i carried even this one the bible says hope does not disappoint us your stronger than you know live without regret i would tell myslef if this baby does not make it i will not love it any less i won't hold back my heart it's gonna be hard anyway there will be a lot of fear anyway you don't get to choose that part but you can choose who you will be anyway come what may you'll have a baby soon tell yourself that and believe it your words matter you know nations go to war over words the bible says life and death lie in the power of your tounge speack words of positivity and declear what you want for yourslef if you believe in your heart that you can have it then it's already yours i'm not telling you this cause i feel like preaching i'm telling you this because it works and because i do everyday you think it's easy to walk around knowing i could make it to weeks with a healthy baby and he could still die sure i think about it all the time but i refuse to be paralizedor held emotionally hostiage by fear the worst has already happen to me and i'm still here so why whimp out now keep going you'll make it plan for the best and expect the best Pregnancy Miscarriage Abortion debate EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breastfeeding Jon Secada Friends Theory of conduct Abortion Jennifer Lopez Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Darth Vader Slow Train Coming Humphrey Bogart Hollyoaks Time Out of Mind Abortion in the United States Social rule Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Charmed Fertility awareness Melanie Wilkes Twin Obstetrics Characters in the Smurfs John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Cliff Richard Prenatal diagnosis The Ashlee Simpson Show Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Cordelia Chase Marilyn Monroe Characters of Lost Ty Cobb Birth weight Mojave people Cher (entertainer) The Death Gate Cycle Scenes from a Memory The Star Wars Holiday Special Phoebe Halliwell Big Brother UK series 6 Neighbours True Crime: Streets of LA Milton H.
