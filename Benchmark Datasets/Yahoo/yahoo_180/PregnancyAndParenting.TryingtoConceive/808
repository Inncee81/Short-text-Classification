what is ok to take for a headache if preg or ttc i have been having really bad headaches and my husband and i are ttc and may be pregnant now does anyone know wheather it is ok to take anything for headaches during pregnancy if not does anyone know anything that can help my headaches without taking a medication it's not unusual to get headaches when you're pregnant especially in the first trimester my wife suffered too she was susceptible to them and pregnancy seemed to make the problem worse experts don't know exactly why carrying a child makes your head ache but good guesses include the hormonal free for all your body is undergoing and changes in the way your blood circulates other potential culprits include fatigue sinus congestion stress and hunger it pays to think twice before taking any medicine while you're pregnant even something as simple as a cold remedy may contain substances which aren't recommended for use during pregnancy if you have any queries about medicines in pregnancy prescribed or over the counter speak to your doctor or pharmacist and always tell the pharmacist that you're pregnant when buying any medicines over the counter you are limited in your choice of pain relief aspirin should be avoided as it has a blood thinning effect however it may be prescribed by your doctor if you've suffered recurrent miscarriage or have pre eclampsia ibuprofen isn't recommended in pregnancy as it may affect your unborn baby and prolong labour paracetamol is considered safe as long as you stick to the recommended dosage and only use it occasionally one study found that expectant mums who took paracetamol on 'most days' or daily in late pregnancy were twice as likely to have a wheezy baby they recommend that pregnant women do not take it more than days per week ' avoid the stronger painkillers which combine one of the above with other analgesics if you continue to suffer from migraine please go and see your doctor for advice on what's safe to take try and work out what's triggering the pain do you get a pounding headache after being cooped up in a hot stuffy office all day then take periodic fresh air breaks are your headaches linked to arguments with your partner or power struggles with the kids then think of ways to defuse these situations or your frustration before they cause you physical pain my wife did not feel comfortable using medication during her pregnancy instead she would soak a flannel in cold water containing a few drops of lavender essential oil and apply this to her forehead and rest in a darkened room alternatively you could apply a warm compress around your eyes and nose for sinus headaches and a cool compress at the base of your neck for tension headaches get your partner to give you a massage if you have the time and money by all means get a full body number from a trained masseuse but if that's only a pipe dream ask your partner to rub your back and head or slip into a salon for a professional shampoo massage works especially well on headaches caused by tension that builds in the neck shoulder and back muscles eat little and often low blood sugar is a common headache culprit eating smaller more frequent meals can help prevent them if you're on the go keep some snacks crackers fruit wholemeal biscuits in your bag exercise frequently some evidence shows that regular exercise can reduce the frequency and severity of headaches and migraines take a cold shower a simple but effective remedy for some migraines it works by constricting the dilated blood vessels often bringing fast if brief relief if you can't take a shower splash some cool water on your face you could try acupuncture needle acupuncture treatment is considered safe and effective for headaches and morning sickness ask your midwife or friends for the name of an acupuncturist or you could contact the british acupuncture council at www acupuncture org uk for details of a registered practitioner near you sniff green apples scientists at the smell and taste treatment center in chicago say the smell of certain foods such as green apples can keep migraine headaches at bay but you have to like the scent for the pain relieving magic to work well it's worth a try best wishes x Fibromyalgia Osteoarthritis Essential oil Stomach cancer Hypertension Coffee Folic acid Coeliac disease Hay fever Medical prescription Vitamin C Breech birth Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Propranolol Yarrow Repetitive strain injury Insulin AIDS Pain Tocopherol Equine conformation Dog Dieting Insomnia Masturbation Menstrual cycle Aspirin Anorexia nervosa Cephalic disorder Rosacea COX-2 inhibitor Obesity Veganism Decompression sickness Aspartame Chlorpromazine Emergency contraception Hyperthermia Acne Bipolar disorder Turner syndrome Professional wrestling holds Lamotrigine Osteopathy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Tai Chi Chuan Mattress Caffeine Homeopathy LSD Anxiety Baldness treatments
