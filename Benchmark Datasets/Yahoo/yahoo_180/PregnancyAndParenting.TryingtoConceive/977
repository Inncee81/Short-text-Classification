when you stop using your birth control when do you ovulate next do you still ovulate on the same schedule like days after the first day of your last period or would it be all screwed up from being on bc and then stopping i am trying to figure out when i ovulated i started my period on the th and i should have ovulated arounnd the th right just wondering if stopping bc makes you ovulate later or sooner thanks no stopping b c has messed up my entire menstrual cycle because our cycles tend to be highly irregular just coming off the pill it is often difficult to pinpoint when ovulation has occured most doctors will tell you to wait at least months before trying to conceive not because it can affect the baby but so they can determine with at least a little more certainty when conception may have taken place estimating when conception takes place is difficult enough but it makes it easier when you have had several regular cycles in a row it is important to know that most woman do not ovulate at exactly days every woman is different therefore every woman's menstrual cycle is different sure you can calculate what your estimated fertility window is but again hence the word estimation it is mostly luck and good timing Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Ovulation Ovarian cyst Polycystic ovary syndrome In vitro fertilisation Birth control Niddah Estrus cycle Menstrual cup Progesterone Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Puberty Fertilisation Sexual abstinence Infertility Bipolar disorder Urinary incontinence Miscarriage Apollo 8 Conifer cones Migraine Anovulation Childbirth Congenital adrenal hyperplasia CPU design Flowering plant Ovary Ovum Hebrew calendar Premenstrual stress syndrome Ovarian cancer Compiler optimization Social rule Endometrium Multiple birth Gonorrhoea Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual intercourse Chinese calendar End times Inflation Breast cancer Entropy Central processing unit Premature birth Julian day Computus Androgen insensitivity syndrome Depo Provera Dynamic random access memory RISC Biorhythm Abortion debate Malaria Sanitary towel Sleep Carpel Ozone depletion Lancelot Shifting cultivation Tide Pregnancy test Slide rule Time Pelvic inflammatory disease Female reproductive system (human) Ozone hole Computer multitasking Full moon cycle Dominical letter Probability Gamma ray burst Microeconomics Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia The Contender (television series) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Meiosis Hipparchus (astronomer) Numerology Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Fermi paradox Tour de France Sea level rise The Amazing Race Astrology AFI 100 Years series Anorexia nervosa Moss Systems engineering Psoriasis Human chorionic gonadotropin
