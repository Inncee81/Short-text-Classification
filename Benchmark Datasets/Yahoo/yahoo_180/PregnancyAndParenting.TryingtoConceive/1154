too early for a pg test my last period was on july and it is now aug i think i am having symptoms of pg my nipples are sore nauseated throughout the day bloated stomach and so on if i were to take a test tomorrow would it be too early to get the correct result i have experienced miscarriages one in sept and one on march just afraid to be let down again because we want a baby yes it would be too early to test sometimes we create symptoms in our heads only to be disappointed depending on how long your cycles are it would be wise from an emotional perspective to wait it out until the week you would expect your period normally sounds like later this week if you test too early and its negative you'll be let down wait until you can truly tell and you won't have to deal with an emotional rollercoaster good luck to you and if it didn't work you always have next month your baby will come to you when its time for your and your partner i believe our babies choose us and when the time is right you'll be pregnant Pregnancy Breastfeeding Miscarriage Stomach cancer Group A streptococcal infection Obstetrics Coeliac disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Paroxetine Abortion Chronic fatigue syndrome Heartworm Clinical depression Alcoholism Stroke Prostate cancer Extreme Programming Urinary incontinence Cytomegalovirus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Spina bifida Menstrual cycle Multiple sclerosis Infantilism Prenatal diagnosis AIDS Morning sickness Roman calendar Breast cancer Debugging Eddie Guerrero HIV test Polycystic ovary syndrome Lance Armstrong Numerology Traumatic brain injury Charles Darwin's illness Infectious mononucleosis Prolactinoma Domestic violence Medicine Pregnancy test Stillbirth Maya calendar Syphilis The Chemical Brothers Social rule Migraine Neighbours Pneumonia Art Guinea pig Abortion debate Emotions (Mariah Carey song) Paget's disease of bone Childbirth Pelvic inflammatory disease UK Singles Chart Lactose intolerance Jeopardy!
