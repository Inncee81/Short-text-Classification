if you concieve the day before your period will it show up on a pregnancy test the next day the box says it will tell you from teh first day of your missed period okay let's start from the beginning ovulation dictates when your period is due if you ovulate on time then yes the box is correct your period would be due as scheduled and yes you would be able to take a test that day and get an accurate result however if you ovulate late your period would then be late too and in that case if you test the day your period would normally be due your test would not be accurate if you ovulate late you would then have to recalculate when your next period is due and then test on that day technically if you conceive the day before your period is anticipated that would mean you ovulated weeks later than expected and therefore you should now test two weeks later for pregnancy for the record a woman's menstruates about days after ovulation give or take a day in some cases good luck Pregnancy Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Pregnancy test Niddah In vitro fertilisation Estrus cycle Emergency contraception Ovulation Ovarian cyst Sexual reproduction Oral contraceptive Infertility Gynecologic hemorrhage Abortion Sexual abstinence Birth control Progesterone Multiple birth Miscarriage Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Gonorrhoea Premenstrual stress syndrome Ovarian cancer Drug test Prolactinoma Urinary incontinence Endometriosis Obstetrics Female reproductive system (human) HIV test Breastfeeding Estradiol Software testing Soap opera Twin Human chorionic gonadotropin Prenatal diagnosis 2005 English cricket season Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Flowering plant Debugging International cricket in 2005 Turner syndrome Premature birth Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Billboard Hot 100 Puberty Game programming Endometrial cancer History of sex Social rule Cephalic disorder Maya calendar Anemia Gregorian calendar Compiler optimization Reliability engineering Ovary Aortic dissection Medical record Spina bifida MTV2 Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Collision detection Hebrew calendar Pearson's chi-square test Quicksort Australian cricket team STS-61 Menstrual cup USS Chicago (CA-136) Gravity Probe B Gynaecology UK Singles Chart Cytomegalovirus Fertilisation Ken Jennings George W.
