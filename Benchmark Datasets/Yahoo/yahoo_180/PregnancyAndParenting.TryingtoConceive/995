lh surge and ovulation i have done some reading on this but i am still abit foggy i have had two days of positive opk tests for lh surge but i have yet to have a shift in bbt's indicating ovulation after you have ovulated will the opk test show negative how many days in a row can you show a positive for opk's and not actually ovulate i am already on cycle day the last days i have had egg white cervical fluid and the last two days i have had positives on my opk tests and i will test again today same time as the last two days if it is negative today does that mean i ovulated and should expect a temperature rise tomorrow morning i am kind of confused i have never had a cycle where i ovulated so late could this be an anovulitiry cycle and still have the lh surge is there any one who can shed some light thanks i am in no way stressed we weren't even going to begin ttc until next month but i got impatient i am just curious because i have had positives and no sign of ovulation yet yeah bd on both opk pos days hi first off you can test positive on an opk and not actually ovulate all the ovulation predictor kit does is test for the lh surge not for actual ovulation with the bbt it is normal to get a temp rise two days after you test positive on an opk for some women it may take three days the reason is that the test is catching the lh on it's upwards surge and it's most concentrated in the urine you may have caught it on the upwards swing that's why you got two days of positive results if you're still testing positive and there is no rise in your temp then you probably didn't ovulate this month i hope you did though good luck also try www peeonastick com it gives good advice on using opks and all Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Ovulation Polycystic ovary syndrome Puberty Pregnancy test HIV test Temperature Infertility Ovarian cancer Progesterone Tide Jet engine Drug test STS-62 Ovarian cyst Estrus cycle Emergency contraception Hormone replacement therapy (trans) In vitro fertilisation Cat Urinary incontinence Cytomegalovirus Birth control Inflation 2000 Australian Grand Prix Solar variation Fast bowling Niddah Experiment 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Weather lore Intelligence quotient Red Fox Sea level rise Axial compressor Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Lance Armstrong Apollo Guidance Computer Childbirth Thermal power station Ben Johnson (athlete) Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Negative and non-negative numbers Penis Maya calendar Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Oral contraceptive Prostate cancer Drag racing Flowering plant Homeostasis Baseball Entropy Premenstrual stress syndrome Gynaecology E85 Conifer cones Hyperinflation Poker jargon Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Cheating in Counter-Strike Human chorionic gonadotropin United Kingdom general election, 2005 Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Daylight saving time Biodiesel Hurricane Rita Global warming and agriculture Normal distribution Billboard Hot 100 Cancer Karma CPU cache Sun Time Nuclear power Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Weather forecasting Plame affair Search for Tomorrow Marine aquarium Rabbit Carbon dioxide Phonon Human papillomavirus Climate of the United Kingdom Norwegian Campaign Sexual abstinence Bipolar disorder Coeliac disease Singlish Solar power Avalanche The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Paleoclimatology Arizona National Football League
