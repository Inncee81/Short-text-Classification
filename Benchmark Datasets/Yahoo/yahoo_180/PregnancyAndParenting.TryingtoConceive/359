can you conceive outside of your ovulation period sorry to be so naive but we've only just started ttc and i'm a bit confused about the whole thing i would highly suggest purchasing the clearblue easy digital ovulation kit which can be bought at target for instead of which is at most retail shops this digital kit has tests which you pee on every morning preferrably in the afternoon time and if you're about to ovulate hours it will show you a digital smiley face if you're not about to ovulate then it will just show you a circle the test detects lh surge which is a hormone that is at it's top peak when you're about to ovulate release the egg once you see that smiley face you should have sex within hours sperm can stay in your body anywhere from days obviously this depends on both partners' health also the reason i would suggest this digital test rather than other tests in the market is because the other aren't digital you have to kind of guess yourself by looking at pink lines if you're okay with that then you can purchase the first response ovulation kit it's cheaper and has more tests but it's not digital check out the clearblue easy digital opk http www clearblueeasy com digitalovul also i've read that before you have sex it's good for the male to drink coffee about min because the sperm are more jumpy and can get to the egg faster especially the y sperm boy sperm good luck and baby dust to you Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Puberty Ovulation In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Emergency contraception Pregnancy Infertility Androgen insensitivity syndrome Oral contraceptive Polycystic ovary syndrome Birth control Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pregnancy test Niddah HIV test Drosophila melanogaster Transsexuality Breastfeeding Milk Social rule Hypoglycemia Sea-Monkey Ovary RFID IBM PC compatible Sperm Whale Ovum Shark Orgasm Billboard Hot 100 Paragliding Hard disk Digital photography Abortion debate DVD Anal sex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma History of Test cricket (to 1883) Friends Coffee Organic food Whale The Amazing Race Estrus cycle Smiley Smile Modem Urinary incontinence Hardware random number generator Copy protection Spider Airsoft Daylight saving time Intersexuality Sears Holdings Corporation Neopets The Chemical Brothers The Beach Boys Commodore 64 UK Singles Chart Oral sex German car number plates PlayStation Portable Target Corporation Illegal drug trade Pornographic movie Only Fools and Horses Sound Blaster Wal-Mart $ale of the Century Oscilloscope M16 (rifle) Collision detection Jam (TV series) Sesame Street Nintendo DS Floppy disk Fertilisation Human sexual behavior Drag racing Octopus card Sinclair Research Ltd Cheating in Counter-Strike Roswell UFO incident Pretty Good Privacy Computer insecurity Wild Honey Toronto Streetcar System Strap-on dildo IPod Condom Game show Estradiol Penis Motion picture rating system Parthenogenesis
