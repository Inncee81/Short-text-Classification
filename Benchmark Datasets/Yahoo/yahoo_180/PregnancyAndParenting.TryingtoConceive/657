how to help my wife my wife and i have been trying to have a baby for a long time and emotionally it is hard on us both what can i say or do to make it a little easier for her only you know your wife and what will help her through this but i have been ttc for years so i can give you some ideas of things that have helped me over the years it helps when my husband has hope for us for example he says things like when we have a baby instead of if we have a baby he talks to me about what he is thinking he attends all the drs appts with me and afterwards he always wants to discuss how things went asks questions and is just a part of the process in general he usually is pretty in tune to when my period is due and when i will be testing for pregnancy and he does nice things for me around that time bringing home dinner asking me to a movie bringing me flowers he doesn't get mad or fight with me when my period does come and i'm feeling crappy he just lets me complain i think you've already shown that you are a caring husband just by taking the time to find ways to help your wife Theory of conduct Infantilism Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Jam (TV series) Pregnancy Grandview, U.S.A.
