ok questions about cm i have read that fertile cervical mucus leading up to ovulation is white or yellowish in color and its not very stretchy the cm when you are ovulating is clear stretchy and transparent so heres my question can sperm effect the color of your cm also i know that if you stretch sperm it stretches like a spider web not just one single strand i am not exactly sure what hostile cm is but if you have very stretchy egg white cm but it has the yellowish color does this mean you have not yet hit ovulation but are close or is this the sperm making it that color thank you for any help i am weeks pregnant i used the cervical mucous checks only because that is what is the best way to detect your most fertile time i can tell you from experience and research that the thicker and whiter it is the more fertile you are i'll just explain it by going through the usual cervical mucous phases it usually lasts about three days day approaching ovulation clear and slippery day ovulation thick white like egg white stretchy but not always stretchy day ovulation ending mucous begins to dry up i know this is probably gross but i also should add that the best way to know which phase the cervical mucous is in is to stick your finger in there and get a sample as close to your cervix as possible don't rely as much on what is on your underwear it's also good to see what phase its in before you have sex and get sperm in there because it's too hard to distinguish what is going on with your cervical mucous when it's mixed with sperm Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Ovulation Cervix Gonorrhoea Puberty Pregnancy Sexual reproduction Oral contraceptive In vitro fertilisation Birth control Fertilisation Infertility Emergency contraception Miscarriage Cervical cancer Cancer Knitting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Niddah Ovary Endometriosis Human papillomavirus Cystic fibrosis Androgen insensitivity syndrome Estrus cycle Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma DNA Spider Paint Semen Chimera (genetics) Bird Abortion Ovum Childbirth Sperm Whale Pregnancy test Textile manufacturing terminology Progesterone Estradiol Cervical vertebrae Flowering plant Fetal development Medical analysis of circumcision Fruit Earthworm Mucus Gynaecology Moss CPU cache Obstetrics Color Psoriasis Orgasm Octopus Vertebral column Chiropractic Liquid crystal Leather American lobster Frog Endometrial cancer Autonomic nervous system Carbon dioxide Spermatozoon Carpel Mixed martial arts Conifer cones Coffee Textile manufacturing AIDS reappraisal Xenomorph Shark Wood Snooker Ectopic pregnancy Seed Abortion debate Timpani Capercaillie Homosexuality and medical science Thoracic vertebrae Strap-on dildo Stomach cancer Sterilization (surgical procedure) Tofu Vagina Roswell UFO incident Apollo 8 Artificial insemination Banana slug Egg (biology) Glass Hydrochloric acid Mendelian inheritance
