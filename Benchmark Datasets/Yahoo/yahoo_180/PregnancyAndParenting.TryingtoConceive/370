is it true that you con control the gender of the baby when conceiving i have heard many theries like on a full moon boy on a saturday girl from the back girl from the front boy days during ovulation boy lights on boy under covers girl are any of those true and can you control what gender the baby will be check out the shettles method but it is not scientifically proven the method teaches that the girl sperm is slower but lives longer and the boy sperm is faster but doesn't live that long depending on your cervical fluid inside the girl sperm can possible live days so if you have sex few days before ovulation depending on the fluid inside of you the girl sperm can get to the egg if you have sex close to ovulation or on that day the faster boy sperm can get to them faster also if you use lubricant like ky jelly astroglide saliva etc this can kill the sperm i would suggest using preseed which is something like a lubricant but you insert it in your vagina minutes before sex you can check out www preseed com and if you read the posts a lot of ladies have gotten pregnant from it because preseed allows the sperm to live longer in that fluid as mentioned above the shettles method isn't proven but it's very popular so it doesn't hurt to try you can read more about it by google ing it also if you have your spouse bf drink coffee min before sex it makes the sperm swim faster another myth but it's worked for a lot of ladies more myths from the back boy because if you're about to ovulate it gets the sperm closest to the cervix so since the boy sperm are faster they're more than likely to get to the egg faster from the front girl good luck Menstrual cycle Birth control Sexual intercourse Puberty Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fertilisation Sexual reproduction Oral contraceptive Condom Strap-on dildo Ovulation Sperm Whale Pregnancy Personal lubricant Menstrual cup Oral sex Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Emergency contraception Urinary incontinence Safe sex Friends Prostate cancer Abortion debate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Spider Masturbation Human sexual behavior Niddah Intersexuality Friction Artificial insemination Jon Secada Pornographic movie Vagina Intact dilation and extraction Semen Abortion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha Orgasm Obstetrics Intersex surgery About a Boy Female reproductive system (human) Twin Sex assignment Internal ballistics Sex and the City Swimming Vaginal lubrication John Money Speed of light EastEnders Cat Child sexuality The Catcher in the Rye Miscarriage Gay slang Moon Dragon Booster Diaphragm (contraceptive) Action potential Hebrew calendar Freenet Floppy disk Infantilism Little Britain Futurama (TV series - season 5) Soul Faster-than-light Childbirth Apollo 8 Moss Apollo 11 Ovum Shark Drosophila melanogaster Equine conformation Contredanse The Chemical Brothers Ovary Kurt Cobain George Costanza History of intersex surgery Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Something Positive Gonorrhoea Marilyn Monroe Dialysis Sex toy Archery Great Teacher Onizuka
