regarding my bbt could i get some advice hello i was just wondering if this is normal i just starting charting this cycle and im confused i am trying to be more aware of my cm quality etc and taking my temp at the same time every morning so here is my questions my temp was pretty steady each morning until a few days ago when it started changing for example day it was day it was day and today i did not have eggwhite cm yet so i dont know if i already ovulate and not realize it i really dont know how to check my cervix yet or exactly what to look for i have tried but i dont really know exactly how far it need to check or where exaclty it is i have read tcoyf and seen the pictures but im still confused can you please help thank you the temp dip is usually due to the estrogen surge that precedes ovulation so i would expect that you might ovulate in the next day or so it is typically cd anyway so that makes sense your vagina is about the same length as your middle finger try sitting on the toilet or putting one leg up on the edge of the tub and inserting one clean dry finger inside your cervix is like a very small penis shaped dealy o that lengthens and shortens throughout your cycle and has a hole in the middle the os like the hole in a penis when you're fertile the cervix is shorter and it is way up at the top of your vagina so you can barely feel it it's soft like the your cheek and way up high really flush with the top of the vagina so that sperm can easily slip in there to find the egg when it's high you can't really find it i can't reach it any longer if you want to feel what low cervical position is feel it when you're about to get your period and it will be much lower in your vagina and feel more like the tip of your nose for me it's literally an inch or so long then and i can easily feel the opening and the penis shape of the cervix hth Menstrual cycle Menstrual cup Strap-on dildo Sexual reproduction Androgen insensitivity syndrome Vagina Condom Pregnancy Birth control Knife Violin Cervix Drill bit In vitro fertilisation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Sexual intercourse Ovulation Equine conformation Intersex surgery Penis Female reproductive system (human) Cervical cancer Textile manufacturing Fertilisation Childbirth Floppy disk Anal sex Niddah Poker jargon Casting Cat Orgasm Bong Ovary Tampon Mattress Diaphragm (contraceptive) Emergency contraception Internal ballistics Professional wrestling holds Milton H.
