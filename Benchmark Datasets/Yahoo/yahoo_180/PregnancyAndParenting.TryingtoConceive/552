can i still get pregnant okay so this may sound like a completely dumb question but my huband and i want to have a baby we have been married for almost one year and we don't use protection ever my dad physically abused me when i was young and used to punch me in the stomach really hard i am afraid that i won't be able to get prgnant i went to a doctor when i was and he just told me that my ovaries were a little enlarged also i was on birth control for almost years am i just worrying for no reason enlarges ovaries are not that uncommon i believe one of the biggest issues for you is whether or not you get your yearly exam if you don't you need to and if you do and the doc has never noticed a problem that is a good sign it sometimes takes while for bc to fully leave your system and it sometimes takes a while no matter what else to get pregnant i wouldnt say your worrying for no reason but i do recommend that you try to not worrying can hampen your efforts and make the process longer best of luck to you and your hubby and i am sorry your dad is such a jerk Breastfeeding Social rule Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Puberty In vitro fertilisation Abortion debate The Fairly OddParents Piccolo Junior Saga Pregnancy Stomach cancer Kodocha EastEnders Joke Phoebe Halliwell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Back to the Future Fathers' rights Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Boom Town (Doctor Who) Cancer Colorectal cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Menstrual cycle Abortion Knots Landing Polycystic ovary syndrome Psoriasis Anxiety Russian joke Trusted computing Ovary Ben Johnson (athlete) Childbirth Hey Arnold!
