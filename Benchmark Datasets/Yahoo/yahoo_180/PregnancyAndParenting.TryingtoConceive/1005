ok i was wondering if i am still able to get pregnant even though i had two abortions in the past i went through with my first pregnancy and had a little boy he is now and the other is something i dont like to talk about going through an abortion or abortions would not hinder your ability to conceive later unless you had the abortions per se without a doctor present or by your hand in that instance you may have complications you should see your family doctor and explain the circumstances express your concerns and fears about not being about to conceive after the abortions good luck Abortion Pregnancy Miscarriage Teenage pregnancy Birth control Abortion in the United States Abortion debate Roe v.
