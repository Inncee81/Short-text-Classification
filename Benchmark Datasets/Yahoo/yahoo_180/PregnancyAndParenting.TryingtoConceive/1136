premarital sex birthcontrol my boyfriend and i had a scare when i was weeks late for my period after that we both decided that we have too much to do before we start a family and neither of us wanted to chance getting pregnant i'm he's and both of us have jobs and are in school its been almost months since our last intercourse and now we are both having nd thoughts on our decision i want to start birth control so that we will both have peace of mind if we resume sex but i'm afraid of the consequences side effects of birth control i need some advice should i start birthcontrol or should we continue our pact of no sex until marriage obviously abstinence is the only sure fire way to not get pregnant every time you have sex even with protection there is a slim possibility of getting pregnant my boyfriend and i had a similar scare at your age right afterward i got on the pill and every time we have sex he uses a condom i have found there's really no downsides to the pill when i first started using it my breasts became just a little bit more tender but my period only lasts days theres absolutely no cramping and my flow is very light of course every woman's body reacts differently to the pill but all of my girlfriends who are on some kind of birth control pill or patch have no severe reactions to it one friend received the monthly shot and got severely sick every time she got it so that's the only one i wouldn't recommend the only real downside is the monetary cost if you're low on money or don't want your parents to know go to your local planned parenthood they'll give you a pelvic exam and prescribe you a pill that you can afford my best friend went that route and it worked out well if you are going to have sex though use a condom and the pill trust me i'm supremely paranoid and having a double defense system really helps good luck Birth control Oral contraceptive Sexual abstinence Fertility awareness Condom Sex education Knots Landing EastEnders Emergency contraception Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Neighbours Endometriosis Prostate cancer Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Oral sex Boston Public Urinary incontinence Sexual revolution Teenage pregnancy Religion and sexuality Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexually-transmitted infection Herpes simplex virus Breastfeeding Sex and the City Safe sex Kodocha Pelvic inflammatory disease AIDS Gender role One Tree Hill (TV series) Acne Social rule Fasting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Planned Parenthood History of sex Human sexual behavior George Costanza Abortion Radio Yerevan Folic acid Elvis Presley The Catcher in the Rye Puberty Transsexuality Roe v.
