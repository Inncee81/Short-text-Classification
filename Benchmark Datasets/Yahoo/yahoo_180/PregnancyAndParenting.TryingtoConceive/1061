if you have no menstral cycle do you still ovulate i was on the depo injection for about months i bled the whole time i was on it my husband and i decided to ttc and i went off of the injection since then i have stopped bleeding all together and have not had a cycle yet is it possible to conceive while not having a cycle well i know anything is possible but is it likely thanks in advance for any information i need all i can get at this time i think you could probably ovulate and not bleed but i don't think you have a high chance to get pregnant without a period because the reason you have a period each month is because your body anticipates that you will get pregnant and it builds up blood and nutrients in the lining of your uterus and then when an unfertilized egg does not implant to the lining it is shed in what becomes your period so to me it would seem your uterus is not preparing itself for implantation also women can have a period every month and never ovulate i would talk to your doctor because there are medications that can be used to cause your body to have a period Menstrual cycle Pregnancy In vitro fertilisation Fertility awareness Infertility Ovulation Miscarriage Oral contraceptive Endometrium Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Progesterone Ovarian cancer Fertilisation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Childbirth Endometriosis Emergency contraception Birth control Obstetrics Ectopic pregnancy Stomach cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Abortion Intravenous therapy Female reproductive system (human) Gynaecology Niddah Estrus cycle Human cloning Uterus Puberty Tsetse fly Endometrial cancer Erythropoietin Ovary Gynecologic hemorrhage Stroke Prostate cancer Twin Stem cell Menstrual cup Ovum Pregnancy test Premature birth Human chorionic gonadotropin Castration Folic acid Baldness treatments Psoriasis Breast implant Cancer Bleeding Sexual abstinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Depo Provera Intact dilation and extraction Embryo transfer Coeliac disease Blood Multiple birth Sexual intercourse Anovulation Insulin Tocopherol Vaginal bleeding Ovarian cyst Warfarin Pregnancy (mammals) Tourniquet Diabetic retinopathy Borg Friends Prolactinoma Computed tomography Toronto Subway and RT Female genital cutting Lethal injection Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Acne Prenatal diagnosis EastEnders Caesarean section Migraine Colorectal cancer Hysterectomy First aid Haemophilia Animal testing Wound Maprotiline Cryptorchidism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Circulatory system Recovery position Subdural hematoma Toronto Transit Commission Methotrexate Boom Town (Doctor Who)
