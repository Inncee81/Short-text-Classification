how accurate are pregnancy tests that have been sitting around in your home for a few months this morning i used a pregnancy test that i purchased from the hpt online store about a few months ago it was still in the original packaging but has been sitting around since march right now i am about days late for my period but my last period i think was actually implantation because it started two days before it was expected and was brown and pink then it stopped and i had a light period i tested then with a similar test but i figured if i just implanted right before my period then it would be too early to make a long story short my periods are always this glamorous production meaning i get cramps and nausea a full week before it actually comes now i have nothing but a big stomach constipation and constant sleep so to get to my reason for posting this question will using old test give me a false response and if so what tests generally work well i am going to wal mart today but will not test again until wednesday morning it could be expired or if you read the instructions it says you should not store below certain temperature in your home or over a high one we had a particularily warm summer hitting over the 's which i k now is about what the box says normally do not store over degrees so think of that too i tested with first response and got the correct positive after testing with a few others and getting negatives good luck Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Sears Holdings Corporation Thermoregulation Stomach cancer Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 SAT Drug test Pregnancy test Mattress RFID Dialysis Fertility awareness Wal-Mart Normal distribution STS-62 Gastroparesis Abortion Coeliac disease Abduction Phenomenon Scientology beliefs and practices GED Oscilloscope Weather lore Global climate model Daylight saving time $ale of the Century RISC Hubble Space Telescope Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Capercaillie Sea level rise Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Climate of the United Kingdom Ovarian cancer Big Bang Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Circuit design Solar power Heinkel He 112 Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Heinkel He 100 Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Emergency contraception Dog USS Yorktown (CV-10) Prenatal diagnosis Haloperidol Prostate cancer Wheel of Fortune Aortic dissection Diode Bayesian inference Adjustable gastric band Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 STS-61 Ozone depletion Billboard Hot 100 Paul Is Dead Soap opera UK Singles Chart Explosive material 2000 Australian Grand Prix Craps Ceramics Young Earth creationism Gregorian calendar Poker jargon Computus Psoriasis Steam (content delivery) Jeopardy!
