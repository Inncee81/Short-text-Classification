every kind there is ok i know i can google this but it will take forever so i just thought i'd ask what is every single kind of pregnancy symptom i know that every woman does not get all symptoms but i'm just wondering i have pretty much convinced myself that i can't get pregnant but my body is being weird the reason i think i can't get pregnant is because my dr diagnosed me with p c o s polycystic ovarian syndrome i know some women can have kids with this my sister did but i seriously rarely have no periods i just had one last month and so me and my husband did what we needed to do but i dunno thanks for answering i also suffer from pcos and i didn't get periods for years i wasn't diagnosed until last summer after suffering with the disease for a very long time my doctor put me on a drug called metformin aka glucophage which stabilizes insulin levels women with pcos are insulin resistant and kick starts ovulation it's possible to have a period without ovulating so just because you had a period doesn't necessarily mean you're going to get pregnant my husband and i couldn't figure it out long story short went on the metformin in august went in for a check up months later was months pregnant i had no symptoms at all i also hadn't had a period in over a year and that usually is a clear indicator to suspect you're pregnant i lost the baby at months no particular reason other than it most likely had to do with the fact i have pcos and my uterus was blighted at the time i had a d c after the miscarriage waited weeks had normal periods and i'm pregnant again this time i knew i got pregnant the night it happened i knew i was ovulating i missed my period and took a test it was i then started experiencing morning sickness sore breasts frequent urination most of your classic signs please just be aware that women with pcos have a chance of miscarrying at any time during their pregnancy i'm almost months along now and i still worry every day even though everything is going alright pcos is a horrible thing to suffer from but there are ways to manage it and it's the most common reproductive problem in women and it is the most misdiagnosed problem the symptoms are so vague doctors don't think of it most of the time good luck and don't give up if you're not on metformin talk to your doctor about getting on it it's changed my life Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertility awareness Prostate cancer Obstetrics Urinary incontinence Insulin resistance Ovarian cancer Coeliac disease Endometriosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Metformin Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia EastEnders Cytomegalovirus Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Oral contraceptive Abortion Infertility In vitro fertilisation Folic acid Obesity Milton H.
