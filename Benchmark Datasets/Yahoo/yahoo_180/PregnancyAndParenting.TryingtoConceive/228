myth infertility is a female problem fact women and men bear nearly equal responsibility when it comes to infertility infertility is a female problem in of cases a male problem in of cases and a combined problem of the couple or unexplained in of cases that is why we stress that it is important for both members of the couple to undergo medical evaluation and as necessary treatment myth everyone else gets pregnant easily fact a normally fertile couple has only about a chance of conceiving each month more than million people of childbearing age in the u s experience infertility every year and million seek treatment myth relax and you'll get pregnant fact infertility is a disease of the reproductive system although stress can sometimes affect hormone levels and ovulation emotions are not keeping you from getting pregnant the stress and intense emotions you feel are the result of infertility not usually its cause myth be patient you'll get pregnant with time fact infertility is a medical problem that usually requires treatment at least of those who complete an infertility evaluation will respond to treatment with a successful pregnancy those who do not seek help have a spontaneous cure rate of only about which means couples have a times greater chance of conceiving if they get medical help for their infertility problem if you are concerned for any reason about your ability to conceive make an appointment with a medical doctor for an evaluation as soon as possible especially if you as a woman are over the age of have irregular cycles experience painful menstrual periods have suffered several pregnancy losses have used an intrauterine device iud have had a pelvic infection or abdominal surgery if you are a man or a woman and have had exposure through your mother's pregnancy to the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol des or if you are a man and have had a testicular injury or frequent genitourinary infections see a doctor for evaluation myth just adopt a baby and you'll get pregnant fact unfortunately this persistent myth is one of the most painful for individuals and couples to hear because it suggests that adoption is a treatment for infertility not the happy resolution to infertility that it is for millions of families every year more important this statement simply is not true studies reveal that pregnancy rates for couples after adopting are the same as those for couples who do not adopt myth you're probably doing it wrong fact infertility is a medical condition not a sexual disorder on the other hand the timing of sexual intercourse is crucial to the conception process myth your partner will leave you because of your infertility fact the rewards of an intimate relationship require hard work and diligent effort every day from both partners regardless of the difficult challenges posed by infertility without doubt infertility represents a major life crisis one that certainly affects a marriage or partnership fortunately most couples survive the infertility crisis and learn new ways of relating to each other that deepen their relationship you may hit a few rough patches along the way but as long as you keep the lines of communication open there is a good chance you will grow closer through the experience myth maybe you are just not meant to be a parent fact you and your partner have made the decision to become parents because you know how much love and support you have to offer a child having a medical condition that makes it difficult to conceive and bear a child is not a sign from god from the universe from society or for that matter from anywhere else about your suitability to raise children or whether it is meant for you to become a parent myth my life will be overwhelmed with infertility and nothing will ever be the same fact infertility is a life crisis and it will probably have an effect on all areas of your life at one time or another it is perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed with surges of guilt anxiety and sadness at the same time the desire to have a child may fill you with single minded determination at the expense of other areas of your life including your most personal relationships long held notions about who you are and how you envision your life may be tested but you will eventually move through this crisis because resolving infertility is a process that may require you to let go of your initial vision of bearing a biological child it is important to recognize that feelings of loss and grief are common although the emotions and issues surrounding infertility may surface throughout your life in predictable and unpredictable times and ways at menopause for example the intense struggle you are facing now will resolve itself as you work through each decision in the infertility process and move along your unique life path Emergency contraception Charles Darwin's illness Goodness and value theory Hypertension Homosexuality and transgender
