me and my dh have been ttc for month we have sex once a day and no luck i dont no what is wrong we are both fertile and i even sit with my legs up afterwards ok the fact that you said you are having sex every day indicates to me that you really don't know your body and when you actually ovulate i would highly suggest you start charting your temps each day in bed before getting up eating or drinking search on t internet for some good bbt sites to help you basically by doing this it willclearly indicate to you when your most fertile days are also every day is not always the best way to get pg as usually the sperm needs a day to charge up again it is told by fertility specialists to have sex only every days if after a few months of ttc while knowing your body better you are still not pg then perhaps ask to see someone for some basica tests on you both dr's however don't consider you have a problem unless you have been ttc for a year at least with no success take your pre natal vitamins give hubby some vit c e zink and good luck Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Puberty In vitro fertilisation Toronto Transit Commission Ovulation Social rule Birth control Sexual reproduction Pregnancy Infertility Polycystic ovary syndrome Sexual intercourse Oral contraceptive Tocopherol Old wives' tale Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Toronto Subway and RT Abortion debate The Star Wars Holiday Special Androgen insensitivity syndrome Emergency contraception Fecal incontinence Guinea pig Fertilisation Germaine Greer Spider Paget's disease of bone Ploidy Friends Brian Close Shaggy dog story Prostate cancer Ovum Rod Stewart Jam (TV series) Holes (book) Birthday Sperm Whale R.
