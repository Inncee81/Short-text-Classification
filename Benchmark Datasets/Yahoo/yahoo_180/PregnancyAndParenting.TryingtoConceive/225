ttc question my husband and i are finally ready to start ttc we really want a summer baby because i am a teacher and i would love to have the whole summer home without having to pay a sub for my room for the whole maternity leave basically that means we need to conceive in either aug or sept we couldn't start earlier because of a transfer of medical insurance or it would be considered a preexisting condition and insurance would not cover baby my question is when you first started trying how long did it take i know that you can't plan things like this so exact but i am just curious basically if we do not conceive in aug or sept then we will stop and wait until next july and start again we will be less picky at that time and continue until we succeed the reason we are on such a time crunch this year is bc i am starting a new job in a new school district i will not have enough sick leave to cover my maternity leave after i run out of sick days i would basically be responsible for paying for my own sub for the remainder of the maternity leave my friend last year had to lose a month from her paycheck to cover that expense i would like to not have to do that until i have built up enough sick leave to atleast cover half of my maternity leave thanks alot of people are questioning why i would have to pay for a sub it would be the same no matter what pregnant or not if i miss more than days of work weeks i am docked pay to cover the cost the district incurs to cover my leave the district has to pay dollars a day to have someone in my room over an entire maternity leave that adds up fast so that is why we are wanting to try and do this right the first time and like i said i know it isn't always that easy but we want to try it this time and if not we will start all over next year by then i will have about weeks worth of sick time saved up assuming i don't have to use those sick days earlier i havent read the other answers yet they look too long haha but when we ttc in april we got lucky on the first try literally unfortunately it ended in m c at weeks but there is hope you can conceive that fast it all works with your ovulation it may be too late this month but next month you could track it there are things like basil body temperature charting your cervical mucus and using the site fertilityfriend com twoweekwait com is an excellent site if you have questions as an overview ovulation occurs usually days after the start of your period this is your prime time for baby making if you track your body temps first thing in the morning it can help you see when your are ovulating cervical mucus is also a great way to check so there are many resources to help you keep up with it to make it happen quicker as far as the work thing i'd think there would be legal obligations for them to cover your maternity leave but anything longer than that they'd have you cover so consult someone on that if you can legally they cant do that best of luck trying to conceive i wish you lots and lots of baby dust Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Insurance Life insurance Health insurance Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Toronto Subway and RT Infertility Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social rule EastEnders Childbirth Microeconomics Ovulation Sharon Tate $ale of the Century Breastfeeding Daylight saving time Education in Germany Social Security (United States) Shaggy dog story GED Toronto Transit Commission Atlas Comics (1950s) Ravi Shastri Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Publicly funded medicine Friends She Loves You USS Taylor (DD-468) CPU design FairTax Scarborough RT (TTC) Abortion in the United States Charmed Unemployment Blackjack Miscarriage Abortion One Tree Hill (TV series) Ben Johnson (athlete) Theory of conduct The Joker's Wild Ra (board game) Plame affair Spice Girls Fasting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wheel of Fortune Divorce The Temptations Jon Secada Contract Oasis (band) National Kidney Foundation Singapore Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Hall & Oates United Kingdom corporation tax Legal aspects of transsexualism Ocean's Twelve CPU cache Floppy disk Slow Train Coming Stomach cancer Jennifer Lopez Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Roman calendar USS Wallace L.
