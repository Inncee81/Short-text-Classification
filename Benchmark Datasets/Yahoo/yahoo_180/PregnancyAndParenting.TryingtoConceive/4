what's up with this conversation my husband and i want to have a baby it's not like we are definitely trying to get preggo but we're not doing anything to prevent it anyway the topic of a baby came up the other night and now he says that if i got preggo he would be happy but otherwise he thinks it would be best if we waited months to year until we have a child well i told him that i can't just pop one out it takes months and that just pissed him off for as long as i can remember we have both wanted this what is the deal with this new idea he has me and my guy talked about having a baby too we both agreed that it would happen in time kind of sounds like the same convo you had with yours in a year or two was the agreement we didn't do much to prevent it and now i'm months pregnant haha he was there when i found out and it was the best news we've ever gotten the thought of babies will always scare men because of the level of responsibility it brings if at first he seems withdrawn about it it will really grow on him and i'm sure he'll be just as excited as you are good luck Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Social rule Jon Secada Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Cliff Richard Time Out of Mind Fiddler on the Roof Characters of Lost Journey (band) Survivor (novel) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Miss Saigon History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Pitaten Bringing It All Back Home The Ashlee Simpson Show Romulus and Remus Yom Kippur War Theory of conduct Sharon Tate The Subtle Knife The Shining (film) The Inside Piccolo Junior Saga God Emperor of Dune Rod Stewart Therion (band) Pregnancy Divorce Vernon Schillinger Rais massacre The Emancipation of Mimi Avenue Q Sami Brady Slow Train Coming Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Good Times Abortion debate Plame affair Cool (song) Alois Hitler Neighbours True Crime: Streets of LA Melanie Wilkes Leo Wyatt Empire Burlesque Friends Edward R.
