has anyone seen these questions there are a few questions up right now asking why do people have to have their own kids why don't you just adopt if you have fertility problems or why not just forget about it the one that still amazes and repulses me said are people that egotistical that they must see their dna reproduced what the heck this is insane anyone else feel that these questions were wrote by people who don't understand basic biology or that got pregnant the first month without even trying or that has always been amazingly fertile just wondering if im the only one thinking that this is cruel im just asking if any other people with fertility issues have seen these crazy questions going around and how do they make you feel i think by my question you can see how i feel about this topic im not saying not to consider adoption not by any means i think that adoption is a great choice but peoples comments like this make the people on the other side of the fence feel alone and like they are doing something incorrectly def got some answers that i did not expect and like i said before there are ignorant people out there who don't understand and try to form opinions and that has somewhat shown thru on the answers to this questions how could someone be selfish for wanting their own baby i'm not sure what the question is but whoever is picking on hopeful parents who want a child should get a kick Adoption Abortion debate Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Species Originalism Moral Politics Social rule Intelligent design Pregnancy Autism Gene Human cloning Altruism Scientific method Economics Free will Superman Friends Goodness and value theory Game show The Apprentice 2 Generation Y Jean Grey Sant Thakar Singh Richard Feynman The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Childfree Kender EastEnders Jon Secada Western philosophy Laura Schlessinger Biology The nature of God in Western theology Simone Weil Prisoner's dilemma DNA Psychology Bayesian inference Ethics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Knots Landing Sharon Tate Francis Crick GED Humphrey Bogart Androgen insensitivity syndrome U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Internet troll Creationism Eugenics Infantilism The Origin of Species History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Science Presuppositional apologetics Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Boston Public Objectivist philosophy Education reform Transactional analysis Futurama (TV series - season 5) Slow Train Coming Abortion in the United States Philosophy The Catcher in the Rye God Emperor of Dune Infant baptism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rudolf Hermann Lotze G__del's incompleteness theorem Garth Brooks Kodocha Coming of Age (TNG episode) Horse John Howard Yoder Horus False memory Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Calvin and Hobbes Coercion Milton H.
