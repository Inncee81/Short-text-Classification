cryobank or other options what should i do i am in a committed relationship with another woman we are planning on having a baby within the next year or two i found a doctor close by who specializes in infertilty and people in my situation but she only works with the california cryobank this costs a lot of money for one vial of sperm and she told me she does three inseminations per cycle which adds up to per month just for the sperm not to mention doctor fees and shipping has anyone else out there had success with another method i know some people say if im not willing to spend that money to get pregnant then why have a child which is ridiculous and please no one respond with just go have sex with a man its free i am married that is just wrong i am just concerned that i will spend so much money on trying to get pregnant when there may be a cheaper way to do it does anyone have any suggestions i live in the chicago area i have known a few same sex couples who have used known donors they simply have this man uh perform with a cup and then using a syringe without a needle inject the ejaculate into the vagina trying as much as possible to get it near the cervix however that is only one option and not one that many people are comfortable with i would look into other cryobanks in the us i had a friend whose husband is sterile and she had bought a vial for about and only had one insem and she is due to deliver any day now i have also heard of some women buying frozen sperm and doing it at home the cheapest way the sperm is already washed so there is no chance of infection of the uterus it may be something you would want to research i don't really know much about it on a completely different note insems it sounds like your doctor is trying to milk you for money i really see no need for more than insems in any cycle even in a medicated injections cycle to stimulate the ovaries the doctors only do insems at the most and that's with a husbands sperm something just doesn't seem right with all of that In vitro fertilisation Infertility Birth control Sexual intercourse Artificial insemination Fertility awareness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Pregnancy Abortion Puberty Oral sex Urinary incontinence Sterilization (surgical procedure) Intact dilation and extraction Orgasm Miscarriage Strap-on dildo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Genital wart Breastfeeding Friends Endometriosis Intravenous therapy Obstetrics Childbirth Fertilisation Menstrual cup Condom EastEnders Gonorrhoea Neighbours Medical analysis of circumcision Sexual reproduction Domestic violence Pornographic movie Safe sex Anal sex Psoriasis Semen Cytomegalovirus Baldness treatments Premature birth Sperm Whale Social rule Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Female genital cutting Days of our Lives Sex toy Tsetse fly Knots Landing Stem cell Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Douche Human sexuality Sex organ Vagina Stomach cancer Intersex surgery Infantilism HIV test Breech birth Folic acid History of intersex surgery Malaria Surrogacy Human sexual behavior Gynaecology Cervical cancer William Shockley Kurt Cobain Religion and sexuality Diaphragm (contraceptive) Blood transfusion Twin Yoko Ono Premature ejaculation Boom Town (Doctor Who) Castration Sexual abstinence Penis Extreme Programming Gay slang
