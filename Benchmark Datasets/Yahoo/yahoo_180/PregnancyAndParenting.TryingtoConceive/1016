what the heck tcoyf related questions i started tracking my cycles recently years on depo year ttc no luck irregular periods which turned into non stop bleeding for two months straight i went to the dr who diagnosed me as insulin resistant pco put me on metformin and clomid i took the meds and the bleeding stopped i tracked my cm on day i had eggwhite then it vanished but then a couple days later i had definate ovulation pain so hubby and i had sex on that day too however my temps have only gone up a little th each day since the day with the ovulation pain did i ovulate or not how do i know if there's no clear shift in the back of the book they talk about a shift by ths of a degree but how do i know if that's what's happening to me am i just overthinking this how long do i have to wait before taking a test i'm also having a luteal phase blood test done soon what will that tell me thank you for all your insights i have read the book twice and am on my third month of charting i think you timed everything correctly i would have intercourse every other day until you see a thermal shift if you are unsure if you have a thermal shift i would still chart this month and then when charting next month see if the same thing happens my doctor said the reason to chart is to see if there is a consistant pattern each month of when you ovulate this was my first cycle of clomid and we timed intercouse starting cycle day day i took the last pill and then every other day until i have a rise in temperature my temperature from about day rose by th each morning but then on day and it went down and stayed lower and today it is just tenths higher than yesterday and it is my cycle day so we are still having intercourse every other day until it rises which i feel will be tomorrow with clomid you will ovulate anywhere from to days after you take the last pill so you may still be fertile remember a major side effect of clomid is drying up the cm so that is why you may have only had one day of eggwhite i would just keep charting and wait to see over a few months if you just have a strair step thermal shift or if this was just a fluke i would also suggest that you have sex every other day until you are sure you ovulated because sperm can live about days inside of you and you want to have it waiting in the f tube where fertilization happens when that egg is released my charting and blood test revealed that i had a luteal phase defect which my dr is hoping the clomid will correct so maybe this is what is wrong with you too just keep at it i know it can be confusing Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovulation Oral contraceptive Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Emergency contraception Pregnancy Birth control Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Puberty Endometriosis Prostate cancer Infertility Progesterone Tide Temperature Stomach cancer Ovarian cyst Sexual abstinence Tocopherol Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Apollo 8 Insulin resistance Niddah Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual intercourse Chronic fatigue syndrome Ovarian cancer Hypertension Knife Estrus cycle Folic acid Diabetes mellitus Menstrual cup Miscarriage Thermal power station Hebrew calendar Orgasm Oral sex Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cryptorchidism Spacecraft propulsion Sexual reproduction Spider Malaria Abortion debate Depo Provera Electric motor Human sexual behavior Cancer Timekeeping on Mars Bipolar disorder Multiple sclerosis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urinary incontinence Attic calendar Infantilism Alzheimer's disease Spice Girls Extreme Programming Anal sex Nuclear thermal rocket Strap-on dildo Insulin Acne Polymerase chain reaction Nutrition Musical mode Transsexuality Sea level rise Migraine STS-62 Year of the Spider Thermoregulation Stroke Growth hormone treatment Social rule Fire fighting Dialysis Milton H.
