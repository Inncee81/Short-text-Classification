how can i stop my cat from freaking out each time i try to give him a bath it takes me and my husband forever to wash our cat he keeps trying to jump around and his claws are vicious we started using scotch tape to tape up his paws but they just fall off when we get him in the water any suggestions i copy pasted how to bathe a cat everyone knows that cats hate getting wet cats generally keep themselves clean and therefore should not be bathed any more often than is absolutely necessary but they sometimes get especially dirty get bombarded by fleas or ticks or get into substances that are toxic or otherwise harmful on such occasions it is a good idea to bathe your cat here's how to keep your feline fresh and lovely as painlessly as possible steps evaluate if your cat really needs a bath there may be other ways such as brushing the cat combing or even just rubbing down with a cloth trim all nails before even attempting to wash a cat it will reduce scratching put a rubber mat in the tub or use a towel fill the tub no more than inches high depends on the size of the cat or kitten you are washing with warm water have shampoo and a small wash cloth ready you also might want to have a helper one to hold the cat one to wash have two towels that you will dry your cat with ready as well comb the fur thoroughly before you put the cat in the water especially if the cat's a long haired breed if any knots are present it will be next to impossible to remove them once the fur is wet talk quietly to your cat and keep a good grip on the neck or shoulders sometimes cats will try to get out of the tub if they prefer to only have two of their feet in the water face them towards the back of the tub and let them stand on two feet choose an appropriate shampoo for the job check with your veterinarian to select the shampoo best suited to your cat's condition human shampoos are not ph adjusted to cat's skin and medicated shampoos may be too harsh or toxic if your cat has fleas use flea shampoo made specifically for cats soak kitty from the neck down using the wash cloth you want to get the water down to the skin use a little bit of shampoo and with the water wash your cat from the neck body legs belly and tail be sure to not get shampoo in their eyes nose mouth or ears rinse thoroughly after shampooing and then rinse two more times you want all the soap out of the coat have two towels for drying ready drain the water from around the cat and press as much water out of the coat before you wrap in the towel rub gently with one towel the first one will be pretty soaked that's why you should switch to the drier one and finish drying until the cat is just damp it helps if you warm the towels in the dryer first finish the drying short haired cats can finish drying themselves in the bathroom as long as they're away from drafts for long haired cats you will have to use a comb and some more towels long hairs will become matted more easily when their fur is wet and it can help to comb them as they dry alternate shower techniques edit recognize that it may be helpful to wash your cat in a shower stall if you have one with a door not curtain the cat is essentially trapped in the shower without you having to hold on make sure the cat has good traction a small towel in the bathtub will help if you have no rubber mat or you will have a panic stricken cat that is likely to seek safety in height by trying to climb you like a tree buy a hose adapter for your bathroom sink try a waterbed store and a hose long enough to reach over the shower door and back down to the shower floor or get a hand held spray shower and a y adapter to connect it to your regular shower head hose your cat down lather her up hose down to rinse then proceed with drying some cats seem to actually enjoy the massage settings on hand held showers especially on the back of the neck and down the ridge of the back some cats can be unnerved by running water try to run a bath when they are distracted and make sure to set aside rinse water in separate prefilled containers this tends to cut down on the scratching also alternate dry shampoo option edit dust the cat with cornstarch gently pet the cat to thoroughly rub the cornstarch into its fur let the cat clean itself with its normal grooming routine this technique is far less traumatic than using water and works especially well if the cat is greasy however use it for non toxic dirt only do not use this technique if the cat has gotten into something poisonous tips edit your cat has its own personality while these are all good suggestions be aware of your cat's reactions and be prepared to adjust tactics accordingly try giving your cat a treat after the bath it might improve the tension for future baths the younger you start bathing your cat the easier it will be as the cat will become familiar with it as part of its routine brave souls may find it easier to put on old clothing and sit in the tub holding the cat however the cat typically likes to be held and letting someone else actually bathe the cat in order to reduce chances of getting scratched you may decide to put your cat inside a mesh laundry bag before bathing her make sure that you are able to keep her head above water at all times this is very traumatic for your cat and will only serve to justify its fears about bathing use it only in urgent situations i e cat covered in potentially toxic substance another idea that some have used which is not so cruel as a little funny is to attach small doll socks to their feet this will not eliminate all of the potential scratching but will help keep in mind that the socks make it difficult for the cat to walk so remove them when the bath is over another useful idea is to put some tape around your cat's paws but not too tight this will keep the cat focused on getting rid of what is on its paws instead of scratching you or even getting out of the water when you have more time run a very shallow warm bath only a cm deep or so to begin with pet the cat and give it a treat if it is food oriented continue at this depth until the cat does not panic and try to escape repeat daily until the cat treats it as part of a routine gradually increasing the depth until it is accepting standing in ins of water as a final step have someone else reassure the cat whilst you use your hand to gently make waves in the water this can take a week or months depending on the cat but it is worth the perseverence to know that you can safely bathe your pet when necessary if all else fails take your cat to a reputable professional pet groomer i e petsmart petco or a vet for their washing they will be able to use techniques to keep the cat calm some cats will do better in an empty tub or sink with water being poured on rather then being put into a tub with water already in it start early in the cat's life train your new kitten once every few weeks by giving it a bath when the cat is older there will be no problem giving it a bath try using baby shampoo it is safer than regular shampoo and if the cat splashes it will not burn their eyes it also makes the coat nice and soft this works with dogs also if you are giving your cat a flea bath wet the area around her neck first fleas will try to escape to the dry areas of the cat which can mean a mass exodus of fleas to the head and face while you are bathing a wet neck will keep them off the head and in contact with the water and flea shampoo another method includes wear long jeans and an old judo gi judo jacket karate is too thin a heavy bathrobe might work as well but the reinforced collar of the gi is ideal for obvious reasons attach a harness to the cat and then tie the harness to the front of the judo gi belt this way the cat cannot escape and should the cat decide to climb you you're relatively well protected place one towel on the floor of the tub so the cat has something to hold onto use a bucket of warm water to wet the fur using hand towels in a sponge bath manner lather and then rinse using more hand towels or a sponge and a fresh bucket of warm water done gently the cat shouldn t mind too much at the end the cat will want to climb you this is okay as you are protected by the judo gi and you can now carry the cat out using the gi as a towel and continue to dry with more towels warnings edit watch out for cat claws if you decide to bathe your cat wearing a thick long sleeved sweater is one way to avoid getting scratched badly while bathing your cat be patient and gentle it is natural for cats to fight the water because it simply doesn't feel right if you don't know how to properly hold a cat by the scruff don't do it your cat may choke don't put shampoo on their head it could get in their eyes be aware that you shouldn't bathe him frequently this technique is just in case your pet is really dirty although some cats may accept the bath without great complaints they may get nervous or angry or too scared when you try to dry them be careful during this last phase shut the door of the bathroom or the cat will run away all wet keep it calm or it will urinate creating a big mess if you find your cat objects too much to a bath by hissing at you and trying to escape then forget the bath use a wet washcloth instead it removes the outer dirt and cleans well at your local pet store you can find treated cloths that need no water to be used to groom the cat they even have a pleasant scent hair dryers are not made for cats the heat is too hot for their body do not use your hair dryer to dry your cat's fur cats absorb chemicals through their skin so they must be very well rinsed rinse until you see only clear water running off the cat make sure to use specially formulated shampoo for cats your hair is different from that of your cat and your shampoo will only irritate your cat's skin do not use flea shampoos for dogs on your cat they may contain ingredients that are harmful to your cat be sure to read the label on all products and be aware that some flea products formulated for cats may still cause a reaction do not bathe your pet any more than once every two weeks excessive bathing may remove protective oils from its fur making it appear dull and reducing the fur's natural efficiency against the elements never use sinks that are freestanding because your cat might jump and slip from being wet and hurt itself never get soap in your cat's eyes as a safeguard put to drops of eye lubricant into each eye just before bathing you can use any human labelled eye drops that are indicated as a non medicated occular lubricant often used for dry eye syndrome they are available as over the counter otc products at most drug stores examples include tears natural ii drops or as a gel genteal similarly do not get soapy water into your cat's ears to minimize the risk of creating an ear infection otitis externa put a pledget of cotton in each ear don't forget to take them out at the end of the bath the cotton may also reduce the noise and make your job easier at the very least your cat may be pre occupied with the cotton in its ears and remain distracted if your cats ears are particularly filthy gently wipe the insides with a warm damp wash cloth with no soap cat's ears contain protective waxes and oils that should not be removed always wash your towels after the bath leaving wet towels in a hamper may rot them and it is more hygienic to clean the towels quickly listen for sounds of unhappiness these sounds include hissing growling breathing hard sneezing crying and mewing avoid using a blow dryer on a short haired cat or kitten as it may burn them and or cause more trauma short haired cats can bathe themselves dry never force your cat's head under the water to wash their head and face use a wash cloth things you'll need edit basic grooming tools comb brush nail clippers towels rubber mat for bottom of tub cat shampoo and conditioner
