first time cat owner help please hi i have never owned a cat until yesterday when my kids talked me into getting them one yes they brought out the tears and all anyway i don't mind her the cat she seems really sweet and doesn't mind the kids at all my concern is that she will start to climb on my tables and counters how do you teach a cat to stay down in the outside world cats do not live only at floor level that's why you see them walking along fences or sitting on top of a wall cats like climbing and sitting up high it makes them feel safe from attack but being the curious creatures that they are it gives them the opportunity to watch everything going on around them the best way to train a cat not to do something you don't want it to is to offer them an acceptable alternative if you can provide your cat with a cat tree or jungle to climb this would be ideal as an alternative perhaps you could allow her to sit on top of a book case or on a shelf cover work tops with tin foil as they dislike the feel of it physical punishment of any kind will only make a cat fear and resent you just like kids cats respond best to positive reinforcement lots of praise affection or food treats when they do something good works much better than punishing them for bad behaviour cats are smart and they will quickly learn to adopt behaviour that brings rewards as kittens i've always taught mine basic words such as no out and down if i caught them doing something i didn't want them to i used the appropriate word and physically moved them aside now i only need to say the relevant word and they behave i know a lot of people like using a squirt bottle but personally i never have for the reasons mentioned in the web article below http www littlebigcat com index php action library act show item squirtbottlespunishmentandcatbehavior as you've mentioned that this is your first cat you might find the web sites below helpful they offer both health and behavioural advice http www sniksnak com cathealth http www messybeast com catarchive htm health enjoy your new cat Dog training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fancy rat Milton H.
