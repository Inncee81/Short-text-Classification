my cat is jealouse because we got a new cat how can i get it to come back to normal and accept the other kitty also will a full grown female cat attack the kitty im worried cuz we have a cat and we just got a new kitty it will a take a bit of time but the older cat will eventually get used to the cat it will be ticked off and annoyed by the kitten for a while but as the kitten matures they will develop a close relationship and if not close at least a relationship where they will no longer attack each other thats how all cats are i've dealt with always getting new cats when i was at my moms house and they all turned out the same way when i got my cat two years ago in my first apartment i brought a kitten home and they didn't like each other that much for about a month now they can't be separated cats a far better off when they are not alone at home by themselves when everybody is gone it is really good for them to have somebody else to play with so all in all just give it time Kitten Cat Badly Drawn Kitties Garfield Manx (cat) Shadowcat Poker jargon Hello Kitty Xiaolin Showdown Puma Azumanga Daioh Sluggy Freelance Cats (musical) Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Ranma __ characters Big Brother UK series 5 Elektra (comics) Atomic Kitten Lion RuneScape quests Pitaten Infantilism Sinfest Rent (musical) Feral cat Fruits Basket Characters from Arrested Development W.I.T.C.H.
