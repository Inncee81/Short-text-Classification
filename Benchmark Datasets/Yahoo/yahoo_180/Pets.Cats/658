why do so many cats wander around reading through this forum i saw someone ask about poisoning cats the entire population jumped up and down on him about it while i disagree with his methods i failed to see a single cat owner stand up and say anything about being responsible for the actions of their pet s not everyone likes cats and not everyone wants the neighbor's cat to stroll into their yard kill the plants birds and leave surprises usually found after stepping in while cutting the grass many suggested calling animal control while one insisted that the local animal control would respond immediately very quickly with traps or even to trap them yourself and take them to the local animal control i live sixty miles from the nearest town of over population rather than inconvenience myself for the neighbor's annoying pet wouldn't it be a better solution if the neighbor would be a better pet owner answer fairy if you'd like to discuss all the rest of the world's problems there are forii for that i'm sure yeah i guess i deserve to step in cat sh t every week because you feel that allowing a pet to wander unsupervised is somehow less irresponsible than beating the same pet as for my petty problem was that pun intended or not why did you address said problem in the same post that you attempt to belittle me i think you're just a lonely person that has issues with socializing with others and you'll grow up one day and the neighbor kids will call you that crazy cat lady if you want to discuss spousal and family abuse or if you're a victim or guilty of it i can find some links for help if you want uh oh some of you think i have issues with pets specifically cats not at all i've owned probably dozen cats in my life not all at once the litter bill would be abhorent and have always been a responsible pet owner someone asked about natural predators there are many animals that feed on mice rats moles etc hawks owls foxes coyotes snakes just to name that ones off the top of my head my issue is not with feral or wild animals my question was about irresponsibility on the part of pet owners gee krista you spending time with the answer fairy you missed the point of the question you ignored everything else i posted after the question apparently because i don't want irresponsible pet owner's to mistreat their animals i'm an animal hater on what planet is it right for me to have to move to the city because some pet owners apparently you fall into this group feel that their rights to abuse their pets trumps my right to not have to deal with something i don't care to don't own and don't want to clean up after oh well i tried to ask a civil question and apparently the more moronic of the crowd would rather make asinine comments move to the city you deserve to step in than reply with a decent answer should've known schools out for the summer and the kiddies are as unsupervised as the pets s'long oh and one more thing krista if you had the comprehension reading skills and ability to read context you might actually have seen where i said i disagree with poisoning of animals however deciding to have a knee jerk reaction on your part was seemingly more gratifying than actually attempting to understand leave off the knee and you'll realize what you look like just for the record in texas it is not illegal nor is it considered animal cruelty to kill a nuisance animal whether cat or dog or opossum or coyote or whatever that's just for those of you that think i am advocating the killing of animals and think they can scare me with threats and hyperbole naturally the world would be a better place if people were responsible for themselves and their animals personally i have indoor only cats who live a pampered life in the lap of luxury they never go outside personally i get pretty ticked off when people don't pick up their dog poop especially in parks where kids play unfortunatly the world is full of people who beat and starve their animals wives and children some people don't know any better while others just don't think animals have feelings some people even believe that it is okay to use dogs for fighting think about it you want to cast stones at people who let their cats outside but otherwise take wonderful care of their animals dude you are on the wrong path you should be ticked off at people who abuse their pets your petty annoyance is so ridiculous when you consider the atrocities that are committed every day you deserve to step in cat poop while mowing your lawn Cat Theory of conduct Feral cat Dog Shaggy dog
