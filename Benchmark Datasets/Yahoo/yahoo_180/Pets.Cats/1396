does my cat have rabies its salivating from the mouth it goes outsitde help i recently used a flea spray on him i followed the directions to a t on how to use it i will try to rub a wet wash cloth to remove any remainding residue or i will give him a bath i will call the vet thank you guys i didnt know how serious this is salivating from the mouth may mean your cat ate something that has a bitter taste or was poison to the cat it could also indicate a bad or infected tooth rabies is not very common in the us and that would probably be the least likely thing wrong with your cat there are so many more obvious reasons your cat would be salivating your cat would be very sick if it had rabies and would have more symptoms than just drowling take your cat to the vet to see what is wrong with her and if she has not been vaccinated she should not be outside in the first place there are other more common disease she can get from being outdoors such as feline leukemia and feline distemper also is your cat neutered if not another reason not to let it outdoors edit if you sprayed the cat with flea spray this is the cause many cats foam at the mouth when sprayed this is very common Cat Rabies Ferret Feral cat Pet skunk Common cold Dog Skunk Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Feline Panleukopenia Bat Kitten -phobia DDT Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fire fighting Chocolate Homeopathy Chronic fatigue syndrome Happy Tree Friends Black Death Cheese Hyperthermia Oral sex Vampire Cancer Gray Wolf Foodborne illness Stomach cancer Anthrax Garfield Tobacco smoking Felis sapiens Urinary incontinence Transmission (medicine) Tooth enamel Biblical scientific foresight Vomiting Canine parvovirus Diarrhea Toxoplasmosis Feline leukemia virus Leech Typhus Heartworm Apple Halitosis Zoonosis Hyperthyroidism Biological warfare Red Dwarf characters Ren and Stimpy Ebola Leukemia Chronic myelogenous leukemia Aloe Jam (TV series) Fire extinguisher Livestock Spotted Skunk Felidae Feline immunodeficiency virus Nepeta Casting Tuberculosis Lyme disease History of medicine Jackass: The Movie West Nile virus Bleeding Bathing Smallpox Chagas disease The Fairly OddParents Foot-and-mouth disease Pneumonia Sauna Hematophagy Malaria Thermal power station Fountain Coffee Measles Bioterrorism Methamphetamine Colorectal cancer Tomato Sleeping sickness Influenza pandemic Feral cat colony Autism Fancy rat Pasteur Institute Werewolf Traumatic brain injury Strap-on dildo
