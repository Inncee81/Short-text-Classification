what is it about baths that cats find so fascinating my cats will go and just sit in the bath no water obviously for hours on end i just don't understand why your cat may be sitting in the bathtub because they like to catch the water that drips from the faucet and drink it or they like the feeling of the cool surface on a hot day or it's a quiet place where no other family members go and it can just relax if your cat starts using the tub as a litter box or if you don't want your cats in the tub try putting water in it this should keep them out after a few days with water in it they won't venture back in again Sento Sauna Bathing Customs and etiquette of Japan Tap (valve) Hydrotherapy Hot tub Urban beach Coriolis effect Shaggy dog story The Inside Onsen Swimming pool Plumbing fixture Japanese tea ceremony Social rule Jackass: The Movie Dundas Square Abstraction Hyperthermia Nudism Punt (boat) Dishwasher Coffee Cat on a Hot Tin Roof Dymaxion house Water Fountain Hamster Hot air balloon Blink-182 The Cat in the Hat Siphon Chinchilla Textile manufacturing Bidet Bird bath Mid-levels Hard water Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Ren and Stimpy Bathroom Water (molecule) Drowning Gay bathhouse Ankara Tooth enamel Swimming Fujian tea ceremony United Airlines Flight 93 Ben Johnson (athlete) Genericized trademark Casting Fancy rat Jazz Richard Chase Kodocha Carlsbad Caverns National Park Bocas del Toro Province USS Taylor (DD-468) Big Brother (USA TV series) Felis sapiens Japanese toilet Hot spring Saga (band) Hersheypark Solar power Turbulence Diving Drink Baptism Dairy Menstrual cup Paul Newman Caffeine Socrate Finnish sauna Kyle Broflovski Cat litter Chinese tea culture Temperature Chronic fatigue syndrome Toxoplasmosis Cruising (maritime) Ice Ocean's Twelve The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Friends Saw II Sleep Geyser Turkish Van Saw (film) Ganesha Hammam The Shining (film) Indianapolis 500 USS Sea Cat (SS-399) Cannabis cultivation
