does anybody have a cat diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and kidney insufficiency the vet prescribed methymazole for the thyroid and this medication can make the kidney function worse please if you have gone through this experience share your thoughts i'm very nervous about giving this drug to my dear cat the problem is that hyperthyroidism increases the cat's blood pressure and in doing so increases the rate of a process called 'glomerular filtration' basically it actually makes the kidneys better at filtering than they would be if the cat had normal thryoid function the reason that the kidney function can get worse is that by using methimazole and treating the overactive thyroid you're revealing the true state of the kidneys it is true that some cats with kidney insufficiency may go into full blown kidney failure but most vets are very aware of this risk and will start treatment carefully and monitor closely the advantage of this treatment is that it's reversible so in many cases it's possible to find a balance between the thyroid and the kidneys neither is 'perfect' but both are good enough for the cat to remain in pretty good condition maybe talk to your vet again and get him her to talk the whole process through with you it might help to set your mind at rest i know at least one person above has mentioned radioiodine treatment but if your cat has already been diagnosed with kidney insufficiency this is not going to be much of an option once done it can't be reversed and without the influence of the overactive thyroid this is when the kidney function really does get worse actually something else that's just occured to me as i'm writing this when your vet did blood tests for the kidneys and the thyroid did they also check your cat's urine untreated hyperthyroid cats are often a bit dehydrated which increases the same things in the blood that the kidneys do and looking at the concentration of the urine is the only way to reliably tell the difference between dehydration and kidney insufficiency the vet will probably re check kidney function at the same time as they check the thyroid levels anyway so will be able to monitor what is happening i hope that has helped you and that i haven't been too technical i've spent the last years leaning to speak vet and am now having to learn how to translate it back into english if something doesn't make sense please let me know in a comment or drop me an email all the best to your cat o Hyperthyroidism Diabetes mellitus Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Kidney Hypertension Traumatic brain injury Hypoglycemia Turner syndrome Thyroid Paracetamol Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insulin Dialysis Cardiac arrhythmia Pneumonia Dehydration Coeliac disease Medicine Schizophrenia Graves-Basedow disease Folic acid Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Growth hormone treatment Vitamin C Diazepam Diabetic nephropathy Bipolar disorder Autoimmune diseases Decompression sickness Obstetrics Glycogen storage disease type I Clomipramine Renal physiology Psoriasis Cephalic disorder Stroke Psychosis Asthma Gout Acute renal failure Multiple sclerosis Nephron Lithium salt Aortic dissection Post-traumatic stress disorder Maprotiline Thyroid cancer Shock Doxepin Amiodarone Urine Prolactinoma Cirrhosis Clinical depression Endocrinology Theory of conduct Kidney stone Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Diabetic ketoacidosis Atrial fibrillation Heartworm Autism Paget's disease of bone Fibromyalgia Psychiatry IgA nephropathy Crohn's disease Epilepsy Tuberculosis Lupus erythematosus Dieting Weight training Stomach cancer Stuttering Myocardial infarction Radiation therapy Scientology beliefs and practices Chernobyl accident Group A streptococcal infection Mesothelioma Anxiety HIV test Leptospirosis Diuretic Malaria Escherichia coli O157:H7 Malignant melanoma Aphasia Addiction Cocaine
