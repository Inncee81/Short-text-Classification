are my kittens play fighting or i know this question has been asked several times and i've already looked at those answers so i'm pretty sure they're just playing but i had an additional detail to throw in there i have month old kittens from different litters had the female for about months now and the male for about days recently got him as a playmate for her when classes start again of course there was the usual scared threatened response by the female including arched back hissing growling etc well they're now fighting i'm pretty sure it's play fighting but they do it a lot i mean a lot and the female almost always hisses they can eat from the same bowl go to the same litter box and be in the same room together but when they fight it looks violent hissing growling scratching biting is this normal should i worry about them as long as no one is getting really hurt with bloodshed it's normal kittens that age are obsessed with hunting and attacking it's their instinct preparing them to kill their own prey instinct hasn't caught up with the fact that cats are no longer wild animals the kittens being from different litters also have to work out their pecking order who is dominant and there won't be peace till they do additionally they don't yet know when enough is enough and when to stop because they have no adult cats to teach them proper cat behavior so one will get too rough for the other and the other has no way to protest except by screaming and hissing all perfectly normal the uproar should settle down in a month or two as they mature and learn to work things out believe it or not it's easier to have two kittens than just one if you only had one all that killer kitten energy would be directed at you Cat Kitten Gray Wolf Ferret Puma Dog Domestic rabbit Manx (cat) Pet skunk Feral cat Animal communication Guinea pig Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Columbine High School massacre Fast bowling Asiatic Golden Cat Lion Shaggy dog story Dog training Spider Azumanga Daioh Hamster Garfield Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Piccolo Junior Saga Kakapo Brown Bear Treecat The Star Wars Holiday Special Sin City Serial killer Unreal YuYu Hakusho Milton H.
