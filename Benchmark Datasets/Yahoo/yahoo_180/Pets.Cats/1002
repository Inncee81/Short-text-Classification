cat wakes me up in the middle of the night i have an yo cat who was neutered when he was he is a rescue cat and was in a home at first and then on the streets for a few months before being rescued he is noisy which i can live with but he wakes me up in the middle of the night scratching and miaowing at the door he wants to be outdoors i try to ignore him but he goes quiet for a while and then starts up again i have tried waiting until he is quiet before i let him out of the room but it hasnt stopped the behaviour sleeping on my bed is not really an option because i am allergic to cats and i still would not get much sleep he still thinks he is a tom cat and yells and sings which is driving me crazy he wants to be outdoors spraying fighting other cats and roaming which is not safe how can i get him used to being indoors it has been three months now and his behaviour is no better than at the start when i tried converting him to being inside hmmm i sure know what you mean i have cats at night when i check the roll for cats accounted for before i go to bed cats should be inside and outside princess will stay in occasionally but i know that when i have just fallen to sleep she will come and will rattle the blinds on the window just above my head and she will growl a very low growl almost too low for a cat but it is her and she is in a panic to go outside she won't be put off for any length of time either or she will knock things off of my dresser to get my attention and then return to rattling my blinds who can sleep i must get up and let her out it sounds like you will have to give in and accept that your cat wants to be out at night it was hard for me at first but then i was getting no sleep she won i have a male cat socks who may stay in some nights or may go out some nights but it is his choice for almost the same reasons as for princess you will have to give and take with your cat sort of like a person some cats just have stronger personalities i bet he will win would sure like to know later when you have had more time to tame him to the indoors but months should tell the tale i am betting Cat Shaggy dog story Sin City Dog training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fire fighting Dog The Time Machine Silent Night, Deadly Night Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Housebreaking Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Amber Spyglass Milton H.
