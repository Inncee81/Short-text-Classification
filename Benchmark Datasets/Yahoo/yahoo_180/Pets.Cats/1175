how can i get my kitten to clean his stinky butt i have a week old kitten whose just great besides the horrible oder coming from his behind i've gone so far as to baby wipe his bottom thinking it might teach him to clean for himself i see him clean his face and tail but never his bottom i've given him a bath once but was hoping he'd learn to clean himself also we took him to the vet who says kitty is healthy so there's nothing like that going on i'm so confused if he doesn't start cleaning himself and keeps on smelling so horribly i may have to get rid of him anything i can do well i will admit i hate this cat so what kind of person gets rid of a cat because he stinks me thanks for all the help guys just continue wiping his bottom he is still young the more you do it the more he will respond and eventually do it himself i agree that you may need to get better food that will help with that problem some kittens never get to that point where they clean their butt and have to rely on us to help them but that is what we are there for to take care of them where i use to work kittens there never cleaned their butt and there was alot more on there bottom then just a smell it is just something you have to do as a cat owner as long as he is healthy there isn't a real reason to get rid of him once he continues to grow and mature he will do it himself just takes patience and time and learning Cat Garfield Pet skunk Infantilism Phoebe Buffay's songs Toilet humour Ranma __ characters Ron and Fez Manx (cat) Guinea pig Fancy rat Ferret Socialization Badly Drawn Kitties Hamster Ren and Stimpy Codename: Kids Next Door Spanking Pitaten Social rule Urinary incontinence Japanese tea ceremony Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Karen Horney The Fairly OddParents Atomic Kitten Domestic rabbit Discworld gods Theory of conduct Diseases of the honeybee Great Teacher Onizuka Piccolo Junior Saga Breastfeeding Azumanga Daioh Doug Sonic the Hedgehog Phoebe Halliwell Goatse.cx Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infant baptism Calvin and Hobbes Traumatic incident reduction Dog The Death Gate Cycle W.I.T.C.H.
