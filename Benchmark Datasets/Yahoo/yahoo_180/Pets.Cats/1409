my kitten has gel like pee with blood in it has anyone experienced this before i was in the room when he was using the litter box i heard a strange noise kind of like a bubbling sound when he got out of the litter box i noticed it didn't look right i am pretty sure it was pee it was clear gel like with blood in it i have only had my kittens for days now i have week old males i am really conerned i already have a vet appointment for tomorrow morning for the regular shots and check up i gave them a call to let them know what i saw today and want me to try and bring in a sample they both seem to be acting normal they are playing and eating but again i am really concerned they are my babies has anyone else experienced something like this what you describe sounds more like mucoid diarrhea since you could not tell where it was coming from that is what i would assume watch for normal stool and see if it has any blood or mucous involved but the 'bubbling sound' would be it passing colon gas with the mucous take in a sample of the 'discharge' and any stool that you can get your veterinarian will want to check for intestinal parasites as a cause of the colitis also a note while males don't come into heat female cats also never bleed in association with heat you are confusing them with dogs a different species Pet skunk Cat Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Crohn's disease Kitten Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ferret Toilet humour Ron and Fez Flatulence Ulcerative colitis Schistosomiasis Fecal incontinence Human feces Feces Poker jargon Veterinarian RuneScape quests Prostate cancer Irritable bowel syndrome Manx (cat) The Legend of Zelda series enemies Colorectal cancer Hamster Coeliac disease Escherichia coli O157:H7 Oral sex Ebola Clostridium difficile Ascariasis Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Endometrial cancer Dog Explosive material Sampling (music) Carbon dioxide Gastroenteritis Garfield Sento Vitamin C Animal testing Cancer Gonorrhoea Obstetrics Little Britain Randomness Chocolate First aid Time Out of Mind Lactose intolerance Origins of baseball Childbirth Laxative Trichinosis Anal sex Morphology (linguistics) Schistosoma mansoni Milton H.
