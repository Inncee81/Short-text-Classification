what's wrong with my cat i have a year old cat that has been acting strange lately sometimes randomly he'll squint his eyes turn his head and clean himself meanwhile his back will be twitching does anybody know what's wrong my aunt thought it might be a flea so my mom got flea medicine but he's still doing it do you think it could be neurological i don't know if it's serious or not it could still be fleas there are some flea medacines that kill only the live fleas but not the eggs and the eggs will hatch every week or so so to ensure that it is gone permenantly the best bet would be to have a vet administer or get from a vet flea medacine thier stuff kills live and eggs i don't think that it is neurological my two cats do the same and it is only when they have fleas after we bathe them and give them the medacine that goes away Flea Dr. Seuss The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Garfield Cat Chicken Shaggy dog story Beetle Weebl and Bob Pet skunk Minor Discworld characters Sin City Kakapo Fancy rat RuneScape Random Events Veterinarian Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Bubonic plague Tungiasis Twitch City Minor Harry Potter Beasts Cindy Sheehan Social rule Red Hot Chili Peppers Randomness Rabies Black Death Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Happy Tree Friends Snake Treehouse of Horror V Theory of conduct Chronic fatigue syndrome Phoebe Buffay's songs Poker jargon Circus Russian joke Menstrual cycle The Archers Mary Jane Watson RuneScape quests Tiny Toon Adventures Egg (biology) Shark Heartworm Ranma __ characters Douglas Adams Ferret Egg (food) May 2005 in Australia and New Zealand Alaga__sia Homunculus Ocean's Twelve Spidey Super Stories Guinea pig Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Xenomorph Cathy Stem cell Friends The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Eggerland series Red Hot Chili Peppers (album) Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Lyme disease The Twin Dilemma Kodocha Kurt Cobain Rocko's Modern Life Daphnia Shampoo Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) The Cat in the Hat Tag Red Dwarf characters Stroke Livestock U.S. Acres Frog Betting (poker) Time Out of Mind Strabismus The Ark in Space Boom Town (Doctor Who) Doctor Eggman Characters of The Sandman Sea-Monkey American lobster Albatross Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Plagues of Egypt Insect Captain Beefheart Nintendo Entertainment System Toxoplasmosis Dream E-102 Gamma John Frusciante
