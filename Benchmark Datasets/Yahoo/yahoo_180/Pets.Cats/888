is getting a month old kitten right for us hi my boyfriend and i are interested in adopting one month old or slightly older kitten i currently work in an office offsite for hours weekdays my boyfriend freelances at home all day so he would be around to take care play with the kitten i understand that kittens need a lot of attention throughout the day several feedings etc but at what age should they start to become more independent not needing as much playing time and down to feedings a day i'm asking in case my boyfriend gets a new job and will be working offsite as well thanks thanks so far unfortunately we're only allowed to have cat in our apartment we're just unsure because there's a possibility that my boyfriend could get a full time job within the next few months and then both of us won't be home kittens don't really need a hole lot of attention me and my fiancee just got one about a month ago now we both work all day i come home once for lunch but that's it we have another cat and the two of them just chill out on the bed all day i assume anyway they free feed and go in the litter box when needed you should be fine with a new kitten from what you said Kitten RuneScape quests Ferret Ron and Fez Feral cat Dead Like Me Fancy rat Pet skunk Social rule Manx (cat) Cat Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Phoebe Buffay's songs Friends The O.C.
