cat problems help my wife and i adopted a wonderful cat from a rescue society his name is truman and is a wonderful pet he only sleeps on his back likes to play in water and is very affectionate we love him to death we've had him for months now and some problems are starting to arise despite using bitter apple and bitter yuck he eats the plants we even used a hot pepper spray and he still eats the plants not only that he is digging and eating the dirt the plants are growing in despite more spray and slices of habanero pepper to top it all off he has started to chew on cords and cables all over the house the lamp shades boxes shoes and anything else he can get his mouth on and before you ask no he is not teething this cannot continue we cannot go around the house every morning and evening unplugging and putting away all electronics shoes plants boxes and everything else any suggestions on what we can do we love him and do not want to return him to the society i take it that dental problems of any kind have been eliminated by a vet is he an indoor only cat it sounds as though he might be bored and in his search for something to amuse himself he is inadvertently getting into mischief for the chewing problem there are a few things that you can try to break the habit i know this may not be easy but wherever possible you need to deny him any access to those items that she's chewing buy some trunking to cover cables and electrical wires the items that you cannot store away put eucalyptus or menthol oil on them cats hate the smell you can also leave bait pieces of cable or an old shoe on which a few drops of menthol or oil of eucalyptus have been rubbed this deterrent will often reform the most ardent chewers sometimes denial for a couple of weeks causes the behaviour to stop shouting at the cat or squirting water at him when you catch him in the act isn't advised as you may just find he resorts to chewing these items in secret or when you are not there instead use a favourite toy or food treat to distract him and focus his attention elsewhere if it's the chewing sensation that he enjoys then try providing him with tough chunks of meat to eat this means he will have to spend more time focused on eating his meal cats like digging in soft soil place small pebbles or stones over the soil and he won't be able to access it any more cats need to eat grass from time to time for health reasons stomach ache etc so providing him with his own pot of cat grass may keep him off your others if he is an indoor only cat would you consider allowing him outside for brief periods either under your supervision or on a harness if he were allowed outside this will further his level of mental stimulation and will reduce the importance of home for activity make sure you set aside time each day strictly for playing games with him so as to focus his attention on things other than chewing there is a theory that for some cats an early interest in playing with cables or string has developed into predatory handling the end sequence of which is to consume the prey some cats make the mental leap straight from stalking to consumption try interactive toys such as those that dangle off the end of a wandstick as they will keep him physically and mentally fit they're ideal toys for playing the hunting games that cats really enjoy like chasing and leaping up high if you and your wife are away from the home a lot due to work or other commitments you might want to consider adopting a companion cat as a play mate for him the web site below will give you
