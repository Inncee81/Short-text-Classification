lock cat in basement i have three cats and am getting the trim near the floor of my house painted the painters suggested we lock our cats in the basement so they don't rub up against the paint while it is wet is this really bad for the cats kep in mind that we have a completely finished basement with plenty of couches and other thigns for them to lay on we had to cover up the kitty door that leads to the basement so thye don't get out the cats' food water and litter box are down there and that is where they always go for those things they will be down there for two days will they be okay everytime they hear someone walk by the door they all meow and scratch at the door they might not be very happy about it but they'll be ok Basement Cat The Shining (film) Rose (Doctor Who) The Basement Tapes Domestic rabbit Treehouse of Horror V Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cat litter Hamster The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Ron and Fez The Catcher in the Rye Xanadu House Phoebe Buffay's songs Invader Zim Poker jargon Socrate RuneScape quests Eastern Illinois University Kitten Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Little Britain Garfield SpongeBob SquarePants The Brady Bunch Triple J Hottest 100, 2003 Max Payne Signs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Arlington House Catscratch Japanese tea ceremony Saw II Abstraction Rent (musical) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Unquiet Dead Chatsworth House De Lorean DMC-12 Jim Morrison Steven Wright Jumpstart 3rd Grade Aerial (dance move) Salad Fingers Housebreaking Philadelphia Mint Stairway Wood carving Paint Animal Crossing Conker's Bad Fur Day Super Mario 64 Planet Waves Happy Tree Friends Door The Ark in Space The Parting of the Ways Basement Jaxx "Weird Al" Yankovic Pet skunk The Boy Who Knew Too Much RuneScape locations Castle Wars The Cat in the Hat Chinchilla Ministry of Magic Boston Public Shaggy dog story Bart Sells His Soul Aliens of London Trailer Park Boys Mid-levels The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Ferret Glossary of firefighting equipment G-Man (Half-Life) Silent Night, Deadly Night White House USS Sea Cat (SS-399) Dog Goosebumps Kakapo Blood on the Tracks Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious Casting The Fairly OddParents The Star Wars Holiday Special Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Worcester Polytechnic Institute I Want to Hold Your Hand Ren and Stimpy Wonderland (McFly album) Queensbridge The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Shadowcat Time Out of Mind Comanche
