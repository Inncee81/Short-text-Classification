what should i do my cat is extremely horny and it is really annoying she walks around meowing lowdly and in that way that only a horny cat can it is more of a mow that goes from really deep to very high pitched if you have heard it you know what i'm talking about she also occasionally stops and sticks her butt in the air and massages the floor with her hind legs she seems to do that whenever i enter the room is there anything i can do to calm her down because right now the meowing and the other thing is really really annoying she's in heat that meow is to attract males do not let her outside give her plenty of attention and play with her to alleviate her eagerness to mate after her heat period is over i strongly suggest you go to the vet or shelter to get her spayed so you won't have to deal with this issue again in the future Cat Garfield God Emperor of Dune Manx (cat) Dog Domestic rabbit Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Milton H.
