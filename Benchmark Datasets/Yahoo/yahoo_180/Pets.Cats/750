hurt feral cat i've just got in from work and noticed one of the old feral cats that hang around my garden is not well he is in the same position as he was when i left early this morning i went to have a look at him and i think he might have a broken paw only trouble is he won't let me near him and if i scare him and he goes off he might not get back and i would really like to get him to the vet suggestions on catching him please he is a wild cat and not at all friendly the dspca will just put him to sleep as he is wild he's been living here years and i feed him every day and would rather bring him to our vet tough one you could easily be injured while trying to help him so procede with extreme caution first put food out for him you may need to feed him a couple of times before he will let you approach him secondly use a small blanket or thick towel and place him a carrier this is more easily done by placing the back end in first if you still have no luck call your local animal shelter try to find one that is a no kill shelter as many cities simply destroy feral cats Cat Dog Feral Ferret Feral cat Socialization Pittsburgh Steelers Guinea pig Feral child Tenshinhan Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Waking the Dragons Domestication Gray Wolf Animal euthanasia American Black Bear Hunting Norwegian Campaign Hamster Feral cat colony Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000 army) Brown Bear Tom and Jerry (MGM) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Domestic rabbit The Dalek Invasion of Earth Cleveland Browns Wild Cat Shaggy dog story Conker's Bad Fur Day Pitaten Tiger Introduced species Microchip implant (animal) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cheetah Comanche The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe RuneScape quests Maneki Neko Cannabis cultivation Cowboy Bebop Battle of Tarawa StarCraft Secret Missions Oh My Goddess!
