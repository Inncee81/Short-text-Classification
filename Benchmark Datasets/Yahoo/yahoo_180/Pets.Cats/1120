my cat was diagnosed with renal failure her vet wanted me to put her down but i didn't feel it was time yet her vet prescribed several meds to be taken x a day this was extremely stressful on my cat got to the point she'd vomit when she saw me getting them ready one month ago i quit all meds because i wanted her last days to be good not a constant battle the vet told me she'd die in days not so she is doing pretty well acting normal even playing she is however very thin but still eating my question is before i quit the meds her urine did not have any odor to it now it has a very strong amonia smell as it did when she was well does this mean her kidney or kidneys are functioning no it's just a stage of kidney failure kidney failure is very common in old cats and some younger ones if cats don't die of an accident or an acute illness or cancer the cause of their death is usually kidney failure cats didn't used to live long enough for kidney failure to develop but now that cats are commonly living into their late teens we see it more and more often your situation with your cat is not unusual the medicines and special diet can slow the progress of the disease but nothing can cure it or reverse the damage eventually the cat is so stressed by the medicines that it ruins the relationship between the cat and the owner at that point most owners stop trying to force the medicine on the cat and stop insisting on the kidney diet which most cats dislike and let the cat eat whatever it wants the vet i work for does not oppose the owners doing this the illness is terminal the cat might as well enjoy what time it has left usually there is a period of time like you describe when the cat is happier and seems better it may last for months usually there will be a sudden dramatic turn for the worse the cat stop eating entirely it drools from sores in its mouth and it may have seizures it's obvious that the time for euthanasia has come so what you're doing is common for owners of cats with terminal kidney disease and you're not harming your cat she might live longer if you were insistent about the medicines and the diet but that would not make her happier it's a question of quality of life i have a cat with early kidney failure and i expect i will do the same thing you are doing when the time comes Diabetes mellitus Stomach cancer Medicine Prostate cancer Pneumonia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypoglycemia IgA nephropathy Urinary incontinence Kidney Paracetamol Gout Tobacco smoking Acute renal failure Nephrology Vitamin C Cat Ferret Breastfeeding Traumatic brain injury Palliative care Hypertension Chronic fatigue syndrome Rabies Psoriasis Abortion debate Diabetic nephropathy Multiple sclerosis Weight training Coeliac disease Multiple myeloma Charles Darwin's illness Glycogen storage disease type I Acute respiratory distress syndrome Epilepsy 2000 Australian Grand Prix Alcoholism Tocopherol Guinea pig Anorexia nervosa Theory of conduct Paget's disease of bone Dialysis Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Fancy rat Euthanasia Group A streptococcal infection Myocardial infarction Autism Crohn's disease Cephalic disorder Lupus erythematosus Alternative medicine Coronary heart disease EastEnders Turner syndrome Growth hormone treatment Milton H.
