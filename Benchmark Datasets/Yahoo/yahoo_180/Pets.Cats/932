how can you tell if a mother cat's milk is drying up my cat gave birth to one kitten and moved her somewhere yesterday we can't find the kitten momma cat is gone for hours at a time presumably with baby how can i tell if momma cat's milk is drying up i am looking for concrete signs that baby is okay i've tried following momma cat to see where baby is but momma is too slick for that she watches first to see who is around last night i followed her outside she sat on the front lawn until i went inside i ran inside to watch her from the front window to see where she was going in the seconds it took me to get there she was gone thank you for the answers if you only have one kitten then most of the mammary glands will dry up except the one that the kitten is using that is your clue that the kitten is nursing one teat will look different than the rest more in use the fact that mama cat is gone for long periods does indicate that she is caring for her kitten Mammary gland Breastfeeding The dozens Childbirth Phoebe Buffay's songs Nipple Goatse.cx Teat Milk Dairy RuneScape quests Elephant Guinea pig Through the Looking-Glass Thermoregulation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prolactin Big Brother UK series 5 Atomic Kitten Mary Cassatt Giant Panda Jon Secada Pet skunk Weather lore 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Paul Is Dead Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Urinary incontinence Domestic goat Breast Martin Lawrence Purr Infant Premature birth Cats (musical) Rais massacre Nestl__ Pulp Fiction Comanche Mammal B3ta Friends StarCraft: Hybrid Cytomegalovirus Platypus Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Mama's Family Ferret Feral cat Manx (cat) Louis Wain Whose Line Is It Anyway?
