how to convince my parents to get a kitten i was wondering what do you think i can do to convince my parents to get another kitten we have this cat about or they hate her they say all she does is sleep and eat and they hate how her litter smells everyday when they clean it still lol they just wanna give her away lol but were not but i want another kitten i love them there so cute but how can i convince them to get another cat with twice the smell and junk and the litter and all lol and also i do nothing for the cat but sometimes give it water lol but besides giving her food and im not cleaning poo what can i do to convince them to get one news is giving them away too we can call help please i will raise the kitten too lol btw im only yr old well i know this is not the answer you want to hear but if you are not willing to take care of the cat you have this is not the right time for you to get another one pets are a big responsibility and taking care of them properly takes effort they depend on us for everything they will suffer and die if we do not give them the things they need like fresh water nutritious food a clean litter box a safe place to sleep and vet care cleaning poo is a part of having pets as long as you have an animal there will be poo to clean up i think the only way you would convince your parents to let you have another pet is to show them you are responsible enough to take care of the one you have and to show them that you love her enough to take care of her you also need to remember that cats do not always like new cats coming to their homes yours might not accept a new one she might fight and hurt the new kitten never get a pet because you think if you get tired of it or it becomes too much trouble you will just give it away that's really not fair to the animal Hamster Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Garfield Cat Kitten Ferret Fancy rat Ron and Fez Fruits Basket Azumanga Daioh Socialization Dog Feral cat Animal communication Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sin City Social rule Pet W.I.T.C.H.
