do your cats provide you comfort i hear some people say that cats cant be comforting and that they dont care about us because they are entirely independant not true whenever im upset my kitty goes into ultra cuddley mode and starts purring and rubbing against me and laying on me and meowing and well doing a bunch of cute intense stuff that isnt normal for her even though she is a generally cuddly cat to me it seems like she is trying to comfort me and let me know that im not alone what do you think can your cats sense when you are upset i completely agree with you cats can sense what we feel when we are upset they comfort us when we are mad they tend to stay away i have a little male tabby and the only time he is cuddly is when i am upset and all the other time he just runs around like a nutter Cat Maine Coon Friends Hamster Shit Ranma __ characters Purr Hello Kitty Strap-on dildo Treecat Bengal cat Autism Tribble El Goonish Shive Kitten Turkish Angora Violin Grief The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Miss Saigon Normal distribution Time Out of Mind Nepeta Milton H.
