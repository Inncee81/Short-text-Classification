how do i stop my month old kitten from nursing i really think he's too old for it he's going to be an outside cat once he's old enough to be fixed but if there's anything i can do to stop him now i'd like to try it oh also the mom is trying to stop him sometimes but not often enough for him to take the hint i think it may be because we gave all of her other kittens away and she's lonely or bored hmmm well maybe this sounds wierd but put vinegar on belly or lemon juice so that when he tries to nurse he wont b c of the taste i know vinegar stops cats from chewing on cords ao maybe try that it's safe for the mom cat too you dont want to pull him off b c he might show hostility towards you when he doesnt understand that he cant do that anymore well goodluck you shouldnt use a spray bottle b c it will upset the mom too if he jumps off quickly or if you accidently spray her milk is a bad idea you are never sappose to give a cat milk regardless of the age unless you want to clean up some nasty messes Cat RuneScape quests Atomic Kitten Vinegar Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Kitten The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Pet skunk Breastfeeding Garfield Ron and Fez Social rule Vitasoy Cheese Toilet humour Shaggy dog story Great Teacher Onizuka Pok__mon Live!
