what to do if a cat is choking i have a couple of cats and i've always wondered what to do if they are choking because when they usually are coughing up hairballs they made a horrible sound as if they are choking and it scares me even though of the time its usually a hairball well sweetie if the cat is one you know and you believe that an object such as a bone might be in its throat and obstructing the cat's breathing reach in with your fingers or tweezers and try to remove it if the blockage is further down lay the cat on its side place the heel of your hand just behind the last rib angling slightly upward and push firmly but not so firmly as to break the ribs four quick thrusts should dislodge the obstruction if not try again if unsuccessful take the cat to a veterinarian immediately look inside your cat's mouth for any obvious foreign body do not poke about in his mouth without looking or you may push a foreign body back into his throat if there is a foreign body in the mouth attempt to remove it use the tweezers dull point or pencil eraser end in your first aid kit if appropriate however if the object appears to be deep in your cat's throat leave it alone or you may push it further down towards his airway if your cat is choking quickly lift him up by his hindlegs so that his head is dangling down and slap the side of his rib cage with two fingers of your free hand in sharp 'cough like' jerky movements you should only move your hands a little in order to stimulate a sudden rush of air from his lungs this should help to dislodge any foreign body stuck at the back of the throat be sensible about the amount of pressure that you apply particularly with a kitten do not slap too hard or you may break the ribs as soon as your cat coughs out the foreign body settle him on the ground and let him calm down in his own time ensure that your cat cannot leave the house continue to watch over your cat be careful not to stimulate him in any way and try to discourage him from moving about contact your vet to tell your vet what has happened there is little point in doing so sooner unless you have someone with you who can make a telephone call as this will waste precious time your cat's best chance of survival rests with you good question b Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Abdominal thrusts Drowning Professional wrestling throws Cat Bong Professional wrestling attacks First aid Knife Ferret Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Volleyball Diving Aerial (dance move) Violin Backstroke Skateboarding trick Snooker Urinary incontinence Fast bowling Internal ballistics Tetrapod Strap-on dildo Gesture Condom Boxing Vomiting Breastfeeding Tobacco smoking Sin City Breaststroke Lung The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Swingout Butterfly stroke Dog training Canoe Glossary of climbing terms Domestic violence Tenshinhan Lung cancer Fire fighting Wing Chun Domestic rabbit Jet engine Guinea pig Drill bit Carburetor Avalanche Glossary of American football Professional wrestling match types Glossary of partner dance terms Horizontal bar Cricket Field hockey Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eye Asthma Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Double bass Cancer Fancy rat Tag Naruto jutsu Dog Front crawl Chopsticks Anatomical terms of location Professional wrestling slang Oral sex Clarinet Toilet humour Triage Tai Chi Chuan Decompression sickness Shaggy dog story Mixed martial arts Swimming Sternum Pottery Three Stooges Sleep apnea Drawing Reflexology Siphon Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Powerbomb Kasparov versus The World Tooth enamel Salad Fingers Glossary of ballet terms Operation Market Garden Trapping Suplex
