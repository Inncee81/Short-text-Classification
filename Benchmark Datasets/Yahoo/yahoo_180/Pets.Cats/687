what is the best way to introduce a mature cat to a new kitten who's been added to the household my cat is years old and is a huge baby she was raised with another adult cat and a golden retriever and they got along splendidly things didn't go so well when a welsh corgi puppy was brought into the family she never learned to get along with that dog even after years me and the cat recently moved out and she seems to be loving all the attention although i worry that she gets lonely and bored while i'm at work mainly i'm worried because about years ago i was kittensitting a friend's cat and she was ready to kill it since then i've been afraid to get another cat advice have the kitten stay in a closed off room for the first days this way the older cat may get a scent of the kitten and begin to recognize this then replace the closed door with a baby gate for another days so they may view eachother and start to become familiar you must coax and praise your older kitty constantly when they finally are introducted showing the kitten very little attention make sure that they have seperate food dishes seperate litter boxes and seperate toys for at least the first months again make sure that you give older kitty the most attention when the kitten is around good luck Cat Kitten RuneScape quests Dog Garfield Socialization Girly Ferret Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pet skunk Housebreaking Care Bears Shaggy dog story Dean Koontz Badly Drawn Kitties Ren and Stimpy Dog training Sharon Tate Cats (musical) Atomic Kitten EastEnders Nintendo Hamster Pitaten Rugrats Days of our Lives Kakapo Doug Guinea pig Little Britain Natural Selection (computer game) Xiaolin Showdown Elizabeth Taylor Nintendogs Dog agility Golden Retriever Big Brother UK series 5 The Fairly OddParents God Emperor of Dune Hello Kitty Our Gang Siamese (cat) Phoebe Buffay's songs Ron and Fez Ranma __ characters German Shepherd Dog Alaga__sia Piccolo Junior Saga Garfield and Friends Characters in the Smurfs AFI 100 Years series The Star Wars Holiday Special Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Kodocha Kangaroo Sarah Kerrigan Cliff Richard Gray Wolf B3ta Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Poker jargon Azumanga Daioh Cat litter Taboo food and drink The Amber Spyglass The Death Gate Cycle Kim Possible Manx (cat) Weebl and Bob StarCraft: Hybrid Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Dead Like Me Series finale Lady and the Tramp The Critic Elephant Jon Secada Cheetah Humphrey Bogart Britney Spears Scooby-Doo Treecat Anna Karenina Sin City Miss Saigon The Amazing Race Ultimate Spider-Man All My Children The Contender (television series) Tenshinhan Kingdom Hearts Fancy rat Puma Friends
