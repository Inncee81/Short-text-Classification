how can i stop my cat from constantly meowing he's a year old maincoon who constantly meows and cries most of it is related to going outside i believe when he was young he escaped and was outside for about hours since then he constantly cries to go out i do take him outside for supervised periods of time because i feel so bad that he's all cooped up i never let him out of eyesight in our fenced in backyard some people have said that i should just never take him out again but i feel this is mean he knows what's out there and i think would be crushed if he never got to go again he also cries at night he's never been out at night so i think this is more related to his sister with whom he was raised from birth dying months ago maybe he's looking for her he'll even sometimes cry when i do have him outside as if he's looking for her he's a great cat best i've ever owned but the crying is incessant and really annoying i don't want to punish him for it it's not like he knows it's wrong what can i do he probably does miss his sister or at least other cats to keep him company have you thought of getting a second cat to replace his sister he'd probably be happier if he's getting enough attention and isn't crying because he's hungry let him out get him a good body harness and a long retractable lead line any good pet store will have them tie him out there and let him explore hunt at his leisure he'll soon be crying to come back in i know people say it's not healthy for them to be out but i disagree it's their nature to be outside hunting and they need access to grass to eat for removing hair balls and for proper digestion mine cries continually if kept in during the day of course she does not run away so is allowed to come and go as she pleases and sleeps well all night in her bed without crying but then it really is annoying constantly opening and closing the door for her during the day like a kid constantly in and out Cat Shaggy dog story Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Ferret Knots Landing Guinea pig Ranma __ characters Hamster Springfield Elementary School Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an W.I.T.C.H.
