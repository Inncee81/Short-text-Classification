how do you know a cat is pregnant can a pregnant cat be spayed the stray cat i am looking after and intend to get spayed looks pregnant but i am not sure her stomach looks a little swollen but again i am not sure i can clearly see her nipples but she has month old kittens and until about weeks before she was lactating she has been leaving her kittens regularly so i thought if she is still trying to mate she may not be pregnant yet if she is pregnant how risky is it to get her spayed i do not want to take the risk of putting her through the surgery if it may lead to serious fatal complications she could very well be pregnant again if she is not too far along in the pregnancy the vet can and will spay her how tame is the cat can you catch her if not you can borrow or rent a have a heart trap from a vet or the humane society so that you can get her to the vet for spaying it would be the best thing if you can get her spayed asap so as not to bring more unwanted kittens into the world Cat Guinea pig Feral cat Breastfeeding Kitten Pet skunk Pregnancy Ferret Socialization Abortion Turner syndrome Domestic rabbit EastEnders Breast Garfield Days of our Lives Prenatal diagnosis Nipple Feral Miscarriage Folic acid Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Propranolol Cats (musical) Manx (cat) Nerpa Toxoplasmosis Birth control Treecat Roe v.
