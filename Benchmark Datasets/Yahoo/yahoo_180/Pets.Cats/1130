training my kitty ok some of you might remember i bought my little sister a kitten and its about a month and weeks old now i want it to be the type of cat where i can let it outside and it can go around doing whatever and return to the house at night or when hungry how do i get it to do this will it be able to do it on its own if i let it outside and also how long should i wait until its old enuff to do it it is my sisters cat but it was kind of her idea because she always wants to take it outside to play plus we have a cat already who is indoor after all the disease and getting lost killed talk im starting to change my mind though if you bought this cat for your little sister why do you get to choose if it's a semi outdoor cat i wouldn't recommend doing this if you want this cat to enjoy the great outdoors get it a harness think about those nights when the cat doesn't come home aren't you going to be worried about it i don t know about you but i know my nerves would never be able to handle that sort of worry not to mention the disease that feral cats can carry with them keep your cat indoors where it's safe Socialization Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests Feral cat Garfield Ben Johnson (athlete) The Catcher in the Rye Hamster Saga (band) Badly Drawn Kitties Feral Theory of conduct Ferret Shaggy dog story Prostate cancer Shadowcat Pet skunk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Archery Cats (musical) Dog The Contender (television series) Animal Crossing Social rule Housebreaking USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63) Catwoman Year of the Spider Felix the Cat Big Brother UK series 5 Dog training Time Out of Mind Fecal incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Flag of India Humphrey Bogart Toxoplasmosis Philosophical skepticism TLC Ocean's Twelve House of M Poker jargon Swimming pool Druid (World of Warcraft) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Piccolo Junior Saga One Piece minor characters Singlish Heartworm Trailer Park Boys Marilyn Monroe Urinary incontinence Fancy rat African American Vernacular English Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Minor Discworld characters Guinea pig Parachuting Sweet Smell of Success: The Musical YuYu Hakusho Airport AFI 100 Years series The Fairly OddParents Hello Kitty Phoebe Buffay's songs The X-Files (season 1) Cheshire cat Wheel of Fortune Dualism (philosophy of mind) Naruto jutsu Pitaten Decca Records USS Waters (DD-115) Pete Sampras USS O'Bannon (DD-450) Manx (cat) Okashina Okashi Steven Wright Friends Livestock Chronology of Jesus Luke Skywalker Conspiracy (TNG episode) Tag Kender The Death Gate Cycle Softball 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships Athletics Miss Saigon Feral cat colony Melanie Wilkes Paragliding Philosophy of language Kurt Vonnegut Nudism DDT Johnny 5
