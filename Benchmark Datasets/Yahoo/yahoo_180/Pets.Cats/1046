i found a kitten that looks like its about a month but i am not sure i am trying to find out how old she is can anyone tell me why this kitten thats so small she fits into your hands has sharp lil teeth and is bitting she eats and fills up but she still wants to chew and knaw on my fingers toes leather ect could she be teething still i am worried that if she is older she is really malnurished i have been feeding her but i am afraid that she is eating to much her lil tummy is getting so big and she is more energetic yet i am still confused on about how old she is her teeth are still real small so i know she has to be at least a month anyone have any info on maybe an approx age or what i can do with her bitting it will be much appreciated if you would like to know how old she is put her on a scale to do this step on a weighing scale and look at your weight then pick up your kitten and step on the scale with the kitten in your arms every quarter of a pound means how many week old they are example you weigh pounds you pick up your kitten and hold her on the scale and now you weigh so that means she is only one week she probably is still teething i'd say she's about weeks if you are worried about her eating take a little food out everyday and see how your kitten reacts a lot of kittens have sharp little teeth when they are born and if she is small enough to fit in your hand it just means shes like weeks i would say for biting i would advise that you let her bite because she is just being playful because she doesn't understand scolding yet wait until she is a little bit older i'd say months to start scolding her for biting hope i helped Dog training Breastfeeding Cat Piccolo Junior Saga Garfield Kitten Tooth Atomic Kitten Drill bit Ferret Computer numbering formats Hamster Knife Cheese Boxing Bat Shark Guinea pig Humphrey Bogart The Contender (television series) Elephant Super Size Me Hansel und Gretel Pet skunk Tyrannosaurus rex Adjustable gastric band Squirrel Ostrich Weighing scale Tooth enamel Electroconvulsive therapy Dog Pound Social rule Equine conformation Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Textile manufacturing Trapping Tuatara Salad Fingers Figure skating Ron and Fez Skateboarding trick Fancy rat Puma Kodocha Horse tack Dynamic random access memory Diving 2000 Australian Grand Prix Treecat Analog-to-digital converter RuneScape quests Internal ballistics Harp Spider Akatsuki (Naruto) Domestic rabbit Babe Ruth Rabbit Wire wrap Ben Johnson (athlete) Paper size Singlish Professional wrestling holds Dental caries Antarctic krill Extreme Programming Softball Mass Red Squirrel FoxTrot Money RISC Musical mode Poker jargon P-47 Thunderbolt Equal temperament Reiki EastEnders Sperm Whale Mountain Gorilla Swingout Fast bowling Haven (TNG episode) Coeliac disease Aerial (dance move) Dieting Weight Monster Rancher monsters Care Bears Counter Socialization Hand grenade Deflation (economics) Milton H.
