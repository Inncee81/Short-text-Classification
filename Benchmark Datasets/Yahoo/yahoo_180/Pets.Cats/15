i have cats that do not have worms they both have diarrhea vet doesn't know why help please one had it first then the nd one got it a few days later they're getting sick of pumpkin and beginning to protest any suggestions would be appreciated i only feed them their cat food friskies cans and iams bran it's been the same for a few mos maybe i should ask a neighbor if he is feeding them and what the pumpkin is for all animals when they have the runs i take exceptional care of all of my animals so this is very upsetting to me that i don't know the answer ha okay the vet doesn't know why he's done a fecal test for all the little micro bugs and they're clean no changes in food or water lately no changes in environment no outside cats exposure up to date on shots temps are normal hydration is still good so exactly what do you want help with curing the diarrhea seriously you need to find the cause in order to cure it but the pumpkin is a good idea the main thing you want to watch for with diarrhea is dehydration as long as they are drinking and are not dehydrated that's good if they are eating also then that's good too first off did the vet give any antibiotics to the cats for the diarrhea if so get some probiotics and give the cats some of that to help build back up the intestinal tract or you can simply feed them some plain active cultured yogurt it does pretty much the same thing keep them on a bland diet cottage cheese rice boiled chicken you can boil the rice in chicken broth to help them like it g lots of places on the web with suggestions on how to feed a cat for diarrhea but it's basically to feed them very bland foods to quiet the system you can also give them pedialyte i prefer the unflavored variety for children for drinking to help rehydrate them and it will also help replenish some of the lost minerals etc do not give them kaopectate or pepto bismal they are dangerous to your cats quite frankly if your cats are still having a problem with diarrhea in another day or two i would switch vets tho and try someone else there's a reason they have this problem and saying i don't know isn't much help be sure tho to re examine the time prior to their diarrhea for anything that might have caused the diarrhea good luck Diarrhea Dehydration Ulcerative colitis Stomach cancer Domestic rabbit Chicken Vitamin C Guinea pig Pet skunk Food Cat Dairy Livestock Kitten Veganism Garfield Cholera Hamster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coeliac disease Prostate cancer Vegetarianism Raw food diet Escherichia coli O157:H7 Japanese cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Fancy rat Ferret Nutrition Cancer Rehydration Ramen Campylobacteriosis Pneumonia Egg (food) Genetically modified food Peruvian cuisine Tofu Cuisine of Denmark Taboo food and drink Lactose intolerance Breastfeeding Bengali cuisine Protein-energy malnutrition Milk Theory of conduct Schistosomiasis Dietary fiber Escherichia coli Organic food Survival skills Soy milk Bread Agriculture Randomness Vampire Food preservation First aid Kodocha Dysentery Cuisine of the Southern United States Clostridium difficile Botulism Pitaten Kashrut Soup Factory farming German cuisine Urinary incontinence Cantonese cuisine Folic acid Soybean Tomato Antibiotic Tea Rice pudding Hiking Kosher foods Tooth Potato Trichinosis Chocolate Flatulence Breakfast McDonald's Vermicompost Tlingit Social rule Organic farming Cuisine of Malaysia Cat food Lactobacillus acidophilus Human feces The Star Wars Holiday Special Atkins Nutritional Approach
