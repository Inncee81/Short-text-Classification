i am worried about my cat we recently gave away her three sisters and her mother so she's the only animal in the house i'm worried about her getting lonely she's already showing signs of depression lazy won't eat much pitiful mewing sounds and she's wandering around the house looking for other cats how can i make her less lonely without having to buy another cat cats live in a world of scents and she smells the others and cannot find them and despite what others will contend it is not unusual for cats to miss another playmate just provide her with lots of attention and love and interactive play if there were certain places her 'friends' spent such as on towels etc wash them to lessen the scent of the 'missing' ones she might get lonely but if you make sure she has a window to look out and perhaps a cat tree to climb on she will be occupied and happy as strange as it may seem she may be scared that she will also disappear love will heal that Shaggy dog story Cat RuneScape quests Garfield Characters in the Smurfs Pulp (band) American Black Bear Dead Like Me Team Rocket Pitaten The Smoking Room Sin City Kakapo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Salad Fingers Tokyo Mew Mew Neighbours The Time Machine Mickey Mouse Gaia Online Jam (TV series) Kodocha Ginny Weasley Ranma __ characters The Fairly OddParents Cheetah Animal communication Narnia Menstrual cycle Fruits Basket W.I.T.C.H.
