couple cat questions i need to get my cat fixed and we are going to get her de clawed how old does she need to be to get fixed and other than her not having claws can being de clawed affect her negatively she is a strictly indoor cat she is only about weeks old in the case of this cat she cant get much more of an attitude she already claws people if they dont pet her the cat has to be at least lbs to be neutered but most vets want to wait till months before they neuter them you can discuss the pros and cons with your vet you deffinatly want to do it before he reaches sexual maturity because he will start spraying and once he starts doing that even neutering isn't a guarentee that he will stop getting him neutered before he starts spraying is pretty much guarentee he won't start spraying i would not recomend declawing i'm sure others have told you the horrors of it so i won't go into that but i must tell you that i work at an animal shelter and we have cats there that their owners two different people surrendered their declawed cats to us because they couldn't handle their behavioral problems that had started after this procedure they don't have claws so they bite and are very ill mannered i've gotten bit by them a few times cleaning their cages and trying to give them fresh food and water other behavioral problem is not using the litterbox litter hurts their feet after surgery so they associate litter box with pain so they didn't use the litter box their owners didn't want to bother to work with them so they declawed them and then didn't want to deal with the other problems that came about so they gave them up there are lots of things you can do to try and correct the scratching problem you may neeed to get a few scratch posts have different materials for scratch posts carpet wood rope cardboard etc we have cats and scratch posts and a cat tree and this is in a bedroom apartment you can get soft claws they are plastic caps that go over your cats claws keep your cats nails trimmed here is a good video of how you can do that http www felinevideos vet cornell edu index shtml please do all you can to not declaw your cat work with your cat teach him right from wrong talk to your vet and see if they have any ideas on what you can do also Pet skunk Ferret Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Hamster Fancy rat Dog Garfield Socialization Theory of conduct Veterinarian Docking Kitten Milton H.
