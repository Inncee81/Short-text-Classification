cat behavior my indoor cat has all the sudden took up with this one toy and he carries it around in his mouth like a dog would do and does this crazy sounding meow does anyone know why he would do this thanks this is a feather toy it doesn't have any catnip on it a previous female cat of mine had a soft toy that she used to carry around the home even though she was spayed i initially thought it might be some kind of maternal instinct until i caught her one day biting and kicking hell out of it with her back legs that made me think that perhaps she viewed it more as prey than off spring she also liked to play fetch which is a hunting type game so that also made me think that her carrying the toy was all part of practicing her hunting skills who knows maybe it helped her judge what size of prey she could successfully tackle and bring home Cat Dog Ferret Hamster Tyrannosaurus rex Housebreaking Dog training Maine Coon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gray Wolf Tag Lion Hunting Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Puma Leopard American football Socialization Pet skunk Kakapo Wolf's Rain Falconry Breastfeeding Canadian football Nepeta Spider Rugby union Peafowl Orca Shaggy dog story Pump It Up Bladderwort Archery Glossary of American football The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Dinosaur The Apprentice 2 Toy train Rugby union positions Air gun National Football League Lore Mickey Mouse Manx (cat) Characters of The Sandman Pinball Trapping Dilbert Field hockey The Strangerhood RuneScape quests Super Bowl XXI Toy Story 2 Coprophagia Cheetah Clouded Leopard Combine (Half-Life 2) Late Night with Conan O'Brien Asiatic Golden Cat Canary Ostrich The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Rugby football Polymorphism in object-oriented programming Cincinnati Bengals Land mine Poker jargon Working animal Tiger Anal sex W.
