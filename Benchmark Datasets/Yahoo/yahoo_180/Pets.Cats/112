why is my cat trying to scratch inside his ears would someone please tell me why my two and a half year old nutered cat is trying to scratch inside his ears he has scratched so hard until he has scratched out all the hair near his ear and it turned red i put a lil antibiotic cream neosporin on the sore area and i orderd some anti itch hydrocotizone cream from drs foster smith for the itching but he still keeps trying to scratch in his ear could it be ear mites when i look in his ears they look clean i dont have money for a vet so is there something i can buy from petland discount in my neighborhood that would help with whatever is in his ears now hes started to scratch at both of them thank you so much for any answers in laymans terms please i can understand that you do not have funds for a vet when he scratches does his other back foot do a thumping action that is an indication of pain if there are ear mites which is what i would think then mineral oil as suggested will help kill them ear mites if left untreated can have long term problems your use of neosporin may have been extremely helpful as infections can be rather nasty try and find a way of saving up or borrowing some funds for a vet check up you may be able to reduce the problem assuming it is ear mites but the long term final solution is generally available only from a vet if it is ear mites then request the vet kill them not just give you ear drops to kill them the vet will use an insecticide that is suitable for cats Guinea pig Fancy rat Psoriasis Diseases of the honeybee Otitis externa Scabies Eczema Allergy Cat Group A streptococcal infection Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pollinator decline Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Dialysis Diving Equine conformation Diamond Chronic fatigue syndrome Stomach cancer Monetary policy Breastfeeding Electrophysiology House dust mite Itch Betting (poker) Earwax Paranoia Agent Common cold DVD Lyme disease Canary Mosquito Gramophone record Conjunctivitis Violin Winter Soldier Investigation Pharyngitis Pet skunk RuneScape quests Fecal incontinence Doom enemies First aid Social rule Kakapo Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sin City Piccolo Junior Saga Tattoo Balance disorder Marilyn Monroe Dandruff Pitaten Tick Computer virus Characters in the Smurfs Biological pest control Massage Keynesian economics Medical prescription Mutual fund Hearing impairment Boston Public Chlorpromazine Inflation Sickle-cell disease Carbon dioxide Mouth ulcer Milk Shaggy dog story Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome The Time Machine Ferret Malaria Honeybee Economy of Russia Rabies Bond Tooth enamel Asthma 2005 Iditarod Tuberculosis Rocky Mountain spotted fever Tobacco smoking Aerial (dance move) Codename: Kids Next Door Earring Zagreus (Doctor Who audio) Annuity Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Billiards Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005
