is there something seriously wrong with my cat i have cats that are sisters we have had them since hours old which has been for yrs now one of the cats piglet will lay under our computer desk and she is breathing rather hard and her sister wiggles will not leave her side and everytime wiggles sees someone she runs up to them and starts meowing and runs back to her sister piglet gets up and eats but then goes back to that same exact spot if you have any answers please tll me now she has been up and moving around and she seems bloated she will only eat soft cat food but she is moving around like normal there are two reasons to seek a vet help one is a change in litter box habits or output for instance a runny stool is often a sign of an illness or it could be a result of a change in food without a vet opinion you will not know the second reason is if there is a dramatic change in their habits for what you have described with piglet i think that qualifies and the behavior of wiggles would tell me that she senses something is not right with piglet when i got my two kittens spayed things seemed normal but my one kitten stayed very close to the other and acted almost like a nurse sure enough my one kitten had a cold and probably was coming down with it when she was spayed a trip to the vet and it was quickly solved and she got better and lived a very long life Cat Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Ferret Stereoscopy Manx (cat) Pet skunk Pig Dog Garfield Fecal incontinence Philosophy of language Socialization Ron and Fez Housebreaking Feral cat Hamster Fancy rat Breastfeeding Azumanga Daioh Randomness Stomach cancer Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asiatic Golden Cat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Alexander Technique Treecat Girly Tag Complexity classes P and NP 2000 Australian Grand Prix Lie Weather lore Silent Night, Deadly Night Urinary incontinence The Pack (Buffy episode) Tooth enamel Abstraction (computer science) Terri Schiavo Chlorpromazine Kodocha Badly Drawn Kitties Phoebe Halliwell Ranma __ characters Poker jargon Theory of conduct Food Gray Wolf Razorback Collision detection The Amber Spyglass Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion debate FoxTrot House Mouse Expert system RuneScape quests Extraterrestrial skies Tick Puma Charles Darwin's illness Botulism Cockroach Anorexia nervosa European Rabbit Purr Leopard The Cat in the Hat Chess (musical) Nicomachean Ethics Victor Cousin Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Glossary of partner dance terms Shen Gong Wu Tlingit High-heeled shoe Phoebe Buffay's songs Chocolate Semiconductor device Kakapo Another Side of Bob Dylan Jumpstart 3rd Grade Clouded Leopard Spot (Star Trek) Epistemology Sant Thakar Singh Siamese (cat) Decompression sickness Dilbert Cheetah Halting problem Coprophagia Liquid breathing Science Autism El Goonish Shive
