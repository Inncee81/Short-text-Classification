my cat died of suspected kidney failure have you experienced this my beautiful cat whom i've had for seventeen years was put to sleep last night by a vet for a while she'd been going downhill but was still so so loving only that morning she had jumped on my bed for a snuggle late yesterday i had discovered she'd vomited a clear foamy vomit i also noticed blood drops on the floor she had blood in her urine and couldn't control the dripping as any responsible pet owner would i rushed her to an emergency vet clinic i was then told that if i was to medicate her it would only prolong her life not make her better i was given the option of euthanasia and after assessing my fear of losing her to her pain i chose the right option to have her put to sleep it happened so fast and i'm shocked i just need to know if i didn't chose to have her put to sleep would have the blood in the urine have stopped did i make the wrong decision i just miss my cat so much and would like to hear from anyone who has experienced this i can't thank all of you enough i have tears running down my face at your kindness thank you for helping me through this loss this has made such a huge difference i buried her under our mandarin tree with a jumper i made her i have just been reading the answers to your question and it has helped me make the very difficult decision for my cat blue he has had ongoing kidney problems for along time now and just spent more days in the animal hospital on iv he's had a lot of stays there we are so reluctant to put him down because he is only years old and such a beautiful loving cat also we have his brother who will be lost without him they are so close we brought him back home hoping he would come around but he is only getting worse we cannot watch him suffer anymore and are taking him back to the vets today to be put to sleep we have cried oceans of tears but we love him enough to let him go thank you for showing us that our love for him as your love for your's makes it the right thing and the best thing thank you and god bless EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Miss Saigon Urinary incontinence Sin City Milton H.
