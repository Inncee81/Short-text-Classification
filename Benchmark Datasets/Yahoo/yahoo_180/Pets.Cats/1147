how do i transition into using new cat litter without my cat peeing outside the box i just rescued a cat and he came with a ton of unused litter unfortunately it smells awful and i found some new stuff that doesn't smell like litter at all and i want to use it i put a new litter box with the new stuff in his room with the old box he isn't using the new box which isn't a surprise to me because he's used to it if i take away the old one will that cause him to pee on my carpet instead it could cats do not like change he is also probably still traumatized from moving to a new environment i would suggest slowly mixing the new litter in with the old gradually increase the new litter and decrease the old you may even have to do it a handful at a time until he is ok with the new stuff Cat Toxoplasmosis Hamster Pet skunk Tobacco smoking Shaggy dog story Jumpstart 3rd Grade Cat litter Domestic rabbit Kurt Cobain Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Deforestation Toilet humour The Best Page in the Universe Computed tomography Aqua Teen Hunger Force Guinea pig Magical objects in Harry Potter Kitten Collision detection Invader Zim Fancy rat Eucalyptus The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Manx (cat) Vegeta Kim Possible Fruits Basket Entropy Ozone depletion Phoebe Buffay Feral cat Mac OS X The Star Wars Holiday Special Red Squirrel Rei Ayanami Naruto jutsu Esperanto grammar Codename: Kids Next Door Major League Baseball television contracts Enzyme Dog Brown Bear RuneScape locations Ozone hole Cheshire cat Russian joke The Strangerhood Traumatic brain injury Menstrual cycle Firefighter SpongeBob SquarePants Litter Sleep Sin City Diseases of the honeybee Albatross Sulfur V (TV series) Wonder Woman (television series) The Inside Particle in a box Apt Pupil Dean Koontz Bong Combine (Half-Life 2) Alien (film) Species Tank Electrophysiology Guns, Germs, and Steel Jackass: The Movie Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Steel The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Red Dwarf characters Mercury Cougar Time travel Tick Characters of Naruto Gross domestic product Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Ron Weasley Ron and Fez Natural Selection (computer game) W.
