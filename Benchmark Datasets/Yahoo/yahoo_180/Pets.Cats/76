any tips on taking care of newborn kittens if the mother is not available to care for them for whatever reason then here is what you will need to do go to your local pet store or wal mart even and buy kitten milk replacement and a tiny bottle in the pet isle mix and feed according to the directions at first you will have to force small amounts of formula into them this is not natural but has to be done do it slowly so that they don't get the fluid in thier lungs by aspirating it which can cause pnemonia and possibly kill them be sure to rub their backs gently after they eat to help them burp and help start the digestion process rub them gently but firmly with a towel to stimulate thier circulation and get them more active several times a day you will need to also stimulate their genitals and anus with a paper towel or old rag after they eat kittens are not able to go to the bathroom on their own and the momma normally takes care of this they will start going on their own around weeks or so keep them clean and dry don't let them get overheated though a small laundry basket or cardboard box lined with an old towel or baby blanket works great just be sure that they are protected from any other animals male cats will usually kill the kittens and on occasion a female will as well dogs also pose a threat around and a half to weeks start to introduce them to some kitten food that is moistened with a bit of warm water or some of their formula and a small amount of wet cat food give them a shallow bowl of fresh water too you will need to wipe them off with a warm damp cloth after they eat since they get kinda messy this is also a good age to start to introduce them to the litter box take a little of the dirty paper that you stimulate them with and place it in the box so that they get the scent of it make sure it is no more than an inch and a half to two inches high or they will have problems getting into it if they mess outside the box simply place the feces in it it is usually fairly easy to train them as it is instinctual for them to use it you will need to get them in to see a vet around weeks so they can be wormed and then around weeks they can start getting their shots and finding new homes good luck Hamster Cat Breastfeeding Pet skunk Kitten Fancy rat Menstrual cup Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Ferret Fecal incontinence Japanese toilet Milk Dog Strap-on dildo Elephant Upholstery Diseases of the honeybee Socialization Toilet humour Spider Mattress House Mouse Japanese tea ceremony Chocolate Hedgehog Sauna Dairy Feral cat Thermal power station Textile manufacturing Hazing Oral sex First aid Bong Carnivorous plant Fire fighting Garfield Animal communication Dialysis Towel Coprophagia Urinary incontinence Minor Harry Potter Beasts Sento Social rule Insulin Kitchen Hyperthermia Chinchilla Compost Tick Tattoo Menstrual cycle Vermicompost Plastic Domestic goat Bird Jackass: The Movie Care Bears Violin Anal sex Chicken American lobster Comanche Characters in the Smurfs Paper Drill bit Idli Manicure Kakapo Puma Tarantula Androgen insensitivity syndrome Procter & Gamble Shit Snake Phoebe Buffay's songs Dry cleaning Tea Aerial (dance move) Manx (cat) Climate of the United Kingdom Cheese Euphemism Anus American Alligator Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
