how do i stop my cat from fighting my new kitten we foster rescue animals and have pets of our own so our house is a constant changing shuffle of cats and dogs one technique we have found that is handy and works is getting a squirtgun and watching the cat when it is about to pounce on the kitten or when it puffs up hisses etc spray it eventually the older cat will figure out that a face full of water is not worth tormenting the new kitten also make sure your kitten has plenty of toys that will help keep the kitten from trying to get the other cat to play the invitation to play might be the kitten jumping on stalking or batting at the older cat which will irritate the older cat causing it to strike and remember to make an effort to give the older cat extra attention so he she knows that the kittten does not affect the love or care the older cat receives if you see the older cat and the kitten near each other and the older cat is calm praise the older cat with pets and treats also a little time will prob be the best solution until they bond feed them seperately and supervise them good luck Cat Pet Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Socialization Ferret RuneScape quests Kitten Garfield Housebreaking Cats (musical) Guinea pig Feral cat Dog Feral Hamster Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Azumanga Daioh Pitaten Big Brother UK series 5 Softball Pet store Puma Fancy rat Rabies Rabbit Ralston Purina Company Atomic Kitten Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Ron Weasley Treecat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers Care Bears Serval Tokyo Mew Mew Asiatic Golden Cat Marc Antony and Pussyfoot Sluggy Freelance Krypto the Superdog Teacher's Pet (Disney) Ranma __ characters Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Dog training Maneki Neko Manx (cat) Darkwing Duck Siamese (cat) Tooth enamel Kodocha Tai shogi Bengal cat Skunk Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Ren and Stimpy Canary DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Minor Harry Potter Beasts Tick Baseball Stars The Amber Spyglass Garfield and Friends OpenBSD Dean Koontz German Shepherd Dog Internet phenomenon Galaxy Angel Golden Retriever Toy Story 2 Urinary incontinence Taikyoku shogi The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Doug Silly Symphonies Maka dai dai shogi Bat Badly Drawn Kitties Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Our Gang Working dog Goatse.cx Rescue group Turkish Van Lady and the Tramp Spotted Skunk Animation in the United States in the television era Blackjack Samurai Pizza Cats Poker jargon Fire fighting Domestication My Parents are Aliens Shaggy dog story DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Animal shelter 2000 Australian Grand Prix Violin Griffon Bruxellois
