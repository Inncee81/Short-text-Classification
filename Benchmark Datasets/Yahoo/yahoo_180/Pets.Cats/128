how can i get my cat to improve his behaviour my cat was a three year old with serious behavior problems when i adopted him but he has improved a lot because i'm very consistent about my expectations my problem is it stresses me out when i have to give him a smack on the bottom and i wish i knew a better way it's not like i always have a bottle of water handy to spray him when he bites or scratches at totally random times so far he hasn't really hurt me but i would like to curb this behavior before it goes too far once when my friend was taking care of him he bit her hard enough to draw blood but then i found out that's because she practically stuck her toe in his jaws most of the time he's a good and affectionate kitty except he can also be really loud he was abused as a kitten and then raised in a home with a lot of instability i want to be able to keep him and take care of him but i need to know how to handle his problems better he is all ready set in his ways don't smack him on the bottom or any were if you just pick him up and look him in the eye and tell him no not loud but firm he will know what you are talking about it may take awhile but he will get it when you smack him on the bottom he thinks he is not loved and won't care what he dose he thinks he is in the same kind of home and a spray bottle just makes him mad just a firm no and let him know you still love him but he has to be good i hope it helps let me know Theory of conduct Pitaten Happy Tree Friends Garfield Social rule Pet skunk Infantilism Equine conformation Poker jargon Guinea pig Piccolo Junior Saga Friends 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kodocha Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Randomness Extreme Programming Clinical depression Dog Efficiency wages Milton H.
