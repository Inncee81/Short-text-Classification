am i being selfish about my cat me and my husband live with a really nice family mum dad boy and girl in a houseshare and i'm buying a kitten today and naturally everyone is really excited especially the kids but i feel really annoyed as the mum seems to think that i'm buying it for everyone when she told me it's my responsibility she even said that i could put it on her little's girls bed as a suprise when i bring it home which really annoyed me as it's my cat not theirs am i being selfish or not thanks so much guys for the answers so far really a big help so glad i'm not being stupid no you are not being stupid at all in fact i would be making a point of clearing it up with them if you are buying the cat and are responsible for all of the associated costs that means it is your cat which also means that if you ever move out the cat goes with you what you have said makes me nervous if you do ever move out you could be in for a fight over the kitty so make it very clear with them all now Shaggy dog story Garfield Little Britain EastEnders Recurring South Park characters Doug Ren and Stimpy Kyle Broflovski Azumanga Daioh Badly Drawn Kitties The Fairly OddParents W.I.T.C.H.
