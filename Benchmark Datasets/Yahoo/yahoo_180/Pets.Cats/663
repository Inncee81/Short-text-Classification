siamese cat rash can't believe i'm asking this after telling several worried pet owners to just go to the vet i now find myself with an injured cat we plan on bringing her if her condition gets worse money isn't an issue but at the moment she is getting better my question to cat owners siamese owners in particular is if their cats have ever experienced rashes when we got home last night we noticed my sister's siamese kitten had a bloody neck we nearly died thinking she'd cut an artery but she barely noticed it she has no cuts or scraps so we're not sure if she had a fight with her sister or if she has a heat rash if it's possible for cats to get heat rashes like i said it's getting better we wrapped her neck with gauze so she couldn't scratch it and she's just sleeping now still what could it have been she is an indoor cat we sometimes take her outside on a leash but we haven't since we lost it she does suffer from allergies though her eyes weep when she's around dust but the house is clean i'm not sure if she's come into contact with any chemicals they are up high but i don't watch her so it's a possibility that is interesting the girls eat from porcelain bowls and drink from one of those metal dishes but we are in a brand new modular house now that i think about it we haven't been here for more than a few weeks so perhaps it is something in this house i never thought of bugs either we have no spiders inside but our friends have been having flea problems we haven't found any yet but that doesn't mean some haven't gotten in she also loves chasing the moths that get in the house they are usually out of her reach but i'd imagine she'd eat them if she ever got a hold of them we use a flea earworm medication called revolution it's applied to the back of the neck not where the rash is we've also been using it for months i won't rule it out as a factor though we use a flea earworm medication called revolution it's applied to the back of the neck not where the rash is we've also been using it for months i won't rule it out as a factor though towards the top of the page it says gearxs part wpn condition refurbished condition details packaging plain box packaging details shipping cost beneath that it reads shipping and handling free to united states yes cats can get rashes mine are allergic to fleas one fricken flea bite and the whole world goes to h e double hockey sticks could be she got bitten by a spider or a bug or a flea and she scratched the bejeezus out of her neck could be she got tangled up on something trying to escape could be anything you need to have it cleaned though if it's not that bad get some anti bacterial soap on a wash cloth not too much and clean the area also antibiotic ointment ain't just for people put a tiny bit on the neck and then re wrap it in the guaze check it in a few hours Cat Fancy rat Guinea pig Garfield Allergy Flea First aid Tattoo Sin City Shaggy dog story Pet skunk Richard Chase Conspiracy (TNG episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eczema The Amber Spyglass Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Shining (film) EastEnders Milton H.
