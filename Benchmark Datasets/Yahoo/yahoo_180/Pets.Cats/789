my cat has a sore under his cheek ok its been there for a few days its dry bloody spot and i was wandering what i can do hes an outside kitten iam going to wash it after i finish should i put rubbing acholhal on it he's months un neutered and hasnt had any shots i am thinknig it could be maybe mites iam not sure but after i put some first aid medication on it and let him go back outside he scrachted it if this helps any he live in a barn that has hay it was like dry blood so after i washed it it started to bleed a little bit then i put the ointment on it should i put a bandage on his sore so he wont scratch it and keep it from drying out i dont really want to put a bandaid on it couse then it wont dry out and itl hurt him for me to take it of is there any way to tell if he has mites without having to go to the vet and are there any over the counter meds for mites do not put rubbing alcohol on it it will sting badly he will not let you touch it again and a bandage will probably not stay on no there are no over the counter medicines or tests for mites it could be a hot spot from scratching at fleas or it could be a wound from fighting that could turn into an abscess make him very sick it would be best to take him to the vet but if you absolutely can't do that that very least you can do is clean it with hydrogen peroxide a few times a day and get some flea medication for him to see if that helps First aid Guinea pig Wound Yarrow Breastfeeding Pet skunk Cat Scabies First aid kit Bleeding Textile manufacturing Aloe Eczema Domestic rabbit Hydrogen peroxide Hay fever Acne Allergy Ferret Snooker Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Common cold Atomic Kitten Snakebite (bite) Stomach cancer Flea Tick Tattoo Diseases of the honeybee Hamster Vinegar Traumatic brain injury Kitten House dust mite Pneumonia Gout Urinary incontinence Ebola Hand washing Fecal incontinence Rosacea Menstrual cup Housebreaking Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Group A streptococcal infection Chagas disease Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Massage Dairy Rabies Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Alcoholics Anonymous Hygiene Halitosis Bubonic plague Professional wrestling slang Drill bit Dehydration Triage Red Hot Chili Peppers Carbon dioxide Salad Fingers Hay Pressure point Aerial (dance move) Paracetamol Drowning Gilding Mouth ulcer Ulcerative colitis Swingout Cosmic Era list of characters Body piercing Tourniquet Mattress Characters of Naruto Blood Upholstery Menstrual cycle Earwax Transmission (medicine) YuYu Hakusho Medicine Sam Sheppard John F.
