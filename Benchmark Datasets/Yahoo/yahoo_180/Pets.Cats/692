new kitten help i've always been a dog person so having a new kitten is quite the adventure unlike a dog i'm realizing that she does not understand no how do i train her to stop play biting and not jump on the couch when my husband and i are eating something i'm in much the same position when my kitten gets bitey i grab her by the scruff of the neck and say no and put her aside she's catching on but i think she just gets excited and forgets or maybe doesn't want to remember we're closer to success on the food thing i feed her before we eat so she isn't hungry and then after we are done i give her a sample of what we had now she knows that peas salad and spagetti sauce are not to her taste she doesn't bother us much during meals anymore Cat Garfield Shaggy dog story Dog training Piccolo Junior Saga Salad Fingers Cuisine of Denmark Fish and chips Futurama (TV series - season 5) Hot dog Little Britain Pok__mon Live!
