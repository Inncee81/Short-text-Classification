how can i get my month old kittens to stop nursing on each other the black one nurses on the striped one who nurses on herself they were weaned for a while then one day they started this i have tried to discourage it by separating them but they go right back to it the often do it when they are snuggling with humans or just before bed the more you pet them the more they want to nurse on each other they are not lickers or needy i guess its a security thing but they are too old for this and its kinda annoying they were not weaned too early they were plus months old when i got them my kitty used to suck on herself too she would get a little fold of belly skin in her mouth and just purr and suck i looked at it as a self soothing behavior like thumb sucking she outgrew it before she was a year old if you are really annoyed i wonder if you could paint a little lemon juice or something yucky bitter on to the area being molested i'd call and ask the vet they could probably tell you over the phone Cat Breastfeeding Kitten Poker jargon Garfield Guinea pig Codename: Kids Next Door Dog Elephant Sin City Treecat Cheetah Phoebe Buffay's songs Mosquito Pet skunk Late Night with Conan O'Brien Puma Hamster Purr Tooth enamel Vampire Physical intimacy Eric Cartman Hiking Bat Shaggy dog story The Human Stain Ferret Shark Futari wa Pretty Cure Leopard Socialization Nail (anatomy) EastEnders Fanta Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Nursing home Azumanga Daioh Cephalic disorder Dog training Knots Landing Grief Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Harp Seal Badly Drawn Kitties Michael Jackson Childbirth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Good Morning, Vietnam Tick Fancy rat Richard Chase James Robson Comanche Hello Kitty Bill Stevenson Aloe Meerkat Milton H.
