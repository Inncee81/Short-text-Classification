my kitten won't eat my cat had a litter of kittens wks ago but one of them won't eat i was advised to put the food in her mouth but she's still not interested i am worried cause she's smaller then the others and theres no chance of rehoming her yet either she still has milk from her mom but not much who can help it sounds like your kitten is the runt of the litter that would explain why he she is smaller than the others often runts have a harder time getting food because they are smaller than the other kittens and get pushed about what you can do is to try all the time if he she eats some and then refuses don't push him her to try to get him her to eat again wait a bit and try again later remember to always finish the feed on a relatively good note because that's what he she'll remember from it don't try again and again because this will leave a bad memory and he she may refuse any further food from you you can buy special kitten feeds in most pet shops you can also watch to make sure his her brothers and sisters are leaving him her alone and if you identify one he she particularly likes you can try feeding them together because often kittens follow each others' example also if one kitten is being particularly rough with him her you can seperate them so that he she feels better one sure way to get it done right is to ask your vet to try and then get some advice on what you can give him her also if he she starts eating a little even just a tiny bit you should consider this a major improvement and maybe he she's too weak to eat a feed all at once try giving it to him her little by little with time for him her to rest in between if the situation gets critical you can him her take to the vet and have a drip installed to feed her all the nutrients and stuff he she needs and it's not going to be terrible to keep the kitty a bit longer than the others or are you hoping to make sure they are all gone as soon as possible give him her some time Cat Guinea pig Kitten RuneScape quests Garfield Breastfeeding Atomic Kitten Pet skunk Phoebe Buffay's songs Stomach cancer Poker jargon Dog Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Chocolate Tick Domestic rabbit Dairy Little Britain Hamster Nutrition Piccolo Junior Saga Sin City Theory of conduct Feral cat Badly Drawn Kitties Vegetarianism Bat 613 mitzvot Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Drill bit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Doug Organic farming W.I.T.C.H.
