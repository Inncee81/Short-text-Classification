what might cause my cat's stool to contain blood one of my cats has had diarrhea for a few days i took him to the vet today and they could find nothing wrong although he did not have enough stool for them to take a sample his appetite and energy level are normal he has been on the same food for two years and my other cats are eating out of the same bag of food and having no problems the vet has given me some medication to treat the diarrhea symptoms tonight however i noticed blood in his stool this was the first time i had noticed blood it was bright red and there wasn't very much i am just wondering what might be causing the diarrhea and blood in his stool seeing as he appears to be otherwise healthy by the way i have a vet appointment tomorrow morning for a different cat to get vaccinations and i am going to bring the ill cat back along with a stool sample to get checked again bloody stool can be caused by intestinal parasites treated with dewormers infection treated with antibiotics intestinal ailments like irritable bowel syndrome treated with steroids and anti inflammatories a foreign body in the intestinal tract like string or other things kitties have a tendancy to ingest or mega colon mega colon happens in older cats and is treated with cefulac syrup and cisapride which are oral medications as you can see the causes for blood in the stool are all treatable so don't you panic your veterinarian will perform a fecal testing with a stool sample the feces will be studied under a microscope to identify any intestinal parasites or abnormal bacteria if the fecal testing is clear your veterinarian may want to perform blood work and an x ray to see if there is anything relevant that can be seen that is causing the bloody stool the condition will be treated accordingly i hope this helps and best of luck Crohn's disease Fecal incontinence Cancer Escherichia coli O157:H7 Ulcerative colitis Coeliac disease Colorectal cancer Irritable bowel syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Ascariasis Human feces Cirrhosis Guinea pig Schistosomiasis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Vomiting Feces Pet skunk Tuberculosis Urinary incontinence Nutrition Hypoglycemia Entamoeba histolytica Prostate cancer Folic acid Insulin Medicine Fancy rat Clostridium difficile Acne Botulism Constipation Dietary fiber Multiple sclerosis Dysentery Diabetes mellitus Sickle-cell disease Ebola Gastroparesis Psoriasis Escherichia coli Flatulence Group A streptococcal infection Ovarian cancer Anemia Anthrax Clinical depression Gastroesophageal reflux disease Food allergy Allergy Cystic fibrosis Asthma Diseases of the honeybee Abscess First aid Domestic rabbit Aspartame Rotavirus Ferret Rocky Mountain spotted fever Laxative Common cold Obesity Hirschsprung's disease Lactose intolerance Malaria Cytomegalovirus Halitosis Horse colic Vitamin C Endometriosis Trichinosis Autoimmune diseases Chagas disease Legionellosis Fecal occult blood Diverticulosis Coprophagia Whipworm Stroke Hepatitis Diverticulitis HIV test Multiple chemical sensitivity Glucocorticoid
