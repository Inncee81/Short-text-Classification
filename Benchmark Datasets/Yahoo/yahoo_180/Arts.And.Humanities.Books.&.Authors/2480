what did you like and dislike about harry potter and the dealthy hallows i liked the whole thing all together but it really made me smile when mrs weasley said not my daughter you b ha ha that made me laugh but i didn't like how many people died for me there was no point in killing off my dear fred and i was really saddened when remus and tonks died when i read that part the first thing i thought was oh crap what about baby teddy but it seems by the epilogue that teddy has got it pretty good and when dobby died i was so sad and i didn't like how the horcrux spelling was 'reacting' towards ronald i was really angry when i read that part but i was really happy for ron when he distroyed it i was happy for neville for finally getting some credit for things and was i the only one who got the vibe that luna and dean where getting to get to know eachother a lot better during the last book anyway i'm happy harry and ron got the girls they wanted and had beautiful babies as emma watson so puts it and yes irish guy it was worth typing out i liked seeing that they had children and how everything is well with them and naming one of harry's sons after snape was cool i was sad about fred and tonks deaths killing only one of the twins was really bad what about his brother how sad his life must be without fred also all that boring time in the forests not knowing where to go i could have told them tons of places to start looking overall good but it had some holes Harry Potter (character) Ron Weasley Blood purity (Harry Potter) Ginny Weasley Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Magical objects in Harry Potter Battle of Hogwarts Hermione Granger Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter: Book Seven Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year EastEnders Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Lord Voldemort Hogwarts subjects Weasley family Minor characters associated with Quidditch Severus Snape Humphrey Bogart Dumbledore's Army Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) House-elf Sirius Black Pitaten Lucius Malfoy Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Remus Lupin Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Minor Harry Potter Beasts Diagon Alley Draco Malfoy AFI 100 Years series Friends Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Fred and George Weasley Luna Lovegood Romulus and Remus Knots Landing Nymphadora Tonks Kodocha Rubeus Hagrid James and Lily Potter Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Sybill Trelawney Boggart (Harry Potter) Marilyn Monroe Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Half-Blood Prince (character) Potions in Harry Potter Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Charmed Dobby Bill Weasley Death Eater Time Out of Mind Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) K' Ministry of Magic Luke and Laura Spencer Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter M*A*S*H (TV series) Horace Slughorn Professor Quirrell Little Britain Albus Dumbledore Peter Pettigrew The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Felix Felicis Hogwarts Floor Directory Theory of conduct The Star Wars Holiday Special History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Gilderoy Lockhart Dead Like Me Phoebe Buffay's songs Shaggy dog story Minor Slytherins The Amber Spyglass Make money fast Leo Wyatt Frankie Laine Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Scenes from a Memory Ron and Fez
