who is iago on the agatha christie website someone compared christie's norton to iago bit i can't remember who he is iago is a supporting character in shakespeare's tragedy othello the villain of the story iago treacherously brings about the downfall of his close friend the title character of the story iago leads othello to slay desdemona othello's wife having convinced othello that she is being unfaithful to him with his lieutenant cassio iago is referred to by several characters as honest iago showing the great irony that he is the villain of the story he is believed to be a valiant honest trustworthy man until his truer nature is revealed by his wife toward the end of the play after both othello and desdemona are dead critics have argued over the character of iago and his motives for hating othello lines in the play indicate that he was passed over for a promotion and also that he may have been prompted by racism othello being a moor he also suspects his wife of having been unfaithful to him with othello however all of these motives are presented as asides so no one is certain what the true driving force was for iago i would say the key thing about iago's character is the irony that he was so well liked and trusted when he was obviously so undeserving of those things Otello Shakespeare on screen Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Agatha Christie Reputation Julius Caesar (play) O (film) Palpatine Kingdom Hearts II EastEnders William Shakespeare MacGuffin Gargoyles (animated series) Kingdom Hearts Oroonoko Hamlet The Pilgrim's Progress King Lear Aladdin (1992 film) Days of our Lives Ian McKellen Christopher Eccleston Edmund Kean Whodunit Alignment (role-playing games) Macbeth Augustan drama BBC Television Shakespeare Paul Robeson Crime film Antony and Cleopatra Tragedy Reversi The Picture of Dorian Gray Irony Hulk (comics) Buffy the Vampire Slayer Theory of conduct Mystique (comics) Sleeping Murder Sunset Beach (soap opera) Story within a story Daredevil Adultery in literature The Dunciad Anna Karenina All My Children The Return of Jafar Cymbeline Kenneth Branagh Ten Commandments Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Limerick (poetry) Pacifism One Tree Hill (TV series) Scientific racism Phaedo Resurrection of Jesus Joker (comics) Captain Planet and the Planeteers Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Orson Welles Memento (film) Randall Flagg Knots Landing Mithos Yggdrasill Crime fiction Serial The Shawshank Redemption Sherlock Holmes The Tempest (play) Swamp Thing Minor Discworld characters Julia Stiles Catwoman The Untouchables Tenchi Muyo!
