why wasn't hermione put into raven claw why wasn't neville in hufflepuff is it strange to anyone else that hermione wast put into ravenclaw whose house is known to value intelligence knowledge why was't neville put into hufflepuff huffle values hard work loyalty teamwork patience friendship and fair play his love for herbology and his faireness should have put hime there hi no for me it's not strange you may have lots of qualities but only one will get you to a house hermione's obviously intelligent but the hat perceived that she was even more courageous and brave at least that what i always understood so it placed her on gryffindor i remember hermione saying in one book don't remember one that the hat doubted putting her in ravenclaw when she wore it on her first year however it chose gryffindor at the end just how the hat hesitated with harry now that i come think of it it is probable that just as harry hermione presented the hat with her opinion in book one she says on the train that she hopes to be in gryffindor maybe just as it occurred when the hat thought of placing harry in slytherin he took her opinion on it chose her courage over her brains how as far as neville and hufflepuff i always understood that they were people with muggle blood hufflepuff takes the rest as the hat sang once considering neville was pure pure pure blood it resulted kind of obvious to me the other houses would come first in consideration however he is courageous and he leaves it clear in book when he tries to stop his friends after all that is also why dumbledore gives him the last points that award gryffindor that year's house cup now you have to remember no person or character is one sided it doesn't mean that you are dumb if you are not in ravenclaw or that you are not loyal if you are not in gryffindor or that only hufflepuffs are friendly people have many qualities and they show them all the time maybe one prevails over all whether you see which one or not but i think there is a little bit of every house in each one of us as sirius says there are not only good people and death eathers we all have both good and bad inside of us on which side do we act is what makes us who we are wow long answer but i really got excited goodluck Ron Weasley Minor Ravenclaws Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Hermione Granger The Hogwarts Founders Ginny Weasley Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Dates in Harry Potter Minor Slytherins Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Hogwarts subjects Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Dumbledore's Army Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Minor characters associated with Quidditch Blood purity (Harry Potter) Hogwarts Floor Directory Neville Longbottom Luna Lovegood Horcrux Diagon Alley Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Magic (Harry Potter) Severus Snape Harry Potter: Book Seven Rubeus Hagrid Hogwarts ghosts R.A.B.
