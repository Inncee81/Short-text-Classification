what makes a good manga i am writing a manga and i have the plot and everything but i must know how do i build up ecitement in my manga and keep people intrested in it what does a good manga usually have good drawings and character design like their clothes hair ect and you have to be able to match up the drawings and the dialoge it also has to be easy enough to read so you can't make the panels like all over the place the main thing that draws me in is the characters and the issues they face i would try to have my characters posses strong relationships complex personalities and an interesting past good luck i hope your manga turns out great Trigun Manga Pitaten Gravitation (manga) Hyuga Hinata Samurai Deeper Kyo Yu-Gi-Oh!
