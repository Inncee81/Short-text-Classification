what happened in the rd book eclipse i was just wondering what happened i know the book hasn't been released yet but i read that some of the books have accidentally been shipped and read already so i figured somebody on yahoo must have gotten the book by now and read it help i really wanna know i just want to know what happens between bella and edward and nothing else i have absolutely no clue the most i know is that something is going to happen i think between bella and jacob or bella and edward because bella decided that she was going to place a bet against alice hope this helps i really doubt that bella might become a vampire in this book i can say that according to stephenie meyer's website their might be a narrator change i just hope that if that is true that the narrator becomes edward that way the story will keep it's balance Jon Secada Narrator Ibn Tibbon Sherlock Holmes The Apprentice 2 Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Fight Club Douglas Adams Vietnam Veterans Against the War The Pilgrim's Progress Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Alice Liddell Stratemeyer Syndicate We Belong Together The Lovely Bones The Dark Knight Returns I Want to Hold Your Hand Dante Alighieri Mulholland Drive (film) Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends Oroonoko I Ching The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Trapped in the Closet Ahmed Ben Bella Predestination paradox AVN Awards Grammatical mood Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Algerian War of Independence Memento (film) Paul Is Dead Chronology of the Ancient Near East Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Choose Your Own Adventure Anglo-Saxon literature History of Test cricket (to 1883) A Day in the Life 24 (television) On the Road Parallax The Brady Bunch Oprah Winfrey Ulysses (novel) Nation of Islam Storytelling Coming of Age (TNG episode) BBC Radio 4 Stevie Nicks Intelligent design movement Discworld About Schmidt Scenes from a Memory Burden of proof Syphon Filter Jeopardy!
