charles dickens a tale of two cities chatacter hey can somone please post like a paragraph on a character from this book about how he was at the start and how his characteristics etc changed through it and his result characteristics at the end ty analysis of major characters sydney carton sydney carton proves the most dynamic character in a tale of two cities he first appears as a lazy alcoholic attorney who cannot muster even the smallest amount of interest in his own life he describes his existence as a supreme waste of life and takes every opportunity to declare that he cares for nothing and no one but the reader senses even in the initial chapters of the novel that carton in fact feels something that he perhaps cannot articulate in his conversation with the recently acquitted charles darnay carton s comments about lucie manette while bitter and sardonic betray his interest in and budding feelings for the gentle girl eventually carton reaches a point where he can admit his feelings to lucie herself before lucie weds darnay carton professes his love to her though he still persists in seeing himself as essentially worthless this scene marks a vital transition for carton and lays the foundation for the supreme sacrifice that he makes at the novel s end carton s death has provided much material for scholars and critics of dickens s novel some readers consider it the inevitable conclusion to a work obsessed with the themes of redemption and resurrection according to this interpretation carton becomes a christ like figure a selfless martyr whose death enables the happiness of his beloved and ensures his own immortality other readers however question the ultimate significance of carton s final act they argue that since carton initially places little value on his existence the sacrifice of his life proves relatively easy however dickens s frequent use in his text of other resurrection imagery his motifs of wine and blood for example suggests that he did intend for carton s death to be redemptive whether or not it ultimately appears so to the reader as carton goes to the guillotine the narrator tells us that he envisions a beautiful idyllic paris rising from the abyss and sees the evil of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out just as the apocalyptic violence of the revolution precedes a new society s birth perhaps it is only in the sacrifice of his life that carton can establish his life s great worth Charles Dickens A Course In Miracles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Tale of Genji The Brothers Karamazov Christian eschatology Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Acts of the Apostles Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Gospel of John Historicity of Jesus Gospel of Mark Baptism Book of Revelation Jesus Apocalypse God Cultural and historical background of Jesus Justin Martyr Resurrection of Jesus Phaedo End times Anne Rice The Lovely Bones Kain (Legacy of Kain) Pitaten Hans Christian Andersen Lucille Ball EastEnders Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Legacy of Kain Anatomy of Criticism Roman Catholic Church Summa Theologiae Rudolf Steiner Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Biblical inerrancy Objectivist philosophy Abrahamic religion Literature Christianity Knots Landing Creationism Paul of Tarsus Book of Mormon Sacrifice Modernism The Shawshank Redemption Marie Antoinette Law of value Republic (dialogue) Justification (theology) Bhagavad Gita Socrates Nineteen Eighty-Four Sin Mary Jane Watson The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Brideshead Revisited Messiahs in fiction and fantasy Altruism Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Sola fide Ludwig Wittgenstein Tacitus C.
