okay one last question for today how do you go about selling an idea to a filmmaker or producer of some sort first you need to have your work published then what does it need to be published by a reputable house or will the content of the story or ideas win a decisionmaker over i only ask this because ive seen so many examples from phillip k dicks works being turned into bladerunner minority report total recall and the guy who wrote die hard in certain cases the movies have very little to do with the actual story that might even be a short one at that so is the actual idea or plot synopsis worth more than a full story can you just scribble down good original ideas for movies have them published and sell the rights to a filmmaker how does all of this work thank you for all your help again idea are free for the taking and using only your words in print are salable it's the completed story that wins them over then they'll rewrite it to find the medium you do need to have an agent that knows how to retain your media rights and then if the book gets good reviews the agent may be able to sell it to a media concern The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Publishing Screenwriting Ghost in the Shell Plame affair Blade Runner Copyright Fight Club Thomas Pynchon The Matrix Film director Self-publishing Extreme Programming The Hobbit Hyperinflation Theory of conduct John Lott Carl Barks Minority Report (film) Grant Morrison Terry Pratchett Modesty Blaise Killian documents The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Blood on the Tracks Marshall McLuhan World Wide Web Journalism ethics and standards Manga U.S. presidential election, 2000 Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Chuck Palahniuk First Amendment to the United States Constitution Dick Tracy Anthroposophy Halloween (film) Science fiction Discworld Doctor Who spin-offs Freedom of speech Advertising Iraq and weapons of mass destruction H.P.
