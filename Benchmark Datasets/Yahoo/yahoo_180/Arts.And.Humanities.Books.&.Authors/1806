what harry potter character do you like better who do you like better out of peeves dobby or kreacher peeve's song from book potter you rotter oh what have you done your killing of studentsand you think its great fun peeves was funny but dobby was loyal to the end i always like a laugh so i'd pick peeves however i don't like to imagine being at the end of his antics seriously though i like kreacher better dobby is more hero worshipping even before he met harry potter yes he is loyal but i think it's romanticism what harry meant to him and to his kind etc kreacher on the other hand is more complex and i like the fact that he changed when shown compassion and affection and that scene with mundungus was simply hilarious i really got a laugh with his line one more please master harry for good luck in all dobby's moments he never made me laugh like that single line of kreacher's Dobby Kreacher House-elf Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Sirius Black Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter (character) R.A.B.
