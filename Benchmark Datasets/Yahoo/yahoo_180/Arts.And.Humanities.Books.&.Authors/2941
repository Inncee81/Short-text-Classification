i have a couple of harry potter questions what shape does hermione's boggart take is the reason that umbridge was so mean because she was wearing the horcrux locket who is fabian prewitt if the sorting hat was killed let's say then why at the end does james talk about the sorting hat did they make a new one or did they mend the old one if harry would have told narcissa malfoy that draco was killed then what do you think she would have done told voldy that he was alive just a few questions thanks for answering them sorry i forgot a few questions who do you think is the new hogwarts headmaster or headmistress and do you think that harry was an auror now i think it would be pointless to be an auror since there wouldn't really be anyone bad left since voldy and the death eaters are gone we never find out as far as i know in book three ron makes fun of her by saying that he boggart would become an essay paper with a grade of a minus after reading part of book three during the end of year exams hermoine's boggart turns into mcgonnagall telling her she failed all her exams i think it is you have to remember how the locket affected the trio hermione harry and ron while they were wearing it of course the one that was most affected was ron he is one of the prewitts a family that was targeted by voldermort also its the maiden name of molly weasley maybe they just mended it that is a good question throughtout all of book seven i got the feeling that the malfoys were no longer on voldermorts side but trying to help harry i mean sure draco made things a little difficult for harry in the room of requirement but then draco started trying to make goyle and crabbe stop attacking harry i think that narcissa would have let harry live to stop voldermort even if her son was death just a few answers thanks for asking them Ginny Weasley Blood purity (Harry Potter) Dumbledore's Army Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Battle of Hogwarts Hermione Granger Minor Hufflepuffs Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Minor Slytherins Lord Voldemort Sirius Black Harry Potter (character) Minor Ravenclaws Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Severus Snape Harry Potter: Book Seven Albus Dumbledore Potions in Harry Potter Diagon Alley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Weasley family Minor characters associated with Quidditch Rubeus Hagrid Narcissa Malfoy Nymphadora Tonks Hogwarts Houses Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Fred and George Weasley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Lucius Malfoy Horace Slughorn Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Rita Skeeter R.A.B.
