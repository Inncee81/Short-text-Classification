in the book halfway to the sky what's beagle's problem i pick best answer i just finished reading halfway to the sky and it didn't really explain much about beagle i thought he was so nice in the begining and then when dani caught up with him he acted like a jerk what happened to the nice sensitive guy in the begining who bought dani breakfast i do give pts for best answer thanks well i think the encounters meant so much more to dani than they did to beagle to him she was just some nice kid dani was feeling needy even though she was setting out alone she needed someone and thought beagle was the someone she needed it did give her some strength to go on some confidence but he wasn't looking for an attachment especially not from a child his point of view and too he may have been afraid she was being too attached have ever done something nice for someone impulsively and then had that someone decide that you are instantly bff that's part of the old saying no good deed goes unpunished beagle was on his own quest dani just hoped he would be a part of her journey and he was genuinely concerned that she was on her own at first but she assured him she was with people and he accepted it she went to let him know that she was now with her mom but since he didn't know she'd been on the trail alone it didn't mean anything to him hadn't she already told him she was with her folks but yeah we were on dani's side and hoping it meant more to him than it obviously did Shaggy dog story The Voyage of the Beagle She Loves You Theory of conduct Charles Darwin Charles Darwin's views on religion Extreme Programming Publication of Darwin's theory Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Highway 61 Revisited The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Charles Darwin's education Piccolo Junior Saga George Costanza Jean Grey 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Reservoir Dogs Karen Horney The Contender (television series) Altruism The Subtle Knife The Amber Spyglass The Apprentice 2 Transactional analysis Ayyavazhi mythology Charles Darwin's illness Recurring South Park characters Empire Burlesque Inception of Darwin's theory Prisoner's dilemma The Catcher in the Rye Peanuts Poker jargon Surveillance Plame affair Characters in the Smurfs Gerald Durrell The Ashlee Simpson Show Coming of Age (TNG episode) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Sharon Tate Scrooge McDuck Atlanta Thrashers Futurama (TV series - season 5) Wallflower (comics) Time Out of Mind Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Milton H.
