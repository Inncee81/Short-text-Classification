i am predicting the last last hary potter book to be out in july what are others ideas please please do not say this is the last one its been said before to increase sales like rocky then then so on the author herself had admitted before the sale of last book there would probably be another this time for charity thats how i knew harry would not be killed this time the question is not will there be one but when harry is older so he can still have older adventures thank you sophie for confirming clearly what i just said with your facts too i wish others would read my question try to understand it like you instead of doing what i said not to she said she would not rule it out in other words shes already planning it probably sorry i think jk rowling said book was a definite end for harry she said she will publish an encyclopedia though so that might be what you are talking about sounds good to me for the encyclopedia this is from wikipedia she is not planning to write an eighth harry potter book but has suggested she might publish an encyclopedia of the harry potter world consisting of all her unpublished material and notes when asked in an interview on the july episode of friday night with jonathan ross whether she would ever write an eighth harry potter novel rowling confirmed that she only ever planned to write seven books in the series but also that she could not rule it out entirely um i think that harry's story comes to quite a clear end in book seven but i've always said that i wouldn't say never i can't say i'll never write another book about that world just because i think what do i know in ten years time i might want to return to it but i think it's unlikely J.
