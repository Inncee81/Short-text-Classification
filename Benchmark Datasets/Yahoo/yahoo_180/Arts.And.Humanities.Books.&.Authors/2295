what harry potter book was the best or your favorite i definately liked the third book it was to the point and she put alot of imagination in there unlike other which focused on one thing rather then real immagination i agree with you the third one is just way more imaginative than all the others i also like the fact that harry is still young and learning about things not just worrying about voldemort all the time as a matter of fact this book is the only one where he doesn't actually face voldemort instead he gets a huge twist which introduces my favorite character sirius this book out of all the others warms my heart and makes the best read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ginny Weasley Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Dates in Harry Potter Severus Snape Harry Potter: Book Seven Magical objects in Harry Potter Minor Hufflepuffs Harry Potter R.A.B.
