what is an autosexuality i am just curious to what it is for some reason i am writing a book and i am writing one of my characters as an autosexual i know narcissus is an example of one the character is in love with himself so thats what i was aiming for but i wondered if there is more to that if i were to label him an autosexual you could describe him or her as a person who is more in tune with their sexuality then with anyone else a person who truly satisfies themselves without the need of another human he or she can excite and please them self and is happy with it no other human can satisfy their cravings like themselves hope it helps Human Love Sexual orientation Narcissism Tanha Utility Bisexuality Nicomachean Ethics Human sexual behavior Gautama Buddha Supernatural Elvis and Me Paradise Lost Novel Adi Da Heterosexuality Child sexuality Laurell K.
