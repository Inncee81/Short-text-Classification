how do i read chapter books faster bookworm is my name so i enojoy to read chapter books very much but how do i read chapter books faster and i'm serious lol answer this please there is a technique known as speed reading i have tried to teach myself using an instruction book and failed miserably supposedly this technique teaches you how to double at least the speed of reading and retain more information from the book as well as i said i failed to teach myself but there are people who have had a great deal of success perhaps you can convince your parents to spring for a speed reading course it will definitely help you in your school work i could provide the basic technique but as it failed to work for me i doubt that my instruction would do any good for you normally i learn entirely from books but i could not make this work i hope this helps jim Speed reading Education CPU design CPU cache Contract bridge Francis Crick RISC Book of Mormon Compiler optimization Central processing unit The Book of Five Rings Dog agility F.
