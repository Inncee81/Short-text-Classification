who hates the years later chapter in the last hp book i hated the ending it spoiled the whole book i mean who wants to think of hp as married to ginny and sending his kids off to hogwarts what a crummy epilogue geez people don't you understand the point that epilogue was intended to show that live went on after voldemort everyone went on to live a normal regular life the whole series was always hinting at how unusual voldemort's rise to power was so here we see that with him removed life regains it's balance sure maybe in a hundred years another dark wizard will make a play for power but he'll probably fall quickly the ongoing battle with voldemort was the magical world's equivalent to world war two and once it was over everyone tried to get past it Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter (character) Hogwarts Death Eater Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Dates in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Order of the Phoenix Sybill Trelawney James and Lily Potter Magic (Harry Potter) Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Battle of Hogwarts Blood purity (Harry Potter) Hermione Granger Ron Weasley Barty Crouch Horace Slughorn Sword of Truth Hogwarts subjects Magical objects in Harry Potter Neville Longbottom Fred and George Weasley Ministry of Magic Diagon Alley Rubeus Hagrid Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Lucius Malfoy Dark Art Harry Potter: Book Seven Minerva McGonagall Sirius Black Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Fawkes Quidditch Tom Riddle's diary Draco Malfoy Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Dark Mark Dumbledore's Army Wizarding world R.A.B.
