thing not just a summary like copied from the book full please nothing fake i already know who dies so please this isn't a question asking for spoilers this is a question asking for the epilogue i will most definitly pick the best answer right after the hours thanks slight spoiler warning beware nineteen years later autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year the morning of the first september was crisp and golden as an apple and the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great sooty station the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air two large cages rattlde on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing the owls inside them hooted indignantly and the redheaded girl trailed tearfully behind her brothers clutching her father's arm it won't be long and you'll be going too harry told her two years sniffed lily i want to go now the commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten albus's voice drifted back to harry over the surrounding clamor his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car i won't i won't be in slytherin james give it a rest said ginny i only said he might be said james grinning at his younger brother there's nothing wrong with that he might be in slyth but james caught his mother's eye and fell silent the five potters approached the barrier with a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother james took the trolley from his mother and broke into a rn a moment later he had vanished you'll write to me won't you albus asked his parents immdiately capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother every day if you want us to said ginny not every day asid slbus quickly james said most people only get letters from home about once a month we wrote to james three times a week last year said ginny and you don't want to believe everything he tells you about hogwarts harry put in he likes a laugh your brother side by side they pushed the second trolley forward gathering speed as they reached the barrier albus winced but no collision came instead the family immerged onto platform nine and three quarters which was obscured by thick whute steam that was puring from the hogwarts express indistinct figures were swarming through the mist into which james had already disappeared where are they asked albus anxiously peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made their way down the platform we'll find them said ginny reassuringly but the vapor was dense and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces detached from their owners voices sounded unnaturally loud harry thought he heard percy discoursing loudly on brromstick regulations and was quite glad of that excuse not to stop and say hello i think that's them al said ginny suddenly a group of four people emerged from the mist standing alongside the very last carraige their faces only came into focus when harry ginny lily and albus had drawn right up to them hi said albus sounding immensly relieved rose who was already wearing her brand new hogwatrs robes beamed at him parked all right then ron asked harry i did hermione didn't believe i could pass a muggle driving test did you she thought i'd have to confund the examiner no i didn't said hermione i had complete faith in you as a matter of fact i did confund him ron whispered to harry as together they lifted albus's trunk and owl onto the train i only forgot to look in the wing mirror and let s face it i can use a supersensory charm on that back on the platform they found lily and hugo rose's younger brother having an animated discussion about which house they would be sorted into when they finally went to hogwarts if you're not in gryffindor we'll disinherit you said ron but no pressure ron lily and hugo laughed but albus and rose looked solemn he doesn't mean it said hermione and ginny but ron wa sno longer paying attention catching harry's eye he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away the steam thinned for a moment and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist look who it is draco malfoy was standing there with his wife and son a dark coat buttoned up to his throat his hair was receding somewhat which emphasized the pointed chin the new boy resembled draco as mush as albus resembled harry draco caught sight of harry ron hermione and ginny staring at him nodded curtly and turned away again so that's little scorpius said ron under his breath make sure you beat him in every test rosie thank god you inherited your mother's brains ron for heaven's sake said hermione half stern half amused don't try to turn them against each other before they've even started school you're right sorry said ron but unable to help himself he added don't get too friendly with him though rosie granddad weasley would never forgive you if you amrried a pureblood hey james had reappeared he had divested himself with his trunk owl and trolley and was evidently bursting with news teddy's back there he said breathlessly pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam just seen him and guess what he's doing snogging victoire he gazed up at the adults evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction our teddy teddy lupin snogging our victoire our cousin and i asked teddy what he was doing you interrupted them said ginny you are so like ron and he said he'd come to see her off and then he told me to go away he's snogging her james added as though worried he had not made himself clear oh it would be lovely of they got married whispered lily ecstatically teddy would really be part of the family then he already comes round for dinner about four times a week said harry why don't we just invite him to live with us and have done with it yeah said james enthusiastically i don't mind sharing with al teddy can have my room no said harry firmly you and al will share a room only when i want the house demolished he checked the battered old watch that had once been fabian prewett's it's nearly eleven you'd better get on board don't forget to give neville our love ginny told james as she hugged him mum i can't give a professor love but you know neville james rolled his eyes outside yeah but at school he s professor longbottom isn't he i can't walk into herbology and give him love shaking his head at his mother's foolishness he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at albus see you later al watch out for the thestrals i thought they were invisible you said they were invisible but james merely laughed permitted his mother to kiss him gave his father a fleeting hug then lept onto the rapidly filling train they saw him wave then sprint up the corridor to find his friends thestrals are nothing to worry about harry told albus they're gentle things there's nothing scary about them anyway you won't be going up to school in the carraiges you'll be going in the boats ginny kissed albus good bye see you at christmas bye al said harry as his son hugged him don't forget hagrid's invited you to tea next friday don't mess with peeves don't duel anyone til you've learned how and don't let james wind you up what if i'm in slytherin the whisper was for his father alone and harry knew that only the moment of departure could have forced albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was harry crouched down so that albus's face was slightly above his own alone of harry'e three children albus had inherited lily's eyes albus severus harry said quietly so that nobody but ginny could hear and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to rose who was now on the train you were named for two headmasters of hogwarts one of them was a slytherin and he was probably the bravest man i ever knew but just say then slytherin house will have gained an excellent student won't it it doesn't matter to us al but if it matters to you you'll be able to choose gryffindor over slytherin the sorting hat takes your choice into account really it did for me said harry he had never told any of his children that before and he saw the wonder in albus's face when he said it but now the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train and the blurred outlines of parents were swarming forward for final kisses last minute reminders albus jumped into the carraige and ginny closed the door behind him students were hanging from the windows nearest them a great number of faces both on the train and off seemed to be turned to harry why are they all staring demanded albus as he and rose craned around to look at the other students don't let it worry you said ron it's me i'm extremely famous albus rose hugo and lily laughed the train began to move and harry walked alongside it watching his son's thin face already ablaze with excitement harry kept smiling and waving even though it was like a little bereavement watching his son glide away from him the last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air the train rounded a corner harry's hand was still raised in farewell he'll be all right murmured ginny as harry looked at her he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on his forehead i know he will the scar had not pained harry for nineteen years all was well
