harry potter hi shhh this is leah's friend kala she told me that she won't tell me who kills fred without reading the book but i want to know who killed fred and why it was a spell from one of the death eaters i don't remember which one it was or even if jkr says in the book but the spell didn't hit fred and it wasn't even aimed at him in the first place the spell missed its intended target and hit a wall which collapsed onto fred and crushed him to death there's really no why to it it just happened in the context of the battle fred's death was collateral damage instead of being specifically intended Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ron Weasley Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Magical objects in Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Minor Harry Potter Beasts Minor Slytherins Final Fantasy magic James and Lily Potter Weasley family Minor Hufflepuffs Collateral (film) Dates in Harry Potter Ginny Weasley Paul Is Dead Sirius Black Limp Bizkit Collateral damage Battle of Hogwarts Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Death Eater Dumbledore's Army Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Rubeus Hagrid Methos Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Euphemism Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Minor characters associated with Quidditch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Hogwarts Houses Diagon Alley Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone J.
