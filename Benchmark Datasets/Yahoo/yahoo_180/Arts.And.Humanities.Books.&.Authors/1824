has anyone here read the th harry potter book and what do you think i've just finished the book a few days ago and i loved it but i'm a little upset sirius and dumbledore didnt come back and i'm shocked with what it said about snape i love harry potter so much i made a harry potter drawing book what did you think of it ps if you go tto my other hp question i might give you best answer it starts like harry potter fans before i start on the things i wasn't happy with i thought that overall she has achieved something remarkable and with deathly hallows she produced an ultimately fitting and satisfying end to the saga bloody well done some random thoughts below the board meeting at the beginning with voldemort was kind of funny it reminded me too much of dr evil yes the camping was extra boring and repetitive the first two thirds of the book was just dreadful from that respect towards the end i was disturbed by they way harry was flinging around 'unforgivable' curses since when was 'cruciato' an appropriate punishment for spitting on someone it was about as believable as young anakin killing all the children in the jedi nursery oh yeah we get it he's conflicted the last third was great fantastic even wrapped up everything and it even had reasonable explanations well except i think pulling the sword out of the sorting hat was a bit 'deux ex machina' the epilogue was completely worthless it should not have been there at all my imagination made up much better after stories for each of them the deaths all seems a bit arbitrary and lacking in feeling it felt like she just wanted to get the body count up whoop de do i wanted to see more from luna i enjoyed evanna lynch's performance so much in order of the phoenix what do we have to look forward to now and after six books and this huge build up for ginny she was given absolutely nothing to do in deathly hallows maybe ms rowling thought that bonnie wouldn't be up to it a sad result it was not very satisfying that harry got ownership of the unbeatable wand when he defeated draco who was using another wand perhaps this fits in strictly with how jk defined wands to behave but it seemed counter intuitive and weak the hallows themselves didn't seem to matter very much the invisibility cloak boring after years and the stone from the ring it just meant that harry didn't have to use a patronus to keep the dementors away yeah that sounds like a doomsday device the unbeatable wand i have already discussed i was amused by the idiotic defenses at gringots i was expecting that more ingenuity would be required to break in let's just say it wasn't exactly fort knox i wish she had done better with some aspects of the final book but in the end it was kind of tremendous Ron Weasley Magic (Harry Potter) Albus Dumbledore Hermione Granger Severus Snape Dates in Harry Potter Death Eater Hogwarts subjects Hogwarts Minor Ravenclaws Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter Battle of Hogwarts James and Lily Potter Rubeus Hagrid Diagon Alley Sirius Black Blood purity (Harry Potter) Hogwarts Houses Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Draco Malfoy Nymphadora Tonks Order of the Phoenix Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Remus Lupin R.A.B.
