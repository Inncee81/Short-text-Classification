do you think i should use a pseudonym or my real name when publishing a book i'm either going to publish a book under the name sandia ashley or watermelon but i can't choose which do you think i should use and please don't choose your answer on a basis of which sound more professional please thanks everybody who has answered this gave really good reasons and thank you for that now here's a third option watermelon ashley i took a lot of what into consideration so how is that go with sandia ashley for the simple fully professional reason that you book will be shelved where readers will see it at or slightly above eyeline people using pseudonyms have to think about more than just which pseudonym they like better but about marketing if your real name started with w and you wanted to use it i'd say go for it but selecting a name likely to be shelved outside of the prime space is just a poor business decision only a's and b's are sure to be well shelved depending on the size and number of shelves but since they'll space out the books to fill the space and there will be few x's y's and z's you can count on a w pen name putting you at or below knee level and correspondingly poorer sales Pseudonym Microeconomics Supply and demand Bookbinding Digital photography Single Transferable Vote Pen name Decision theory Hash table Fanta Quicksort Lechaina Social rule Equine conformation CPU cache Education in Romania Watermelon Mathematics Halting problem Chess opening Floppy disk Ra (board game) Empire Burlesque Lebesgue integration Doctor Who spin-offs Atari 8-bit family Redundant array of independent disks Library Laserdisc Vector (spatial) Tax Don Rosa Economics Professional wrestling Novel Capital accumulation Anne Rice Expert system The Apprentice 2 Combinatorics Crime fiction Random walk Model (economics) Entropy Sudoku Library catalog Arthur Schopenhauer On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Approval voting Corporate finance The Skeptical Environmentalist Windows 2000 Real estate broker Vanity press Baseball New Coke Axiom of choice Albuquerque, New Mexico Blood on the Tracks Jack Kirby FairTax Canadian and American health care systems compared Surplus value Fast bowling RISC Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Moe Berg Amiga Power Biblical inerrancy Cabinet of the United Kingdom Wild ARMs 2 Radiation hardening The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Legal research CPU design Sydney Riot of 1879 Ming Pao Robert A.
