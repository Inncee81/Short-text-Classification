people who read the last harry potter spoiler warning how did nevil get the sword of gryphandor to kill nagini with i thought griphook ran off with it when they broke into gringotts i thought for a while that it was the fake one but didn't they leave it in the vault did i miss something or was he using a different sword altogether my hubby is reading the book right now so i can't read it over again right now and i probably butchered the spellings too neville pulled the sword out of the sorting hat the same as harry did in the chamber of secrets although the sword was left with griphook the enchantments on it were such that it returned to hogwarts in a time of need a true gryffindor can pull the sword out of the hat in time of need which neville was this is a case of the goblins not realizing the true nature of something they had created to a goblin the person who pays for an item is only renting it but in this case at least the sword belonged to the gryffindors at hogwarts and so returned to them it was more than the sword of godric gryffindor it was the sword of all gryffindors Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hogwarts Horcrux Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Magical objects in Harry Potter Hogwarts Houses Harry Potter (character) Diagon Alley Ginny Weasley Ron Weasley The Hogwarts Founders Minor Ravenclaws Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Hogwarts subjects Minor Hufflepuffs Wizarding world Hermione Granger James and Lily Potter Minor characters associated with Quidditch Hogwarts Floor Directory Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter: Book Seven Fawkes Neville Longbottom Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Dobby Death Eater Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Albus Dumbledore Weasley family Rubeus Hagrid Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Sirius Black Minor Slytherins Blood purity (Harry Potter) Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Hogwarts ghosts Quidditch House-elf Hogwarts Express Harry Potter Portraits in Hogwarts Minerva McGonagall Minor Harry Potter Beasts Dumbledore's Army Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) Green Goblin Magic (Harry Potter) Money in Harry Potter Battle of Hogwarts Weapons of Middle-earth Sybill Trelawney Bill Weasley Drizzt Do'Urden Ministry of Magic Tom Riddle Miss Saigon Fred and George Weasley Luna Lovegood Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup Colin and Dennis Creevey Harry Potter in translation series Kill Bill Tom Riddle's diary Hobgoblin (comics) Horace Slughorn Link (Legend of Zelda) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) J.
