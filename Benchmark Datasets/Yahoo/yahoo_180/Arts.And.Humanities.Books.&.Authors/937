thoughts on twilight by stephenie meyer being made into a movie twilight has been picked to possibly be made into a movie check stephenie meyer's website www stepheniemeyer com i personally dont want it to be made into a movie because im scared that they may ruin stephenie meyer's wonderful story line or choose horrible actors to play the characters i would cry if they ruined edward or ruined the characters that would be the worst thing ever i dont think i would be alone in saying that there would be some pissed off fans if the movie producers ruiuned edward cullens character but at the same time i think it would be interesting to see it as a movie just to see how movie producers would would create it and who they would choose to be the characters but i still would be very pissed if they ever ruined the book and i want to know what you guys think so please do tell i don't want it to be made into a movie either they would never ever be able to tell the story like stephanie can they're probably going to get actors opposite of their description also they're likely to mess up the plot and they're not going to take stephanie's advise totally stupid idiots but then i'm really curious to see if they don't fuck up i wonder sometimes who they might choose for actors well i just repeated everything you said in a shorter crappier version now i'm off to re read twilight before eclipse is out Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind Paul W.
