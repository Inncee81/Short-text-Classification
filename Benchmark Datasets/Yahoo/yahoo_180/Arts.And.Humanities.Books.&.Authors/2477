elder wand i think i get it but i need a confirmation or two before i discuss it with other readers lol so i need someone to explain how the elder wand ended up being harrys it went from who to who and in what situation did the transfer happen thanks as seen in the vision harry saw through voldemort's eyes when he looked into gregorovitch's the wand maker's mind the elder wand was stolen from gregorovitch we later find out that it was grindelwald who stole the wand hence when grindelwald and dumbledore dueled in and dumbledore won dumbledore became the master of the elder wand in the th book when draco disarms dumbledore he unknowingly becomes the master of the elder wand though voldemort stole the elder wand from dumbledore's grave he is not the master of it when he realizes it is not serving him as it should he somewhat correctly believes that it is because the wand belongs to the person who killed its previous owner this is why voldemort kills snape he thinks the passage of the wand went to snape when snape killed dumbledore which is what dumbledore had hoped and planned for and therefore the wand would go to him when he killed snape however as chapter is so wonderfully entitled there is a flaw in the plan in that draco became the master of the elder wand when he disarmed dumbledore when harry disarmed draco at the malfoy's manor harry also unknowingly became the master of both draco's wand and the elder wand funny how his signature move expelliarmus was key in his success since harry is the master of the elder wand it killed voldemort in the final battle Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Severus Snape Lord Voldemort Albus Dumbledore Death Eater Battle of Hogwarts Ron Weasley Harry Potter: Book Seven Dates in Harry Potter Draco Malfoy Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Ginny Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Horace Slughorn Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Magical objects in Harry Potter Hermione Granger Magic (Harry Potter) Order of the Phoenix Sirius Black Bellatrix Lestrange Rubeus Hagrid Diagon Alley Professor Quirrell James and Lily Potter Lucius Malfoy Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Hogwarts Sybill Trelawney Unbreakable Vow Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Dark Art Minor Hufflepuffs Potions in Harry Potter Occlumency Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Remus Lupin Minor Ravenclaws Legilimency R.A.B.
