harry potter did you feel that ron hermonie and harry's magic skills magically accelerated to do such battle in the final book i felt that things were hurried jumbled and even for hp a little too out there at times with some of the explanations i love the series don't get me wrong but i felt that book for all of the hype and build up was really a let down in some ways i think it could have been shorter with the parts in the forest and more time for the trio to hone their magic i felt that ron was totally underdeveloped we were not told anything about the elder wand in any other book and then it is is sooo important we did not know it was buried w dumbledore and then the whole deathly hallows triage out of nowhere it just seemed a little pulled together and some of the explanations just did not fit nicely is it just me or did you see that too spoiler i did feel like the book was put out in a hurried fashion like either the author was tired of the characters and just ready to be done with it or more likely she's fighting the clock with the actors and had to get it done quickly so they could turn it into a script and film it before they all get too old what a shame eh i did think the overall frame plot were good but i agree with you that the whole running around looking for horcruxes dragged and then there were things with the hallows just dropping out of nowhere it was like it just didn't get edited enough Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter: Book Seven Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Dates in Harry Potter Rubeus Hagrid Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Hogwarts Albus Dumbledore Hogwarts subjects Ginny Weasley Wizarding world Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Horace Slughorn R.A.B.
