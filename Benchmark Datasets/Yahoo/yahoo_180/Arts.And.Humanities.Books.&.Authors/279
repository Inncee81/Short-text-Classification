harry potter and the deathly hallows i just finished reading the book but i don't understand anything is harry dead or alive include voldemort if he's dead or alive how did harry meet dumbledore harry is alive voldemort did hit him with the killing curse but he only hit the part of his soul that was inside harry that was the final horcrux he made himslf mortal once more when he hits harry harry becomes unconsious and he begins to have a dream where he is talking to dumbledore's soul when harry becomes consious again voldemort soon discovers harry is not dead and that he is mortal again voldemort hits harry with avada kadavra and it bounces off harry and hits voldemort so voldemort really killed himself you know harry is alive when they mention in the epilouge that his lightning scar hasn't pained him for years voldemort is truly dead it is all very confusing lol Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter (character) Albus Dumbledore Horcrux Dates in Harry Potter Death Eater Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban R.A.B.
