at what point in time should i contact a literary agent about a book project i am currently writing a book that i'd like to have published through traditional channels i am disinterested in self publishing that said i have heard conflicting reports on when to start contacting literary agents must i have a finished project or can i complete a large bulk of it and send portions of it in with the proposal thanks in advance unless it's a non fiction book you're writing you'll need to have the manuscript completed and edited and revised before you begin shopping it around to agents or publishers with fiction they're not interested in ideas or partially completed manuscripts they want the finished product you begin the submission process according to the agent or publisher's submissions requirements some will ask for a query letter only brief letter of introduction some will ask for a query letter and synopsis condensed version of the entire story from start to finish and can be as short as one page depending on the length that is asked for while still others will ask for a query synopsis author bio listing of your publishing credits and chapters from the manuscript once you make the submission in the format they ask for sending it in your own way as opposed to their way is a surefire way to get a rejection letter you sit back and wait if they like it they'll ask for the entire manuscript which is why you have to have it done and ready to go if they ask for it and you say you don't have it finished not only will you likely get a rejection but you've probably burned a contact not a good idea for a writer good luck to you but finish the manuscript before you do anything else Peer review Publishing Bible Screenplay Screenwriting Eugene Onegin Biblical canon Gospel of Mark New Testament Oxford English Dictionary Open Directory Project Book of Kells Short story Literature Mary Wollstonecraft Web crawler Publication of Darwin's theory Norse saga Cthulhu mythos arcane literature Science fiction Jack Kerouac Book Modesty Blaise Frank Herbert Acts of the Apostles Chuck Palahniuk Internet Group Management Protocol Mishnah Junkie (novel) Documentary hypothesis Software testing Style guide Fight Club Alice Liddell Condon Committee C.
