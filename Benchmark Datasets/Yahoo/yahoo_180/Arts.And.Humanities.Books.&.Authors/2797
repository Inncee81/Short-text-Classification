has anyone read the new harry potter book if so tell me if you liked it cuz i did not think it was so great surprisingly i did not like it that much it was not my favorite don't get me wrong it was a good book with some great chapters the prince's tale i just thought j k rowling sort of rushed through it the epilogue in my opinion was too short and vague i thought it was a little to hard for some people to understand every detail in the book because many people on yahoo answers have asked the same questions about certain parts i thought there were too many deaths that were unnecessary the characters just died without much said about them there was also a lot of pointless arguing between harry ron and hermione i was kind of mad on how voldemort just died because it was such an anticipated moment in the series i thought it could have been better Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince R.A.B.
