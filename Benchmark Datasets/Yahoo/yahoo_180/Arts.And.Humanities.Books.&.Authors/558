dobby harry potter if you haven't read the last book this will be a spoiler i have about pages left in the last book but it makes me mad dobby was my fav character i can't believe they killed him then when harry dug the grave by hand then on the tombstone wrote here lies dobby a free elf buddy i cried like a little baby it was bad enough dumbledore died in the last one but why dobby so was anyone else ticked off that they killed dobby first of all i would like to thank you for bringing this up even though i myself am beginning to cry as i write this i actually think that even though it was terribly sad it was good for dobby to die and in this way he died fighting for the one person he ever really stood up for and against the family that treated him like less than dirt for numerous years also by dying j k rowling did his justice in truly and finally making him a free elf House-elf Dobby Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hermione Granger Lucius Malfoy Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) J.
