do i have to go to college i want to be a writer of novels and short stories and honestly can't see myself doing anything else it has been that way since i was seven i'm planning to begin sending out my first novel to agencies by the end of th grade i promised myself that if i don't get any proposals by the first semester of th grade i'll consider college good idea note this isn't my first novel it is about my th this is the one i and readers of it feel the most confident in it would be my first published novel quite honestly it helps most of today's authors have college degrees some publishers even require it i got an english degree but i got a degree in architecture too fortunately i have never had to use that degree but if writing ever slows down for me i can always build bridges or skyscrapers or baseball stadiums that would be cool a woman designed camden yard and several others you also need a contingency plan in case it turns out you aren't going to make it as an author only about of all authors make a living at it you really will need a career to support yourself also you don't send your novel around to agencies that is not how it is done it will only earn you a place on the slush pile waiting for a rejection letter get yourself a copy of writers market and start learning the proper way to query publishers and agents also there are many good answers archived here at resolved questions for you to read through you have to learn to advocate for yourself that takes a lot of time learning how things are done and as for college i would go along with stephen king who said in his opus on writing in order to become a great writer you must first become a great reader i was always a good reader but i didn't become a great reader until i got to college and found a mentor who recognized my writing talents and helped me i truly believe writing is a gift from your creator that you are born with but once you receive that gift it is your responsibility to hone and train it until you have turned the gift into a skill and talent that requires education never underestimate the value of a college education on many levels it not only teaches you subjects it also teaches you things like socialization independence decision making prioritization critical thinking how to present yourself properly and a lot of other important life lessons pax c Education in the United States Scientology beliefs and practices Extreme Programming GED Graduate school Theory of conduct Education Mary Wollstonecraft Intelligent design movement Survivor (novel) Education in Singapore Aesthetic Realism Intelligent design Architecture Theodicy Ontological argument Deconstruction A Course In Miracles Education in Germany Franklin W.
