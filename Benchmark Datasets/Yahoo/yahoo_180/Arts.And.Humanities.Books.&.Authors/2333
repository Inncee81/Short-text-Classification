literature does your knowledge of a writer's life influence your reading of their work i was thinking particularly of jean rhys i very much like her work but i also know quite a lot about her her life in paris the way she couldn't look after a baby etc i was also thinking about philip larkin for example can you read his work without knowing about his life this applies to many writers i'm sure many of you can think of examples interesting question i think it would depend on who it was and what they had written if one found out that the person who had written their favourite book was a child molester it would be difficult to read anything they had written without that fact being at the front of ones mind so i suppose that the answer would have to be yes i know that there have been instances of serial killers and gangsters writing memoirs but they are read specifically for curiosity value therefore that too is influencing one because of the authors notoriety not because of the book Deconstruction Literature Serial killer Socrates Charles Dickens Scientology beliefs and practices Philip Larkin Epistemology Children's literature Plame affair Postmodernism Theory of conduct Modernism Psychology Canadian literature Ludwig Wittgenstein Expert system Serialism British literature Charles Fort EastEnders Junius Frank Herbert Victor Cousin Martial Objectivist philosophy Gary Snyder GED Copy protection Extreme Programming Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Gertrude Stein Chuck Palahniuk Child sexuality The Chronicles of Narnia Education reform Donald Davidson (philosopher) Beat generation Abortion debate Science fiction Coercion James Joyce Andrea Dworkin Carl Jung Function (mathematics) Philosophy of mathematics The Human Stain Jean-Paul Marat Pedophilia Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Victorian literature Ancient Greek literature Japanese literature French literature of the 19th century Supernatural Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Zohar Arthur Machen Magic (paranormal) Tao Te Ching Literacy Scientific method Jean-Jacques Rousseau Biblical inerrancy C.
