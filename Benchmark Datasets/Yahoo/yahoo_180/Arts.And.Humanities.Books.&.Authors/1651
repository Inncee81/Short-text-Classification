some good books with dragons except eragon and the dragon lance check out jane yolen's books the pit dragon trilogy they were favorites of mine as a kid there is also the dragonrider series by anne mccaffrey despite the fact that they are about dragons the books are a little sci fi ish takes place on a different planet later books are all about discovering technology etc i used to like these books but as the series progressed they got increasingly lamer to be honest but they have a huge loyal fan base i'd stick with the earlier books and steer clear of anything published after the late 's if you are super into dragons these books get really into the detail of caring grooming dragons and so forth they are also telepathically linked to their riders like in eragon although this isn't about dragons per se the rd book in the narnia chronicles the voyage of the dawn treader has one of my favorite chapters about an encounter with a dragon i confess i haven't read dragon rider by cornelia funke but i bet it's good i really like inkheart a nice gift type book is dragonology The Chronicles of Narnia Dragonriders of Pern Alaga__sia Anne McCaffrey Eldest C.
