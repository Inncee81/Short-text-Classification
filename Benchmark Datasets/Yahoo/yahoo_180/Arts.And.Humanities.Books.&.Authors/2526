book question what is the basic situation at the beginning of the coffin quilt plus what is the protagonist of the book this stuff is too confusing for me feuds among the mountain folks of west virginia and kentucky particularly the bloody skirmishes between the hatfield and mccoy families are often celebrated in american legend and folksongs in the coffin quilt ann rinaldi mines this rich vein of americana for a fascinating tale that closely follows the real events of the hatfield mccoy feud but which also has implications for our own violent times rinaldi suggests in her author's note that the civil war conditioned men who fought in it to kill and to hate consequently men came home from the war to their mountains with minds and rifles primed to react to the slightest trespass upon their exaggerated loyalty to kinfolk the story is told by fanny the youngest of the fourteen mccoy children who traces the beginnings of the famous feud to a confused civil war shooting and a dispute over a herd of pigs when her favorite older sister the beautiful roseanna runs off with handsome johnse hatfield it's like a bucket of gasoline thrown on the smoldering hatred between the two families warned by the apparition she calls yeller thing fanny is nonetheless a helpless witness to ambushes and killings burials and retribution too late she realizes that roseanna's obsession with sewing a traditional but gruesome coffin decorated quilt is a sign of her evil attraction to deliberately stoking the fires of the feud providing a psychological thriller ending for this dramatic tale of hillbilly love and revenge The Invisibles Wyatt Earp American Psycho Hip hop rivalries Knots Landing Darth Vader The Dark Knight Returns Zhao Yun Capital punishment Mark Calaway Kill Bill American Revolutionary War Penda of Mercia Vampire Sin City Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Anne Boleyn Conan the Barbarian Vietnam War Ranma __ characters YuYu Hakusho Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bloody Sunday (1972) American Old West Scenes from a Memory 50 Cent W.I.T.C.H.
