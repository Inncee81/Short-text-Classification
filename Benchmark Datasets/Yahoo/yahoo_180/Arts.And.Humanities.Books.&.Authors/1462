do you know any good publishing companies i've finished writing a good story but now i need help to publish it not self publish can anyone help i want a good puublishing company this is my first book although first time authors often have more difficulty getting published than previously published authors it's still quite possible speaking from experience if you want to get a really good company i highly recommend finding an agent to represent you first because most traditional publishing companies do not accept unsolicited manuscripts directly from authors they seek quality in a work and feel more comfortable working through an agent who can guarantee a certain novel's quality and public appeal having an agent also makes the author appear to be better qualified in the eyes of the publishing company therefore giving you a better chance to get published agents also help you negotiate a better deal with the publishers if you seek an agent here are some good sites that i personally recommend this is where i search when i was looking for someone to publish my novel dream saver http www writers net agents html http www author network com agents html http www books bc ca literaryagents php there are several publishing companies that accept query letters directly from authors although these are few in number below are several sites that list those companies however be warned these companies will often offer you low royalties and print few copies of your novel personally i recommend working through an agent http anotherealm com prededitors peba htm http www yellowbook com category publishers book http www geocities com ladyjiraff publishers html another company that you can try is the company that published me mercury publishing inc they're currently looking for fantasy and science fiction novels and are willing to accept first time authors http www mercurypublishinghouse com for more tips and tricks on getting published check out my blog http www michelleizmaylov blogspot com good luck getting published HTML Publishing Web crawler World Wide Web Ajax (programming) Science fiction PHP Ebook Representational State Transfer A Course In Miracles Peer review Common Unix Printing System HTTP cookie Blog Uniform Resource Locator HyperText Transfer Protocol Gmail Domain Name System Wget Internet Web server Transport Layer Security Uniform Resource Identifier Cascading Style Sheets Cross site scripting Website Wiki Pretty Good Privacy Spyware Crime fiction BitTorrent Internet Speculative Fiction Database XHTML CPAN Quotation mark C.
