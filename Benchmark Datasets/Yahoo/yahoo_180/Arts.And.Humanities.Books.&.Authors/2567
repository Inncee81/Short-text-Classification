is this good i'm and i wrote this for a writing competition but i only had about minutes to write it i'm usually better at writing longer stories but this time there was a limit of words so any comments are welcome my own personal prison cell when they speak at the forced meetings the social workers and the psychologists in the grey boring crisply pressed suits with matching shoes don't really seem to notice whether or not i participate they do not care whether or not i listen or take into account their suggestions to fit in better they are so wrapped up with all their planning and 'foresight' that they would not notice if i fell asleep in the meetings and i did that once or even if i jumped out of the clammy office and fell five stories down onto the london high street below crash their aim is to 'fit me in' squeeze me into society somewhere whether i want to be there or not and in so doing solve all of my current problems relating to my father's suicide and other such 'dramatic' events that have taken place in the last six months that was sarcasm by the way i told them once that i don't want to go to festivals and art exhibits because i mentioned once that i wanted to be an artist but what does it matter what i want anyway i'm just their little experiment the kid with too many 'emotional issues' to dwell upon tiptoe 'round the poor little girl i've often heard them talking about me in those melancholy manic meetings saying personal things like how my father tried to kill himself at least five times before he actually succeeded stupid man could never get anything right and how my mother became 'clinically depressed' in other words nuts and almost joined him in their early grave beside granddad they don't listen when i say i don't care it just doesn't affect me they're nuts so what i haven't seen either of them for about a year now but i'm supposed to be all grieving and depressed they class my indifference as a problem but i've dealt with it now it's in the past i'd be more than happy to continue living my life but no i need counselling and help like i said they don't care what i want i just want out of this pointless situation freedom from those annoying oh my gosh so plastic social workers they informed me today that the counselling should take three months three months i repeated incredulously argh i'm stuck in this prison yer thats good Clinical depression The Catcher in the Rye Social rule Theory of conduct Transactional analysis Psychology Transsexuality Shaggy dog story Psychoanalysis Hikikomori The Smoking Room Simone Weil Grief Laura Schlessinger Empathy EastEnders Abortion debate Scientology beliefs and practices Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an About a Boy M16 (rifle) Pitaten The Young Ones (TV series) Paranoia Agent U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 The Amber Spyglass Friends I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Ex-gay Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shit Immortality Sin City Sexual orientation True Crime: Streets of LA Plame affair Microeconomics Schizophrenia Altruism Fight Club Philosophy of language Little Britain Bernard Williams Psychotherapy Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Storytelling Resurrection of Jesus Theodicy L.
