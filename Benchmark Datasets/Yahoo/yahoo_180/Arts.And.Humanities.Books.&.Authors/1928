harry potter vs other children's fantasy in regards to christianity just a question for those that avoid harry potter because of the fantasy aspects i was just wondering if you also avoid all other faity tales as well or is harry potter an exception i know my mom questions my reading of it i'm but i also know that we were allowed to watch and read other stories with magic and fantasy aspects of course she also heard and believed the rumor that jk rowling is a satanist and is trying to convert all children to be wiccan which has been proven to not be the case so i guess the real question is where do you draw the line on what you deam exceptable for you or your children to read watch i am a christian and believe that the practice of withcraft is sin as well as all other things that do not glorify god i do my best to teach my children the ways of jesus and refrain from influences that interfere with their walk with him you are right that if as christians we believe harry potter is evil than yes cinderella bewitched pornography dirty harry freaky friday almost all disney movies and movies involving adultery drunkeness gambling murder envy strife gossiping and disobedience are also evil and we should refrain for viewing them as well i think the line in the sand is personal to each individual and my advice is to know your weaknesses and be cautious with influences that feed that weakness for instance i'm not a person that is tempted by the need for power control so viewing witchcraft doesnt influence me i feel safe that watching harry potter would in no way encourage me to go against god's will and practice witchcraft however for a person who strives for power and control harry potter may not be a good choice for entertainment likewise where my weakness is shopping i limit myself on the number of trips i make to the mall it is also very wise to know your children's weaknesses as well and direct them away from influences that temp them aside from the witchcraft at the heart of harry potter movies is a young man that struggles to do the right thing and who puts the welfare of his friends and community above himself it teaches selflessness courage integrity and love and the long standing moral that good triumphs over evil Harry Potter Witchcraft Magic (paranormal) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Evil God Charles Grandison Finney Wicca Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism John Howard Yoder Paradise Lost Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Satanism Demon Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christmas Urantia Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Eastern Orthodox Church Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Summa Theologiae Incarnations of Immortality Witch trial Religion and sexuality A Course In Miracles Satan Supernatural Jehovah's Witnesses Philipp Melanchthon Sin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an C.
