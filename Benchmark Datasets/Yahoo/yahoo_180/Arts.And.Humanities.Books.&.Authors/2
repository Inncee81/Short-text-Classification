what was the significance of neville longbottom fitting the description of the boy whom the prophecy was about jk said she worded the prophecy very carefully i really thought neville would play a key role in the deathly hallows but he didn't neville is my second favourite character after snape he did play quite an important part but you're right given the whole thing with the wording of the prophecy which i had totally forgotten about because i can't remember anything about book it seems he'd have had a bigger role either way in the last book i think jk does portray neville's character as a remarkable person brave caring confronting in a good way and even intelligent therefore i think the way he comes across in the final book makes neville out to be a fine guy which i think is enough even if he didn't have a big part along the entire duration of the book Neville Longbottom Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Hogwarts subjects James and Lily Potter Harry Potter (character) Sybill Trelawney Hogwarts Houses Lord Voldemort Harry Potter: Book Seven Ginny Weasley Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Ron Weasley Blood purity (Harry Potter) Nevil Shute Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Humphrey Bogart Remus Lupin Little Britain Priesthood (Mormonism) Dates in Harry Potter Dumbledore's Army Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Apocalypse Intelligent design movement The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Luna Lovegood Fan fiction Bible prophecy Hermione Granger The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Jeremiah Diagon Alley Christian eschatology Battle of Hogwarts One Tree Hill (TV series) The Invisibles Book of Daniel Slash fiction Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Book of Isaiah Book of Mormon Ministry of Magic New Testament God Emperor of Dune Goodness and value theory Wars of the Roses Guide for the Perplexed Ethics IBM PC compatible Brave New World End times Scouting Nineteen Eighty-Four Nostradamus Anne Neville Macbeth Bible Apocalyptic literature Horace Slughorn Marshall McLuhan Care Bears Theory of conduct Minor Harry Potter Beasts Gettysburg Address Babylon 5 Gary Neville Order of the Phoenix Obi-Wan Kenobi Blood on the Tracks Republic (dialogue) Merlin (wizard) Teach the Controversy Sheikh Abdullah Albus Dumbledore Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Richard III (play) Meaning of life Hogwarts Philosophy of language Empire Burlesque Joachim von Ribbentrop Ed, Edd n Eddy Big Brother (USA TV series) Martin Sharp Culture of Lithuania Garfield South Park Shaggy dog story Recurring South Park characters Potions in Harry Potter Eschatology Presidential system Jacques-B__nigne Bossuet The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Shakespearean authorship
