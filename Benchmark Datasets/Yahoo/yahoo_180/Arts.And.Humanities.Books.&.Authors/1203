which actor do you like as dumbledore richard harris or michael gambon i liked richard harris i hate michael gambon as dumbledore i hate him he is not a good dumbledore at all i know what he was trying to do he was trying to break away from what richard harris had done and play a more active dumbledore but instead he screwed it up he just doesn't even seem nice at all and when he tries to seem nice or friendly like in the end of goblet of fire he fails and he just seems weird dumbledore is always so polite and then in the th movie he just interrupts fudge at the hearing and says that he'll be defending harry he would never do that and then when harry's name comes out of the goblet yes i'm going back to the th movie he starts shaking him and yelling did you put your name in the cup it so wasn't like that in the book so yes now you have heard my rage against michael gambon i liked richard harris although he obviously can't do it anymore Michael Gambon Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Harry Potter (character) Ron Weasley Minor Ravenclaws Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Minor Hufflepuffs Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ginny Weasley Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Order of the Phoenix Diagon Alley Minor characters associated with Quidditch Dumbledore's Army Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Luna Lovegood Death Eater Dates in Harry Potter Rita Skeeter Hogwarts subjects Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Cedric Diggory Cho Chang Aberforth Dumbledore Hogwarts Houses Sybill Trelawney Hogwarts Floor Directory Hogwarts Triwizard Tournament Ministry of Magic Severus Snape Columbine High School massacre Minor Hogwarts teachers Tom Riddle's diary Viktor Krum Spoiler (media) Avenue Q Neville Longbottom Sirius Black Fawkes Magic (Harry Potter) Minor Slytherins Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Young adult literature Reservoir Dogs Dolores Umbridge J.
