how do you get past writer's block i'm trying to write a song i've got verse one down but i need to write the chorus and i can't seem to keep the creative juices flowing any ideas well i have ways to beat writers block for writing a romance novel but most importantly you need an idea that inspires you to work those fingers where it just pours out of you writers block really isn't the stage you are in before you write writer's block isn't the culprit everytime you have a break in the writing process only when that break becomes paralyzing writers block is when you write some and no matter what you try you can't continue it doesn't really keep you from starting some people don't think writing exercises help but i think they can be fun one i know of is to try to write a story in words no more no less or just a paragraph make it smaller to words i can't remember the actual name of this bah anyway procrastination is a big culprit of writers block just avoidance behaviour but the best way is to work through it sit there and start typing all of what you type you might think stinks but as you keep writing you'll eventually stumble across something that you can go with and use once you get started writing it is ok to skip around in the story a little bit try writing a different scene if the scene you are on is making you stuck or it could be what you previously written has gotten you stuck so you might can revise the last scene so the next scene is on track try writing something that you won't use put your characters in a weird situation and write about how they act in it write the scene from another point of view to give you a new angle even though you should stick with the same point of view throughout this is just practice don't worry about perfecting just write down the basics write a list of what will happen in the scene phrases they might say then put it together with those guidelines don't keep thinking about what you have already written move forward not back take a good look at your outline ask yourself all these questions to make sure you haven't missed any plotholes you might have to change things at this point to get it back going try thinking about what made you want to write this story to start with the plot the characters find a book that has something similar and just lose yourself in it when you finish it you might have new energy on your story and if all else fails start a new project not every idea you come up with will be a winner it is something we all face in our minds it works out but on paper it just doesn't do so well no biggie do something else and try to come back to it later again those are ideas for a romance novel once you have already started in general try looking at these pages http fictionwriting about com od writingroadblocks tp block htm http fictionwriting about com od writingroadblocks a writersblock htm http www sff net people lisarc exer htm http www writingontherun com writersblock html http www sff net people lisarc help htm Theory of conduct Milton H.
