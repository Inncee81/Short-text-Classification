y and r fans do you think devon likes lilly as more than just a sister i sure think he does i always found he looked like he did just the way he'd smile at her etc and he wanted her and daniel to break up in the worst way by telling lilly you deserve better and he's no good for you now he tried to set up a night of fun for them and lilly went and invited other people to be their dates he looked sooo dissapointed i think they'd be cute together but i also don't know if a relationship with them would ever happen what doyou think i agree with you your dead on the money he has a thing for her for sure girl he's in love but i think that he is struggling with the whole sister thing he want's to be a part of a family and for that reason he hold's her sacred as his sister but the man part of him really has a thing for her in the worst way that's why he is so jealous of daniel but i don't think that they will match them up though when he first started on the show i thought they would and have to say that i wanted them to be but not now Friends Knots Landing EastEnders Humphrey Bogart The Emancipation of Mimi Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Characters of Lost The Ashlee Simpson Show Dead Like Me Jon Secada About a Boy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Another World (TV series) Pitaten Social rule Sin City Paul Is Dead Neighbours Fiddler on the Roof Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Jennifer Lopez Cardcaptor Sakura Tenchi Muyo!
