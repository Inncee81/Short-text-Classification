tattoo idea hey i found out the o' sullivan family has a family motto along with a family crest and i was thinking about getting a tattoo of the gaelic motto along with an irish flag or shamrock or something like that i've thought about putting it on my chest any help on ideas to make the tattoo better thanks i have a tat already and i make sure that whatever i get i think about and really make sure it's what i want i know i want the family motto and some kind of irish symbol but i just need help on making it better no matter what you do be sure to ask around and go visit several shops in your area and check out the work the artists do when you choose an artist always double check the drawing and don't be afraid to make changes as you see fit i would start with the family crest first then add on from there you want your family crest to stand out and not get lost in a bunch of clutter it won't look as good Coat of Arms of Canada Tattoo Irezumi Criminal tattoo Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom Scottish clan Scouting Poker jargon Arsenal F.C.
