i want to get a lower back tattoo but don't know what to get i want something with scrollwork and the actual symbol in the center i like fairies and thought about putting a fairie in the middle with her sitting on the moon or something like that any ideas people are always asking what tattoo to get but what do you think a tatoo artist does trust me it's much better to have the artist come up with a tattoo uniquely designed for you than to bring in something that anyone can find on the net please talk to your tatoo artist Tattoo Irezumi Waterworld Bosniaks Ouroboros The Ersatz Elevator Picts Amy Dumas Mythology Ecco the Dolphin Art Vanilla Ninja Angel Sanctuary Memento (film) The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Brandy (entertainer) Criminal tattoo Fairy tale Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog The Death Gate Cycle V.F.D.
