is anyone else tired of them i dont want to be mean at all if you take offense to this i am sorry send me hate mail if you want no biggie in my life but honestly guys i come on here about everyday and answer tattoo questions is anyone else tired of the year olds wanting stupid things and asking about them when they cant even spell tattoo i dont want to be too mean i mean im only but i know a lot more than these kids do do year olds really know what they are doing i mean come on at we still dont know what we are doing yeah im but still waiting to get my tattoos because im not going to be an idiot and go behind my dads back to get a tattoo haha just to clear things up why am i answering questions you dont have to be covered to answer questions google works just fine to answer ones that are technical i dont answer ones about pain or price so why would it be a problem does someone have to have tattoos in order to say what they think looks good or not why wouldnt i answer questions about something i love arent we all hypocrites these hate answers really make me laugh i really dont get why i cant answer questions at yet they can ask them at and come on people whats so wrong with not having one yet knowing a lot about them kinda like that guy that loves football and knows a lot about the game yet has never been in a game before instead is always sitting on the bench i'm not trying be mean either but you could just skip over these questions if you find them repetitious and annoying you don't have to answer them if you're looking for an easy points you could inform them nicely that they could go to the discovery section and get lots of answers and advice from there as these questions have been asked many times before i'm not questioning your knowledge or ability to answer them because it sounds like you've done your homework but not everyone is as informed as you or on this website at the same time you are that's what this website is designed for to ask questions no matter how many times or how many ways it's been asked before just move on to the next question be glad that you already know or have the answer to what some else is asking and if you choose to share your knowledge that's even better yet and possibly points for you for answering the same question over and over it's not worth all the energy you're putting into it just be glad it's not you and move on you should also be proud of the fact that you're and knowledgeable and people are looking for what you have to offer even as annoying as it may be you could share when you're feeling generous or move on when you're not this catagory will have the most questions about tatoos you could always go to a different category too and be glad you're not equally knowledgeable about piercings i see a lot of those questions to Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Social rule Tattoo Avenue Q Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Current teachings of Prem Rawat Little Britain Expert system Jennifer Lopez She Loves You EastEnders Socrates The Apprentice 2 Hip hop rivalries Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The nature of God in Western theology 2000 Australian Grand Prix W.I.T.C.H.
