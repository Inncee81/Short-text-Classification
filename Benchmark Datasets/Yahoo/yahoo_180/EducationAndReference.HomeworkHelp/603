study tips please for all subjects but especially english math and french yea i'm only allowed to get straight a's need to get to tokyo in two years i'm not quite sure about what your question is but if you're looking for general study advice here's what i have for you organization is key from making sure your notes are organized your homework is organized to making sure you have all your assignments written down and separated by class and or due date i have a calendar above my desk that has when every paper is due or on what dates i have exams that seems to help a lot keep on top of reading this is especially important for history english classes if you don't do the reading on time you'll end up getting bogged down later in the semester or closer to tests have a good quiet study space where you won't be distracted and other people won't distract you quiet music is okay but don't have the television on or a whole mess of people around you while you're trying to study you won't pay attention to what you're doing and you will be too tempted to socialize or do something else other than your school work without specific questions i'm afraid that's really the best advice i can give you i hope it helps Education in Romania Graduate school Test (student assessment) GED Grade (education) SAT Education in Taiwan Advanced Placement Program Education in the People's Republic of China Hunter College High School A-level Junior Certificate Juris Doctor Victorian Certificate of Education Massachusetts Institute of Technology Harrow School Mathematics Education in the United States Economics The Apprentice 2 Singlish Social rule IB Diploma Programme Education in Germany Education Pitaten Girls Aloud Parliament of Canada Calvin and Hobbes Great Teacher Onizuka Quizbowl Franklin W.
