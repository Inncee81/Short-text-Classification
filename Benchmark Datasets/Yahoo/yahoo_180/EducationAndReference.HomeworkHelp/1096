how do you find the area of a tringle when it only gives you the vertices the vertices are a b and c im only an eighth grader if the vertices are a x y b x y and c x y then the sides are of length ab sqrt x x y y and two other similar formulae for bc and ca when you have the lengths of the three sides call these a b and c calculate s a b c the area is then sqrt s s a s b s c there may be a far simpler method if it is evident that the triangle is right angled but you haven't suggested this Triangle Complex number Trigonometric function Polygon Angle Collision detection Cissoid of Diocles Parabola Pythagorean theorem Circle Simplex Heron's formula Pascal's triangle Square root Golden ratio Pentagram Area (geometry) Platonic solid Quaternion Pi Similarity (mathematics) Multiple integral Trigonometric identity Tetrahedron Catalan number Wallpaper group Archimedes Regular polytope Semiregular polyhedra M__bius transformation Determinant Graph theory Glossary of graph theory Octahedron Metric space Quartic equation Methods of contour integration Haversine formula Euclidean geometry Dimensional analysis Schwarz-Christoffel mapping Hexagonal lattice Traveling salesman problem Quadratic equation Normal distribution Conic section Langmuir probe Tessellation Ellipse Trigonometry Quadrilateral Astrodynamics Debye model Dot product John Wallis Crystallographic restriction theorem Spherical trigonometry Analytic geometry Semi-major axis Simplex algorithm Euler characteristic Norm (mathematics) Signed graph Standard deviation 3D Studio Max Black-Scholes Irrational number Pentagon Reuleaux triangle Lattice (group) Polyhedron Fibonacci number Delaunay triangulation Square root of 2 Dirac equation Quantum harmonic oscillator Particle in a box Pendulum Vector (spatial) Quantum tunneling Desargues' theorem Parallax Root system Trajectory Ramsey's theorem Circumcircle Great-circle distance Feynman diagram Rotational symmetry Tiling by regular polygons Phong shading Graph coloring Planar graph Lagrangian point Renormalization Polynomial Ptolemaios's theorem Hipparchus (astronomer)
