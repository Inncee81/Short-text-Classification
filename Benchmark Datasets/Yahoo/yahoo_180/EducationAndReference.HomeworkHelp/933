algebra probs please help me step by step on these im not cheating on a homework assign or anything i just want to understand these test tomorrow so thanx what are the solutions of the equation x x a x or b x or x c x or x d x or x thanx ok you want the answer to equal zero and we all learned that anything times is therefore you must make both parts equal to zero x x a x isolate the x by bringing the number to the other side x b x x therefore the answer is d GED Elementary algebra Orthogonal matrix Quaternion Algebraic geometry Fermat's last theorem Exponentiation Mathematics Quartic equation Probability Dirac equation Adjoint functors Square root Boolean algebra Associative algebra Algebra Gravity Explosive material Complex number William Rowan Hamilton Grade (education) Extreme Programming Division by zero Exact solutions in general relativity Calculus Quadratic equation Test (student assessment) Vedic mathematics Causality Random walk Dynamical system Quantum computer Newton's method Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Prime number Gaussian elimination Galois theory Naive set theory Geometry ___1 (number) Model (economics) Dice History of mathematics Ruler-and-compass construction Complexity classes P and NP Lebesgue integration Viterbi algorithm Finite element method Algorithm Heat equation Bayesian inference Digital circuit Laws of Form Distribution (mathematics) Linear equation Where Mathematics Comes From Matrix (mathematics) Real number Modular exponentiation Zeno's paradoxes Cubic equation Unified neutral theory of biodiversity Monty Hall problem Negative and non-negative numbers Ordinary differential equation Doomsday argument Theory of conduct Engineering Arthur Cayley Augustus De Morgan Software engineering Hebrew calendar Singlish Academic Games Determinant Combinatorial species Irrational number SAT Polynomial Ideal class group Supersymmetry TI-89 series Quantum logic Matroid Kepler's laws of planetary motion Collision detection Einstein's field equation Quintic equation Pp-wave spacetime Irreducible polynomial Local zeta-function Curve Education George Peacock Numerical integration Hilbert's sixteenth problem Labor theory of value Computational complexity theory Derivative
