how do you solve this problem is of another approach that will help you solve any problem of this sort is as follows replace the is with an equals sign replace of with a multiplication sign x or replace the unknown with a variable such as x or y change the percent into decimal form by moving the decimal point two places away from the percent sign that is the way i always remembered it in school that if you want to get rid of the percent you move the decimal point away from the percent sign but if you want to make a percent then you move it towards the percent sign therefore you should end up with this x multiply both sides by to make it easier to solve x therefore if we divide through by x Polynomial Decimal Elementary algebra Binary numeral system Pi Gaussian elimination M__bius transformation Trigonometric function CPU design Derivative Vulgar fraction P-adic number Numerical analysis Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Vedic mathematics Prime number Compiler optimization Grade (education) Ordinary differential equation Two's complement Proof that 0.999... equals 1 Numeral system Planetary orbit Joseph Louis Lagrange Quartic equation Logarithm Cissoid of Diocles Napier's bones On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Quadratic sieve Quicksort Floating point Wheel of Fortune Linear programming Esperanto orthography Zeno's paradoxes Multiple integral Egyptian mathematics Linked list 0 (number) History of computing hardware Multiplication Complex number Dimensional analysis Slide rule IBM 700/7000 series Lagrange multipliers Unix time Discrete Fourier transform Assembly language Lambda calculus Division (mathematics) Quadratic equation Orthogonal matrix Two-body problem Daylight saving time Conic section System/36 Trip distribution Pound sterling State space (controls) Trigonometric identity Angle Quaternion Quantum computer Boolean satisfiability problem Timeline of mathematics Mental calculation Path integral formulation Newton's method Dash Recurring decimal IP (complexity) Equation solving Reduction (complexity) Bayes' theorem Projective transformation Percentage Resistor Multidisciplinary design optimization Operational amplifier COBOL Expert system Mach kernel Linear differential equation Separation of variables Exponentiation Optimization (mathematics) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Divide and conquer algorithm Central processing unit Ackermann function Base (mathematics) Contract bridge Eight queens puzzle Mode choice Cyprus dispute Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Circuit design
