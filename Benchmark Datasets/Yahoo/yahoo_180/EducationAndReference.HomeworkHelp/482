how is love depicted now i'm trying to prove that love songs now are better in portraying love as compared to shakespeare's sonnets any help is appreciated d thanks our love songs say the same thing to us that shakespeare's sonnets said to his audience the difference is not in the quality of expression but in its relevance the language that sounds so stilted and high flown when we read shakespeare was the common vernacular of his time to an elizabethan it would have sounded perfectly natural a young elizabethan in love would hear his own emotions put into words when he read a sonnet the same way a young lover today hears his own in a well written love song love is still love and good poetry is still good poetry only the idiom is different William Shakespeare Sonnet Shakespeare's sonnets Poetry English literature Lyric poetry Shakespeare's reputation Literature English poetry William Empson British literature Urdu Meter (poetry) Shakespearean authorship Pleonasm Chinese language Italian language Christopher Marlowe Michael Drayton John Berryman A.
