math problem help can you please tell me how to solve by doing it step by step x i would appriciate any help thanks a bunch or actually better yet tell me how to solve without having to use a calculator since we cannot use it in school Mathematics Problem solving Computation Complexity classes P and NP Archimedes Algorithm TI-89 series Route assignment Ordinary differential equation Finite element method Central processing unit Quantum computer Levinson recursion Conway's Game of Life Newton's method Computational complexity theory Cholesky decomposition Vedic mathematics Physics Planetary orbit CPU design Collision detection Richard Feynman Leonhard Euler Graduate Record Examination Time hierarchy theorem Numerical analysis P-complete Random walk Moscow and Rhind Mathematical Papyri Expert system MathCounts Computer vision Mathematics education Quantum chemistry Celestial navigation Learning Dynamic programming Aerodynamics The Skeptical Environmentalist History of computing hardware Aberration in optical systems RSA Genetic algorithm Orders of magnitude (numbers) William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Numerical stability Dyscalculia Fluid dynamics X86 Scientific computing Artificial neural network Quartic equation Massachusetts Institute of Technology Heuristic Philosophy of mathematics Soviet Student Olympiads Pi Polynomial interpolation Inventive step and non-obviousness Child prodigy Verlet integration Green's function John von Neumann Recurrence relation Sinclair Research Ltd Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm Polymerase chain reaction Density functional theory SAT American Regions Mathematics League Merkle-Hellman Calculator Hartree-Fock Matrix (mathematics) Computational physics EXPTIME Haversine formula Chess problem Lisa the Simpson Engineering Cryptographic hash function Fermat's last theorem Cellular automaton Atiyah___Singer index theorem Lebesgue integration Egyptian mathematics LU decomposition Analog computer Digital circuit Robert Watson-Watt New math Colossus computer Subset sum problem Grover's algorithm The Princeton Review Numerical ordinary differential equations
