some simple calc i cant figure out sqrt x x using the mean value thm find c the mean value thm is f' c f b f a b a for some reason i cant seem to get it right help f' x x so f' c c also f f so f' c f f gives c so c c c the end Kripke semantics Dirac equation Pendulum Cissoid of Diocles Coordinates (mathematics) Normal distribution TI-89 series Boy's surface Trigonometric identity Modified Newtonian dynamics Taxicab number Quantum harmonic oscillator Square root Frame fields in general relativity Pi Quadratic equation Central limit theorem Debye model Combinatorics Particle in a box Chi-square distribution Standard deviation Quantum state Resonance Trigonometric function M__bius transformation Space-time block code Gas in a box Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Quartic equation Ruffini's rule Harmonic oscillator Conic section Manifold Proper time Heinkel He 112 Langmuir probe Circuit design PlayStation Portable Diffraction RLC circuit Random variable Mandelbrot set Quantum tunneling Augustus De Morgan Quaternions and spatial rotation Phase-shift keying EPR paradox Invalid proof Angle Linear differential equation Roman surface Golden ratio Lagrangian point Bessel function Anti-Mormonism Turbo-Hydramatic Stirling's approximation Impedance Pronunciation of English th Time dilation Factorial Kinetic energy Margin of error Jacobi's elliptic functions Nickel WKB approximation Pentagram Cubic equation Identical particles Triangle Phonon Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means Coordinate rotation Heat equation Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Hohmann transfer orbit Mass Ideal chain Gamma function Geometry Ton Scandium Calculus Quaternion Norm (mathematics) Functional programming Prime counting function Iron Discrete Fourier transform Bell's theorem Damping Doomsday argument Emacs Chebyshev polynomials Recurrence relation Chlorination Generating function Equal temperament Crystallographic restriction theorem
