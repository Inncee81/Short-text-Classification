golden ration question if ab in fingure is inches and b divides ac in extreme and mean ratio find bc and then show that the ratio of bc to ab is the golden ratio a b c x x x x squr ratio bc ab squt squt squt and this is not a golden ratio but if i do ab bc squt squt and this equals to squat which is a golden ratio please tell me where i made mistake thank you solve for x x x x x x x x x x thus x but this is not what you want what you want is bc ab bc x ab ab bc x x x and that is the golden ratio please note that bc ab one golden ratio ab bc the other note that these are the fundamental properties of the golden ratios Golden ratio Trigonometric function Meantone temperament Musical tuning Pi Golden ratio base Musical acoustics Polynomial Square root PE ratio Transformation problem Gear ratio Dimensional analysis Archimedes Logarithm Probability Projective transformation Chemistry Bayes' theorem Nondimensionalization Interval (music) Hypergeometric series Aberration in optical systems Fuel injection Standing wave ratio Prime number Rational number Law of value Abortion debate Quartic equation Just intonation F-number Apollonius of Perga Irrational number Microeconomics Continued fraction Angle Gravity Ruler-and-compass construction Trigonometric identity Flag of the People's Republic of China Complex number Combinatorics Ecology Bayesian inference Ordinary differential equation Infantilism Joseph Louis Lagrange M__bius transformation Nicomachean Ethics Urban planning Piano Modular group Gold Macrocosm and microcosm Real estate bubble Fibonacci number United States dollar Diamond Nuclear fusion Mathematics of musical scales Galois theory Fundamental pair of periods Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Path integral formulation Mathematics Concrete Rasch model Mutual fund Plasma (physics) Lebesgue integration Triangle P-adic number Marilyn vos Savant Antenna (radio) Abelian group Insurance Pythagorean tuning Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Real number The Golden Girls Rocket fuel Studebaker Golden Hawk Stress (physics) Consonance and dissonance Planetary orbit Moral relativism Vector (spatial) Capital accumulation Complexity classes P and NP Equivalence principle Francis Crick Equal temperament Time Series (mathematics) Division by zero Liberalism Paper size Radius of convergence Cyprus dispute
