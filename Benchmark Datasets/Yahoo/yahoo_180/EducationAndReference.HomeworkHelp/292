help me plzz i dont have a book either this is for my brotherr not meeeeeeeeeeee omfggggggggggggg evaluate the is asspost to mean squared x for x the same thing with the its asspost to be cubed a b for a b same thing with the two's n n for n only the first is squared type in algebraic form use n as your variable be sure to use parentheses use the format a b c for your answer times the sum of a number and two type in algebraic form use n as your variable be sure to use parentheses the difference of and times a number find of find do not use an improper fraction for the answer find find x do not use an improper fraction for the answer sure that's why all questions that you've asked all seem to be from the same class http answers yahoo com my qa index ylt aktn lodzm fwv ccvof fsy ix link question more y show aa stop cheating and start asking for help from your teacher if this really is for your brother be a good brother and help him by speaking with your parents and or his teacher and get him the extra help he needs getting point whores to do your or his homework for you isn't ultimately going to help you with anything not to mention the fact that its blatant cheating Integral Complex number Exponentiation GED Algebraic geometry On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Lebesgue integration Binary numeral system Boolean algebra Point groups in three dimensions Polynomial Prime number Ideal class group Theory of conduct Elementary algebra Vulgar fraction Series (mathematics) Common Lisp Pi Grade (education) Clifford algebra Real number Napier's bones Stochastic process Lisp programming language Fibonacci number A Course In Miracles Exponential function Vector (spatial) Joseph Louis Lagrange CPU cache Linear regression Lambda calculus Surreal number Function (mathematics) Order of operations Number theory Combinatorics Riemann___Roch theorem Calculus Logo programming language Prolog Computer numbering formats Cubic equation Scheme programming language Ontological argument Formal power series Identical particles Modular form Multiplication Exterior algebra Surplus value Normal distribution Chern class Doomsday argument Crossword Orthogonal group George Peacock Orthogonal matrix Irrational number JavaScript Quantification Expert system Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Division (mathematics) Galois theory Ideal (ring theory) Microeconomics Group of Lie type Newton's identities Tensor product Algebraic variety Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
