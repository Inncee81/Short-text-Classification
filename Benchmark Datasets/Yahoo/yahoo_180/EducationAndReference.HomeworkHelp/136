comparison between static library and internet give the detaild answer and also tell the specific websight for finding the answer of this question in computer science a static library also referred to as a statically linked library is a computer library using which links to external functions and variables in a caller are resolved at compile time sometimes such library files may also be linked loaded at run time by a linker or linking loader for example the x module loader however it is debatable whether such a process can be called static linking static libraries can be easily created in c or in c an internet is a group of networks connected together the internet note the capital i refers to the global connection of networks around the world Library (computer science) C programming language Thread (computer science) Object file Variable Kernel (computer science) Web crawler Btrieve PHP C plus plus Java programming language Hello world program Domain Name System Linux kernel Mach kernel Subroutine Objective-C Compiler JavaServer Pages Object-oriented programming Booting Polymorphism (computer science) Computer program Ocaml Name mangling Federal Standard 1037C BASIC programming language Software testing Virtual memory Emacs Perl World Wide Web Abstraction (computer science) Scope (programming) Computer software Computer Common Lisp Static single assignment form MDAC Lisp programming language Pointer Python programming language Compiler optimization C syntax Computer virus ALGOL 68 Windows 2000 Master Control Program GNU General Public License Grid computing FidoNet Linux Linked list Reference (computer science) Musical Instrument Digital Interface Scheme programming language Component Object Model GNU Common Unix Printing System Exception handling High Level Assembly C Sharp File system ITunes Internet protocol suite CPU cache Class (computer science) Novell NetWare Call centre Network address translation OSI model Wi-Fi Objective Modula-2 Ajax (programming) Uniform Resource Locator Tcl Open access Proxy server Programming language Voice over IP Dylan programming language Ethernet Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Visual Basic Enterprise content management Server OpenBSD Computer security Windows XP JADE programming language Artificial neural network ARPANET USB flash drive Position independent code ZX Spectrum Central processing unit Operating system
