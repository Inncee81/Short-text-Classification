help i need to finish it today this is another part of the article can anyboby help me to rewrite it and find the mistakes in the article thanks a lot here is the article human activities such as direct harvesting of species introduction of alien species habitat destruction and various forms of habitat degradation have caused dramatic losses of biodiversity current extinction rates are estimated to be times higher than prehuman extinction rates some measure of biodiversity is responsible for providing essential functions and services that directly improve human life for example many medicines clothing fibers and industrial products and the vast majority of foods are derived from naturally occurring species in addition species are the key working parts of natural ecosystems they are responsible for maintenance of the gaseous composition of the atmosphere regulation of the global climate generation and maintenance of soils recycling of nutrients and waste products and biological control of pest species ecosystems surely would not function if all species were lost although it is unclear just how many species are necessary for an ecosystem to function properly human activities such as direct harvest of species introduction of alien species habitat destruction and degradation have caused dramatic losses of biodiversity current extinction rates are estimated to be times higher than pre human extinction rates some measure of biodiversity is responsible for providing essential functions and services that directly improve human life for example many medicines clothing fibers industrial products and the vast majority of foods are derived from naturally occurring species in addition species are the key working parts of natural ecosystems they are responsible for maintenance of the gaseous composition of the atmosphere regulation of the global climate generation and maintenance of soils recycling of nutrients and waste products and biological control of pest species ecosystems surely would not function if all species were lost although it is unclear just how many species are necessary for an ecosystem to function properly it seems plausible enough it's a meaningful article may i add Extinction Eutrophication Organic farming Global warming Earth Coral reef Effects of global warming Vegetation Fish farming Sewage treatment Shrimp farm Shifting cultivation Biology Overpopulation Agriculture Fauna of Australia Invasive species Soil science Trophic level Alcohol fuel Energy development History of ecology Soils retrogression and degradation Conservation biology Green Revolution Arctic Gaia theory (science) Evolution Yosemite National Park Rainforest Old growth forest Lake Introduced species Bioinformatics Global warming and agriculture Carbon dioxide sink Fermi paradox Veganism Organic food Botany Diatom Sea level rise Terraforming Twelve leverage points Mosquito Biosphere 2 Holocene extinction event Ozone hole Hiking Carbon dioxide Plastic Desertification Human extinction Soil Invasive plants Factory farming Genetically modified food Sustainable agriculture Waste management Unified neutral theory of biodiversity Biological pest control Permian-Triassic extinction event The Origin of Species Palouse Wetland Nutrition Geography of Brazil Nuclear power Agriculture in Australia HIV Hunting Chernobyl accident Insect Compost Insulin Commodity markets Future energy development Biodiesel Carnivorous plant National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Amazon Rainforest Biodiversity of New Zealand Green economics Gasoline Livestock Natural gas Climate change Soil life Natural capital Global 200 Conservation ethic
