please help me with this math problem find the number of computer units x that needs to be sold to produce a maximum profit p in pesos if p x x x could you please help me with this problem and please put your solution or an explanation on how did you get the answer thanks notice that the equation you show is a parabola also notice that it is an upside down parabola b c of the negative infront of the it's like an unhappy smile so the tip of it is the maximum remember how since it's a quadratic equation it has the form of f x ax bx c if we rearrange yours it would be p x x x now to get to the maximum minimum you need to get the vertex of the equation the formula for those coordinates would be b a f b a p p so the max of profits needed to sold would be to get a profit of Quadratic equation Parabola Cissoid of Diocles Ordinary differential equation Elementary algebra Production function Optimization (mathematics) Galois theory Polynomial Mathematics Complex number Square root Calculus Water (molecule) Transformation problem Planetary orbit Projective transformation Length of an arc Timeline of mathematics Trajectory Glossary of graph theory Algebraic geometry Cubic equation Dynamical system Negative and non-negative numbers Atiyah___Singer index theorem RLC circuit Partial differential equation Technetium IP (complexity) John Wallis Profit maximization Explosive material Vedic mathematics Determinant Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Quartic equation Joseph Louis Lagrange Quaternion Ruler-and-compass construction Prices of production Combinatorics Four color theorem Algorithm Newton's method Labor theory of value Algebra Apollonius of Perga Dirac equation Simplex algorithm Hipparchus (astronomer) Doomsday argument Collision detection Shader Trigonometric function Gaussian elimination Ellipse HSV color space Temperature Action (physics) Diffraction Exponentiation Imaginary unit Graph (mathematics) Quintic equation Black-Scholes Graph theory Computer numbering formats Renormalization NP-complete Sudoku Newton's identities TeX Numerical analysis Zero-knowledge proof Prime number Triangle TI-89 series Sturm-Liouville theory Photoelectric effect Huzita's axioms Torque Fibonacci number Orbit equation Physics Simulated annealing Leonhard Euler Kolmogorov complexity Basis (linear algebra) Asian financial crisis Surplus value Welfare economics Graph coloring Modular form Particle in a box
