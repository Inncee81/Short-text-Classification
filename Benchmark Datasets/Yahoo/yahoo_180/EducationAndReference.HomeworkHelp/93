pivotal chapter in to kill a mockingbird ok so for school over the summer we were supposed to read to kill a mockingbird which i did and just recently finished we're supposed to write a page essay about a pivotal or important chapter in the novel i'm not asking you to do my homework i'm just asking for your opinions so what do you think is an important chapter in the novel and why i was thinking it was the trial scene but i can't think up of any reasons why it is important thanks in advance you're right on target that is the pivotal chapter for the first time in the history of that southern town an all white jury was kept out for a length of time as opposed to immediately and automatically finding against the defendant a black man this is the triumph of atticus finch he proved that tom robinson could not possibly have assaulted mayella ewell because she was attacked by someone who was right handed tom robinson had a deformed right arm the result of an earlier accident the jury found against the defendant anyway after all this was a typical southern town in the s but never before had a jury been kept out so long To Kill a Mockingbird Battle of Gettysburg Jury trial Mumia Abu-Jamal Theory of conduct Lynching in the United States NAACP Terminal ballistics No Child Left Behind Act Quicksort Operation Mockingbird Plame affair O.
