got an idea plzz helpp i need story ideas based around this quote she seemed glad to see me when i appeared in the kitchen and by watching her i began to think there was some skill involved in being a girl she doesn't have to be cooking maybe she's coaxing her younger brother to eat or arranging flower pots on the window sill and the person walking in could be a boy of about her age or the person could be a younger sister a reflective parent or a brother sister of the same age point being try to find a way to interpret it that is not the expected one that she's cooking and the person is an admirer with amorous intentions the story could spin around too say she was arranging herbs maybe she's a witch and the herbs she's using are to make a potion love potion one for luck one to be beautiful etc perhaps she's really an old lonely lady but the herbs she uses make her look young and attractive so that the young boy will marry her have fun with it RuneScape quests RuneScape skills W.I.T.C.H.
