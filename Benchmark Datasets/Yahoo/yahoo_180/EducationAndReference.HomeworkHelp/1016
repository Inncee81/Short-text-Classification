how do i apply marxist critisism to andersen's fairytales i'm getting the hang of marx i know the three stories well i just don't know how to go about writing an essay that applies the theoretical perspective to the stories big claus little claus emporer's new clothes the flying trunk i need to find something to argue for but although there are themes of capitalism in the stories i can't argue that andersen was a marxis so what do i argue in all three stories you can find themes that advantage low status over high but what do i argue hmm the emperor's new clothes is the story i'm most familiar with but i'd say the emperor being naked in public and humiliated when he thought he was wearing brand new fancy clothes shows how capitalism wanting brand new fancy clothes turns people into fools it also shows the peasant masses having the last laugh at the wealthy this reminds me of china during the proliterian campaign it was called something proliteriate it was after the peasants briefly owned land again after the great leap forward mao zedong abolished hierarchy and mobilized students to rebel against anything western or capitalist goods and they rebelled against hierarchy and authority for example they were no longer considered below their teachers and were not supposed to call them sir thus they were not showing respect to an authority like how the people in the emperor's new clothes didn't show respect to their king who was in a position of authority their teachers and other intellectuals one could argue they had some elite left in them were sent to work camps Cultural Revolution Mao Zedong Socialism Communism Marxism Karl Marx Max Weber Maoism Deng Xiaoping Socialist Workers Party (UK) Communist state Jacobo Arenas Hans Christian Andersen History of China Feudalism History of the People's Republic of China (2/4) Communist Party of China Wang Ming Leon Trotsky China History of socialism Conservatism Cheng Feng Capitalism Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Mao: The Unknown Story Emperor Primitive accumulation of capital Kitsch Han Dynasty Ming Dynasty Socialist economics Qin Shi Huang Wealth Anti-communism Louis Althusser History of communism Emperor Guangwu of Han Xi'an Incident Law of value Jung Chang Separation of church and state Social class Education in the People's Republic of China Deconstruction Chinese Civil War Civilian control of the military Microeconomics History of the People's Republic of China State Chu-Han contention Great Leap Forward Productive forces Emperor of China Szlachta Capital accumulation Anarchism and capitalism Confucius Qing Dynasty Western Roman Empire Libertarian socialism Postmodernity History of the Republic of China Khmer Rouge Originalism Anarchism Historical materialism Filioque clause Zhou Enlai Edo period Criticisms of socialism Labor theory of value Left-wing politics Frankfurt School Libertarianism Gaozu of Han Intellectual property Criticisms of communism Red Guards (China) Liu Shaoqi Exploitation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fashion Trotskyism Chen Duxiu Populism Trademark Peasants' War Economic inequality Taoism Social rule Joseph Stalin Mahatma Gandhi Surplus value Conscription Transformation problem Guan Yu
