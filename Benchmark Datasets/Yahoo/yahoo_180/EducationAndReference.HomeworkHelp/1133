can you please be nice enough to help me with this question the distance travelled by cars with automatic tranmissions before they develop transmission problems is on average km with a standard deviation of km a car dealership claims that their automatic cars will last up to km before developing transmission problems assume that this variable is normally distributed are the dealership's claims reasonable explain what proportion of with automatic transmissions would develop transmission problems within km assuming a normal distribution that means that of all vehicles will fall within or standard deviations from the mean therefore given the numbers you have of all vehicles will fall between or km that is or or to km within one standard deviation is to km and based on a normal distribution this likelihood is that one falls within that range so i would say the dealer's claims are reasonable given that they are on the low side of the mean and within one standard deviation the proportion of cars that would develop transmission problems within is more difficult if you actually meant within then it would be within standard deviations and would be of the total number of cars to fall within sd's on both sides of the mean that would be Normal distribution Manual transmission Toyota Prius Intelligence quotient Transformer Decibel Labor theory of value Central limit theorem Yugo Bluetooth Speed limit Automatic number plate recognition Wind turbine Automobile AvtoVAZ Audi Ford Focus Gravity Microeconomics Equine conformation Maximum entropy probability distribution Mitsubishi 3000GT Chevrolet Corvair Bayes' theorem Four wheel drive Species Margin of error ELO rating system Exponential distribution Headlight Prices of production Federal Standard 1037C Chevrolet Camaro Grade (education) Road traffic accident Log-normal distribution Mean Toyota Camry Hydrogen economy Race and intelligence Carburetor Insurance Law of value Radio Human height Car handling Student's t-distribution Doomsday argument Mercury Cougar TGV Sport utility vehicle Single Transferable Vote Motor oil Uncertainty principle Value at risk Renewable energy Control chart Oldsmobile Silhouette Median Blackjack Continuously variable transmission Probability Maximum likelihood Mitsubishi Eclipse Solar car Toyota Motor Corporation Edsel Chrysler Corporation Empirical Bayes method Statistical hypothesis testing Frequency modulation De Lorean DMC-12 Volkswagen Golf Survival analysis Hybrid vehicle Speech recognition Ford Explorer Fermi paradox Road-rule enforcement camera Ford Mondeo Acura TL Linear regression Fuel efficiency Fuel injection Airbag Public transport Binomial distribution E85 Quantum mechanics Subaru Loyale Electric power transmission Ford Thunderbird Big Bang U.S. Electoral College Chevrolet Corvette Inflation RFID
