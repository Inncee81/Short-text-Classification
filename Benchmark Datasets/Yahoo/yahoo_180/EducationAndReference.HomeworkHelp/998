further mathematics partial fractions hey guys i got this assignment on partial fractions am good in maths and all these calculations but i missed the class and i tried to check the topic on ma text books but i didnt c it so i dont hav any idea how am going to solve them plz help mi xplain them and if possible u can help mi solve them da questions r x x x x x x x x x x and x x thenx guyz i'll go through one of these x x x x first note that x x cannot be factored if it could be factored then that would be the first step x x x x a x bx c x x bx c is used on the second term because x x is of the second degree so the term on top must be one degree lower now multiply both sides by x x x x a x x bx c x this is true for any value of x if you let x you can find a a b c a a a replace a with x x x bx c x now let's try x b c c c c replace c with x x x bx x now pick a third value for x one that you haven't already used plug it in and solve for c after you've found c go back to the equation a x bx c x x and put in the values you just found for a b and c Ordinary differential equation Mathematics Projective transformation Complex number Vedic mathematics Partial fraction Elementary algebra Quartic equation Polynomial Continued fraction Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Binomial coefficient Lebesgue integration TI-89 series Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Numerical analysis Separation of variables Joseph Louis Lagrange Ruffini's rule On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Exponentiation GED Gauge theory Trigonometric function Sturm-Liouville theory Bayesian inference Explosive material Adjoint functors Gravity Slide rule Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Path integral formulation Fibonacci number G__del's incompleteness theorem Cissoid of Diocles Hydrogeology Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Doomsday argument Halting problem Transformation problem Computer numbering formats Sudoku Recurrence relation Quantum computer Square root Prime number Large numbers Logic Identical particles M__bius transformation Economics Trip distribution Derivative Many-worlds interpretation Complexity classes P and NP Mathematics of general relativity Random walk Riemann zeta function Quantum harmonic oscillator Algorithm Astrodynamics Polynomial interpolation Binary numeral system Newton's method Order theory Bose gas Pi General relativity Units of measurement Dynamical system Gaussian elimination Principle of maximum entropy Mental calculation Microeconomics RSA Web crawler P-adic number Software engineering Dynamic programming Napier's bones Model (economics) Orthogonal matrix Particle in a box Computational complexity theory George Boole IP (complexity) Polylogarithm Fermat's last theorem Trigonometric identity Logarithm Price equation History of mathematics Shor's algorithm Expert system Examples of differential equations UBASIC Dirac equation Irrational number Nondimensionalization Normal distribution
