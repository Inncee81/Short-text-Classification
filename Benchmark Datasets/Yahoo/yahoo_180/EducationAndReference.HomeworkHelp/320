please help me with my homework we're supposed to have a debate next week regarding the legalization of drugs in philippines i was chosen to represent the negative con's side could anyone please give me a link to a webpage with information related to the cons of drug legalization buddy you should first make sure your assignment isnt about debates on legalization of opium in phillipines which occured way back in otherwise heres a great article the pros and cons of drug legalization should drugs be legalized drugs are resources that are capable of affecting theamerican economy in many ways both positively and negatively drugs often have a bad name even though they help us everyday in medical cases and the drugs with the worst reputations are not the most abused drugs one may benefit from the legalization of drugs in many ways while others would suffer greatly almost every person in the united states has their own opinion on drug legalization there are many different pros and cons to the legalization of drugs drug legalization is also an ethical and a moral issue should drugs be legalized or not while i think drugs should be legalized many others disagree the first major benefit that will come from the legalization of drugs will be the increase in jobs creation of new jobs will take place in the manufacturing industry sales industry and marketing industry due to the increased demand for drugs the manufacturing industry will experience a boost because some drugs will need to be mixed with other substances to become other drugs such as crack cocaine the sale industry will expand from the legalization of drugs because the drugs will not sale themselves a new form of entrepreneurship will be available for many individuals to take part in marketing jobs will increase simply because every new drug product will need to be marketed in addition there will be a variety of legalized drugs not only will drugs create jobs for these three major industries they will also create jobs for farmers farmers will benefit from the sale and distribution of drugs in the united states the southeast and south west in general will benefit the most form these new types of crops in the west the very hot climate and usual low cloud cover will allow the marijuana plant to flourish much like it does in mexico in the south it will no longer be king cotton ruling the land it will be the great king cocaine that takes the throne and rain supreme the cocaine plant will do well in the south due to the similarities of the deciduous slightly tropical forest of south georgia and florida and the jungles of its native south america over seventy percent of drugs that come from plants need cultivating by someone the three major ones are cocaine marijuana and opium all three require very little to grow this will allow farmers that have very unfertile soil to grow vast acreage of different drug crops and reap large profits instead of going out of business and losing everything farmers that have incorporated crop rotation will be able to bring marijuana in plant it on their worst piece of property and make a profit farming has been on the decline in the last few years the legalization of drugs could be the driving force that brings them back this type of farming is legal in many places and has been proven effective this process being legal will allow farmers to flourish however it is not legal in the united states this leads to the next point the legalization of drugs would decrease the prison population significantly in there were drug offenders serving time in federal prison if drugs were legalized these offenders would be released some drug charges are federal offenses that can ruin one's life forever for example some states have laws that disable convicted felons from voting if caught only talking about selling or distributing drugs the charge can carry a one hundred year sentence if convicted while a convicted murderer could get out in seven years depending on the circumstances this is completely unfair unneeded and would not exist if drugs were legalized my third reason why drugs should be legalized concerns taxes tax breaks could be brought upon by this new source of tax money there is eleven point four billion dollars a year that is spent fighting the war on drugs that seems to be ineffective our tax money is putting this money forth but it could be put to better use if drugs were legalized if drugs were legalized the government could place taxes on them the money generated from the drug tax alone could be used to build new schools instead of new prisons the drug taxes could even be used toward special scholarships government grants or construction of new roads this will generate new opportunities for some people which they may not have had before due to the lack of government aid this shows how drugs could play a major positive role in our economy last of all the economy would experience an extreme boom from the byproducts of drug legalization certain drugs need other products to function properly or to be produced for example heroin addicts need needles to inject the drug this will call for a higher demand for needles and the production of needles will increase this is simply supply and demand the heroin and the needles will be complements of each other and will cause a direct supply and demand curve that will flex tremendously this supply and demand will help our economy thrive heroin is not the only drug that will benefit from byproducts other drugs such as crack need to be mix with american made products such as baking soda all these things intertwine for the greater good in a sort of you scratch my back i will scratch your back sort of way propelling the united states into a future as an even larger economic power house these are just a few reasons why drugs should be legalized for one reason the good ascends the bad and the input does not exceed the output farmers will be able to grow cheap crops and prisons will be for real criminals above all the economy will flourish this new concept will yield numerous positive results such as new jobs and sources of money for americans the money that spent on drugs is currently sent out of this country making other countries rich we are spending money to stop this instead of embracing it to make our own country rich this is a war does not need to be fought and is a blatant waist of the united states tax payers money the legalization of drugs should occur for the benefit and the well being of this wonderful nation as with all hot topics there is a con for almost every pro there are many reasons why drugs are illegal for example the rock bottom prices would put drug dealers out of business this looks like a good thing but once drugs are cheaper more people will experiment with the higher experimental level more people will become addicted a high increase of experimentation will occur because of a decrease in price and therefore there will be more drug addictions there is no way possible a single drug dealer can compete with big business meaning large corporations with lower prices the big companies will be able to buy tremendous amounts of drugs at wholesale prices therefore passing on a cheaper price to consumers this cheaper price will destroy the drug dealer for one simple reason the supply is extremely higher than the demand simple economics with price of production also being significantly lower the price of the drugs could drop even lower causing drugs to be lower then bread which is a shame with grain being the nation leading crop with the drugs being cheaper more people will be able to afford them this allows them to be easily accessible the more accessible they are the more people will try them drugs like heroin and crack cocaine are very addictive substances often taking only one use for one to become addicted in the case of heroin the addiction effect is so strong that a person would have to get addicted to a lesser drug such morphine to beat the addiction this is one major reason that drugs are outlawed it is proven that drugs alter ones physical emotional and often mental state virtually disabling a person in some form or way for a determined period the growing addiction rate would call for more rehabilitation centers to be built this money would have to come from somewhere the money more than likely will come from tax dollars that the taxpayer will have to provide this will mean an unnecessary new tax for a problem that we do not need to have even with more rehabilitation centers there is still a very strong possibility that some drugs users will relapse and start the vicious cycle over again this in turn will call for more money and more tax dollars that could be used for better things such as roads schools and scholarships not rehabs prisons and police since there is no major drug producer in the united states we have to import them form other drug producing countries this is a multi billion dollar a year industry proven evident by the one hundred thirty four million dollar drug bust that took place right here in the chattahoochee valley area on last year and the more recent five point five million dollar drug bust this leads you to one question where are the drugs coming from if there are no producers in the united states and the truth is that they are not coming from here they are coming from other countries out side the u s such as mexico costa rica nicaragua peru ecuador el salvador columbia bolivia and venezuela every year we spend billions of dollar attempting to fight this problem but to contradict that drug by twice as much spent on getting them in this is a battle that the united states is fighting that it will never win and the more money we spend to keep the drugs out the more money the drug dealers will spend to get the drugs in if drugs were to be legalized instead of shipping these billions off to third world country drugs lords making them rich and providing them with the funds to rule their country this money could be put to use here making our countries financial status better all these things make drug legalization such a hot topic in the world today there is enough evidence to support either side of this debate drugs have often had a bad reputation but it seems that in every good there is bad and vice versa it seems that the only thing that has so many people divided is fear fear of the harm it could do or even fear of the good it could do take for example the city of amsterdam it proves that drugs can be legalized in a safe and orderly manner since the legalization of drugs their there crime rate has been one of the lowest in the world in the end it all boils down to people because drugs do not control people people control drugs society has proven this with th amendment where one of the most commonly abused drugs alcohol was banned in the 's the ban was later repealed in the 's during the ban alcoholism went down but it created a booming industry for organized gangsters crime went up but when the law was repealed crime went down and alcoholism went up it seems history has a way of repeating itself and i think drugs should be legalized
