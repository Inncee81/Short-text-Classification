what would be a good idea for a senior project i either have to learn how do something or come up with a product of something like holding a dance to rasie money for cancer someone already did that and i dont wanna copy them so plz hlep me with some ideas for the project well thx in advance community service is the way to go my students did a lot of projects this year one was sending cards to the troops in iraq one was planting marigolds for our school and then donating some of the plants to an aids facility they also made birthday cards for a little boy with cancer who was trying to break the world record of receiving cards you can run a food drive or a clothing drive or a charity basketball game even my suggestion would be to call some local places and see if they are in need of anything basically community service is the way to go you can get a lot of people involved and have fun at the same time it is a lot of work but definitely worth it in the end Playoff Jeopardy!
