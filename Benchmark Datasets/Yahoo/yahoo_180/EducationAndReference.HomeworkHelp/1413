the effective output efficiency of fuels please help urgently ok i have this assignment and it's telling me to analyze the heat of reactions of various fuels used today compared with effective output i e effciency i know that the heat of reaction of fuels is exothermic which is also the heat of combustion of the fuels and i have found a site which has values for the heat of combustion of various fuels but i can't find anything to do with the percentage of effciency of different types of fuels and i've been looking everywhere btw if ur wanting to know i'm intending to do different types of fuels diesel butane and probably natural gas or methane so if anyone can give me the percentage efficiency effective output of any of these fuels i'll choose you as best and a website would be very much appreciated i really need this urgently because the draft is due the end of this week thanks heaps everyone i don't mind if you choose me as best or not the thing is im not sure about my answer diesel source http www bankrate com brm news auto a asp prodtype auto butane fuel consumption penalty source http en wikipedia org wiki butanol fuel properties of common fuels methane source http biopact com eon creates company to feed biogas into html Alcohol fuel Renewable energy Alkane Explosive material Hydrogen economy Future energy development Natural gas Hydrogen vehicle Biodiesel Methane Petroleum Energy development Gas turbine Sewage treatment Gasoline Diesel engine Hydrogen Coal Nuclear fusion Hybrid vehicle Nuclear power Fuel cell Gasification Automobile Methanol Thermal depolymerization Two-stroke cycle Spacecraft propulsion Town gas Oxygen sensor Diesel Combustion Stirling engine Steam engine Carburetor Website Chemical reaction Power station Bunsen burner Solar power Portable stove Greenhouse gas Carbon monoxide Liquid fuels Fire fighting Fuel Propane Hubbert peak theory Spark plug Catalytic converter Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Uniform Resource Locator Anaerobic digestion Furnace Microeconomics Climate change Fuel efficiency Turbocharger Air pollution Locomotive Abiogenic petroleum origin Kyoto Protocol Incandescent light bulb Diesel cycle Battery electric vehicle Wget Mitigation of global warming E85 Clostridium acetobutylicum Environmental concerns with electricity generation Wood gas Wind power Fusion power Helium HTML Solar variation HTTP cookie Global warming Motor oil Carbon dioxide Web server Thermal power station Pulse jet engine Nitroglycerin Ammonia Fischer-Tropsch process Common Unix Printing System Fire extinguisher Nuclear reactor Wankel engine Supercharger
