can you suggest a project for our science club that will both gain us fund and will be used by the student just suggest a project that is unique thank you i am not very certain of what you're asking but i'll answer it according to my interpretation i think that you mean you need something that will attract money from the students yet the thing you create must useful to your fellow peers well you could create since it has to do with science a little booklet about science something like a study handbook for what you're learning at school or perhaps you can create a contest that the contestants must pay to enter like a little quiz show or something like jeopardy and the prize is something that you have invented or something that the students may want sorry if this answer wasn't what you wanted i hope i helped Jeopardy!
