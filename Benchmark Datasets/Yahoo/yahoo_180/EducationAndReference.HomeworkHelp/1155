i need help designing a hierarchy chart for international currency conversion computer program what programming format are you using java c etc depending on the program it may be a simple as a loop with a conversion to one specific currency and then high low parameters like first set it up to all types of currnency to convert to us dollars that's probably the easiest use like an if euro then dollar then the amount of euros x rate then take you answer than other answers computed and so on you'll have to have a chart of all applicable rates to convert then just do a or dollar and then it will be put in order with each input i'm a little rusty on programming and without knowing what format you are using it's difficult to help but the basic logic needed to do the program is there sorry i couldn't be more help Operational amplifier Euro Expert system BASIC programming language Programming language Compiler optimization Perl XML CPU cache Visual Basic Java programming language Unicode Analog-to-digital converter Central processing unit Halting problem Computer Natural deduction Object-oriented programming Compiler CPU design Class (computer science) Variable C programming language Domain Name System Digital circuit ALGOL 68 PostScript Genetic algorithm Common Unix Printing System Pound sterling Turing machine Portable Document Format PID controller Abstraction (computer science) Forth programming language Game programmer Transistor Scheme programming language Microeconomics RISC Polymorphism (computer science) Windows 2000 Complexity classes P and NP Loudspeaker Curry-Howard Computer numbering formats Atari 8-bit family Recursion Binary numeral system Musical Instrument Digital Interface Digital-to-analog converter UTF-8 Lisp programming language Linked list Hello world program Explosive material Internet protocol suite Monetary policy MIPS architecture Control system Diablo II: Lord of Destruction C Sharp Supply and demand Floppy disk Logic gate Speech synthesis Hardware random number generator Oscilloscope Computer science Functional programming Mainframe computer Combinatory logic Debugging Hexadecimal Fuel injection System/36 Inflation Artificial intelligence Programmable logic controller Computer virus PHP Jet engine Unix time Transformer Money C plus plus Wipeout (game) Argentine Currency Board MP3 Verilog Morse Code X86 assembly language Brainfuck Hong Kong dollar Common Lisp Spreadsheet
