critique quote from ben franklin i was rather disappointed when i found myself recovering regretting in some degree that i must now sometimes or other have all that disagreeable work to do over again i can't say much because it's your assignment but have you ever been very sick for a while hospitalized perhaps if not try to imagine it especially if you were a hard working energetic person like mr franklin he was doing well through hard work then found himself and his employer so sick that he was near to dying nobody wants that but once he was sick he was able to relax stay in bed and get taken care of so when he found himself better he faced the prospect of having to work hard all over again to regain the position he had already held imagine what that would be like could you see how on one level getting better could actually seem ironically worse than staying sick or even dying in a book about the rightness of hard work and self sacrifice we get a glimpse here of how hard it was for franklin himself to keep at it do you identify more or less with franklin for having made this admission have you ever felt this way or known anyone who felt this way is it a sensible thing to think are even those who hold good sense in the highest regard always sensible themselves do you think it was the lingering illness that made him feel that way or just plain humanity Democratic Party (United States) Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Franklin D.
