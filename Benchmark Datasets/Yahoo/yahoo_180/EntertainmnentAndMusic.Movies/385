anyone think the new simpsons movie was crap i went to see it and it left me totally unimpressed it wasnt crap but then again it wasnt good just like a normal episode strung out to last the duration ok so there was a few scenes such as the shot of the huge mob carrying flaming torches that looked great and could only have been done on a film screen but apart from that i was suprised at how little i was drawn into the story i noticed that the tv show however short drew you in and you felt at home with the characters but in the movie they fitted all the regulars apu etc in but you didnt feel any connection with them just faces that appeared said a witty line and went i think we have grown to used to the simpsons on the small screen and on a cinema screen it wasnt as intimate could they have done it better i doubt it i find it hard to believe anyone could have come up with a credible storyline for a simpsons movie its all been done over the numerous seasons i even believe the show should take a break from tv for a year or two to allow the world to move on and the cast crew to recharge their batteries groening seems obsessed with having it go on and on non stop just to break records if it were off tv for a while imagine the build up of interest and storylines to cover when it came back anyway the movie wasnt good or bad it was the worst type of movie that doesnt raise any feelings in you totally bland i agree all the best clips were shown on tv so many folks have said that The Simpsons Science fiction on television The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular Fantastic Four Futurama Doctor Who Digimon Canon (fiction) The Ashlee Simpson Show Meta-reference Whose Line Is It Anyway?
