how can i avoid bathroom breaks during a movie this probably sounds a bit dumb but whenever i go see a movie at the theater i always get really thirsty and end up drinking a lot then i end up needing the bathroom before the movie is over i hate to miss parts of the movie and i hate being 'that person' you know the one that disturbs everyone else because they have to get up to go pee lol i'm sure they make the air dry in theaters to encourage you to buy drinks i stopped eating popcorn because that made me more thirsty any suggestions on how to curb my thirst without drinking gallons of water soda i'm going to the movies tonight and i really don't wanna be in this situation again i always make sure i go before the movie last time i went to the movies was for the simpsons i tried holding it because it'sonly a short movie and i was in sooo much pain by the end lol i always go before the movie and then i just sip on the drink throughout the movie but i don't do popcorn to dry i eat nachos instead but also if it is a longer movie you might not want to get a drink or popcorn or get a smaller drink you could try eating candy instead take some hard candies in your pocket that will make you salivate but it won't make you hungry at least that works for me i live off hard mints and butterscotch at work a lot Movie theater Fecal incontinence Soft drink Ron and Fez Happy Tree Friends The Shining (film) Homer Simpson Popcorn Treehouse of Horror V Sola fide Make money fast Bulk vending Shaggy dog story "Weird Al" Yankovic Drinking Dental caries Tea Cosmo Kramer Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory Coffee The Cure Bart Simpson Wine The Ashlee Simpson Show Wedding Crashers Jackass: The Movie Traumatic incident reduction The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hungry ghost Taxi Driver Drowning Hamster Tooth Hiccup Can't Hardly Wait Ramen Coca-Cola Marathon (sport) Loss leader Subliminal message Hansel und Gretel Poker jargon RuneScape quests Drive-in theater Sin City The Jazz Singer Beavis and Butt-head Little Britain Who Shot Mr. Burns?
