for those that have seen and fully understand 'the prestige' im sure this is a repeated discussion amongst viewers of the film i don't get the whole deal with michael caine's character did he know all along that bale had a twin he wasn't too suprised to see 'fallon' go to the warehouse where jackman was in the end and he's talking at the very end to the daughter of bale how a trick works is the movie comprised of a whole complete trick michael caine ends up w the machine the tricks and the money does the movie show evidence of this i just feel that the real suprise ending has something to do w michael caine or i'm overanalyzing and hugh jackman's character what is the significance of his name angier danton not being his real name i heard that his real name was the name mentioned at the end when adopting bale's daughter lord something and what was the significance of the final image showing the water tank consisting of jackman's clone michael caine's character was basically an observer in a sense he worked with both men during their careers and it was not his place to interfere you notice that while he had the machine at the end he did use nor did he sell it he was just there to observe and clean up the mess not to be part of their rivalry not sure about the whole name thing you mentioned i honestly didn't even notice the significance of the clone and all of the clones in all of the tanks was to show the amount of sacrifice that hugh jackman's character also went through for his craft that he was essentially risking killing himself into order to create this grand trick it showed that christian bale's character wasn't the only one that had to sacrifice something for his craft Christian Bale X-Men (film) Hugh Jackman Neo (The Matrix) Cain Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Batman Begins Knots Landing Dynasty (TV series) God Emperor of Dune The Shining (film) IBM PC compatible Rei Ayanami Michael Caine EastEnders Theory of conduct Final Fantasy XI Daredevil Obi-Wan Kenobi The nature of God in Western theology Atari 2600 Curse and mark of Cain Hogan's Heroes Shaggy dog story Guiding Light Days of our Lives Priestly Code Casino Royale (2006 film) Adam and Eve Austin Powers Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Hey Jude Notable lines in the Star Wars series It's Walky!
