final destination do you think they'll be a final destination should there be i love the first three i dunno the first two were good as there was a connection between the girl cant remember her name then the third one was completely different still good though i think if they did anymore they would get boring as the actual films are the same they all get killed and a couple survive what the could do is take the survivors from the other ones and kill them off tht would be a better way to make another film whilst ending the films Final Destination Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Final Destination 3 Little Shop of Horrors The Amazing Race Kain (Legacy of Kain) Cliff Richard Final Destination 2 Friday the 13th (film series) Battle Royale Jennifer Lopez Parsifal 28 Days Later Apocalypse Now Modesty Blaise Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare The Rutles Platoon (film) Charmed Ichigo 100% Empress Shangguan Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Reincarnation Survivor (novel) Dracula Pamela Voorhees The Bag On Line Adventures Incarnations of Immortality Lolita Characters of Lost Gregg Alexander Traditional animation Aladdin (1992 film) Vampire Hunter D Shiki-Jitsu The Virgin Suicides St. Elmo's Fire (film) Nancy Drew Musical film Buffy Summers Norway national football team Charles Lee Ray What a Way to Go!
