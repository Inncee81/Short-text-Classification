can i use a classical song for a movie so i was trying to figure out a way to use music in a movie i'm making with out paying tons of money and one of my friends thought that i could use some classical music like mozart and what not because they songs pre date copyright laws is this true it is called public domain all music falls into public domain after a period of time the laws specify the period of time they do not grant permanent copyright to anyone most governments allow copyright to extend to years after the death of the composer the usa and eu countries observe a year period all rules have exceptions but mozart is long dead and his works are considered pd in his home country germany which is the guide used by the wto governing commercial use in other countries however this does not allow you to take a cd recording of his music and use in a movie that is because the recording company has a claim on the recording of the music both the composition and the recording have to be pd to be used rights free here is a website that has what you want http www music tvandfilms com Public domain Copyright Copyright law of the United Kingdom United States copyright law Fair use Copyright infringement Crown copyright Intellectual property Freedom of speech European classical music Japanese copyright law Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Trademark Warez Copyleft Romantic music SCO-Linux controversies Australian copyright law World Trade Organization Ludwig van Beethoven Sonata (music) Software patents under TRIPs Agreement Fr__d__ric Chopin Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights GNU General Public License Software patent debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Grammy Award Felix Mendelssohn Tonality Patent Baroque music Eldred v.
