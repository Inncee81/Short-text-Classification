are the indian movies more realistic or the english movies more realistic the english i have to agree with naz indian movies are very corny how can you get lost in a story when in the middle the characters stop and sing for like minutes it's like a movie is supposed to create reality that you get so caught up in that you forget about the real world for two hours so what happens in indian movies is that you get lost in the reality of a movie for a while and it's all good until it gets to a dramatic scene and then boom they stop and sing and start to dance around in corny synchronized dancing and then you remember oh yeah i'm watching a movie with aishwarya rai and two other movie stars it kills the fact that when you watch a movie a good indicator of a good movie is that you're supposed to forget that you're watching a movie english movies are good because they engage you in the reality of the story until the very end you forget that nicole kidman is superstar actress nicole kidman until the very end when the credits roll they don't kill the reality of the movie by inserting corny song and dance numbers here and there like in indian movies Nicole Kidman Aishwarya Rai She Loves You Stanley Kubrick Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Usher (entertainer) Actor Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Digimon Tom Cruise Sting (musician) Film soundtrack Moulin Rouge!
