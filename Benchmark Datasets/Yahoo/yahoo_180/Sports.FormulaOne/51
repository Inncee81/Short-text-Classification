how is the car ferrari made the f car because i want to the how it is made the parts what they do etc the history of race car manufacture is very interesting and if you went back to the mid 's just years ago you would have found cars fabricated into a monocoque structure from alloy sheet and then riveted together just like an old fighter plane such as a spitifire a monocoque is taken from the idea of an aeroplane in which sheets of metal riveted together to form a series of box sections is both extremely strong and very light if you want to know how this works then superglue about or cardboard matchboxes together to form a square place them end up and all being well you should be able to stand on them also eggs are a kind of light strong monocoque in grand prix racing or any motor sport the most important thing is to make the cars as light and as a strong as possible and so every component uses high strngth materials but as thinly made as possible to save weight by getting the weight down to under half a ton fully laden with fuel a bhp engine is much the same as fitting am litre dragster engine into your ordinary road car this is called the power to weight ratio which in a formula one car is probably i'm not quite sure something like bhp ton whatever the exact figure it makes them quicker off the line than a jet fighter it doesn't matter what car you choose in formula because they are all made much the same these days beneath the outer panels a grand prix car is made from a modern material called carbon fibre which starts life as a mat of material a bit like fibreglass matting but of dark grey or black appearance this material is very carefully cut to shape and built up in a mould using resins to get the desired shape the whole thing is then autoclaved and when the resin hardens the material is at least as strong as steel and yet doesn't bend and crumple like steel instead it can be made to crumple and shatter in such a way that it absorbs enormous amounts of energy on impact did you see lewis hamilton drive into the tye wall at mph years ago he would have been quite badly injured but to day it is just a racing incident i'm not sure what the outer skin of the cars is made from these days but it is very likely to be a material known as kevlar or may be fibreglass whatever it is it doesn't need to be a strong as the carbon fibre monocoque beneath it which is why bits fly off when the cars hit each other weight saving applies to almost everything in a grand prix car so the suspension components are now made of the same carbon fibre the brakes too are carbon fibre because metal brake discs are very heavy things like wheels are made from light but strong magensium alloy as are many of the engine and gearbox components the major differnces between different formula cars are in the design of the suspension and the length of the wheelbase etc but especially in the design of the aerodynamics which play such an important part in making the car handle steer and accelerate better many formula car designers such as ross brawn have worked in the aero space industry and know a lot about wing design and airflow so far i've only touched on the complexities of a modern formula car which really is as advanced technologically as a nasa space craft and at the very pinnacle of engineering and design if i find any suitable web sites or think of anything really important i'll edit them into this reply and let you know but it really is amazing stuff which tests every single component to the limit History of Formula One Tire Bicycle Car handling Solar car Welding Sport utility vehicle Mazda RX-7 McLaren F1 Chevrolet Corvette Ford Thunderbird Lamborghini Diablo Mazda Miata Drag racing Toyota MR2 2000 Australian Grand Prix Indianapolis 500 Porsche 993 Boat building Model aircraft Steel Radio controlled airplane Scuderia Ferrari Dodge Charger Terminal ballistics Metallurgy Colin Chapman Chevrolet Corvair Seismic retrofit Honda Prelude Explosive material Formula Three Diesel engine Fixed-wing aircraft Recumbent bicycle Ford Mustang Mars Exploration Rover Homebuilt aircraft Mooney M20 Monocoque Mitsubishi 3000GT Screw Airbus A380 Battery electric vehicle Heinkel He 112 Jaguar E-type Grand Prix motor racing Formula One regulations Volkswagen Golf Solar power NASCAR Hydrogen economy Iron Gasoline Wood Aluminium Future of Formula One Wind turbine Land Rover Discovery SR-71 Blackbird Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Arado Ar 80 Tank Carburetor Pagani Zonda Fuel injection Nuclear weapon design Carbon fiber Tier One Chris Amon Michael Schumacher Glass
