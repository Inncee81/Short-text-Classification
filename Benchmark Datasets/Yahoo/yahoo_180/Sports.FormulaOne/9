what team orders did hamilton disobey i must admit i missed the race build up while i was having a massive piss now everyone is saying that hamilton disobayed team orders but nobody seems to want to elaborate on this so please help me out what did he do or not do and are team orders not supposed to be issued anyway both dennis and alonso suggested that hamilton had initially been at fault at the start of the final minute qualifying session in which the top grid positions are determined hamilton lined up ahead of alonso in the pit lane and for what the team described as fuel burning reasons he should have allowed the spaniard to pass him on his out lap the critical third phase of qualifying the top shootout takes place over minutes during which time the drivers set up their cars for the race as well as compete for the leading grid positions they must start the session with their race fuel load which is replenished at its end but can burn it off by completing more laps during the session to make the car lighter and consequently improve the chances of setting a fast time at its end dennis claimed that hamilton had broken an agreement by which alonso would have the advantage in this respect yesterday the fuel burn characteristics mean there is a small advantage which we play from driver to driver according to the nature of the circuit said dennis in this instance it was fernando s time to get the advantage of the longer fuel burn the arrangement was that we re down at the end of the pit lane with hamilton ahead of alonso so we reverse positions in the first lap that didn t occur as arranged that was somewhat disappointing and caused some tensions on the pit wall we were from that moment on out of sequence because the cars were in the wrong place on the circuit and that unfolded into the pitstops it complicated the situation into the result which was lewis not getting his final timed lap it was claimed that hamilton had ignored radio orders to let his teammate pass on five separate occasions dennis also said alonso had stayed in the pit box for the extra seconds because his engineer was waiting for traffic to clear on the circuit the stewards noted there were just four cars on track at the time of the instruction and so no need to wait for a gap in traffic this was the reason the team were handed the constructors points penalty Formula One 2003 United States Grand Prix 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Fernando Alonso 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain 24 Hours of Le Mans 2005 United States Grand Prix 2005 Australian Grand Prix 2005 Formula One season 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix Juan Pablo Montoya Team McLaren Formula One racing Ayrton Senna Jenson Button History of Formula One The Amazing Race Jacques Villeneuve Chris Amon Giancarlo Fisichella A1 Grand Prix 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix Renault F1 Jordan Grand Prix 2005 Monaco Grand Prix NASCAR 2004 Monaco Grand Prix 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix Scuderia Ferrari Drag racing Future of Formula One Carlos Reutemann Hendrick Motorsports Traffic light Craftsman Truck Series Mark Webber British Touring Car Championship Jacky Ickx 2005 Chinese Grand Prix Football (soccer) GP2 Series Tony Stewart Mercedes-Benz Carburetor Dog agility CPU design 2005 Japanese Grand Prix Esteban Tuero Danica Patrick Jet engine 1985 Australian Grand Prix Tour de France Ben Johnson (athlete) Toyota Prius Kart racing July 2004 in sports Railway signalling Damon Hill May 2005 in sports July 2005 in sports September 2005 in sports National Football League Lore Rugby union Bowl Championship Series Poker jargon Collapse of the World Trade Center Jarno Trulli Turbocharger David Coulthard Mario Kart 64 Minardi NEXTEL Cup Pit stop Norway national football team Ron Dennis Car handling Penske Racing 2005 San Marino Grand Prix Rail terminology TGV GunBound Tiago Monteiro Swedish Grand Prix Baseball April 2005 in sports
