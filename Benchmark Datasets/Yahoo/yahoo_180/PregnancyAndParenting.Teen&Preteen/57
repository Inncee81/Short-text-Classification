im and my bra size is dd i know it is big atchually very big im fed up of people in school commenting them should i be proud to have big boobs or should i think about reducing the size when im older wow i can really relate to this when i was your age mine were bigger not saying what size here but email me if you want to find out and i had the same problem i'm now and people are a lot more mature when they're finished school in my school uniform i used to get remarks from not only fellow pupils but also strangers on the street there are still some people that feel the need to comment but i've learnt to ignore them now you should be proud i am now at this stage in my life i just learned to accept them and think of them as a great accessory to every outfit having said that i would not be completely against surgery at some point in the future if for example i had back pain or anything like that which isn't an issue for me now i'd rather be the way i am than flat chested anyway to be honest i feel more feminine not saying anything against flat chests by the way this is just a personal preference of course if you did decide on reduction or similar you would need to wait until you're older in my country until then be proud people are often jealous and you'll see that more and more as you get older not to be patronising i hope you know what i mean so keep your chin up and walk tall and try to rise above the comments and don't try to hide them Breast Brassiere Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Equine conformation Software engineering Tyra Banks Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infantilism Breast implant Transsexuality Piccolo Junior Saga Physical attractiveness Plame affair Tai Chi Chuan Kylie Minogue Esperanto as an international language Escape from New York Daredevil Social rule Theory of conduct Poker jargon Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Saruman About a Boy Garth Brooks Stuttering Gender-neutral language Transactional analysis Goodness and value theory Fahrenheit 9/11 Breech birth Flat tax Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an MTV Video Music Award Diving Richard Feynman Abortion debate Professional wrestling holds RuneScape Random Events RuneScape quests Mobile Fighter G Gundam The Isley Brothers Prostate cancer High-heeled shoe GunBound Pitaten Garfield Professional wrestling attacks IP (complexity) John Edwards Stomach cancer Urban sprawl Tina Turner Rush Limbaugh Kyle Broflovski God Emperor of Dune Law of value Alcoholics Anonymous Androgen insensitivity syndrome Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Aesthetic Realism Ranma __ characters Stroke Breaststroke Anonymity Malignant melanoma Angina Bon Jovi Free will Drowning Utilitarianism Education English grammar Cat Asperger syndrome The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Blog Overpopulation Ben Johnson (athlete) Zoophilia E-mail U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Amy Dumas Smallville (Season 4) Sex and the City Ethics Mouse (computing) Medicine Cindy Sheehan Ayrton Senna Narcissism Intersex surgery The Catcher in the Rye W.I.T.C.H.
