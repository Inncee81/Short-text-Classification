need to install fan in my bathroom which is better vented through attic right through the wall to exterio i have seen both i was wondering if anyone could advise me whether i should install the fan with a vent through the attic or with a vent right through the interior wall to the outside what are the pros and cons of both thanks alot in general either option will work however in some climates attic space can be cool or cold causing the water vapor to condense if it condenses your fan willnot be able to blow it out and it may collect in the vent tubing i'd take the shortest possible route to discharge the vapor outside Circuit breaker Residual-current device Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Fuse (electrical) Welding BS 1363 Short circuit Switch Spark plug Electrical wiring Relay Electric motor Circuit design National Electrical Code (US) Gas metal arc welding Vacuum tube Ground and neutral Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Printed circuit board Three-phase electric power Thermal power station Action potential Distribution board Thermostat Heat High-voltage direct current Overhead lines Screw Electrical resistance Solar power Tesla coil Electrical wiring (UK) Naval mine Wire wrap Resistor Aluminium Solar cell Conductor (material) Earthing system Oscilloscope Ring circuit Wind turbine Electrophysiology Motorcycle Transistor Light switch Alternating current Incandescent light bulb Electricity meter Electric power transmission Tire Electrical breakdown Guitar Current (electricity) Soldering Ground (electricity) Ampere Magnet Ethernet Rail terminology Hydraulic machinery Power strip Wire Fan (implement) Fluorescent lamp Third rail Capacitor Operational amplifier Violin Lightning Loudspeaker Lightning rod Electric guitar Glossary of firefighting equipment Superconductivity Burglar alarm Railgun RS-232 Internal ballistics Lightsaber Seismic retrofit Central processing unit Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Diode X10 (industry standard) Ceramics High-voltage hazards Bicycle frame Oplan Bojinka Voltage drop Gas tungsten arc welding Enigma machine 2003 North America blackout Barbed wire Computer bus
