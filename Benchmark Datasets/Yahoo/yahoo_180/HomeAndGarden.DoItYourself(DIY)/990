why do the lines on my centeral air unit keep icing up out side its not a leak there are probably a few things wrong the system could be low on freon but that's not always the case it could also b that your evaporation coils on the top of you furnace are clogged with dust and dander this happens a lot if you are mechanically inclined at all you can take the front panel of the evap coils and get in there with a garden sprayer with a mixture of simple green and water it should wash off careful though you don't want to damage the fins looks like a radiator and if the lines out side are freezing these will also be frozen after you clean those coils go ahead and use the same spry on the condensing coils they are the ones out side around the ac unit then run the system if it still freezes you will need to have the freon checked by a professional but they wont be charging you for all the coil washes cause they have already been done it good preventative maintenance and if its never been done you'll find quite a mess up there hope this helps Distillation Brewery Water Heat exchanger Solar power Bong Water vapor Water (molecule) Water purification Fractional distillation Coffee Autonomous building Agar plate Ocean thermal energy conversion Steam engine Lake Boiling point Helium Alkane Thermal power station Motor oil Fossil fuel power plant Marine aquarium Hydrogen Single malt Scotch Desert Petroleum Furnace Fog Glass Hyperthermia Rum Reflux Perfume Temperature Welding Moonshine Cider Dry cleaning Sulfuric acid Steam Alcoholic beverage Soldering Evaporation Plastic Food preservation Carbon Nuclear reactor Diamond Hydrogen peroxide Thermoregulation Alcohol fuel Desalination Renewable energy Autoclave Hydrogen economy Casting Tesla coil Industrial process Vacuum Scotch whisky Dundas Square Phase change heat pump Carburetor Urine Sea ice Sun Homebrewing Tea Titanium Water resources First aid Geyser Diving suit Sterilization (microbiology) Ammonia Printed circuit board Greenhouse effect Hong Kong-style milk tea Alcohol Microwave oven Heat Tofu Essential oil Mars Phase (matter) Gas tungsten arc welding Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Space habitat Cocaine Solvent Nitrogen Explosive material Phosphorus Soap bubble Distilled beverage
