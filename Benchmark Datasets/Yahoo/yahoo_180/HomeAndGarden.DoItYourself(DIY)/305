i need a transformer for my doorbell that can be installed in the attic i cant install it under the house and my service panel is outstide easiest place for me is the attic but i dont want the transforer to overheat it won't overheat just mount it in the open not covered with insulation make the connections inside a box per electric code the transformers usually mount directly to a metal box knock out hole cover the box with a blank cover the transformers take a tiny amount of current from the house circuit and the wires to the button and chime are low voltage so there will be no problem at all in the attic i have seen them installed in attics in modular homes Woodworking Violin Linear Pottery culture Drawing Masking tape Collecting fossils Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Pocket knife Sundial Drill bit Bong Snooker Commodore 64 Comanche Glossary of climbing terms Wound Gramophone record Drywall Berlin Wall Duct tape Skateboarding trick Painting Climbing equipment VHS Whose Line Is It Anyway?
