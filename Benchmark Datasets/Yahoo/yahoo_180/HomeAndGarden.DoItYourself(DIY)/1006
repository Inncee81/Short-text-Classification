i need to install a ceiling fan but have no idea how i am extremely low on money and prefer to do it myself should i start by turning off the braker box my husband is out of town foe two weeks and it's hot the installation begins with choosing where the fan should be located in almost all homes the fan is installed in the center of the room replacing a central light fixture this spot provides a smooth air flow to most of the room since a fan draws about the same power as a ceiling fixture the electrical circuit shouldn't be overloaded but if your fan includes lights be sure the circuit it's on has enough extra capacity to handle the load if not you must run a new circuit with a new circuit breaker from the house main service panel or subpanel to the fan if there is no central light fixture you'll have to create a place to hang the ceiling fan then you'll need to bring electrical power to it you can tap into an existing circuit to do this check the blade clearance check the floor to ceiling height of the fan blades you can do this by measuring the floor to ceiling distance and subtracting for the part of the fan that will extend below the ceiling down to the lower blade surface an absolute minimum height of ' is recommended building codes in your area may reinforce this if the floor to ceiling distance is too little check into a low ceiling mount for your fan with some models the fan blade height can be increased by as much as remember though that you need at least between the ceiling and the tops of the fan blades for proper airflow having is better if the space is available complete detailed information at link below Fireplace Kitchen Bong Wood fuel Fireplace poker Hydrogen economy Fire Natural gas Spark plug Firefighter Motor oil Drill bit Siphon Fire fighting Organ (music) Air pollution Renewable energy Flamethrower Internal ballistics Solar power Dog training RuneScape quests TARDIS Seismic retrofit Punt (boat) Apollo 13 Suppressor Sail-plan Coming of Age (TNG episode) Gas turbine Aerial (dance move) Fossil fuel power plant Sorting algorithm Chevrolet Corvair M4 Sherman Pipe organ Oxyacetylene Carburetor Mars, Pennsylvania Jet engine Logging Energy development Chimney The Empty Child Electrical wiring Thermal power station BS 1363 Manitoba Hydro Matroid Spacecraft propulsion Carbon dioxide Welding Common Unix Printing System M16 (rifle) Modem Carbon monoxide Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Sailing Irrigation Saw Radio controlled airplane Gas lighting Textile manufacturing Wood E85 Flush toilet Campfire Sewage treatment Glossary of firefighting equipment Stove Porsche 911 Wildfire De Lorean DMC-12 Diving cylinder Rebreather Glossary of wildland fire terms Dairy Country house Hand grenade Ammunition Rocket fuel Scuba set Windows XP Gas turbine-electric locomotive Pebble bed reactor Airbag Firearm Dinghy Gas metal arc welding Cello Two-stroke cycle Lighting M60 machine gun Hash table Battle of Tarawa Stanley Cup Shaggy dog story Toyota Prius Richard Rahl Tank
