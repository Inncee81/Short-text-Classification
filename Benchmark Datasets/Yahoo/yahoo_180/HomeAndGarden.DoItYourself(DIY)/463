heat activated wood veneer laminant has anyone had experience with the heat activated wood veneer laminant i am attempting to re laminate an old library table the top is nothing fancy and will need to be done in just two sheets of laminant about feet x feet i've never attempted this before and am a bit overwhelmed by the older process of using exotic glues and big presses i've read about the pre glued heat activated using an iron type of laminant and think that this may be the way to go it sounds too good to be true which makes me a little bit skeptical i've already spent many many hours preparing my surface and don't really want to screw it up i'd like to hear from people who have actually used this product on a piece the size i'm contemplating i am not by any stretch of the imagination a wood worker but i am pretty handy and crafty how do you folks think i'll do with this product and this project any how to tips will be appreciated thanks i use it all the time for edging oak plywood for cabinets it is very easy set your iron to the highest heat setting and begin to iron it out you only need to hold the iron on a spot for about a sceond before the glue starts to melt and then keep ironing making sure you don't have any loose spots you can take a folded up towel or use a roller to flatten out the venner as you iron if you miss a spot don't worry you can go back and reheat that spot to adhere it and flatten it out have fun it's not that hard to do Staple (fastener) Stapler Revolver Floppy disk Drill bit Heckler & Koch G3 Speedloader 1957 World Series Staple gun Skateboarding trick Table saw Browning Model 1919 machine gun Marathon (computer game) Beretta 92F/FS Internal ballistics M16 (rifle) Pinball Equine conformation Glossary of firefighting equipment Two-stroke cycle Elevator Journey (band) Suplex Trapping Airsoft IAR 80 Lock picking Steyr Mannlicher M1901 Railroad car Los Angeles Kings Heckler & Koch MP5 Paintball marker Repeating rifle Railgun Charleston (dance move) Atari 8-bit family GLOCK Bong Aerosmith MG42 Anchor Casualty lifting Gatling gun Aerial (dance move) Cartridge (firearms) Ski Manual transmission Relay M60 machine gun Sleeve valve Krag-J__rgensen U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Breaststroke Knife Handloading Butterfly stroke Forth programming language Sega Saturn Guns N' Roses Battle of Mokra MG34 Messerschmitt Bf 109 AK-47 Glossary of nautical terms Ammunition Swingout Sinclair ZX81 M3 Grease Gun Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver First day on the Somme Chair M4 Sherman Tank Los Angeles Clippers Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine Heinkel He 100 Rifle Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Quake III Arena Suppressor RX-78 mobile suit series Futurama (TV series - season 4) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis X86 assembly language P-47 Thunderbolt Brush Combine (Half-Life 2) Machine gun Zippo Submachine gun Shotgun Mark I (tank) Firearm New York Giants System/36 Professional wrestling throws L.A.
