how do you attach facing to a neck edge on a shirt i'm making a pajama shirt and i'm completely confused about how to attach the facing do i baste stitch it and gather it like sleeves and then stitch the directions that came with the pattern confuse me at this point also what is grading the seam allowances this is one of these steps where you should have someone standing by your side but lets see if i can walk you through it what the facing is is the fabric that finishes the edge of your pj neckline you do not want to gather it like a sleeve since the point here is to create a finished edge for the neck have you already attached the front neck facing to the back neck facing yet and edge stitched the outer edges the next step is to pin the facing to the shirt this is done by matching right sides together typically you lay the shirt on the table with the right side facing up then invert the facing with the right side facing down pin the two together matching notches circles center backs and seams stitch along the seam allowance do not gather since this will pucker the neck opening if you are nervous about this use a baste stitch the first time through before you do any clipping let's double check to see if you've sewn the facing on properly merely flip the facing around like you are tucking in a collar the seam you just basted should now be the finished edge of your shirt if everything looks like it's in the right place unflip the facing back into it's original position and this time sew it for real grading the seam allowance means that you don't trim the seams at the same length this prevents having a bulky collection of seams beneath the finished edge of your neck line if you are still confused email me and i'll walk you through it in greater detail Peanut Peanut butter Adhesive Internal ballistics Peanut butter and jelly sandwich Tanning Butter Popcorn Nut (fruit) Genericized trademark Stuck Together, Torn Apart Breast Tofu Wound Spidey Super Stories Cartridge (firearms) GX-9900 Gundam X Clinker (boat building) Christo and Jeanne-Claude Bubblegum Cuisine of Africa Breastfeeding Dairy Cyanoacrylate George Washington Carver The Inside Supernumerary nipple Yarrow M&M's Saturated fat Nipple piercing Cuisine of the Philippines Breast bondage Solvent Pulse (legume) Chili con carne Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Homer Simpson The Wolf Man Tasmanian Devil Screw Domesticated turkey Pubic hair Toplessness Chocolate Cookie Hamster Alice B.
