is there any way to improve plastic scratch resistance hmm was wondering for sometime on this q is there any real way to improve plastic's scratch resistance like spraying some hard coat to uncoated plastic and vice versa we all know plastic is really easy to get scratches in no time even if you are careful the only way i know is overlay screen protector else a plastic sheet over it to prevent but is it possible to add the original plastic resistant to scratches i pretty worried when i going to buy a ps soon and will encounter this issue and heard of so many negative comments about it any ideas for an existing handheld game screen you are pretty much limited to the plastic screen protector films i have heard of people cutting out their own protective films from sheets of vue graph film since that might be a little thicker than some protective films you can however if you have a touch screen then that can interfere with the response i would not try spraying anything on the screen for fear that it might have a solvent affect and make the screen hazy if you are talking about protecting the plastic case then there are adhesive films that you can buy that adhere to the surface of the box these are used on many products nowadays from car fenders when they are shipped to watch faces and swim goggle lenses they are usually meant to be peeled off before you use them but could be left on and periodically replaced as needed as long as you didn't need to be able to see through them very well Concrete Seismic retrofit Drill bit Masonry Hamster Mattress Straw-bale construction Reinforced concrete Basement Air-raid shelter Rail tracks Casting Building material Pavement (material) Chair Upholstery Geodesic dome Light-frame construction Natural building Cremation Prestressed concrete Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Retaining wall Pile Boat building Vault Knife Vermicompost Pottery Stucco Floppy disk Kitchen Dam Menstrual cup Barbecue Le Corbusier Bass guitar Desert Road Radio masts and towers Fallout shelter Tofu Lumber Cinder block Stairway Shotgun Carburetor M16 (rifle) Drywall Microeconomics Dinghy Golf Passive solar Panama Canal Locks Pok__mon Abilities Ridge Route A151 road Anchor Rathfarnham Opportunity rover Gypsy moth Hoover Dam Ship model Screw Xanadu House Thermal power station Motorcycle helmet Adobe Wind turbine Shell (projectile) Fire fighting Trench warfare Printmaking Acne Fecal incontinence Mouse (computing) Collecting fossils Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Fancy rat Eifel Aqueduct Combine (Half-Life 2) Vacuum Guitar Wrigley Field NASCAR Fender Telecaster Dairy Harley-Davidson Comanche World Trade Center Barbed wire
