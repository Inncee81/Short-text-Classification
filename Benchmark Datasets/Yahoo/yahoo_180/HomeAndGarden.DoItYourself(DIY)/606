how can i make a homemade bottleneck guitar slide i've looked up some ideas and tried the method of scoring it with a glass cutter and heating and cooling but i haven't got the best glass cutter in the world so it takes too long to score it deep enough so my first attempt failed ive read about the hot wire method the string burning one and some others i think i'll try the hot wire one but does anyone know which method is best or have any other methods soak a thick peice of thick packing string in diesel fuel then tie it around the bottle neck light it on fire and let it heat the glass before the string goes out pour ice water over it and the glass swill fracture along the string line it takes some practice to get right but it works quite well Ski wax Manicure Wax Paint Casting Plastic Batik Seal (device) Shoe polish Wax play Pottery Perfume Cosmetics Motor oil Pubic hair Car washing techniques Paraffin Cross-country skiing Polyurethane Naruto jutsu Cotton swab Turquoise Doctor (Doctor Who) Gilding Guinea pig Brush Carnivorous plant Earwax Ski Nunchaku Violin Pysanka Drill bit Disc brake Characters of Naruto Diseases of the honeybee Dog Christmas tree Fire Alkane Sunscreen Body piercing Waxing Condom Sunglasses Friction Vulcanization Cat Eczema Inflation Leopard Woodworking Ear canal Lacquer What's My Line?
