i also wondered if anyone deficates in the sink i pee int he sink but one of the answers reminded me of the which i do in the kitchen so i can grind it in the garbage disposal anyone know something i can use to purify and get rid of smelling drains i thought at first you put this in the wrong subject and it would be better located in society and culture but i see that you are actually looking for household help first i wonder why you are doing that both the sink and the toilet end up in the same place the sewer grinding up your stool does not help in any way it all gets broken down in the end that being said it's your choice although i think you will find it difficult to form a long term relationship with this habit to clean the sink i would fill it partway up with hot water then add cup of bleach if that doesn't take care of the odor you can repeat the procedure with cup of vinegar instead and if you are having a long term problem sit a small bowl of vinegar on the counter for long lasting odor removal HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Web server World Wide Web PHP Apache HTTP Server Ajax (programming) HTTP cookie Proxy server Sears Holdings Corporation XMLHTTP Wget HTML Gmail Streaming media Website Uniform Resource Identifier Phishing Wireless Application Protocol Web browser Cross site scripting Web application TOC protocol Common Unix Printing System Domain Name System Wiki Stopping e-mail abuse BitTorrent Mod python Unicode and HTML Slashdot subculture Virtual hosting Port numbers Slash (punctuation) Character encodings in HTML Intrusion-detection system Representational State Transfer Server-side scripting Session Initiation Protocol Secure Shell Information appliance Web cache CPAN Ecclesiastical Latin Internet Lotus Notes TikiWiki JavaServer Pages Thin client Application server Quotation mark SAML WebDAV Squid cache XSL Transformations Opera (web browser) Gopher protocol Web service Manchester JSON Web design Mozilla Firefox Client-side scripting Future Shop Web page Java programming language Mozilla Application Suite Electronic commerce Apache Software Foundation I-mode Multimedia Messaging System Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition MySQL Web crawler Digest access authentication Fire The Book of Mozilla Universal Plug and Play Mac OS X Server Comment XML Screen scraping Methana Neopets Netscape Navigator Karytaina Jabber Macromedia Dreamweaver Major appliance Delta encoding Macromedia Sega Frankie Goes to Hollywood Java Servlet XHTML Massimo Ellul Free software Flickr Internet censorship in mainland China GameFAQs
