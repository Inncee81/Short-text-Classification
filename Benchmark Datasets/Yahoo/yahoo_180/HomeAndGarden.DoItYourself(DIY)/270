looking for a good website w pics for replacing water shutoff valve under sink i replaced my kitchen faucet and in the process knocked some deposits off of the cold water shutoff valve under the faucet it now slowly leaks plus it's old and crappy i tried locating a good website to explain how to replace a shutoof vavle and got frustrated im looking for a site with pictures and good descriptions specifically i want to go to the hardware store once what tools do i need the new valve of course do i need a pipe cutter should i cut directly beneath the valve or just remove the valve and replace it without cutting for a novice if you can remove the valve with wrences turn off the water and do this and take the valve to the store and ask for equivalent otherwise determine size of pipe by measuring around with a string buy a compression fitted valve to match pipe size using the string turn off water cut pipe at each end of valve with a pipe cutter the cutter should leave edges smooth put the ends of the old pipe into the openings of the compression fitting and tighten with a pair of wrenches if you don't have these you may be able to borrow but a true diyer would have these around and true diyers would be willing to go to the hardware store more than once if they are not very far away and then tighten some more if you have a rubber hose connection at the end of the valve that goes to the faucet you would need to instead buy a valve with a compression fitting at one end and the male connector that fits the rubber hose at the other you may just want to replace the connection to the faucet with a hose anyway and then go this route there are cheaper ways to go if you have soldering know how and materials but if this is the only plumbing you will do then this may be best alternative Casting Polymerase chain reaction Art Paint Upholstery Epoxy Stucco Painter and decorator Light-emitting diode Lead paint Manicure Primer (paint) Glass Rose Poker jargon Pastel Color Collecting fossils Handloading Color theory Blue Wood carving L.
