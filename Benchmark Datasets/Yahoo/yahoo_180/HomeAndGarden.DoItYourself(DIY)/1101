we've discovered a big hole in our ceiling help help my husband and i are ripping out our kitchen and going to put in new cabinets lights flooring all that stuff so we ripped down the old cabinets and the old soffit over the sink previously there were two lights sort of recessed in the soffitt but when we took out the soffitt we found two huge holes in the ceiling with the electrical wires coming out the holes about a foot wide each the stove is going to go under this spot now and it's in front of a window so we dont have alot of options for fixing it can anyone give any ideas on what to do we need to have lighting there other than that options are totally open help and thanks if the ceiling is sheetrock drywall or plaster then you can cut the plaster or sheetrock back to the middle of a ceiling joist cut patches out of another sheet of sheetrock and screw them to the ceiling joist use drywall tape and joint compound and a wide blade putty knife to smooth out the joint then texture as needed to match the rest of the ceiling if the ceiling is wood or metal that are hard to match a patch to then you might want to build a shallow wood box around the area over the stove and mount your new lights in that since there was a soffit there before then i assume the window does not go all the way up to the ceiling so this should work o k if the window does goes all the way up to the ceiling then you may need to cut out a section of the damaged ceiling and put in new boards or whatever the ceiling material is Bong Glass Drill bit Printed circuit board Floppy disk Drill Drill bit sizes Drilling and threading Smoking pipe Ketchup Safe-cracking Metalworking Casting Fiberglass Bottle Solar cell Cannabis (drug) Screw Die (manufacturing) Drill bit shank Diamond enhancement Oil well Textile manufacturing Hamster Coffee Knife Ice core Champagne (beverage) Plastic Woodworking Milk Nalgene Brush Apollo 15 Christmas tree Inca Kola Beverly Hills, California Energy development Wine bottle Float glass Derrick (lifting device) Jackhammer Baby bottle Port wine Compact disc Cathode ray tube Shotgun Molotov cocktail Wayne Corporation Hitler's death Drilling mud Prohibition Recycling Directional drilling Shotgunning Cider Wheat beer Tea ITunes Music Store Piccolo Junior Saga PHP Textile manufacturing terminology Seismic retrofit Polyethylene terephthalate Hand grenade Aluminum can Stereoscopy W.
