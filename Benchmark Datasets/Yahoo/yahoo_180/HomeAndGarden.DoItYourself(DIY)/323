how can you test a basement for mold choose sample point choosing the right spot for mold testing where to collect tape samples of surfaces people collect surface samples for mold testing using clear adhesive tape to identify a visible mold on a surface to screen settled dust for mold allergens or to test the cleanliness of a surface after mold cleanup regardless of the reason the adhesive tape mold test method can be very effective in fact more reliable than spot checks of airborne particles which vary widely minute by minute and far more reliable than culture samples which only grow a small percentage of all possible molds but everything depends on the selection of the sample location where you stick the tape this document explains where and where not to stick the tape when sampling for mold random mold samples tape sampling of arbitrary surfaces or sampling the obvious black mold when investigating a building are practices which increase the risk of a serious error missing what's important and finding what's not very important the result of these errors is the waste of time and money as well as the possible failure to find and address the real problem leaving a health or cost risk in a building to be handled again and again until it's addressed properly mold is everywhere you can't eliminate it if you could we'd all be in trouble as nothing would ever decay and we'd all be so buried in junk and debris that nothing could grow on the earth but we don't much like to see mold indoors and certainly not on our walls ceilings or furniture there we remove it or clean it off this paper describes the detection of mold in buildings by visual inspection of mold suspect surfaces a thorough building investigation for problematic mold needs to address hidden mold reservoirs for which our approach is to complete a detailed inspection and building leak history as well as to record occupant observations and complaints use the links at page left to navigate this

mold inspect test accuracy bias pledge contact us sampling drywall gypsum board sheetrock and other building surfaces for mold using clear adhesive tape as i've explained in various articles and at my instructions for collecting and mailing a tape sample to our lab different mold genera species will be found growing on the same or nearby sections of drywall on a building surface depending on several variables if the largest contiguous mold area in a building is trivial in amount say sq ft i would not test it unless i thought that the mold i see is representative of a larger mold problem i cannot see small areas of mold should simply be removed for larger areas of mold certainly if more than sq ft of area is moldy or if mold is growing on many surfaces in a building you are looking for the dominant species present and particularly allergenic or toxic species present in the environment collect one tape sample per location do not use the same tape to sample from multiple locations choose a representative sample spot select a representative spot of mold growth on a surface such as a wall cabinet ceiling or floor this means that if you see what appears to be a single coating of mold suspect growth on a surface all rather consistent by color texture and what it's growing on you need only one sample of that material variations in appearance or texture or growth surface or mold growing in different building areas or floors are reasons to sample more than one thing color sample molds of different colors black white green red gray brown yellow pink are often not always different species texture sample molds of different textures hard lumpy big grainy versus fuzzy and easily blowing into the air are often not always different species growth surface sample molds growing on different building materials this is quite important completely different mold genera and species may be found growing in the same building on different growth substrates drywall room side drywall cavity side plywood sheathing wood stud or joist framing painted surfaces exposed fiberglass insulation kraft paper vapor barrier are often not always different species even on the same growth surface drywall for example different mold species appear at different locations according to variations in moisture level explained just below building area basement crawl space living area and attic all have different moisture conditions often different building materials different patterns of air movement and exposure the green mold found on wood subflooring visible overhead from inspection in the basement is very often a completely different genera and species from the green mold found on the roof sheathing in the attic of the same building representative dust samples we will sometimes screen areas where there is no visible mold by collecting settled dust particles from a horizontal surface if you are going to collect a single dust screening sample collect it either from the area of which you are most suspicious a flooding basement or from the area where building occupants spend the most time perhaps a bedroom or family room variations in moisture gradient in the drywall so if a floor was flooded water loving molds grow closest to the floor such as highly visible black molds like stachybotrys chartarum while molds liking the drywall to be a little less wet grow a little higher such as cladosporium sp cladosporium sphaerospermum cladosporium cladosporioides ulocladium chartarum and molds liking the drywall to be still less wet grow higher still on a vertical wall such as aspergillus sp aspergillus glaucus aspergillus flavus penicillium sp etc therefore where the tape sample is collected can make a big difference in what you find in the first photo of moldy drywall three completely different mold genera and species were within a few inches of one another at different heights on this laundry room wall this condition often occurs but the different genera may be as close as inter mixed and even overlapping in the same area to growing several feet apart on the same wall to growing in the same building but on different materials on different surfaces in this case tape sample the bottom mold was stachybotrys chartarum tape sample the middle mold was cladosporium sphaerospermum and the top tape sample was aspergillus flavus of these three the aspergillus is the easily airborne toxic spore which is more likely to be a problem in the building if it is present in sufficient quantity in this photo detail you'll see that using a new and clean zip lok bag we placed several surface tape samples on the same bag if you can't assure that the bag surface is clean between tape sampling use a new bag for each sample interruptions in the moisture gradient absorption path for example at a wet floor which soaks the bottom of drywall moisture wicks up into the drywall material but moisture wicking may be reduced suddenly at a horizontal drywall joint resulting in easily visible borders or lines in fungal growth exact pathway of water on a surface or in a building cavity so tracing the exact water path through a ceiling or wall cavity is very important are you collecting too many mold test samples there are nearly always multiple mold species present in any environment where mold producing conditions are present we sample surfaces likely to host different molds focusing on surfaces which appear to represent mold or mold suspect material growing over large areas in the building don't collect and send samples if you find you want to collect a great many samples it would probably be smarter and more economical to bring in an expert to survey the building and who can sample more strategically Drill bit Screw Table saw Turbocharger
