why do manufacturers make it so hard to get into a cd and they put a light bulb in a small box with open ends thank you cute question caused me to chuckle at least not to sound sarcastic but we can't play a lightbulb actually the issue is more about just the packaging it's light weight for a bulb and we should assume they are fragile anyway it probably would't matter much if they were packed in foam one might still drop one taking it out of the box the good news is that cd's are pretty much going to go the way of the tracks at some point especially since the advent of mp 's etc my issue with music and most especially on a cd album cassette is that i'm very selective and usually don't want or need the other tracks regarding packaging in general however that business is as large albeit sometimes subtle as what products go into the packaging one of my least faves is anything packed in clear plastic that i have to slice through to get to the product hence possibly voiding any ability to return it as fine print states in original condition good q though steven wolf Masonry Sodium hypochlorite Seismic retrofit Water purification Hemp Brush Drill bit Brewery Weed control Dishwasher Washing machine Dishwashing Weed Irrigation Textile manufacturing Herbicide Brick Moss Building material Carnivorous plant Detergent Car washing techniques Retaining wall Vacuum cleaner Dry cleaning Upholstery Hebburn Illegal drug trade Tillage Air-raid shelter Architecture of the California missions Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Sugar beet Deforestation Bleach (manga) Leaf Poker jargon Chimney Disinfection Japanese toilet Maize Houseplant Solar power Dam Coal Hydrogen peroxide Passive solar Flowering plant Tea Lawn Organic peroxide Menstrual cup Laundry detergent Water resources Mortar (masonry) Bleach Coir Wetland Contact lens Adobe Environmental concerns with electricity generation Arch bridge Basement Sewage treatment Domestic water system Toilet Halitosis Desertification Tooth Sorghum Chlorine Hamster Concrete Town gas Manicure Gilding Stucco Japanese tea ceremony Natural building Septic tank Essential oil Gypsy moth Cinder block Ozone Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Comfrey Creeping Charlie Fireplace Anchor American Psycho Biodynamic agriculture Tooth enamel Soil Agriculture Sodium percarbonate Nuclear power Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Ammonia Home repair
