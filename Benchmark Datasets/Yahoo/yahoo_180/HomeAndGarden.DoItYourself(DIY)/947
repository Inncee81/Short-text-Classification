removable flow restrictor what is that i'm shopping for showerheads i like the rainfall shower heads i found one i like but it says it comes with a removable flow restrictor does that mean i can adjust the water pressure this would be great since i like less pressure and my husband likes more for years now showerheads have been required to discharge only gallons of water a minute not much water but it is enough anyway in most showerheads it's a small round disk with a tiny hole in the center and is removable it should increase your pressure when you do i find it interesting they 'advertise' that it is removable because it is required to be in the head they make a flow valve you can put on the shower arm that your showerhead screws on to that is what you really need they don't cost much wholesale but i've never really looked at a good hardware plumbing store for one they are about bucks wholesale so expect to pay or so for it Chair Upholstery Mattress Couch Vise (tool) Royal Assent Equine conformation Furniture Snooker Wood carving Professional wrestling throws Kowloon Motor Bus Palace of Westminster Passenger car Drill bit Theory of conduct Lisa's First Word Screw Pickup truck Teen Girl Squad Friends Lathe Strap-on dildo Bed (furniture) Socrate Cushion The Brady Bunch Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Special relativity Thai royal and noble titles EastEnders The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cleveland Browns Pillow Seismic retrofit Pittsburgh Steelers Sun Wukong Guilty Gear Futon Kach and Kahane Chai Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling match types Disney's Contemporary Resort Billiards Headboard (band) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vibes Shawn Michaels Rail tracks Micrometer Clinker (boat building) Cello Tire Poker jargon 1957 World Series Textile manufacturing Ontological argument Brewery President (game) The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular Dog training Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles The Lion King Einstein-Cartan theory Humphrey Bogart The dozens Charles Eames Human position Post office Luminiferous aether Baseball Happy Tree Friends Wan Chai High Court of Justice of England and Wales Milton H.
