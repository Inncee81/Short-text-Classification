can i use a power shower pump with a seperate mixer valve i assume you're thinking of installing a water pump to increase the pressure of your shower firstly you can only do this to a gravity fed hot water system not a combi boiler or megaflow second make sure the water tank is big enough it's no use increasing the pressure of the shower if you're going to run out of hot water in two minutes so the pump needs to go somewhere between the hot water tank and the shower ideally as near to the tank as possible in the airing cupboard would be best firmly fixed down maybe to a breezeblock to minimize the noise a twin pump will pump the hot and the cold water so they are at equal pressure which is essential for a thermostatic shower mixer you can use pretty much any shower mixer you like with a pump for most showers a or bar pump is enough for large rain heads or body jets bar or above would be best try to buy a brass pump it will be more expensive but will last a lot longer than a plastic one stuart turner monsoon pumps are excellent Gramophone record Basement Seismic retrofit Vacuum cleaner McMansion UK Singles Chart Casting Carpet Sydney Opera House Tile USB flash drive Plastic Central bank Linoleum Predatory lending Kitchen Plywood Mattress Movie theater Plasticizer Vinyl roof Christmas tree Arlington House Franklin W.
