assimilating laminate flooring i bought traffic master laminate flooring at the big orange box yesterday thursday today is the one day for a while that i will have the time to install it it says to let it sit in the room for hours now i understand that is the best thing to do i'm just curious if anybody has installed it within hours of bringing it home and if so what were the results i assumed it had no wood product in it when i bought it so there wouldn't be any shrinkage or expansion but i guess the fiberboard material inside will adjust a bit if i do this what kind of problem could i expect to see and if there was wouldn't it be somewhat easy to fix given it's not glued or nailed the area is a small hallway about sq ft it is a very humid area it is currently sitting in there stacked up any response is greatly appreciated thanks first i'm going to suggest that you not install traffic master flooring as it's a very poor product line i think there's still a pergo there on special that i can't stress strongly enough would be a better choice for little money more assimilation whether it's flooring or cabinetry is important especially in high humidity environments hours is the stated time on the box but after with this product you're likely safe just be sure to allow the floor to float by that meaning do not install any planks tight to a wall i hold all the way around the room or corridors sides i would go ahead and install just wait the remaining prescribed hours to install your baseboards best regards mike lonergan tradesprofessional inc http www tradesprofessional com Sento Wallpaper group Wok Scrubs Car washing techniques Dry cleaning Tile Manicure Japanese tea ceremony Japanese toilet Carpet Tessellation Kitchen Soap Cast iron Brewery The Legend of Zelda series enemies Bong Paint The Brady Bunch Laundry detergent Sterilization (microbiology) The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Queensbridge Hogwarts Floor Directory Brush Richard Chase Dundas Square Tattoo Upholstery Menstrual cup Car wash Laundry Wassily Kandinsky Comanche Fecal incontinence Vinegar Dialysis Color theory Seismic retrofit Plastic Tai shogi Codename: Kids Next Door Vacuum cleaner Chatsworth House Mattress Toilet Toilet paper Jackass: The Movie Columbine High School massacre Basement Dishwasher Five-second rule McMansion Lionel Corporation Jumpstart 3rd Grade Mouth ulcer Bathroom Teen Girl Squad Pai Gow The Legend of Zelda series races Taikyoku shogi Scrabble Time Out of Mind King Khalid International Airport Iron Chef National Statuary Hall Eight ball Dymaxion house World War Three (Doctor Who) Titanium 742 Evergreen Terrace Textile manufacturing Caving Soldering Ra (board game) Bread Color Computer animation Opportunity rover PC Engine Gram staining Mission San Juan Capistrano The Human Stain Yellow Hydrogen peroxide Violin Vitreous enamel Fluorescent lamp First aid Diseases of the honeybee Procter & Gamble Asbestos Billiards Grand Central Terminal Architecture of the California missions Nintendo Entertainment System Discworld gods
