can i clean my concrete driveway and or brick wall with bleach i just finished cleaning my deck with straight bleach and it looks wonderful yes you can use bleach or one of the masonry cleaners available from the building supply store you may need to use it with a power washer sprayer since the brick and concrete have a rougher surface pits and cracks that a brush may not be able to get clean be careful using bleach around your plants and grass bleach is also a great weed killer and it will kill good plants too if you do get it on your plants then rinse them well with water to get the bleach off their leaves and to dilute the bleach in the soil Drill bit Masonry Plastic Seismic retrofit Welding Stucco Liquid crystal display Mortar (masonry) Steel Knife Password cracking Leather Gesso Iron Casting Corrosion Titanium Home repair Gramophone record Glacier Apollo 8 Cast iron Fast bowling Paint Sword making Brewery Compact fluorescent lamp Hard disk Breastfeeding Color Japanese tea ceremony Drawing Motorcycle Diamond cut Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Diamond Polyvinyl alcohol Aquatic ape hypothesis Amber Pottery Toffee Equine conformation Reinforced concrete Seabird Pastel Sebaceous gland Dam Brittle Katana Manganese Mattress Gasoline Korean War Polarizer Impressionism Stainless steel Hubble Space Telescope Cryptanalysis Tocopherol Die making Crucible steel Arcade cabinet Parchment Chimney Minoan civilization Fracture mechanics Cubism Sandpaper Horseshoe Mixtape Sundial Alcoholic beverage On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Laserdisc Floppy disk Metallurgy Cookware and bakeware Flood geology Sound recording Incandescent light bulb St. Peter's Basilica Aluminium Construction Graffiti Springfield 1903 rifle Blonde on Blonde Sewage treatment Queen (album) Concrete Tooth enamel Cocaine Aggregate (composite) De Lorean DMC-12 Alcoholics Anonymous Endowment (Mormonism) Diving Hashish Portland cement Alan Arnold Griffith
