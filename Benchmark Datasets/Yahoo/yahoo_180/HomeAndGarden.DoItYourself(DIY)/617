replacing rotten subfloor under toilet how thick is the floor typically it was built in ' in new england i'm tackling this project myself 'cause i haven't got the to pay somebody to do it for me i already pulled the toilet up and most of the vinyl it's probably about cu ft of the floor that's water damaged there are drip marks in the kitchen below it but you can't see through i read in another forum that the floor is probably thick but that doesn't sound right to me the suggestion was to use a circular saw and take off a bit at a time all the rotten stuff to the nearest joist i understand the bit about checking the floor joists for damage and sistering joists as necessary i'm more concerned with ripping the wet stuff up any suggestions all i own is a jig saw so i'll probably rent or buy a circular saw i'm more concerned with the thickness of the sub floor 'cause i don't want to cut too deep also how far apart are the joists supposed to be floor joists are typically on center plywood sub flooring is typically you need a circular saw for the job you can buy one at any home center for around if a blade comes with the saw the blade that comes with the saw should be good enough for this job if no blade comes with the saw buy a carbide tipped combination blade ordinarily to cut plywood you would use a fine tooth plywood blade but that is not the blade to use here you will also need a tool called a cat's paw and a hammer the cat's paw is a tool for pulling nails the guy at lowes or home depot will know exactly what you're talking about pull up the vinyl and find where the plywood is nailed to a joist pull the nails out of the plywood using the cat's paw and hammer mark a line along the nail holes go and find the next row of nails and do the same thing mark a line at a degree angle past the edge of the damaged plywood make sure your cross cut is in good wood you probably will not be able to remove the toilet flange so you will have to use your jig saw to cut as close to it as you can and break the plywood away from it now you will need pieces of x or x that are about long measure the distance between the joists you want to toe nail nail at an angle one piece between the joists at the end of your cut out flush with the top of the joist make sure it is slightly under the original plywood as this will support the joint where the old plywood and new plywood meet do the same thing at the other end take the other two pieces and nail them in on both sides of the sewer pipe under the toilet flange cut out your new piece of plywood and you will have to measure from the end of the cut out to the center of the sewer pipe hole and cut the new piece in two at that point mark the hole for the pipe and cut it out with your jig saw slide one piece under the flange and let it drop into place do the same with the other piece and then use drywall screws to secure them to the joists and screw the flange to the new wood you are using screws so that you do not knock the cieling loose under it by hammering nails as a matter of fact you should use drywall screws to attach the support pieces as well that should have you fixed Refrigerator Manual transmission Brewery William Perry (football player) Bubble Bobble Dodge Charger Ford Thunderbird Mitsubishi 3000GT Dairy GunBound Aerial (dance move) Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway American lobster Dodge Neon Kitchen Revolver Battle of Perryville Hybrid Synergy Drive Filter (mathematics) Tofu Drill bit Poker jargon Ammonia Sonic the Hedgehog Torque Boolean prime ideal theorem Filter feeder Rum P-38 Lightning Toyota Prius Volkswagen Golf Bloom filter Air conditioning Atomic Kitten Precession Refrigeration Anchor Nintendo GameCube Refrigerator car Ford Torino Nissan Skyline De Lorean DMC-12 The Midnight Sun Volkswagen Jetta Textile manufacturing Dialysis Chess strategy and tactics Pinball Mouse (computing) Knife Super Bowl XX Floppy disk Gag (BDSM) Harp Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) Bottom (television) Spidey Super Stories Ford Mustang Ford Taurus Carburetor Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Low-pass filter Extreme Programming Piccolo Junior Saga Johnny 5 Nintendo 64 In-N-Out Burger Renault 25 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Daimler Club (weapon) Front wheel drive Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina BMW New Class Lewis Mumford Bong Chevrolet Camaro Alf Stewart EMD F7 White noise Adhesive Plough Happy Tree Friends Gas absorption refrigerator DirectShow Fordson tractor Effects unit Barbecue Diesel engine Rent (musical) Springfield 1903 rifle Bulk vending Leica Traffic light Synthesizer Hard disk Electric motor Wario
