how to stop grass coming through some gaps in the mortar of outdoor paving flagstones it's the crazy paving flagstones which surrounds my garden i blasted the crazy paving with a pressure washer a few weeks ago the area was dirty and now it's much really clean but the downside being it's removed moss around some of the paving joints which seems to have eaten in to the mortar joints to leave gaps and now grass has sprung up through those gaps i'm not exactly sure what mortar is how to use it or where to get it from or is there a better alternative that i could try to fill the gaps with please theres only a few gaps so i don't need a huge bag of mortar type stuff anyway i would use a total vegetation killer you can get it near the weed killer section at home depot just spray it in between the gaps and it should keep the grass out for months good luck Mattress Upholstery Strap-on dildo Casting Polyurethane Chair Polystyrene Radio controlled airplane Fuselage Plastic Roof Homebuilt aircraft Boat building Brassiere Plywood Rail transport modelling Pillow Climbing equipment Goaltender Personal flotation device Foam Mercury 4 Welding Model aircraft Hat Bread Hand grenade Mousepad Deck (ship) Machining Sand casting Glossary of firefighting equipment Paragliding Metalworking Skateboard Kayak Geodesic dome Dance pad Fire extinguisher Loudspeaker Formaldehyde Fire engine Dice Motorcycle helmet Nuclear weapon design Wire Lava Soap Smoking pipe Metallurgy Reinforced concrete Timber framing Detergent Textile manufacturing Tent STS-114 Aggregate (composite) Wayfarer (dinghy) Textile manufacturing terminology Tangram Tire Structural insulated panel Bed (furniture) Katamari Damacy Professional wrestling match types Wood Manicure Seismic retrofit Xanadu House Skateboarding Glossary of wildland fire terms Bicycle frame Semiconductor fabrication Applique Polikarpov I-16 Sword making Bong Taps and dies Kimono Rigging Composite material Solar cell Fire fighting Canoe Dinghy Bicycle helmet Teller-Ulam design Screw Novelty (locomotive) Fabrication (metal) The Little Mermaid Skirt and dress Thermal power station Saw Crystal oscillator Landfill Wound Pottery Handloading Cuisine of Austria
