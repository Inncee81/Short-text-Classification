ok diy question now im buying a house and long story short the guys that put the furniture in the house it comes furnished with new furniture banged the legs of tables chairs couches and everything else against the corners of the halls so these dents are like inches long and are like craters in the corners i need to know how to patch the corners and make them not craters i know it can be done but i dont know how i tried getting the seller to fix them but no luck and the seller and his buddies brought the furniture in and im absolutely not going to sue so if i buy that patch stuff how do i get it to stay the shape of the wall steps please or maybe a link to a website that shows how im not going to hire anyone the corners are straight then when you get to the dent they curve in its very unattractive and in some places they curve in and then they curve in more have you ever done anything like that there are numerous types of drywall patch mud available ranging from pre mixed to the boxes of powder you'll also need a drywall putty knife large enough to span the widest portion of the dents and finally you'll need to have sandpaper primer and paint tinted to match the wall's colour the process is relatively simple sand the paint off around and inside the dent try to get it to the exterior paper of the drywall then just scoop out a glob of mud and spread it out into the dent flip the knife over and pull upwards smoothing out the mud and collecting the excess repeat the process until you have a fairly smooth finish when it hardens wrap the sandpaper around a wooden block and sand the surface smooth use a circular motion like wax on wax off you might need to repeat the process for really deep dents or dents which have broken through the backside of the drywall then primer and paint on corners it requires a little more effort on small dents simply work one side then the other sanding and reapplying as needed to get a nice finish the problem with corners are the corner beads a thin soft paper and metal strips that are covered with drywall mud if the corner beads are really badly dented you'll need to cut out the affected section and insert a new piece most hardware stores carry corner beads they're sold in eight foot strips so one should be enough for patches once you've cut out the affacted section clean up any excess drywall slather on some mud and press the corner bead into position let it dry then apply mud over the surface on both sides sanding and reapplying as needed until the corner bead is covered by a thin finished coating of mud then primer and paint Domestic AC power plugs and sockets National Electrical Code (US) Residual-current device Electrical wiring Kitchen Electrical wiring (UK) Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets High-voltage hazards Extreme Programming The Brady Bunch Ground and neutral BS 1363 Cruising (maritime) Telephone tapping Glossary of firefighting terms Welding 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Elevator Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Distribution board Three-phase electric power McMansion Fuse (electrical) Apollo 13 Earthing system Burglar alarm Airbus A380 Spark plug Scientology beliefs and practices Transformer Insurance Knife Health insurance Thermal power station Syphon Filter Firefighter Telephone numbering plan X10 (industry standard) The Penultimate Peril Current (electricity) Antenna (radio) Internet fraud Japanese toilet Plame affair Incandescent light bulb Explosive material A Course In Miracles Split phase Seismic retrofit Space disaster Loudspeaker Switch Geodesic dome Tesla coil Tank Lawn mower Tire Lionel Corporation Light switch Oscilloscope Electric shock B-47 Stratojet National Weather Service Fire extinguisher Chatsworth House Battery (electricity) Pebble bed reactor Hamster Columbine High School massacre Passenger car Sin City Shaggy dog story Dormitory Wire Universal Serial Bus The Strangerhood Circuit design V.F.D.
