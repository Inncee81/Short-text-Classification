how do i keep my shower rod from fallind down the shower rod in my bathroom keeps falling down how do i keep it from falling down the rod has the rubber stoppers at the end and i've made sure the tile surface is dry along with the stopper but the rod fall down seconds after i put it up the rod isn't adjustable or spring loaded well if you have already tried to turn the rod and extend it ususlly this is done by twisting one section of the rod as you hold the other section firm you can also buy actual mounts that you drill into the wall they are available at most hardware stores you install them and then remove the rubber caps on the rod and place them into the slots be sure that the rod is actually a bit larger than the width between each mount if it is spring loaded it's just like a tension rod good luck Illegal drug trade Microeconomics Mortar (masonry) Diamond Digital photography Portland cement Electronic commerce Tax Poker jargon Concrete Transformer Masonry Mutual fund Supply and demand Architecture of the California missions Steel Brewery Free trade Credit card Sewage treatment Commodore 64 Tea Inflation Publicly funded medicine Monetary policy Extreme Programming Wal-Mart Hydrogen economy Seismic retrofit Bong Lighting Coffee Wind turbine Floppy disk Light-emitting diode Biodiesel MapleStory Management information system Brick Gross domestic product Bicycle lighting Diesel engine Value added tax Price discrimination Space elevator Radio controlled airplane Education in the People's Republic of China Maya civilization Bulk vending Tariff Autonomous building Economy of India Drill bit Turbocharger Pavement (material) Mattress RuneScape quests Industrial Revolution Law of value St Albans Cathedral Plastic Anchor Jet engine Theory of conduct E85 Gramophone record CPU design Solar power Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping Wood Tofu Pebble bed reactor Loudspeaker Insurance Futures contract William Murdoch Laserdisc Minimum wage Normal distribution Labor theory of value Wine Overclocking Tobacco Arbitrage Corporate finance Handloading Solar cell TransUnion Artillery Mergers and acquisitions
