am i the only one totally engrossed in the phil spector trial when the story was first reported it seemed like i was the only one who knew who he was what he did professionally and when i bring it up now people even my age and older still say 'who i think that's odd i'm just curious i think he should be convicted of criminally negligent homicide not outright murder although the prosecution hasn't rested based on their presentation i thought he was guilty of murder but after the defense presentation there's a really good chance lana clarkson played a part in her demise i agree its quite interesting what is your opinion did he do it i have mixed feeling but in some way i do think he was responsible even if it is only that he supplied the gun and probably egged her on to do it Murder Phil Spector Beltway sniper attacks Appeal Mumia Abu-Jamal Plame affair O.
