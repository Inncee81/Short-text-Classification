what do you think of this suggestion in light of all the reportings etc do you think this might work instead of having a report button or even in addition to it if yahoo wants to keep it having an auto delete this way if a troll answers your question disrespectfully poof you blast the answer right off of your question this might have some merit to it what do you think as far as removing any answer you don't like well that is up to the individual just as answering any question is up to the individual it puts more control in our hands rather than being at the mercy of whoever decides they need to put offensive material on our questions i am not talking about constructive criticism i am talking about offensive material and in any case it would be up to the owner of the question what they deem offensive i see no point in leaving answers on that simply tell people to get a life or call them a juvenile name that is not constructive criticism weatherman point taken you will always have flaws in any method you employ unfortunately sgt pepper you would be able to keep your points for answering just be deleted if your answer is rude crude or socially unacceptable and i am talking about deleting for your own questions not others of course ya listens to our suggestions this is why the site is constantly changing i do applaud them for really trying to listen and then give us what we ask for the problem is you can't please everyone and even in trying to please the masses there are those that always find ways to make the new features have some sort of negative form like your suggestion i think most of us would use that only to delete the offensive stuff but there are definitely going to be those that will take an amazing answer and delete it out of jealousy or competition or some reason that would never be understood i like the suggestion above that takes your idea and perhaps gives that out as a reward earned at upper levels once people have learned to appreciate the time and effort put into asking and answering on the site it would be a great incentive perhaps i think i would trust level and people to do the right thing heck it might even be a deterant to others to misbehave who knows it's always hard to tell with such a large and varied population such as this nice thinking Internet troll Socrates Extreme Programming Ethics Philosophy of language SAT Expert system Capital punishment Little Britain Scientology beliefs and practices GED Free will Current teachings of Prem Rawat Second language acquisition Capitalism B3ta Sexual orientation Simone Weil Altruism Evil Externality Avenue Q National Certificate of Educational Achievement Human Past teachings of Prem Rawat Aikido Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Goodness and value theory Determinism Infantilism Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Economics Corporate governance Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Deconstruction Atheism Epistemology Noam Chomsky David Hume Scientific method Labour economics Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Plame affair Shit Transactional analysis Philosophy of space and time Social psychology Stopping e-mail abuse The Apprentice 2 Religion Presuppositional apologetics God Emperor of Dune Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Classified information Singlish Problem of universals Originalism Infant baptism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Consensus decision-making Soul Prices of production Metaphysics Immanuel Kant Unemployment Strategic management Independent Media Center Ontological argument Intelligent design movement Euphemism Everything2 Forum moderator Computer virus Wealth W.
