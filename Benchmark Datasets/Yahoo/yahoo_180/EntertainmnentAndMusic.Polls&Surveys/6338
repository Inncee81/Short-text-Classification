when does being nice turn into being too nice aside from letting others take advantage of you that's the obvious what i'm saying is can you ever be too nice of a person if so where do you draw the line as to where you consider nice to become too nice do you consider someone who is loving and friendly by nature to be too nice do you enjoy people like this if it is genuine of course or do you enjoy people who have a bit of a malicious side which type of person do you more prefer to be around no kakity i'm not asking this to try to figure out how to get more people to like me this is not personal i am simply trying to get others opinions on the subject i hear all the time that people dislike people who are catty and selfish yet when you look around it is the truly nice people who usually seem to be the most overlooked and the least popular it is always better to be nice but don't be a push over nobody wants to hang out with someone that agrees with everyone and everything be a nice person but have your own opinions and views Theory of conduct Altruism Alignment (role-playing games) Humphrey Bogart Consensus decision-making Evil Bon Jovi Social contract Revolutionary Girl Utena The Pet Sounds Sessions Internet troll Freemasonry On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Lie Expert system Slashdot subculture Reality A Course In Miracles Guadalupe Mountains National Park Kim Possible Cheating in poker Sant Thakar Singh Big Brother UK series 6 Transactional analysis Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Roxette Avenue Q Election Gross domestic product Kitsch The Fast Show Sexual orientation Aerial (dance move) Narrator The Beach Boys Objectivist philosophy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Amateur astronomy Suicide Social rule Drag racing Communication skill Democracy Political correctness The Apprentice 2 Mandelbrot set Human sexual behavior Philipp Melanchthon Bondage (BDSM) Audiophile Physical attractiveness School of Salamanca Pet Sounds Nice Maison Ikkoku Microeconomics French Defence Slander and libel Hearing impairment Prisoner's dilemma Skiing Rangers F.C.
