were your days more busy and stressful when you were studying full time or when you were working full time i'm in college right now and i'm very busy with tests and papers due in i'm just wondering if i'll be even busier after i finish if possible but don't feel obliged could you let me know your level of education and your current job thanks definitely busier and probably more stressful when studying in my final years i had to be in uni from a m to p m days a week and worked part time evenings a week the rest of my time was spent studying and writing essays etc social life was non existent then i think it depends what type of work you eventually find yourself doing i have two jobs now one where i go to work do my job and then that's it don't have to worry about it once i get home my other job does however require quite a lot of reading up and also writing summaries reports part of the stress of studying involved the degree of competitiveness between students i found that really unnecessary and very stressful there's none of that anymore plus all the pressure you put on yourself constant tests and essays to write i think you'll find there are occasions in the working year obviously depending on what kind of job you take where you are required to do some sort of appraisals research etc but it won't be as often as what you are experiencing now remember one of the bonuses of working is that you actually get paid for what you do that'll put a smile on your bank managers face good luck with the tests Graduate school Unemployment GED Extreme Programming Social rule Infantilism Education in the People's Republic of China SAT Aikido Academia Master's degree Education in Germany Quizbowl Education in Portugal Human adaptation to space IB Diploma Programme John Peel A-level Clinical depression Hikikomori Welding Corporate governance Abortion Labor theory of value Physician Education in Romania Sumo The Origin of Species Wal-Mart Efficiency wages Economic inequality Avenue Q Tai Chi Chuan Bernard Williams Prostate cancer Education in Japan Junior Certificate Air traffic controller Wheel of Fortune Urinary incontinence Principal-agent problem Stress (medicine) Juris Doctor Test (student assessment) Leo Strauss Librarian Kindergarten Nuclear power American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) New Deal Philosophical skepticism FairTax The Citadel (Military College) Offshoring Centrelink Slot machine Carl Jung Theory of conduct College Billboard Hot 100 Capital accumulation Cliff Richard Scientology beliefs and practices Wind turbine Credit card Freeters Stuttering Second language acquisition New York Giants Charter school Psychology Liang Qichao Public Eye Tour de France Transactional analysis The Contender (television series) The Amazing Race Inflation Mortgage Great Depression Statistics Socrates University of Houston Game tester Indian Oil Cup 2005 Copyleft Economics Social Security (United States) Education in Australia Kyoto Protocol Stephen Jay Gould Post-traumatic stress disorder Competition Professor Galactic Civilizations
