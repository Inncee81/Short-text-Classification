when you meet new people is there a question you ask them to find out if they are good people or not do you have kids not that having kids is the thing that i'm looking for it's their reaction to the topic of kids if they pull out the wallet and start showing their pride well you know they adore their kids and are probably good active parents if they roll their eyes and say yes which is why i have no time to do anything i kind of put a red flag and kind of wait to see if this is just a particularly rough day or if they are resentful that having kids has taken away their me time but those that pull out their hair and run screaming for the hills at the mention of children well sure that pretty much gives me an answer lol Kodocha Ben Johnson (athlete) Good Times Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Rich Mullins About a Boy Shaggy dog story Sampling (music) Pure Pwnage Kender Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Have I Got News For You Sam Kinison Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tom and Jerry (MGM) Kimi Finster The Fairly OddParents The Marshall Mathers LP Garfield Silent Night, Deadly Night Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Prank flash AFI 100 Years series Koopa Kid Kid Buu Saga Kid (Chrono Cross) Biff Tannen Milton H.
