what about the students who leave there family and go abroad to study homesick and new language you dont know it we have had of those lol and it happened to me to when i joined the military and served in germany at least the homesick part to a point the best advice on the language is to use it stay away from english as much as possible which means staying away from the computer esp chatting and skype and staying off the phone besides you'll make more friends out doing things than back in your room on the computer which brings me to the homesickness thing you will get homesick no way around it but the key is to tell someone you're homesick just don't suffer in silence then get out and get busy go to a new museum go walk around a new part of town go to a different restaurant take a train ride but busy is the only cure do not succumb to the temptation to call home because you're homesick that will make things worse Square Enix Enix Nintendo Fan translation Tokyo Computer role-playing game Square Co., Ltd.
