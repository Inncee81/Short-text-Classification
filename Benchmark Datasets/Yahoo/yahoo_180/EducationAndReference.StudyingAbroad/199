if you don't know italian can you go there to study abroad and what language are there classes yes absolutely it depends on the school you go to while you're there but you should be able to take classes in english with no problem at all it's probably a good idea to learn some italian to make sure you can get around and communicate with people usually when you study abroad your college cooperates with a college in that country and you set up everything through the college you already go to does your school have a study abroad program of its own or does it at least have a study abroad office if not you might be able to study abroad with another college as long as you talk to all the necessary people and make sure your credits will transfer sometimes grants and scholarships can transfer too to help pay for the school in italy look around online for study abroad programs i haven't studied abroad so i can't tell you everything you need to know but i was trying to study abroad last year so i went to informational meetings picked up brochures talked to study abroad counselors etc Visa (document) H-1B visa Immigration to the United States Indian nationality law Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Education in Japan Charter school Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Culture of the United States Filipino American Illegal immigration Education in the United States Chinese Canadian North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Naturalization NHH Columbia University Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Citizenship Education in Portugal Lynbrook High School Education in Germany Rockford, Illinois University of Santo Tomas Rosa Parks Status of religious freedom in Sudan Filipinos in Hong Kong University of North Carolina at Charlotte Pennsylvania State University Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (sitcom) Asian American University of Central Florida University of Maryland, College Park American University University of Hawaii at Manoa Ohio Wesleyan University Brown v.
