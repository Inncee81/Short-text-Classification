what service restaurants offer flexible schedules i have all this experience from years of working in the restaurant industry but it all goes to waste because i can generally only work part time and nights for college of the places i go to expect me to work full time with or days a week with double shifts or work only lunch hours since the management was inept and only hired dinner staff now i'm just generally getting sick of all this and only want to work part time on my terms what restaurant chains generally allow part time work and flexible schedules i work for chili's and we are pretty good about that considering that most of our staff is in college most managers want you to be worth their while which is probably shifts a week if a restaurant is wanting you to work that much they must be understaffed and you probably don't want to work there anyway as they will put added pressure on you remember you have to be worth the time the job invests in you training managing schedules you getting good at the job only shifts a week etc is expensive Wal-Mart Call centre Restaurant Education in the People's Republic of China Inflation DisneySpeak Air traffic controller Hamburger In-N-Out Burger Working time Outsourcing Tip Graduate school Keynesian economics The Apprentice 2 International League Battle of Britain Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd Walt Disney World College Program Labor theory of value Electronic commerce Eric Bischoff Steak n Shake Social rule National Football League Monday Night Football Paralegal Time Out of Mind Professor Cincinnati chili History of SNL:1980-1985 Denny's Game programming ITV VIA Rail Supply and demand United Kingdom corporation tax Dialysis The Devil Wears Prada Nuclear power Norway national football team Publicly funded medicine Mach kernel Wall Street Life insurance Diseconomies of scale Management information system Daylight saving time Baseball Make money fast Warren Buffett Ra (board game) McDonald's Hash table STS-59 Labor-power Tertiary sector of industry Microeconomics Red Hot Chili Peppers Freeters Simutronics Charles Ponzi WNNX (FM) MV Galaxy Just In Time Alex Ferguson Public house Big Brother UK series 6 TLC Employment in Hong Kong MTV2 Super Chief James J.
