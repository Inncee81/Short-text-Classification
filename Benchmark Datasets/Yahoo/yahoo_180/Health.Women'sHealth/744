i lost my period recently i'm fifteen and i was around pounds after having a tonsillectomy i lost pounds and am now i have been eating normally for around a week i couldn't for about two weeks after my surgery because it was so painful and i had a risk of hemorrhaging my period should have come during my first week of recovery to be honest i didn't expect it to because of all the stress my body was going through but i did expect it to come a week or so ago it's almost three weeks late and i'm starting to get worried your period is late as a result of the anethesia and medications they use to put you asleep during surgery this is totally normal you skin may break out worse this month and your skin may be drier than it usually is unless you have had unprotected sex in the last month you are fine your period could come at any time now good luck and hope your throat feels better Radiation therapy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Stroke Prostate cancer Stomach cancer Childbirth Tonsillectomy Adjustable gastric band Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Penis Group A streptococcal infection Acne Psoriasis Dialysis Coeliac disease Human adaptation to space Androgen insensitivity syndrome Neighbours Intersex surgery Social rule Transsexuality Multiple sclerosis Pneumonia Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Lung cancer AIDS Babe Ruth Fecal incontinence Female genital cutting Malignant melanoma Insulin Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome The Contender (television series) Medicine Abortion Aortic dissection Scar Acupuncture Animal testing Medical analysis of circumcision Carpal tunnel syndrome Continuation War Paget's disease of bone Stuttering Spina bifida Cocaine Days of our Lives Pregnancy Piccolo Junior Saga Esophageal cancer Shaggy dog story Oral sex Marathon (sport) Dieting Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Knife Osteoarthritis Phoebe Halliwell 2000 Australian Grand Prix Crohn's disease Diabetic retinopathy Endometriosis Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Cephalic disorder Anorexia nervosa History of intersex surgery Lupus erythematosus Super Size Me Milton H.
