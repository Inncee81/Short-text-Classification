i almost want to be i kind of want to be anorexic i know i really shouldnt its a disease but i admire them because of the amount of control they have on their life ive tried restricting soooooooooo many times but im such a faiilure i wish i could lose lbs by being in control im just a fat failure ' lb s butt ive been trying to lose weight for twoo years i started at i dont know what to doo i keep failingg help you aren't fat try being ' and pounds it isn't pretty although having abnormally large breasts by genetics is part of the reason and plus i really am big boned my doctor even said so so anyway stop thinking crazy either figure out a diet that works or find a way to be happy with your thin self never try a diet that doesn't allow a little wiggle room the jello commercial is right every diet needs a little wiggle room you need to be able to eat a small piece of chocolate cake once a month if you really want to you need to allow yourself to have that one glass of soda when you go out with friends every so often the key is balance balance healthy habits with small treats and it will all work out if i don't get to have a piece of candy once a week i wouldn't be able to stick to my diet oh and make an eating plan trust me it helps but don't starve yourself you will end up looking even uglier than you already think you do those who are anorexic have many more problems than just being underweight their insides are all screwed up it takes years to be well again their nails and teeth and hair start to yellow and get brown and icky and fall out because they aren't eating their skin just droops on their fragile bones and they are more susceptible to disease please don't do that to yourself just give your diet some wiggle room and everything will work itself out if you eat properly your body will find it's ideal weight on its own as long as you nourish yourself your body will not let you become under or over weight you will remain in perfect harmony with yourself no matter what the scale says Anorexia nervosa Prostate cancer Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hamster Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Fancy rat Tooth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chocolate Equine conformation Guinea pig Adjustable gastric band Dog Diabetes mellitus Garfield Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Binge eating disorder Domestic rabbit Nutrition Bread Insulin Tocopherol Vitamin C Breastfeeding Kodocha Coeliac disease Vegetarianism Low-carbohydrate diet Homer Simpson Milk Puberty Super Size Me Hypoglycemia Folic acid Raw food diet The Time Machine Tooth enamel Stem cell Cat Sealab 2021 Happy Tree Friends Crohn's disease Androgen insensitivity syndrome Kenny McCormick Phoebe Buffay's songs Weight training Decompression sickness South Beach diet Hypertension Tasmanian Devil Protein-energy malnutrition Chicken Anemia The Ashlee Simpson Show Ron and Fez Elephant Medicine Chronic fatigue syndrome Shark Cephalic disorder Nine Inch Nails Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Dualism (philosophy of mind) Pterosaur Matt Hardy Brain Snake Knife Timeline of alternative rock Coffee Bat Cystic fibrosis Weighing scale Veganism Dragon Booster RuneScape quests Growth hormone treatment Carburetor Alzheimer's disease Weight loss Codename: Kids Next Door Multiple sclerosis Megan Griffin Friends Protein Drill bit Sperm Whale
