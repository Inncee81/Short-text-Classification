my wife is embarrassed about cunnilingus ladies only ladies i have an extreme desire to please my wife orally but she is very hesitant about me doing that for her she is embarrassed by it for some reason what i tell her over and over again is how much i want to do that for her it really does turn me on to please her that way but she doesn't want to relax and enjoy it any suggestions what can i do when you're doing something that scares you it's always nice to take small steps into the unknown and have familiar things around to keep you calm so when she actually lets you do it try to keep things as normal as posible there's two things to deal with one is completely mental she probably thinks it's a gross place to put your face and doesn't understand why you want to do it i don't know how your wife thinks or what kind of logic would work well on her but in the end you probably won't win her over with just words you just need to wear her down enough that she lets you try it so that you'll shut up about it then she'll realize what she's been missing so just keep on asking maybe try telling her not to think about you just herself definitly say that there's no pressure for her to climax like someone else said that's a good suggestion the second thing is physical she might also be nervous just because it's something she's never felt before if she's used to your finger start off with your finger then use a little tounge then go back to your finger it's definitely a new feeling and she won't know at first what works for her and what doesn't and that will make it hard for her to simply lay back and relax since she'll be paying attention to the new sensations and personally since i'm very clingy i didn't like that i didn't have anything to hold onto i mean this all depends on your position but now he puts his arm where i can reach so i can touch him or hold his hand or dig in when it gets good ps guys like you are awesome Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Oral sex Aerial (dance move) Cyberspace Milton H.
