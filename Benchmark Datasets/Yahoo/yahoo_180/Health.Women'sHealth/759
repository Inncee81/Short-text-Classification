this is really embarrassing but any girls know any treatment for an ongoing yeast infection ive tried diflucan and some o t c meds ive also been tested for any other infeections and came back negative kindof odd and might sound crazy but this works get some plain yogurt and coat the outer portion of a tampon with it the yogurt has active cultures that will balance out the cultures that are acting up i know it sounds gross but the yogurt will be soothing and will be easily inserted with a tampon dont leave the tampon in too long just for minutes at a time repeat with a new tampon as needed you dont need gobs of yogurt just enough to coat it if you would feel better do it at night before you go to bed and wear a pad while you sleep that way you will be laying down and it will be able to work itself out Tampon Menstrual cup Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Sanitary towel Candidiasis Yoghurt Mattress Toxic shock syndrome Gastroesophageal reflux disease Athlete's foot Group A streptococcal infection Chronic fatigue syndrome Sleep apnea Traumatic brain injury Clostridium difficile Malaria Prostate cancer Dairy Atomic Kitten Sewage treatment Apollo 8 Vulvovaginal health Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lactose intolerance Lactobacillus acidophilus Undergrads Gramophone record Fecal incontinence Spaceballs Brewery Drowning Flatulence Pet skunk Strap-on dildo Socrates Herpes simplex virus Palindrome Trance music Sexual intercourse Waylon Jennings Shawn Michaels Coeliac disease Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Manicure Common cold Charles Ives Immunosuppressive drug Anne Boleyn Multiple sclerosis Chagas disease Stuttering Dialysis Dyslexia Gram staining Episodes of Lost (Season 1) AIDS Kit Kat Balance disorder Fancy rat Casting Folic acid RAS syndrome Patrick Star Intravenous therapy Singlish Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Characters in the Smurfs Narcolepsy Oral sex Cliff Richard Family Guy Angioplasty Pneumonia Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Late Night with Conan O'Brien Psoriasis Polymerase chain reaction The Amazing Race Guinea pig Binary numeral system Medicine Comanche Epilepsy Shaggy dog story Rabies Sleep debt Hemp One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Bacteria Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Medical analysis of circumcision Infectious mononucleosis Pedophilia Child sexuality Virgin Crohn's disease Pitaten Hypertension
