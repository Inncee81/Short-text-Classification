menstrual migrains my doctor says that the awful headaches i get every month during my period are called mentrual migrains i cannot find anything to make them go away or even ease up does anyone else have these what are some ways that you treat them i get them i use aleve which takes the edge off but i know what you mean about them not going away i am on birth control and i know that the headaches where not this bad when i wasn't on them so it is obiously a hormonal issue i guess that if you can figure out what is going on with you hormonally during that time you are closer to figuring out what is going to help you avoid tylenol for headaches use it only in a last resort and understand it may not work or may make the headache fade and comeback stronger also if you take aleve or ibuprofin the moment you feel like you are going to have a headache you have a better chance of having it turn into a migraine also i know it is a taboo topic to discuss but monitor your bowel movements and see if your headaches are related to being constipated at some point during that time as strange as that sounds needed to go number two and not going can cause headaches Migraine Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Cluster headache Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chronic fatigue syndrome Oral contraceptive Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Endometriosis Fecal incontinence Pregnancy Fertility awareness Tension headache Clinical depression Hal Trosky Emergency contraception Menstrual cup Epilepsy Prolactinoma Multiple chemical sensitivity Traumatic brain injury Headache Growth hormone treatment Chlorpromazine Opioid Obstetrics Psoriasis Ben Johnson (athlete) Hypertension Theory of conduct Constipation Hypoglycemia Medical prescription Stomach cancer Naproxen Growth hormone Acne Lamotrigine Abortion Syringomyelia Sailing Depo Provera Homosexuality and transgender Bad Wolf Propranolol Aspartame Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fibromyalgia Humphrey Bogart Anabolic steroid Aloe Yarrow Clomipramine Birth control Social rule Pitaten Breastfeeding Lou Gehrig Topiramate Valproic acid Folic acid Neurology Tyramine Breast cancer Biofeedback Reflexology Coeliac disease Transsexuality The Battle (TNG episode) Sigmund Freud Endocrinology Citalopram Cannabis (drug) Craps Essential oil Paget's disease of bone G-Man (Half-Life) Multiple sclerosis Growth hormone deficiency Group A streptococcal infection Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Crohn's disease Chronic pain Password Aspirin Acromegaly Classical music era Cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Medical cannabis Pharmacology Carpal tunnel syndrome Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Miscarriage Cryptorchidism Drowning
