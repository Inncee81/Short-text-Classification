girls only pleez plz dont laff no rude jokes either im just curious thx if u have anal sex can u get pregnant or get aids no pregnancy risk with anal sex but the risk of transmission of the hiv virus that causes aids is higher with anal this is because during anal sex the friction and mechanics of the act itself causes small cuts and tears in the anal tissue giving the virus an ideal portal for entry into the body although the risk of transmission is lessened by wearing a condom it is not taken away completely a condom provides safer sex not safest sex a condom is around percent effective in preventing pregnancy believe me the hiv virus is thousands of times smaller than a sperm cell in any case if you are considering anal sex please make sure that you do use condoms just like pregnancy the only way not to get aids is to abstain from sex until you are ready for a lifetime commitment make sure that you are both tested as negative and then stay faithful to your partner Safe sex Oral sex HIV AIDS Condom Herpes simplex virus Anal sex Pornographic movie Crystal methamphetamine and sex Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Birth control Sexual intercourse Human sexual behavior Sexually-transmitted infection Gonorrhoea Sex education Sexual abstinence Cytomegalovirus AIDS in Africa Methamphetamine Genital wart Medical analysis of circumcision HIV test Barebacking Human papillomavirus Gay bathhouse Unsafe sexual practices Rape HIV vaccine Masturbation Prostate cancer Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Anal masturbation Timeline of AIDS Fertility awareness Sex toy Nonoxynol-9 Strap-on dildo Emergency contraception Harm reduction In vitro fertilisation Turner syndrome Androgen insensitivity syndrome AIDS reappraisal Transmission (medicine) Duesberg hypothesis Earring Prenatal diagnosis Radiation therapy Common cold Butt plug Tuberculosis Pelvic inflammatory disease Hepatitis B Kaposi's sarcoma Abortion Breastfeeding Circumcision Pornographic actor Antiretroviral drug Multiple sclerosis AIDS in the United States Cancer Oral contraceptive Cephalic disorder Orgy Vaccine Proper Condom Use OPV AIDS hypothesis Antiviral drug Rabies American Red Cross Toxoplasmosis Fecal incontinence Child sexual abuse Old wives' tale Monogamy Coeliac disease Diabetes mellitus Body piercing Puberty HIV structure and genome Abortion debate Gay slang Psoriasis Child sexuality Personal lubricant Folic acid Anus Miscarriage Foodborne illness Human sexuality Prostitution
