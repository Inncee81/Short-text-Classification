diagnosis hirsutism or just plain hairy i'm wondering if i may have hirsutism or an excess of andorgens some kind of hormonal problem i've always been hairy but lately i'm noticing that it's getting a little bit worse in certain areas and peach fuzz on my face is getting darker however i have always had very regular periods once a month and i'm not obese i have started to get acne lately at years old am i just going through some weird late growth spurt but nothing else is really growing haha i never had acne earlier in life so i think i'm just getting it now i don't necessarily think the two are linked but i thought it was worth mentioning and i'm of middle eastern descent i guess my basic question is what's the difference between having hirsutism and being just plain hairy i think i'm the latter because i don't have any other medical symptoms of hirustism and i know middle eastern women tend to be more hairy it's something i can deal with but i'm just curious about the diagnosis of hirsutism hi i think middle eastern girls have the best hair not to forget skin but about your question hirsutism is the masculine distribution of hair but associated are also male characteristics if you havent grown a beard and a deep voice i think you have nothing to worry about girl theres a physiological change in your body since your all your hormones are outta wack it will take some time for em to stablize dont worry about the facial peach fuzz usually it will receed and its normal to have a lil fuzz for the acne you could consult your doctor for a cream with tretonin it has excellent results also makes your skin tighter i prescribe that most of the time and its awesome it may make your skin photosenstive so stay outta the sun but since your brown its a white kids problem haha basically dont stress much luv take care Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome Acne Prostate cancer Testosterone Transsexuality Baldness Growth hormone deficiency Endometriosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Urinary incontinence Hypertrichosis Growth hormone treatment Cancer Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.
