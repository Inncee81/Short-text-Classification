period hello hi i'm and i haven't gotton my period yet all of my friends have by now i was wondering if weight might be an issue i weigh and am ' thanks its totally normal not to have started yet yes weight might be an issue but don't worry you'll probably get it a little later than your friends a lot of things can make you start late but don't worry i started at if you don't start by gain some weight and if that dosen't work then ask your mom if you don't eat beef then you might start much later because of the horomones added to meat just remember that you can get slimy down there before your period so if you get that than keep some pads with you just in case find out from your mom when she started and when she got boobs don't worry Social rule Hamburger Treehouse of Horror V Piccolo Junior Saga Binge eating disorder Computer numbering formats Pok__mon Live!
