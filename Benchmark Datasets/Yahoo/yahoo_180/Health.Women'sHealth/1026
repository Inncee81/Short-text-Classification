my period is over but when i wipe i have bit of blood is that normal im only on my rd period this period was my first heavy one all my others were really light and i ended mine last night for sure because i didnt have any blood at the end of the day or at night or in the morning its just when i wip i have goops of blood on the toilet paper yes it is normal for you to have blood when you wipe after you think you are finished bleeding since this is only your rd period and the first two were different you should not worry about being normal or not normal until you have had several more and then see what your body is telling you is going to be normal for you everyone is different with their period even though we are almost all the same everyone's body is different and there are also things like stress and diet and how much exercise you get that will also cause you to have a heavy or light period i always made sure i wore a pantyliner for maybe a day or two after i thought i had finished just to make sure there wasn't anything else to come out since your period is the shedding of the lining then it is ok for there to be something to come out only when you wipe it may also be different in color while sometimes it may be bright red there may be times it is only a dirty brown color good luck and if you want to talk more or ask something else feel free to e mail me congratulations on becoming a woman Menstrual cycle Menstrual cup Social rule Urinary incontinence Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pitaten Vampire Knife Blood pressure Discus (fish) Blood Weight training The Ashlee Simpson Show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tour de France Anemia Anxiety EastEnders Shit First aid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cat Color Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cancer Milton H.
