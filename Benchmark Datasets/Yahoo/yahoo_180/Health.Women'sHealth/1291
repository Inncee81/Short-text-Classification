simple question about birth control pills i've been taking birth control pills ortho tricyclen lo for the past months to protect against pregnancy however my boyfriend is abroad for the next months so i don't think i really need to take them until he comes back do you agree because it's a bit expensive and isn't fully covered in my insurance however i have a bunch of refills left so i was planning to retake them about a month or so before he comes home i know that it regulates periods and such but my period is regular even w out taking the pill let me know what you think thank you you should be continually taking it when you stop and then start back up it will be like starting it all over again and could screw your schedule up even though you were regular before you got on the pill you are on it now and stopping it may end up not having your periods regular i wouldn't chance it keep taking them Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Knots Landing Friends Menstrual cycle Birth control Indianapolis 500 EastEnders Neighbours Kodocha Abortion debate Pregnancy Insurance Life insurance Apollo 8 Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Endometriosis Depo Provera Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Childbirth Tocopherol Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Tire Medical prescription Hillary Rodham Clinton Charmed Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diving cylinder Indian nationality law English verbs Spina bifida Health insurance Intrauterine device Oslo Accords Democratic Party (United States) Tag Drug test Satchel Paige CPU design Pink (musician) Green Party of Canada The Inside The Riordans Vernon Schillinger Items in the Metroid series The O.C.
