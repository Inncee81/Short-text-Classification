why do you have to start birth control the sunday after your period would it really make a difference if it was like the tuesday after do you still have to be on your period or what help please i'm not using it for contraceptive just to help with my period so i'm not looking for its effectiveness in the pregnancy department but if i start the pills tonight then i have my period the first week of school so i was just wondering if i could start it next week or so starting on the first sunday after the start of your period means that you aren't likely to be pregnant when you start taking it and it means that your next period will start at about the same time of the month that it would have started normally the pills are timed so that your period will always fall during the week keeping your weekends period free my pills actually start on a saturday and my period will start on monday afternoon and is gone by thursday or friday you could delay starting it for a week if you aren't sexually active it just means that you would have a slightly longer wait for your next period you'd get it when you have the sugar pills Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Emergency contraception Birth control Week Fertility awareness Sunday Hebrew calendar Easter Monday Gregorian calendar National Football League Fasting Monday Night Football Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Depo Provera Thursday Holy Week Saturday Weekend MTV2 Daylight saving time Friday Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Acne Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Tocopherol Folic acid Tuesday Abortion debate Sexual abstinence Doomsday rule Days of the week Good Friday Major League Baseball television contracts CBC Radio One Endometriosis Sex education Intrauterine device Sunday shopping Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Psoriasis EastEnders UK Singles Chart Carnival Saturday Night Live Irish calendar WQHT (FM) Velvet Revolution Bob Harris (radio) Wednesday Lent Northern Ireland peace process Friday the 13th Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Teenage pregnancy Back to the Future timeline Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Paschal cycle Day STS-59 Johnnie Walker (DJ) Hurricane Katrina timeline Urinary incontinence ISO 8601 Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Jewish holiday Apollo 8 New Orleans Mardi Gras Operation Market Garden Ocean's Twelve Astrology Ron and Fez Priesthood Correlation Program August 2005 in Britain and Ireland BBC Radio 2 Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Breastfeeding Miscarriage September 2005 in Malaysia and Singapore Computus Holiday Fathers' rights movement in the UK Formula One racing KCMP Hypertension Coronation Street Channel 4 Harrow School Sexual intercourse September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for September The Disney Afternoon Shavuot History of sex BBC television drama
