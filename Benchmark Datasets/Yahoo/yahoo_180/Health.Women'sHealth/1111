new birth control or anti depressent okay i've been taking ortho tri cyclen for years now and just recently within the last months i've been really depressed it's almost an empty feeling like i have no feeling not really happy or sad just nothing feelings come and go i do have some feelings i can cry at just about anything a majority of the time i'm just empty everything in my life is great should i think about trying a different kind of bc ortho tri cyclen is the only kind i've been on or should i go talk to the doctor about anti depressents i think that if you have been on ortho tri cyclen for years and you're just now experiencing symptoms of depression it's probably from something totally unrelated however i am on ortho tri cyclen lo which is the low dose version that is still just as effective but contains less progesterone and it seems to ease my mild pms symptoms like mood swings and rage that i used to experience more when i was on the regular ortho tri cyclen i have heard that birth control pills can suddenly just cause side effects they never caused before like i once started to experience a noticeably lower sex drive with a pill i'd been taking for about years nowadays i just switch them up every or years it seems to work try switching your pill first and if that doesn't help you might need some anti depressants Oral contraceptive Bipolar disorder Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Antidepressant Borderline personality disorder Birth control Endometriosis Emergency contraception Fertility awareness Maprotiline Hypoglycemia Methamphetamine Seasonal affective disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Migraine Premenstrual stress syndrome Multiple sclerosis Folic acid Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fluoxetine Psoriasis Haloperidol Bupropion Chlorpromazine Breastfeeding Psychosis Childbirth Diazepam Transsexuality Postpartum depression Isotretinoin Coffee Depo Provera Tocopherol Tris Speaker Antiretroviral drug Caffeine Sedative Ty Cobb Opioid Antipsychotic Taxi Driver Adult attention-deficit disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Post-traumatic stress disorder Anxiety Obstetrics Cannabis (drug) Hypertension Narcolepsy Progesterone Abortion debate Anorexia nervosa Addiction Placebo Homeopathy St John's wort Traumatic brain injury Spina bifida Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Babe Ruth Schizophrenia Malaria Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Atherosclerosis Asthma Progesterone only pill Kender Empathy Herpes simplex virus Withdrawal Radiation poisoning Osteoarthritis Happiness Narcissism Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Hyperthermia Inflation Buprenorphine Sleep Traumatic incident reduction Fibromyalgia Doxepin Alzheimer's disease Pitaten LSD Breast cancer Kodocha Human adaptation to space Propranolol Psychopharmacology Puberty Electroconvulsive therapy
