im but i think youngsters like me have gone to far have we okaii so this is not a question related to me just scared for highschool really dont have to stick my foot down peoples mouthes but anyway i think year olds like me have now gone way to far i read other peoples questions and its true that year old girls and guys are pressured into having sex really if you have a boyfriend you might get pressured into sex i cant believe that you should wait till your ready buit i dont know having sex at is the new styl e which i will never follow i hope i dont have to deal with that when i head on to highschool but what do you think about this sex pressure thing at a young age no i was seeing what people taught id be real stupid to have sex while in high school hello waiting for maybe till im ready you know im i noticed that too my senior year of high school i had a few boys who were about your age who followed me around 'cause they thought i was cool or whatever and two of them told me they had lost their virginity at about i was shocked i didn't have my first boyfriend until i was and i was still a virgin i was stunned until i got to know one of them better he had joined the drama club and we hung out and he began hanging out with all my friends it wasn't because we thought aww cute kid we can play babysitter it was because he acted like he was and not a kid pretending to be a year old either he was mature and he talked about sex he talked about respecting people how he won't do it with girls who don't want it talking about using protection all of that stuff long story short some people your age aren't ready and i don't think that people should put pressure on kids to do that when they're not ready especially because once i got to college i found out alot of people are virgins but there are some kids your age who are mature and responsible they understand the consequences of sex they understand how to use protection and they don't force it on others my opinion is that if people are mature enough and maturity is not necessarily directly linked with age go ahead if you're not wait and there shouldn't be any pressure i am glad you made the choice to wait One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct The Catcher in the Rye Shaggy dog story Jennifer Lopez Kodocha Little Britain EastEnders Social rule The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Kylie Minogue Singlish Teen Girl Squad Sex and the City Can't Hardly Wait Jon Secada Too Short a Season (TNG episode) About a Boy St. Elmo's Fire (film) Undergrads The Inside The Fairly OddParents Ed, Edd n Eddy The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) God Emperor of Dune The Subtle Knife Dawson's Creek Child French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Megan Griffin Plame affair Sharon Tate Sin City The Lovely Bones Survivor (novel) Theodicy Pitaten Recurring South Park characters Laura Schlessinger The Ashlee Simpson Show Paul Is Dead Great Teacher Onizuka Stewie Griffin AFI 100 Years series Infantilism The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Characters in Bleach series Beetle in an Anthill StarCraft: Uprising Eric Cartman Radiohead Everwood Rich Mullins Timmy Turner Springfield Elementary School Marilyn Monroe She Loves You Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Child pornography Pop punk The League of Gentlemen (comedy) The Marshall Mathers LP Salad Fingers Sydney Riot of 1879 Vegeta America's Next Top Model Big Brother (USA TV series) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Blood on the Tracks Motion picture rating system Sex Pistols Something Positive Okashina Okashi Smallville (Season 4) Hip hop rivalries Sexual abstinence Rod Stewart George Costanza Jumpstart 3rd Grade Coming of Age (TNG episode) Simone Weil Boston Public KaBlam!
