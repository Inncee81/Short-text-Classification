pap smear tests while doing a pap test does the doctor test for hpv my last pap smear came back normal my question is if my test came back normal could i still have hpv normally an initial pap smear is just to see if there are abnormal cells when it does come back abnormal they usually do another one to see if it is hpv or something else they may be able to tell from the first sample whether or not you have it but usually they do it if you have an abnormal sample it's this is a very slim to none chance btw possible that you can have hpv but it's not likely since it came back normal of course when you go again next year you could have contracted hpv so make sure to always use condoms with your partner as you usually get it from males because they're carriers for it of course it can be passed down from your mom but more likely than not it came from a guy so congrats you most likely don't have hpv Cervical cancer Human papillomavirus Cancer Genital wart Medical analysis of circumcision Herpes simplex virus Prostate cancer Colposcopy Endometrial cancer Obstetrics Sickle-cell disease Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Gynaecology Complete blood count Sexually-transmitted infection Circumcision Gonorrhoea Prenatal diagnosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tag Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Anemia Metastasis Infertility Condom Malaria Oral sex Blood film Cystic fibrosis Apoptosis Medical laboratory Cytogenetics Histology Mesothelioma Huntington's disease Hemolytic anemia Duchenne muscular dystrophy Lumbar puncture Color blindness Inclusion body myositis Thalassemia AIDS reappraisal Urinary incontinence Ovarian cancer Coagulation Cryptorchidism Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Staining (biology) Acne Cardiac stress test Lymphocyte Intelligence quotient Turner syndrome Hypoglycemia Pat Smear Medical test Vulvovaginal health Penile cancer In vitro fertilisation Safe sex Normal distribution Puberty Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Haemochromatosis Leukemia Lupus erythematosus Multiple sclerosis Cephalic disorder Pneumonia Acute myelogenous leukemia Cardiac arrhythmia Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Atheroma Autism Cancer of the larynx Iris (anatomy) History of Singapore Genetic disorder Kidney Rabies Plasmodium falciparum IgA nephropathy Cervix AIDS Breech birth Chromosome Anal sex Genetic fingerprinting Pedophilia Intersex surgery Bipolar disorder Electrocardiogram Gaucher's disease Down syndrome Kurt Cobain Intersexuality Fecal incontinence
