ovarian cysts i was just wondering whether you can still get ovarian cysts even if you're on using the birth control pill as far as i'm aware you don't ovulate while taking the pill but if you missed pills due to sickness it could possibly make you ovulate again and can cysts then form cysts can sometimes still form when on the pill i had asked a doctor friend about this and they said that the pill doesn't always help keep cysts from becoming a problem i found this to be the case for myself in when i had to have surgery for one of my other medical problems my doctor found a cm functional cyst these kind of cysts are pretty common i've been on the pill for years if you miss your pills because of sickness it can cause breakthrough bleeding to occur for some women making them think it's a period i would recommend getting in touch with your doctor as well to see what they say Ovarian cyst Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Polycystic ovary syndrome Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Spina bifida Ovarian cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ovary Syringomyelia Guinea pig Urinary incontinence Puberty Acne Cephalic disorder Psoriasis Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gynecologic hemorrhage Ovulation Breast Infertility Ectopic pregnancy Birth control Cysticercosis Toxoplasmosis Pregnancy Vitamin D Pilonidal cyst Miscarriage Tuberous sclerosis Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Progesterone Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome Endometrial cancer Fecal incontinence Tocopherol Medical cannabis Breastfeeding Folic acid Childbirth Intersexuality Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency Renal cell carcinoma Depo Provera Surgery Polycystic kidney disease Osteoarthritis Sedative Entamoeba histolytica Caffeine Gregory Goodwin Pincus Stomach cancer Intersex surgery Migraine Ebola Flowering plant Abortion Resident Evil Outbreak Sulfasalazine Ben Johnson (athlete) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Bloating Jam (TV series) Lung cancer Apollo 8 Physician Milton H.
