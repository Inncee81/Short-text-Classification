i'm late my period was due day cycle my last period was its now and still af is nowhere to be found i took the obvious pregnancy test and it came back negitive what do you think the deal is i have no stress haven't gain lossed any weight my basal body temp is staying elevated any clues or advise is welcome thank you i would suggest you take the pregnancy test again if your basal body temperature is still elevated it is quite possible that you are pregnant pregnancy tests are not always reliable close to your period and sometimes need to be done several days after your period should have arrived to get a proper answer if your test is still negative then relax if you are trying to get pregnant then it is quite common for the excitment pressure etc of the expectation to slow your period down and for it to come later it is also possible that you are not pregnant at all it is very unusual for a person to have an entirely consistant mentrual cycle with no variation at any time you may just be late if you find that you are not pregnant after retesting and you don't get your period within another few days then you may want to consider going to see a doctor Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Obstetrics Fertility awareness Abortion Urinary incontinence Turner syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hypertension Coeliac disease Breastfeeding Oral contraceptive Cytomegalovirus Temperature Prostate cancer Miscarriage Folic acid Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion debate Psoriasis Thermal power station Childbirth Ovulation Child sexuality Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Myocardial infarction Sea level rise Gonorrhoea Stomach cancer Dieting Birth control Autism Anemia Roe v.
