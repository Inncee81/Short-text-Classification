question about pamprin i took some pamprin this morning around am for period cramps well at around am my stomach starts to hurt and i have had several bowel movements not diarhhea but softer than normal since then i was wondering if the diuretics in pamprin could make you loose water through bowel movements as well as through urinating i know that diuretics can make you pee a lot but can it do the same thing with bowel movements as well a diuretic will not soften your stools it acts specifically upon your urinary system i am not sure about pamprin having a diuretic though if you have your period you may have starting to release some of the water held during the hours before your period started causing increased urination also sometimes during your periods there is a bit of over stimulation of your large intestine that may result in stool softening i do not know exactly how that occurs but it may be related to tiny uterine contractions normal with a regular period that cause the cramps on the other hand there is also the possibility that the medication was a bit harsh on your stomach and you are feeling the effects of that Fecal incontinence Laxative Irritable bowel syndrome Endometriosis Diarrhea Urinary system Diuretic Ulcerative colitis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urine Vomiting Endometrial cancer Urination Constipation Colorectal cancer Menstrual cycle Coeliac disease Obstetrics Polycystic ovary syndrome First aid Hemorrhoid Dietary fiber Escherichia coli O157:H7 Penis Diverticulosis Breastfeeding Cancer Schistosomiasis Hypoglycemia Dehydration Gastroparesis Muscle Ovarian cancer Yarrow Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Gastroesophageal reflux disease Diabetes insipidus Mattress Vitamin C Paracetamol Puberty Reflexology 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Premature birth Glucocorticoid Autoimmune diseases Loop diuretic Hypomagnesemia Indomethacin Shock Cramp Gastrointestinal tract Short bowel syndrome Flatulence Ben Johnson (athlete) Pregnancy Lactose intolerance Drill bit Atherosclerosis Hirschsprung's disease Enema LSD Stomach Pharmacology Kidney Hernia Acupuncture Erection Ginger Bowel obstruction Childbirth Opioid Pneumonia Gout Caffeine Clostridium difficile Rabies Cirrhosis Althaea (genus) Acromegaly Hypertension Intersex surgery Drowning Motility Allergy Human feces Insulin Crohn's disease Dialysis Glucokinase Adderall Infantilism Acute renal failure Chlorpromazine Wood Cystic fibrosis
