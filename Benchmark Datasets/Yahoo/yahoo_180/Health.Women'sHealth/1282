i ate an apple and nectarine late at night but i'm trying to regain weight to have a period i should be gaining weight right now but i may have already reached my target weight since i haven't checked in a while but i always have snacks in the day and then a dessert at night today i didn't eat as much as i usually do so i ate a nectarine and an apple with my dessert a cookie and milk and i feel really full is it okay to feel this full since i need those calories the main reason i need to gain weight is to get my period started again which i lost for a year due to mild anorexia well it probably depends on how long you have been eating regularly plus i know milk tends to make me feel really full have you been to the doctor or nutritionist if you are at your target weight is this your target or the general target weight for your age height your period should start since your body is just sooooooo anxious to get the natural cycle going again also maybe it could take a couple months of healthy normal eating as your body is probably in a sort of shock from the transition from deprivation to nutrition just keep eating good calories and i wouldn't worry so much about trying to pack them all in at once you need to build a tolerance for food again and as long as you know you're not depriving yourself nature will take care of itself good luck Dieting Anorexia nervosa Breastfeeding Atkins Nutritional Approach Milk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Apple Healthy eating Fasting Stomach cancer Chocolate Hypoglycemia Nutrition Adjustable gastric band Insulin Sleep Bodybuilding Human height Peach Obesity Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Food Protein-energy malnutrition Fancy rat Omega-3 fatty acid Eating disorder Calorie Veganism McDonald's Puberty Folic acid Guinea pig Chinese cuisine Breakfast Tofu Prostate cancer Snack food Cuisine of Denmark Infantilism Dietary fiber Insomnia Sugar substitute MRE Theory of conduct Cheese Meal Tomato Egg (food) Target Corporation Pig (zodiac) Social rule Gastroparesis Coffee Coeliac disease Fertility awareness Fecal incontinence Eating Clinical depression Tooth enamel The Contender (television series) Domestic rabbit Tide Anxiety Cat Hamburger Tocopherol Fruit tree propagation Apple pie Childbirth Kodocha Low-carbohydrate diet Binge eating disorder Terri Schiavo Taiwanese cuisine Food guide pyramid One Piece minor characters Alcoholic beverage Vegetarianism Urinary incontinence Dream Menstrual cup Chlorpromazine Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Diarrhea A Series of Unfortunate Events Ice cream Peanut Dairy Human adaptation to space Pancake German cuisine Protein Abortion debate Bulimia nervosa Original sin South Beach diet Hamster
