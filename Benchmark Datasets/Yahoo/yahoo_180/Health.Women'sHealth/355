our first time together did she have an orgasm or was it just really good well during our forplay session she started turning red as i touched her then after insertion she got even more redder and at the end she was a red as a beet she was almost as red as her hair it was kinda scary at first because i never seen my love turn so red before and her green eyes where so deep and glossy as she stared at me deeply she did get really tight on me and i thought i felt her throbbing on me and she looked like she wanted to scream but she just breathed really hard she won't answer me and she gets really red in the face everytime i talk about last night i asked her did i do anything wrong or anything i should do and she just says no while getting red in the face while staring at the floor i knew her since th grade we are now and she has never told me a lie and it also was our first time having sex period she must have told one of her bff because they keep on telling me not to send her to the moon or something like that only she knows for sure either way you did something right so i wouldn't change it since she didn't complain try not to push the issue i know you are curious but you aren't sure how she is feeling women in our society are sometimes taught that sexuality is shameful and that they shouldn't enjoy sex obviously this is wrong but she may have conflicting feelings if you have sex again i wouldn't worry about whether she had an orgasm on this incident it's more important that she is comfortable with you Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Social rule Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Child sexuality Orgasm Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blood on the Tracks Sexual intercourse Milton H.
