what would you say so i measured err down there the other day and it said i'm like long would any girls notice if i lied said i'm also i read that the average is something like does that mean that in a group of like guys i will actually more often than not be bigger than most most likely if i look at my in the mirror sorry if that visual makes you uncomfortable or turns you on ladies i can see exactly how im a bit larger than average despite me also be somewhat tall but still i can't really picture myself being considered big just well sized i'm thinking a comparison i can make here is like guys' heights average height is ' ish and tall is like over feet tall ' is kind of a grey spot would you agree this is comparable with my size down there i've said it before and i'll say it again it is not what you have down there but whether or not you know what you're doing with it and in bed in general there is more to sex and to turning a woman on than whipping out ol' willie and doing the thrust till you ejaculate women need more physical attention in order to become aroused and about will never have an orgasm through straight vaginal sex in other words foreplay oral sex masturbation of your partner etc are all essential in order to please your partner men are nearly guaranteed an orgasm and a good time with the thrusting of intercourse women don't get a lot out of it unless their partners make it enjoyable otherwise women are just blowup dolls that breathe so my best advice is learn how to perform sex buy some books there are dozens available on sex and sexuality the more educated you are the better you'll be at the final exam crunch time Sexual intercourse Oral sex Orgasm Human sexual behavior Child sexuality Strap-on dildo Masturbation Premature ejaculation Condom Sexual dysfunction Penis Safe sex Anorgasmia Puberty Masters and Johnson Human sexuality Physical intimacy Human sexual response cycle Bondage (BDSM) Rape Sexual abstinence Group sex Mutual masturbation Prostate cancer Child sexual abuse Erogenous zone Zoophilia Nocturnal emission Proper Condom Use Sexual orientation BDSM Fertility awareness Dildo Ejaculation Human penis size Cybersex Aerial (dance move) History of sex Hentai Menstrual cup Glen Quagmire Missionary position Pornographic movie Pornography Sexual revolution Homophobia Religion and sexuality Female ejaculation The 120 Days of Sodom Inhibited sexual desire Prostitution Sexual attraction Pedophilia Oral contraceptive Vaginismus Equine conformation Vagina Sento Paraphilia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Child pornography Medical analysis of circumcision Human height Bukkake Sex and intelligence Orgy Milton H.
