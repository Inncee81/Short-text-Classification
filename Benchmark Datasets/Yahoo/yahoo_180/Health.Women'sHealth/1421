post hysterectomy women hoping for some feedback i'm scheduled next week for a hysterectomy due to fibroids that have been basically ruining my life for over years now while this is a good thing i'm starting to get a little nervous about what to expect post op looking for input from ladies who've been thru this to tell me what i can expect to feel like afterwards and how quickly you were able to return to full duty i'm also curious about whether there's anything specific i should take to the hospital with me any and all advice is very appreciated i had a total hysterectomy about three years ago if you are going to have to have your ovaries removed it is a good thing to talk to your doctor about hormone replacement therapy i was sent home with none and would have uncontrollable crying spells and depression after a while i got off of them but maybe it would have made my recovery easier had they sent me home with a hormone patch nausea after surgery can be a real problem for me so i asked to not be given any morphine which makes me throw up and to be given something for nausea before they brought me out of surgery i had the hysterectomy and tummy tuck all at once and did fine with a lydocain pain pump dripping novocain right into the incision area by little tubes and motrin i read something about packing gauze in one of the other responses but i had none of that just a wrap over the incision Hysterectomy Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Cancer Dialysis Gynaecology Chemotherapy Hypoglycemia Traumatic brain injury Childbirth Radiation therapy Uterine fibroids Panic attack Babe Ruth Abortion Stroke Myocardial infarction Transsexuality Ovarian cancer Adjustable gastric band Cocaine Medicine Menstrual cycle Urinary incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Sigmund Freud Combat stress reaction Testosterone Shaggy dog story Opioid Polycystic ovary syndrome The Amber Spyglass Oral contraceptive Infertility Intravenous therapy Diarrhea Electrophysiology Ectopic pregnancy Cerebellum Intersex surgery History of intersex surgery Acromegaly Pneumonia Fast bowling Action potential Theory of conduct Tobacco smoking Palliative care Hormone replacement therapy Menopause Carpal tunnel syndrome EastEnders Prolactinoma Vaginal bleeding Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Ovarian cyst Cervical cancer Clinical depression Colorectal cancer Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Gender reassignment therapy Lung cancer Terri Schiavo Dentistry Anorexia nervosa Diabetes mellitus Orgasm Homosexuality and transgender Morphine Postpartum depression Puberty Adverse effect (medicine) Days of our Lives Glucocorticoid Sterilization (surgical procedure) Endocrinology Phoebe Halliwell 1957 World Series Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Acne Haloperidol Cryptorchidism Baldness Acupuncture Obstetrics Plastic surgery Emergency Medical Services Sleep Aortic dissection Psoriasis Brain Stem cell
