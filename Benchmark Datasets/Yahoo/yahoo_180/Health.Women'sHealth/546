i finnally got it a few days ago i posted a question about wanting to use tampons well i just got my first one in now i'm nervous about taking it out will it hurt how long should i leave it in for advice and tips appreicated great it will be like riding a bike you never forget to take it out just grab the string and pull you might feel a little tug from where the tampon is folding back up but you shouldn't feel any pain a tampon should be changed every hours consistently so carry an extra one with you to school note if it gets to the point that the tampon is uncomfortable after you put it in you may need a smaller size because when you sit down that large one will make you feel like you are sitting on something Menstrual cup Sanitary towel Professional wrestling holds Shaggy dog story Menstrual cycle Textile manufacturing Tampon Aerial (dance move) Mattress Knife Cello Social rule Skateboarding trick Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.
