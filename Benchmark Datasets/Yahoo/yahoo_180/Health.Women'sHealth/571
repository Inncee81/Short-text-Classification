what do these symptoms mean i recently had a baby weeks ago now i am not sure if any of these symptoms are related to that or not i have been very nauseated for the past weeks now every time i eat i can barely eat half and occasionally will end up with diarrhea now the past week i have had sore joints mainly ankles wrists knees but have done no sort of heavy activity i also get headaches quite often i have a doctor's appointment tomorrow but i was curious if anyone has any ideas or if maybe this could be something that just happens after giving birth also just a note the pregnancy and birth went well no problems except being anemic during the last month of the pregnancy i tested to be fine after the birth though and generally i don't feel tired i had a baby two months ago and i relate to you with the pain in the joints its mainly because pregnancy softens the joints to make it easier for the baby to come out it takes some time for it to be back to normal maybe the nausea is from all the hormones and the headaches from sleep deprivation but its a good idea to see the doctor just to be safe good luck Pregnancy Breastfeeding Childbirth Obstetrics Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Psoriasis Miscarriage Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Ebola Folic acid Breech birth Hypertension Menstrual cycle Morning sickness Guinea pig Traumatic brain injury Post Polio syndrome Endometriosis Carpal tunnel syndrome Group A streptococcal infection Oral contraceptive Fecal incontinence Paget's disease of bone Diarrhea Spina bifida Stroke Equine conformation Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Abortion debate Charles Darwin's illness Clomipramine Decompression sickness Syphilis Cephalic disorder Insulin Opioid Physical examination Migraine Cancer Diabetes mellitus Polycystic ovary syndrome Anemia Hyperprolactinaemia Tocopherol Sulfasalazine Transsexuality Sexual intercourse Fibromyalgia Postpartum depression Lyme disease Neighbours Emergency contraception Propranolol Weight training Jam (TV series) Multiple chemical sensitivity Acupuncture Pneumonia Medical cannabis Anxiety Premature birth Hepatitis C EastEnders Abortion Multiple sclerosis Aspartame Mattress Sleep Intact dilation and extraction Cannabis (drug) First aid Chiropractic Syringomyelia Osteoporosis Puberty Narcolepsy Paracetamol Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Elephant Medicine Growth hormone treatment Chemical abortion Gonorrhoea Food allergy Professional wrestling holds Radiation poisoning Buprenorphine Cytomegalovirus Episodes of Lost (Season 1)
