menstruation miscarriage i miscarried a baby in mid april this year at and a half months along without complete miscarriage and never had my period or any bleeding for that matter aafter i found out that the baby was not alive anymore i never had a d c yesterday i got my period and some very bad cramping and passed a large clot about and a half inches in diameter is it possible that i passed the baby sorry for the descriptions but it's the only way i could describe it thanks for your help i went and had an ultrasound done which determined the the baby was not alive the doctor told me to wait it out and after a couple weeks he gave me pills to help it along it never did anything so that is how we got here that's entirely possible dear when i miscarried i actually had that happen but it was during the miscarriage it's likely that your regular cycle started up again and your uterus has cleaned itself out to start over again if something like that ever happens again heaven forbid you should consider having a d c done obviously women had miscarriages before doctors and they were fine but you should at least be checked out Miscarriage Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Obstetrics Intact dilation and extraction Oral contraceptive Endometriosis Vaginal bleeding Abortion Childbirth Breech birth In vitro fertilisation Endometrial cancer Neighbours Niddah Menstrual cup Birth control Gynaecology Polycystic ovary syndrome Ovarian cyst Stomach cancer Morning sickness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chemical abortion Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prenatal care Stroke Habitual abortion Urinary incontinence Prenatal diagnosis Miscarriage of justice Premature birth Dialysis Emergency contraception Jam (TV series) Partial-birth abortion Friends Twin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Terri Schiavo Nuclear fallout AFI 100 Years series Gonorrhoea Spina bifida Ectopic pregnancy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Triage Mormonism and Judaism Jennifer Lopez Pregnancy test Apollo 8 Uterus Situation comedy Progesterone Gynecologic hemorrhage Cervix Coeliac disease Estrus cycle Anne Boleyn Solar eclipse Salic law Kimberly-Clark Corporation Characters of Lost Dinah Marler Obstetrical hemorrhage Androgen insensitivity syndrome Caesarean section Abortion in the United States Alanis Morissette Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial Endometrium Birth weight John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Computus Gender role Prostate cancer Mount St. Helens Traumatic brain injury Guinea pig Astronomy on Mars Hebrew calendar Erythropoietin Jon Secada What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
