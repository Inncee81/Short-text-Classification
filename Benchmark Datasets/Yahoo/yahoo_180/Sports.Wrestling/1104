what do u think of carlito to be honest i don't really like him i hope he doesn't get a title shot because he doesn't deserve it he hasn't done much in my opinion until now what do u think of him he might have won the title in his debut but what about after he lost it he didn't do much so in other words someone else needs to learn about wrestling i agree with you i mean he became intercontinental champion but he has really done anything besides grow his hair out lol but seriously i don't like him i think he needs to step it up or do something to prove he wants to be taken seriously Carly Colon Eddie Guerrero Shawn Michaels WWE Intercontinental Championship Hulk Hogan David Bautista John Cena Paul Wight Ric Flair Paul Levesque Kurt Angle Merced Solis Rob Van Dam Chris Benoit Montreal Screwjob WWE RAW Roddy Piper Stone Cold Steve Austin Greg Valentine Glen Jacobs Jeff Jarrett The Rock (entertainer) Ricky Steamboat Virgil Runnels III Chris Jericho Leon White Richard Vigneault Mick Foley Shelton Benjamin WWE Unforgiven Booker Huffman Theory of conduct Nikita Koloff Mark Calaway Adam Copeland Terry Gerin Jason Reso Scott Levy Randy Orton Marty Jannetty WWE Judgment Day Pierre Clemont Royal Rumble Randy Savage Don Muraco Jacqueline Moore Survivor Series Carlitos Colon Solofa Fatu In Your House A.J.
