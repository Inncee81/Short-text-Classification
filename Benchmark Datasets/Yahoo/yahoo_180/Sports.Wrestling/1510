is anyone else sick of kevin nash i liked nash during his diesel big daddy cool days and i also enjoyed his work during the nwo day so there's a few points for him however the work he's been doing in tna has been terrible the man all but ruined the x division with his stupid skits and his whole size doe matter squashes of the x division roster he took a perfectly good worker in jay lethal and turned him into a clown called the black machismo and quite frankly the comedy sketches that he was doing with alex shelley really weren't that funny your thoughts actually i find him one of the best parts of tna his comedy bits with alex shelley have been amazing quite frankly and although the gimmick choices are stupid and the promos were off kilter and weird they brought personality and character to the x division wrestlers something they sorely needed and while i agree that the black machismo gimmick was stupid look at what the gimmick did for him lethal used to be a bland x division wrestler with no personality whatsoever suddenly he pretends that he's the macho man and the guy's over as hell and he'd still be as over if tna didn't make the stupid decision to take the x division title away from him in the first week basically while i do believe he should have lost to sabin earlier what he's brought to the x division in terms of interest character and personality is hard to find plus his skits especially those with the extremely funny shelley have been an enjoyment in a show that has been lacking in enjoyable things i can only take angle making joe look like a punk for so long NWo Professional wrestling slang A.J.
