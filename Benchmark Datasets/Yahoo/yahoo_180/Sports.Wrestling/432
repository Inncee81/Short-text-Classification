if wwe brings back y j and pyscho sid what brands should they be on i think y j should go to smackdown and sid should go to raw i agree that y j should go to smackdown because they need someone like him to make it interesting and funny and psycho sid should probably go to either raw or smackdown it all depends on which show needs him which at the moment is probably raw since all their main event guys are getting injured WWE RAW WWE Draft Shawn Michaels World Heavyweight Championship Carly Colon Chris Benoit John Cena World Wrestling Entertainment WWE SmackDown!
