do you think the sumo wrestler here in japan should tell the japanese sumo federation to go shove it let me explain this sumo wrestler from mongol told the sumo federation he could'nt take part in the next tournememt due to a back injury anyway he goes back to his native country plays football and returns to japan he is the penalized from the sumo federation and told he's not allowed to take part in the next tournements then he's told by his stable master he can't leave his house the sumo in question is now depressed and you can see the stress on his face due to the constant bullying from the japanese people though some do have sympathy my point is is'nt it only right when you return your native country you also escape the hard over ruled society and enjoy is'nt it your own right and no right of the japanese to interfere with another person's life when they return thier native land after all fottball soccer is'nt as fierce as sumo and i'm sure the sumo wrestler did'nt even think he'd have these problems basically this guy is being penalized because he took part in sport when he said he was injured was it sport on a professional basis or for relaxation if it was just for relaxation i guess he shouldn't be penalized so much that would be a kind of prejudice but maybe the sumo federation believe he lied to them when he said he was injured that would be more serious i guess if he lied about his physical condition just to take a holiday back home sure i feel for the guy but i'd also need to know the nature of the charges against him maybe it is prejudice but that's japan any gaijin is going to have a tough time integrating he could take the sumo federation to court if he feels that he is the victim of racism but that would be the end of his career in japan almost certainly court action isn't smiled upon it disrupts the 'wa' probably his best course of action is to just apologise profusely to everyone and throw himself back into his training telling them to shove it is the other option but like i said that'd be the end of sumo in japan for him so this is the story http mdn mainichi msn co jp national news p a m sp c html what can i say i guess the jsa thinks taking part in the charity soccer match was contemptuous but maybe they were too harsh still asashoryu is a sportsman of the highest calibre presenting a doctors note to say you're unfit for sport and then appearing in a public sporting event might not in retrospect have been the best move on his part he should be allowed to appeal against the jsa's decision though especially considering the adverse effects it has had on him Football (soccer) Rodney Anoai Professional wrestling match types Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Professional wrestling Professional wrestling slang Mixed martial arts Paul Wight Leon White Sport Amateur wrestling Professional wrestling holds Kurt Angle Hulk Hogan Ice hockey Yokozuna Ultimate (sport) Wrestling Shawn Michaels Eddie Guerrero American football Ko shogi Volleyball Roger Federer Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Akebono Taro Professional wrestling throws Mao (game) Aikido Chris Benoit The Rock (entertainer) Boxing World Championship Wrestling Asashoryu Akinori Suplex Racism Alignment (role-playing games) Appeal Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway Hearsay Columbine High School massacre Bad Wolf Alexander Technique Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Martial art Professional wrestling attacks Baseball Transactional analysis Capital punishment National Football League Randy Savage Extreme Dodgeball Bully Trish Stratus Glen Jacobs Mumia Abu-Jamal YuYu Hakusho Violence in sports Mark Calaway EastEnders Evan Mecham Anger management Ethnic issues in Japan Paranoia Agent Olympic Games Avenue Q Australian rules football God Emperor of Dune Table tennis Touch football (rugby league) Supreme court Page Falkenberg Divorce Fukuoka, Fukuoka Liberalism Scientology beliefs and practices Stone Cold Steve Austin NWo Education in the United States Shaggy dog story Japan Sumo Association Fathers' rights Rugby union Japanese sports Chris Kanyon Muhammad Ali Sting (wrestler)
