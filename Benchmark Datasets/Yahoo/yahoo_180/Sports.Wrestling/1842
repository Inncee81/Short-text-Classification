i hate to be rude and i don't want to start fights or anything but how come everyone likes raw so much i personally think it's the 'c' brand vince always puts all the good wrestlers on there and misuses them and he took all of the good smackdown wrestlers like booker t and ken kennedy and put them on raw look at them now booker t is having a stupid king storyline which i think is rediclious he shouldn't of ever got that gimmick and i'm never metioning him as 'king booker' mr kennedy is so new to the wwe and has only got one belt he should of stayed on smackdown with mvp and got the tag titles with him back in october than they could have both moved up to being the wch now rather than stupid khali anyway i also think that ecw before chris benoit died and the draft was more intresting than smackdown and raw itself they had a lot of extreme rules matches and i prefer hour of wrestling than i get bored easily with two hours what's your opnions i really think raw missuses a lot of superstars like shelton val venus charlie haas etc i agree with u and i think ecw is cooler ecw has interesting matches and it has a lot o talent hours of wrestling gets me bored at times raw's king storyline is sooooooooo stuipid i wouldn't say raw is the 'c' brand and khali champ wtf y did they pick him he doesnt do damn thing the wwe except injure the best of wwe mr kennedy should have stayed on sd raw is more competetive and mr kennedy isnt even that competetive and booker wow raw sure made a big mistake there raw does missuse some of the wreslers sometimes so i agree with u John Cena ECW One Night Stand WWE RAW Professional wrestling slang Paul Levesque Mark Calaway Hulk Hogan Jason Reso John Layfield The Alliance Paul Heyman World Heavyweight Championship Vince McMahon Stone Cold Steve Austin WrestleMania XX Ric Flair Chris Jericho Shawn Michaels WWE Tag Team Championship The Invasion Randy Orton Matt Hardy Bret Hart WWE Armageddon Paul Wight Mick Foley Virgil Runnels III WWE Intercontinental Championship Shelton Benjamin Royal Rumble Chris Kanyon Mike Bucci Devon Hughes Yoshihiro Tajiri The Rock (entertainer) WWE Judgment Day WWE Vengeance WWE Championship The Great American Bash Carly Colon NWo La R__sistance Glen Jacobs WWE No Mercy Lance Storm Adam Copeland Rob Van Dam Peter Senerca Taboo Tuesday Mark Copani Darren Matthews Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Jim Ross Gregory Helms Charlie Haas Oscar Gutierrez Nelson Frazier, Jr. Bill Goldberg Kevin Sullivan (wrestler) Page Falkenberg Professional wrestling throws Warrior (wrestler) Chris Candito Survivor Series NWA World Heavyweight Championship Tag team Sean Morley King of the Ring Trish Stratus Perry Satullo Mike Alfonso WCW Monday Nitro Michael Manna Eric Bischoff Championship unification Stephanie McMahon-Levesque Ohio Valley Wrestling Dean Simon Jacqueline Moore Amy Dumas Chavo Guerrero, Jr. Ren__ Goguen Richard Rood Dudley Boyz
