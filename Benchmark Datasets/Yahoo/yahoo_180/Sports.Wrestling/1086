does anyone have or wants advice on how to pull off wrestling's high flying acrobatics i can do the shooting star whisper in the wind swanton flip legdrop moonsaults of many kinds and so on front flips are easy enough if you are athletic and brave the trick is making them look good however it gets much harder when you do backflips and can't use your eyes to see where and how you land this takes skill above bravery and athleticism as well as some other aspects but when it comes to putting spins and flips together whisper in the wind spiral tap infrared you have to be purely amazing now i can pull of a whisper in the wind flawlessly and my spiral tap leaves a bit to be desired before it looks like aj styles' so do you have any suggestions or experience with this like i do or maybe you need some of it i don't reccomend doing this due to the dangers involved but this is what i love do not post warnings of how dangerous this is don t wanna hear it believe it or not i know what i am doing and i practice safely please actual suggestions only aww what you know about seems to be jealous because he's probably not anywhere near athletic or brave to pull this shyte off how sad on a more serious note i asked for advice why would i come here and ask this to pretend that i could do that so people like you who i don't know would be impressed without even seeing this i don't care if jealousy blinds you i pity you really for saying that beacuse i can do it and i asked for advice on improvement i don't have to nor can i prove to you that i can but i can shut your mouth and shoe you that you're a pretty pathetic human being to accuse people you don't know for lying about something that's true just because you don't want it to be because you think that makes me cooler then you or something i never said you can't get your ass up get in shape and try this too but you didn't and i did so now i have skill and you still don't don't blame me for that your fault stop being so sad practice on a trampoline you get the thrill of the height while also teaching yourself new acrobatics then all you have to do is transition that to the ground the hardys practiced on trampolines when they were little and now they're extremely talented Professional wrestling aerial techniques Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling throws Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Skateboarding trick Aerial (dance move) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Professional wrestling slang Volleyball Mixed martial arts Parkour Professional wrestling holds Xiaolin Showdown Characters in the Smurfs The Death Gate Cycle Knots Landing Paragliding Saruman Fast bowling Jeff Hardy Dragon Booster Moonsault Figure skating Theory of conduct Milton H.
