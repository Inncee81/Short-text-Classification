i have an idea what do u think about this angle o k since kevin thorn is now being underused why not make his vampire gimmick more interest this is it after thorn defeats his opponents if they are worthy enough he bites them fake and they automatically become a vampire as well and apart of a vampire faction that is headed by kevin thorn maybe they could even bring back gangrel as the first member what do u think why not james give me a reason point taken keyring but remember its entertainment so everyone knows it's not about wrestling nor has it ever been about wrestling wwe had one wrestler and that's kurt angle and he's in tna notice that they are called superstars rather than wrestler kool Kurt Angle Professional wrestling John Layfield Shawn Michaels Jason Reso Paul Levesque Professional wrestling holds Kevin Nash Mark Calaway NWo Professional wrestling attacks World Wrestling Entertainment Bret Hart Jeff Jarrett Chris Benoit Professional wrestling slang Bob Backlund Carly Colon John Cena Suplex World Championship Wrestling Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling aerial techniques Eddie Guerrero Virgil Runnels III WWE Championship BG James Stone Cold Steve Austin Professional wrestling match types Jimmy Hart Nick Dinsmore A.J.
