do golf course bartenders earn good hi i'm a five year experienced bartender i'm not doing it as a living for the past couple years but still do it at parties and stuff like that i'm thinking making it my career choice i love doing it and i'm very good at it but i want to know if golf course bartenders make good i'm taking home about month w benefits and everything but i'm not happy that depends on whether you are talking about private clubs or public ones the average money i made tending in country clubs was good but not what you are making currently municipal courses are a nightmare most of the people can't afford the golf they are playing let alone leaving a decent tip it sounds like you have a decent job taking something part time to check it out for yourself would be my best suggestion the country clubs i worked at were a blast a real sense of family with the staff and the members still if you have something good in your pocket already the part time route is probably your best bet every job has it times when you just want to say screw it the grass always seems greener on the other side most country clubs hire alot of people for seasonal gigs when the business is peak so if you have an offer in hand make sure its a permanent position and not just one of the many short term fill the gap jobs that come up its important to be happy at what you are doing but a little caution here would be prudent Unemployment Golf Gross domestic product The Shining (film) Economic inequality Poker jargon PGA European Tour Betting (poker) Shaggy dog story Cricket The Amazing Race Bruce Johnson U.S. Open (golf) Microeconomics Fancy Crane Friends Flat tax Who Shot Mr. Burns?
