how should i celebrate a milestone birthday need some suggestions this is a biggie and i want to make it special i'm drawing a blank because i rarely do any formal celebrations etc give me some ideas how to make it special please nothing involving booze i don't drink so partying til i pass out isn't on the list try something different like an interactive show like a murder mystery dinner party or just a big party at your house or somewhere nice with your favorite people and foods no alcohol no problem in fact i think that's really better that way myself safer for those having to drive or those having to be on the road with someone who's been drinking happy birthday Birthday Theory of conduct Alcoholic beverage The Notorious B.I.G.
