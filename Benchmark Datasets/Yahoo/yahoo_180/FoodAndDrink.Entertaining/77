what are some nice finger foods for an engagement party we have all the sweet foods covered but need some ideas on quick finger foods any help would be great chips with several different types of dip to choose among from french onion cheese dip spinch dip or salsa crackers with a cheese ball is a good idea there is more cheese to go around and the guests get as much or as little as they like another good idea is to get some lunch meat spread cream cheese on it and and then roll it up and place toothpicks through it to hold it together i know sounds werid but my mom did it for a halloween party and they where the favorite food of the night i recommend shelling out the cash and going with a small variety of meats from the delli but if you're on a budget a good quality packaged lunch meat works too also the cream cheese is a good idea for crackers too turkey and ham taste the best in my opinion but i know my mom had roast beef in there too and believe it or not bisquits work well too lay some out with butter and jam and people will enjoy it as does making sandwhiches and cutting them up into small triangles and placing toothpicks through them or you can get a block of cheese cub it fold some lunch meat on the top of it and hold them together with with a toothpick and last but certainly never least fruit and veggie trays are perfect for any occassion you can buy them or make them yourself Cuisine of Denmark Breakfast MRE Hamburger Sandwich Hot dog French cuisine Barbecue Street food German cuisine D__ner kebab Cuisine of the Philippines Tofu Vegetarian cuisine McDonald's Dim sum Pizza Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Argentina Peruvian cuisine In-N-Out Burger Dairy Bengali cuisine Cajun cuisine Dumpling Ramen Chili con carne Polish cuisine Pie Taco Cheese Vegetarianism Fondue French fries Tamale British cuisine Biscuit Meat analogue Roman eating and drinking Sauce Soul food Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Austria Potato Ice cream Sushi Cuisine of Greece Cuisine of Brazil Cha chaan teng Tea Cuisine of Turkey Cuisine of Singapore Korean cuisine Cold Stone Creamery Bread Milk Fish and chips Snack food Burger Cuisine of Africa Potato chips Persian cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Cheesesteak Mexican cuisine Yoghurt Yum cha Pringles Nachos Soup Domesticated turkey Brunch Fast-food restaurant American Chinese cuisine Cincinnati chili Chicken Organic food Culture of Argentina Genericized trademark Cuisine of Norway Meal Coffee Cantonese cuisine Poker jargon Fecal incontinence Mochi Veganism Cuisine of Canada Refrigerator car Rationing in the United Kingdom during and after World War II French toast Salad Gyros
