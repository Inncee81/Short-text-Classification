help w a hannah montana party at the pool my daughter is turning and wants to invite all of her girlfriends over for a hannah montana party at the pool does anyone have any ideas for invitations decorations games and treat bags that tie in with hannah or and swimming thanks well hannah montana is a performer so maybe you could set up some kind of stage and have the girls perform karaoke claire's has a lot of hannah montana things including notepads pens and paper maybe the party could be set up like the show first the party could be kind of average just hanging out at the pool like a normal teenager with drinks snacks and friends and then surprise your daughter with a limo ride to a nice dinner or small shopping spree in the show hannah montana is a normal teen named miley then she is also a super star named hannah montana on the way to the pool you can listen to the new miley cyrus cd and while in the limo you can listen to the hannah montana cd one of her songs is called best of both worlds the one from the tv intro i think so that could be the overall theme of the party invitations could be divided in half or two sided one side could invite the girls to a normal teenage pool party then the other side could be glitzy and glamorous and tell the girls that they will receive a surprise star treatment for decorations the pool area could be decorated like the beach with big umbrellas beach blankets etc then the second half of the party could have more elaborate decorations like balloons and glittery stars for games you could play hannah montana triva and have the karoke contest have fun Charmed Little Britain Teen Girl Squad Birthday Wheel of Fortune The Emancipation of Mimi ABBA Scooby-Doo Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jeopardy!
