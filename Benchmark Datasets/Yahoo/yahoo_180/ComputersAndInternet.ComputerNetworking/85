wifimax wireless connecting my laptop to the web security issue i'm using wifimax to connect my laptop to the internet wirelessly it works great but here's the problem my setup is like this my desktop pc is connected to a wired not wireless modem and router wifimax dongle thingie is plugged into this pc this sends a signal to my laptop and now the problem the connection doesn't work if the network is secure if i put in a password or use encryption it simply sends no signal at all so to make it work i'm basically running an unsecured unprotected network authentication is open system and wep is disabled how unsafe is it to keep the network unsecured no one can see my files i've checked but i assume someone could steal my internet by connecting to my network how big of a problem is this going to be assuming i only use my laptop for a few hours a day and unplug the dongle thingie shutting down the network when i'm not using it here's a picture of my settings which might help http i tinypic com osi og jpg is it wifi or wimax i was one of the authors of the wifi security specification and i was the primary author of the wimax security specification so i know the security protocols in great detail from the rest of your message i'm assuming that it is wifi not wimax there's no such thing as wifimax dual protocol interfaces will come out in the future but they aren't out yet you have the desktop pc trying to act as a bridge or router since it has to bridge or route your laptop's traffic onto the wired internet connection you have if you're running linux that bit is easy configure it as a router or bridge bridge is easier if you're running windows you have some digging to do to find the configuration however in wifi in infrastructure mode the normal mode one end needs to be an access point and the other needs to be a sta mobile station so either the laptop needs to be configured to be an ap or the desktop pc's wifi connection needs to be configured as an ap see your manufacturer's manual for the details of how to do that there's no standard way it may well not be possible on either end an alternative is to configure both ends to be ad hoc mode rather than infrastructure mode with routing on the desktop this should work assuming something downstream like your router is handling dhcp with bridging on the desktop it should also work but do force address packet headers in so bridging can work the reason why is black magic that i can explain by email if you care it is basically unsafe to have your wireless unsecured so if you care about people using your network and having direct access to your pc past the firewall don't do it securing it with i also known as wpav should not be a problem is you use psk mode pre shared key but i can quite believe some vendors don't support security in ad hoc mode for a simpler solution get a wireless ap that plugs into the ethernet and bypasses the desktop pc X Window System Network address translation Wi-Fi Protected Access Internet protocol suite MDAC Windows Server 2003 Skype Pretty Good Privacy Password Windows Vista Digital Subscriber Line IEEE 802.11i AirPort Embedded system IBM PC compatible IPv6 E-mail ITU-T Extensible Authentication Protocol Novell NetWare OpenBSD Public-key cryptography PowerPC Laptop Wardriving Denial-of-service attack GPRS Core Network Wireless access point Integrated Services Digital Network Wireless Application Protocol Asynchronous Transfer Mode Secure Digital card Musical Instrument Digital Interface MAC address PlayStation 3 IPsec History of Microsoft Windows Internet Group Management Protocol Communications protocol Internet Relay Chat HyperText Transfer Protocol Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Universal Plug and Play HTTP cookie Stopping e-mail abuse Surveillance Session Initiation Protocol Microsoft Windows Proxy server Opera (web browser) AmigaOS Computer security Routing Telegraphy General Packet Radio Service OSI model Domain Name System Spyware File Transfer Protocol Web service ZigBee ALOHAnet Computer virus Xbox Digital rights management Microsoft .NET Netfilter/iptables E-mail spam Computer forensics Global System for Mobile Communications BitTorrent
