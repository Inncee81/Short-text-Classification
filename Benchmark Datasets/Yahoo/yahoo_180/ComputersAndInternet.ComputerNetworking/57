freeing up an eternet port i am attempting to install a us robotics modem it plugs into the network socket via a cat cable next step is to type and then set up the modem no joy as all i get is problem loading page modem is ok have tested it and successfully set it up on another machine looking in network settings or device manager i can only find a usb adsl wan adaptor this is my existing modem how do i create a new connection the wizards are useless as the adsl wan is the only option available it is a wireless adsl modem router the problem is there is no lan connection in 'network connections' when i try to configure one the only option is the usb adsl wan the port is enabled in bios but just cannot be seen by device manager tried it on my mac and was on the net in under a minute why is windows so hard to do anything on andy is a bit loud you can get ethernet modems and they don't need drivers and the router modem won't show up in device manager it's not installed on your computer it's an independent network device which doesn't require drivers first remove your old modem and reboot your machine now try connecting to the router modem if that hasn't fixed things try this open the network properties and select the ethernet socket you're using local area connection open the tcp ip internet protocol v and look at the ip address it could be that your computer is already using for itself that said most routers use as their ip finally you may need to set up a fixed ip for your computer if you want to try that then try these settings ip subnet default gateway assuming your router ip address is correct jbv Digital Subscriber Line Modem AppleTalk Router Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Wi-Fi Windows XP Bluetooth Broadband Internet access Local area network USB flash drive Network address translation IMac Wireless LAN Common Unix Printing System Internet Group Management Protocol Transmission Control Protocol Computer network Xbox AirPort History of Microsoft Windows Internet protocol suite Windows 2000 IPod MDAC Voice over IP Atari 8-bit family IEEE 802.11 Denial-of-service attack IP address IBook Computer bus Commodore 64 Secure Digital card Novell NetWare Cisco Systems Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Border Gateway Protocol Windows Server 2003 Asynchronous Transfer Mode IPv6 Floppy disk Nintendo DS Integrated Services Digital Network Internet Netfilter/iptables AmigaOS X Window System Differentiated services RS-232 Computer Architecture of Windows 2000 Apple Macintosh Communications protocol PowerPC Blue screen of death Advanced Technology Attachment Embedded system Quality of service Domestic AC power plugs and sockets GSM services X.25 Domain Name System MIPS architecture Wireless access point OpenBSD Control Panel (Windows) Linux kernel Password Musical Instrument Digital Interface Mac mini Laptop Knoppix OSI model FireWire ZX Spectrum Open Shortest Path First Berkeley Software Distribution Universal Plug and Play Apple IIGS ITunes Linux Desktop computer Serial port Telegraphy Virtual LAN Firewall (networking) Proxy server Mouse (computing) 3Com Corporation Private branch exchange Computer surveillance Dongle
