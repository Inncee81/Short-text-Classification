my cable modem stops working when anything is plugged into a plug in on the same curtcuit if the pc is online and i turn on a fan plugged into wall outlet in any of the outlets in the rest of the house the modem stops working how can i fix this and why is it happening i am totally confused i would get a circuit tester and check all the outlets in the house they are little units that look like a plug and have lights on the end with a code should be available from any decent hardware store sounds like there is a problem with the return side of the wiring either at a plug or in the main panel and the circuit is using ground for return a fan is an inductive motor and causes current to flow differently than in a transformer unit Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Modem Enigma machine Three-phase electric power Residual-current device Relay Thermal power station Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Alternating current Transformer BS 1363 RS-232 Vacuum tube Electric motor Commodore 64 X10 (industry standard) Switch Fuse (electrical) Circuit design Digital Subscriber Line Universal Serial Bus Fan (implement) Ground and neutral Computer bus Power line communication Solar power Sega Dreamcast Nintendo Entertainment System Extension Cord Electrical wiring (UK) Impedance matching Oscilloscope Power strip Atari 8-bit family Ethernet Carburetor National Electrical Code (US) Jack plug TIA-568A/B High-voltage direct current Battery electric vehicle Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Personal computer Volt Distribution board IPod Impedance Embedded system Thermostat Inductor Series and parallel circuits Earthing system Railgun Resistor Apollo Guidance Computer Capacitor Electric power transmission Audiophile Electrical wiring Maxwell's equations Telephone exchange Serial port Antenna (radio) ZX Spectrum Musical Instrument Digital Interface Circuit breaker Federal Standard 1037C Membrane potential DVD Ground (electricity) Digital circuit Bombe Secure Digital card STS-61 Teletext Ring circuit Windows Vista PlayStation 2 Windows 2000 Multiplayer Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Motor oil Loudspeaker Transmission line Burglar alarm Mains electricity Broadband Internet access Super Nintendo Entertainment System Split phase Light switch Two-stroke cycle Hayes command set Airport Ignition system Sinclair ZX81
