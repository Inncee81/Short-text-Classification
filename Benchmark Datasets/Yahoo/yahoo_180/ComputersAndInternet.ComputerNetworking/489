when i use batch to move files from a linux computer to an win one why is there an hr difference my co worker and i transfer three files from our linux computer to our windows sp computer about once an hour one file we pull over to the computer using a program we then run a batch file that renames that file by looking for pdf there's only one pdf in the folder so this works well then this first batch file calls a second batch file the second batch file copies the remaining two files from the linux computer to the windows computer then it renames both of these files the first file pulled over with software has the correct date problem the two files pulled via batch and renamed show a modified date in the folder that is hours behind the actual time it is always hours difference we create the original files on the linux computer just before transfer any ideas what might be causing this first thing to check is the locale settings for windows and linux if there is a time or zone difference then there is very possibility for the issue to occur in this scenario the file downloaded by some software does not create any problem as the software just pulls over the file with the file attributes from the source software does not allow file to directly interact with system however with batch file it directly interacts with system and takes the destination system locale Computer virus Microsoft Windows Thread (computer science) Linux Virtual memory Windows 2000 Linux distribution Debugging NTFS Windows XP IBM PC compatible Mac OS X Btrieve MS-DOS Software bug Operating system MDAC File Allocation Table Concurrent Versions System Emacs Mach kernel DOS Rootkit ITunes Windows registry Java programming language GNU General Public License Common Unix Printing System Windows Vista Redundant array of independent disks COMMAND.COM Portable Document Format Gmail Patch (computing) Spyware GNOME File format Macromedia Flash SCO-Linux controversies Domain Name System Peer-to-peer Open-source software CPU cache X Window System BitTorrent Pretty Good Privacy Wine (software) Perl Unicode SCO v.
