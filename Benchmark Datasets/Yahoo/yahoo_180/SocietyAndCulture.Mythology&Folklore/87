don't you hate how ppl in the section don't believe in ghosts spirits ouija boards psychics aliens anything paranormal even if it is right in front of them whenever you ask a question they respond all rudely saying how you're lying about whatever it's not real that never happened first yes i do second when a response is both not helpful and rude i do not hesitate to use the report abuse button i respect different opinions when they are expressed respectfully and intelligently third there is a section in science mathematics called alternative and further divides into paranormal phenomena and parapsychology the section has a few vocal debunkers most of the people in the mythology section are usually more open minded i would love to see some open minded people over in science math fourth debunkers not skeptics which is a word they abuse long ago had to resort to claims of lying cheating drug use and mental illness to explain things that they had no other explanation for just fyi the actual research on this seldom finds evidence of any of their claims for instance there is zero correlation between mental illness and ghost sightings fifth all that said i am skeptical of some claims like the ouija board that when tested as far back as by michael faraday always shows that physical force is used to move the planchette the triangle this does not mean that it might not be working via your own esp and unconscious muscle movements or connecting with your own subconscious it means when it was shown to not be moving by unexplained forces debunkers dismissed it claimed it disproven and moved on real scientist would ask if it provided accurate information that was other wise unknown to you and create experiments to test this idea michael john weaver m s director new mexico anomaly society http nmas freeservers com Unidentified flying object Extra-sensory perception Anomalous phenomenon Scientific skepticism Telepathy Supernatural Pseudoscience Abduction Phenomenon Psychokinesis New Age Unconscious mind Roswell UFO incident Out-of-body experience Consciousness Neuro-linguistic programming James Randi Magical thinking Autism Magic (paranormal) Psychology Condon Committee Near-death experience Intelligent design Philosophy of science Cognitive science Artificial consciousness Charles Fort Ufology Dissociative identity disorder Project Blue Book Empathy Extraterrestrial hypothesis Magic (illusion) Religion Epistemology Human Physics Intelligence quotient Scientific method Cult Edgar Cayce A Course In Miracles Science Franz Boas Skepticism Philip J.
