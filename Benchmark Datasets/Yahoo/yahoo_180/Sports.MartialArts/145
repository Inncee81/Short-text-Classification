do martial artists run a higher risk of prosecution when involved in an altercation that ends in injury you know the old idiom about a martial artist needing to register his her deadly hands and or feet along those lines do you think the police would be more likely to charge you if they knew you held a ranking in a martial art most states have a duty to retreat clause on their law books this means that you may use reasonable force to defend yourself or repel an attack but can only legally use deadly force death or great bodily harm when faced with a deadly or great bodily harm threat yourself otherwise you are obligated to retreat if possible or practical use only that force you believe to be reasonable and neccesary and be prepared to justify your actions john junker a university of washington law professor specializing in criminal law and self defense issues state's if the person using force believed he needed it to defend himself and it was reasonable so the key is what is reasonable to defend yourself so you have a guy yelling bullying threatening you put your hands up to protect yourself and state you do not want to fight he is not backing down and takes a swing at you you kick his knee and he falls to the ground in pain unable to continue the attack you stop someone contacts the police peter hobart esq further addes the law and the facts underlying a cause of action are rarely clear cut statutes and case law vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction lawyers are skilled at recasting the facts in their client s best interest juries are given broad discretion with respect to determining guilt or innocence and may feel the need to compensate an injured party regardless of fault and even if a defendant successfully raises one of the defenses discussed above litigation is costly both in terms of time and money it would be foolish to try to rely on a general understanding of the legal principles at work in these situations in order to engage in behavior which falls just within the realm of legality rather the wise martial artist will attempt to avoid any hint of liability or criminal conduct the following general principles may be of value in this endeavor avoid physical confrontation if there is a safe avenue of retreat use it regardless of jurisdiction at a minimum retreat to the wall if confrontation is inevitable give a warning when defending property unless doing so would be dangerous or futile which is often the case this does not mean that you should list your qualifications as the samurai of old were wont to do rather you should simply give the aggressor notice that you intend to use force against him in order to allow him to reconsider his position ensure that you are not seen as the aggressor this does not require taking the first hit but it does require being certain that physical contact is imminent prior to reacting for an in depth examination of the danger here see the goetz case be aware of the aggravating and mitigating factors is there a size age or ability differential are you or the attacker armed or trained all of these factors will help you determine the appropriate level of force use only the amount of force necessary to deter the attack this does not require the use of ineffective technique but rather mature reflection prior to a confrontation about what technique including flight is appropriate in which situation it would be wise to introduce this as part of training once the initial threat is neutralized stop this does not mean that you must give your opponent a fighting chance rather you may immobilize the attacker while awaiting the police but do no further damage when intervening on behalf of a third party ensure as much as possible that the intervention is justified and necessary as a rule interference in domestic disputes is unwise reconciliations can mean trouble for the would be rescuer remember that in this country human rights are superior to property rights the use of force in the protection of property is very risky as an instructor you are both morally and legally responsible for the actions of your students both inside and out of the
