is there any talk of fedors next opponent also is he going to stay in bodog or fight in other fight leagues bj as in bj penn i hope your joking anyways thats a good answer mr chris i wish fedor would just sign with zuffa that way all the americans who dont know about him will realize that silvia and couture sp really arent that good at all couture is old as hell and silva is pathetic honestly his next opponent depends exclusively on the promoter that he signs with so really next promoter would be more appropriate dana white has said that if fedor signs with zuffa the ufc he will get an immediate title shot he probably doesn't want to get cro copped again if he signs with k or bodog who knows i suppose if he signed with k brock lesnar or a rematch with semmy schilt would be likely if k could put together bob sapp v fedor that would sell as well bodog doesn't have much at heavyweight so if he signs with them i imagine they will have to lure away a ufc free agent i don't think zuffa picked up mark hunt so they could do fedor v hunt ii but that match happened not too long ago Mixed martial arts Ultimate Fighting Championship Randy Couture Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira PRIDE Mark Calaway The Ultimate Fighter Kurt Angle Chuck Liddell Vitor Belfort Brock Lesnar Mirko Filipovi__ Professional wrestling match types Royal Rumble Matt Hardy WWE Championship Frank Shamrock Paul Wight Hulk Hogan Wanderlei Silva King of the Ring Leon White Chris Jericho David Bautista Shawn Michaels Fedor Emelianenko WWE Armageddon Major League Baseball television contracts Professional wrestling slang The Rock (entertainer) Martial art WWE Judgment Day Detroit Tigers WWE No Mercy Survivor Series Boxing John Layfield John Cena Mark Coleman Frank Mir A.J.
