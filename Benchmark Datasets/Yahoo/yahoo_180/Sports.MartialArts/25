now i've been watching some fights and i see how people kick someone in the leg and from a kick to the leg the person falls down where how do you have to kick in order to get them to fall down getting someone to fall down from a kick isn't really an intentional thing its more of a really good bonus it would require almost inhuman timing and accuracy to do it whenever you wanted to it happens when the person has most of their weight on that leg and you kick them in the back of the knee so that you contract their tendons and force that leg to collapse you can try and see how it works by tapping someone in the back of the knee while they're just standing or haave someone try it on you if your weight is balance between your two legs you might stumble but you shouldn't fall like i said falling happens when all their weights on that leg if you're trying to do it it only works about once every times sometimes it just happens when your aiming for the thigh and miss the other thing you might be thinking of which is much more consistant is called a sweep a sweep does look like a kick but its actually more of a block trip what you do is move them push them so that they have to step to keep their balance but then you stick your foot in the way so that they cant take a step you block their step its hard to describe you'd have to get someone like a wrestler or judoka to show you its actually harder to do if you think of it like a kick though it really does look like one Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling aerial techniques Equine conformation Mixed martial arts Skateboarding trick Swingout Casualty lifting Glossary of ballet terms Powerbomb Glossary of partner dance terms Charleston (dance move) Marching band Breaststroke Muay Thai DDT (professional wrestling) Guilty Gear Backstroke Biped Judo Circle (dance move) Glossary of climbing terms Piledriver (professional wrestling) Batting (cricket) Jazz dance moves Volleyball Figure skating Suplex Professional wrestling slang Butterfly stroke Backbreaker Glossary of American football Shaggy dog story Shoot boxing Big Apple (dance) Swimming Lightsaber combat Trapping Parade (military) Fast bowling Piccolo Junior Saga Water polo Side pass (dance move) Neckbreaker GunZ The Duel Front crawl Rugby union positions Wing Chun Weight training Chair Pump It Up Wrestling Goju Ryu Dressage Professional wrestling 108 form Wu family T'ai Chi Ch'uan Boxing Field hockey Boston crab Cross-country skiing American football strategy Bass drum PRIDE Suicide methods Extreme Championship Wrestling Theory of conduct Shawn Michaels American football Pole vault Proprioception Lindy Basic Horizontal bar Tai Chi Chuan Kick Internal ballistics Clean and jerk Theodicy Ice hockey Punt (boat) Naruto jutsu Goaltender Dropkick Lindy Hop Childbirth New York Jets Tango (dance) Chris Benoit Sugar push Mojave people Indiana Pacers Rugby union Ric Flair Canadian football Capoeira Football (soccer) Terry Bogard
