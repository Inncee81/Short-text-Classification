judo vs ju jitsu b j j my girlfriends son loves the ufc and mma in general he would like to take up b j j which we are ok with but in watching the ufc or any other mma organizations shows there aren't any judo practitioners i have seen one guy that i remember them mentioning he was a world class judo practitioner and i can't remember his name i was wondering why that is and if his goal is weight loss he carries a few extra lb's and to get in shape which would suit him better he is tall and lanky except for about extra lb's outside sports for him are out he hates doesn't do well in the heat unless it is cold he is inside in the a c combat fighting is not his priority judo vs bjj is a long running riverry in america you don't see alot of judo because to be honest judo in america for the most part sucks they do olympic judo which focuses more on the standing aspect and the throws and less on the newaza or grappling part of judo bjj is the exact opposite to olympic judo focusing alot on the grappling aspect but doing little with the standup which is why most bjj guys have average at best takedowns around the world judo is really more popular the jiu jitsu and for bjj if you really want to get technical they shouldn't call it brazilian jiu jitsu but brazilian judo eaither would be good you just have to do alittle research on the schools to find out which is better both are good choices for what your asking might i also reccomend sambo if you can find that here are some good judoka's in some good matches for you to look for and let your son see hidehiko yoshida vs don frye karo parisyan vs matt serra judo vs jiu jitsu right there kazuhiro nakamura vs daniel gracie Judo Martial art Royce Gracie Jujutsu Hidehiko Yoshida Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira Masahiko Kimura Professional wrestling throws B.J.
