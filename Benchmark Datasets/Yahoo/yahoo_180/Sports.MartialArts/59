is aikdo effective in real life fight there seems to be some soft akido which is more like a dance to the oth other end where i have seen it be brutal sharp hard and dangerous any thoughts aikido in my opinion tends to be naturally soft but it can be hard in some ways hard and soft martial arts or a combination of the two like goju ryu karate for example can be effective in fighting aikido has a lot of deep training in the mind it may not sound important but having the right mindset to use the right tactics and strategy work well for any situation whether you are fighting or not you use techniques to heighten your chances at getting a good outcome but being smarter than your opponent is an easy way to counter adversity such as less strength speed et cetera the techniques there's joint locking with some throwing mostly there's two major styles i've heard of ki aikido and i forgot the other one smacks forehead i don't want to go to wikipedia p most of the training is around learning how to use your opponents force against them for a throw or something to knock your opponent off balance in some way softness is about how the techniques are done by the way it's not style dependent nor does training have anything to do with it to some extent training style has a lot to do with whether or not training can be effective but regardless if that is true or not practicality and ability are very subjective no one person can defeat an entire style just people within them it is effective but the training in some cases is not very good and that may or may not break a student of aikido i've had my experience sparring with a couple of them and a good student with good training can do a good job lawless you obviously know nothing about either art because a hapkido classes involve sparring almost all the time i knew that before i started the style guess what is included in sparring too throwing and grappling b if you knew how to separate the concept of martial arts style and training method you would say a smarter comment than omgz dat style duz not werk omgzzzzzzzzzz one eleven Jujutsu Hapkido Mixed martial arts Goju Ryu Judo Tai Chi Chuan Chinese martial arts Eskrima Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Muay Thai Taekwondo The Book of Five Rings Grappling Professional wrestling holds Tenshinhan Lightsaber combat Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Akuma (Street Fighter) Sub-Zero Wing Chun Ranma __ characters Kalarippayattu Naruto jutsu Theory of conduct Kyokushin Social psychology Shaolin (martial arts) Genseiryu Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Eagle Claw Shotokan Bruce Lee Explosive material Consensus decision-making Sparring Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Social rule Chess strategy and tactics Choy Lee Fut Hatake Kakashi Wado Ryu Ninja Koichi Tohei Yoda Baseball Capoeira American football strategy Piccolo Junior Saga Password Music Neuro-linguistic programming Kata (martial arts) Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Redundant array of independent disks Meditation Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Computer chess Fast bowling Wushu Poker jargon Boxing Yagyu Shinkage-ryu Kung fu Experiment Force powers Vulcan (Star Trek) Ansatsuken Microeconomics Kumite Combat stress reaction Kenpo Scientific method MP3 Characters of Naruto Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Philosophy of language Parkour Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Drizzt Do'Urden Professional wrestling match types YuYu Hakusho Vovinam Weight training Cross-country skiing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tank
