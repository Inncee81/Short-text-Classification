any legitimate website that teaches the basics of fighting at the moment all i know about fighting is that you tackle someone make a fist and then attempt to bludgeon them in the face repeatedly and also are there any particular fighting styles that are easy for novices to pick up quickly and are effective and most importantly that you can learn without signing up for a class you can learn any style without attending a class or having an instructor the difference is you can't learn it well without those things it's akin to watching ufc and thinking you'll be able to learn how to grapple it just doesn't work that way i would strongly advise against trying to learn to fight from a website you are only partially right about fighting as well not all fights begin or even end up with a tackle in fact tackling someone is a very risky maneuver not only are you setting yourself up for an attack but you're effectively putting your head at a good level to get punched and or kicked and you might end the fight for yourself to answer the second part of your question what's easy for one person may be difficult for another so that's hard to answer however dependant upon your personality and dedication you may find a style with a school close to you that fits you you would just need to seek it out i would advise checking out what's in you area and even if you aren't looking to master a style trying them out and learning some of one at the very least if you spend months training to fight you'll be much better off than you were before hand good luck in your search for skill and knowledge Martial art Mixed martial arts Aikido Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Chinese martial arts Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Alexander Technique Tenshinhan Eskrima Taekwondo Fast bowling Theory of conduct Jujutsu Parachuting Tai Chi Chuan Professional wrestling attacks Social rule Capoeira Eagle Claw Tekken characters Graduate school Piccolo Junior Saga American football Ultimate Fighting Championship Hapkido Jade Empire Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Lightsaber combat Karate Past teachings of Prem Rawat Miyamoto Musashi Vegeta Shaolin (martial arts) Aesthetic Realism Jeet Kune Do Paragliding Fist of the North Star Royce Gracie Expert system Alcoholics Anonymous Professional wrestling holds Diving GED Volleyball Esperanto as an international language Tank Plame affair A Course In Miracles Naruto jutsu Akuma (Street Fighter) YuYu Hakusho Artemis Entreri Team Fortress Classic Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Reiki Education Jiddu Krishnamurti Blood (computer game) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Boxing Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Lebesgue integration Kalarippayattu Current teachings of Prem Rawat Philosophy of language Storyteller System Rugby league God Emperor of Dune American football strategy Consensus decision-making PRIDE Japanese tea ceremony Double Dragon Second language acquisition No Child Left Behind Act Carolina Panthers Autism Rugby union Visual Basic Drowning Rugby union positions Judo Tag Obedience training Quizbowl Xingyiquan Son Gohan Obi-Wan Kenobi Choy Lee Fut Scientology beliefs and practices Columbine High School massacre
