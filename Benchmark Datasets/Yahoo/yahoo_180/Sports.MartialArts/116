which is better karate or kung fu if you can be a master in karate or kung fu chinese martial arts which would you be considering you are at the same level in both mas all martial arts have they're good points i prefer kung fu much more than karate and have studied both i only did karate for year now have done kung fu for so i can't say i gave karate it's full chance my reasons primarily based on my experience only karate felt like i used only my arm to punch just my leg to kick where with kung fu i feel that i've been taught to use my core muscles primarily and the arm leg as extra i feel like i can hit a lot harder this way kung fu is more versatile the things to learn are a lot more varied so i didn't get bored so easily being phsically a smaller person i feel like kung fu was much more beneficial because it teaches the idea of not only using my whole body to defend but also how to redirect my opponents energy against them karate i felt was more like force impacting force where with kung fu it felt more like redirecting their energy right back on them b t w karate is not based in china Martial art Wing Chun Aikido Karate Chinese martial arts Tai Chi Chuan Goju Ryu Taekwondo Mixed martial arts Hapkido Punch (strike) Shaolin (martial arts) Kung fu Bruce Lee Shotokan Kung Fu Hustle Jujutsu Strike (attack) Wushu Bak Mei Eskrima Judo Qigong Sport Eagle Claw Muay Thai Professional wrestling holds Kickboxing Choy Lee Fut Kick Anko Itosu Volleyball Kata (martial arts) Kenpo American Kenpo Genseiryu Professional wrestling attacks Kung Fu Master Jeet Kune Do Martial arts film Lightsaber combat Pushing hands Piccolo Junior Saga Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Sanchin Zen Nunchaku Korean martial arts Xingyiquan Bodhidharma Terminal ballistics Diving Professional wrestling throws Weight training Tenshinhan Hung Gar First World Martial Arts Championship Saga The Karate Kid, Part III Qi Kajukenbo Uechi Ryu Equine conformation The Karate Kid Fencing Akuma (Street Fighter) Liu Kang (Mortal Kombat) Ranma __ characters Tekken Kung Fu (TV series) Aerial (dance move) Wado Ryu Wang Chongyang Northern Shaolin (martial art) Yiquan Ansatsuken Kung Lao Shorin-Ryu G.I.
