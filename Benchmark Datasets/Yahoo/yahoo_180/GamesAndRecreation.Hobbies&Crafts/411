has anyone used snap tape for baby clothes i am looking at some plastic snap tape is it hard to use i plan to make some baby sleep sacks with snaps tape along the bottom similar to the ones i found at nature baby com they should be pretty easy to make it seems as though this is what they used since the snaps are not visible on the out side what brands are the best for baby clothes i was thinking to use one with plastic snaps after you sew one side on the fabric snap the other side on then pin on opposite side of fabric then unsnap and sew that way they will be lined up properly hope this isn't confusing the metal snaps stand up better to multiple washings happy sewing Mattress Plastic Zipper Textile manufacturing terminology Textile manufacturing Sewing machine Typewriter Sewing Diaper Floppy disk Upholstery Undergarment Clothing Glossary of American football Bookbinding Climbing equipment My Little Pony Violin Jute Bong Strap-on dildo Casting Earring Chair Tent Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Kayak Hat Glossary of climbing terms Skateboarding trick Knitting Professional wrestling holds Applique Kimono Condom Drill bit M-209 Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Cricket ball Canoe Compact audio cassette Macbeth Volleyball Professional wrestling throws EastEnders Knots Landing Dinghy Leather Printed circuit board Suplex Knife American football strategy Gramophone record Poker jargon Movie projector Soap Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kilt Mouse (computing) Sniper Commodore 64 Quarterback Screw Glossary of nautical terms Billiards Autopsy Landing at Anzac Cove Bedbug Seismic retrofit Experiment Boat building Hand grenade Textile Camouflage Bicycle lighting Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Semiconductor fabrication Characters in the Smurfs Parachute Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Quilting Flag Titanium View camera STS-61 Stocking Model aircraft Comanche Gothic Lolita Yarn Homebuilt aircraft Backup Fabrication (metal) Carpet Solar cell AFI 100 Years series Starbucks Kimi Finster
