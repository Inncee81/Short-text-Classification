cosplay costume help please okay i need help on my akatsuki cloak i have all the materials i need to make it but i am just confused on how to sew it i have the pattern http cosplaywiki org index php akatsuki coat thats what i am going to go by but i am just confused on how to sew it anyone who made a cloak before and would take me through step by step would be very nice i just need tips on sewing it and about the seams and how to sew the red on the inner part and the collar ok i will try and help do you have the pieces all cut out if you do then sew just the two back pieces if you don't i highly suggest cutting out the back as one piece no seam to interfere with the design on the back if you have one there if you want a design on the back now is the time to sew it on it is also the time to sew the design on the front pieces before you sew them to the back now the designs only on the sleeves too just remember to keep the sewing lines in mind when doing this step to make it even easier you can draw in the sewing lines lightly with dressmakers chalk now after all that work is done pin the fronts to the back and sew together pin and sew the sleeves to the main body pin and sew the side seems all the way up to the end of the sleeves now do the same for the lining you are making this garment twice ok when the lining is done place in inside the cloak with seams facing each other the easiest way i could think of for a beginner is to slip stitch both sleeves at the opening i also would highly suggest that you hem the main coat and the lining separately the bottom of the coat will be open or again slip stitch it closed now for the collar it needs to be sewn on making sure you get both the outside and the lining together there are various sites online that can help you visually hope this helped a little Sewing Clothing Kimono Textile manufacturing terminology Stocking Shirt Sewing machine Kilt Knitting Upholstery Fast bowling Skirt and dress Pattern (sewing) Bookbinding Textile manufacturing Fencing Billiards Han Chinese clothing Mattress Glossary of nautical terms Swimsuit Carpet Professional wrestling holds Comanche Glossary of American football Earring Akatsuki (Naruto) Violin Clothing terminology Ajax (programming) Drill bit Applique Chess terminology Casting Dinghy Cross-stitch Fashion design Strap-on dildo Chemise Glossary of climbing terms Jack plug Japanese tea ceremony Vestment Quilting Tincture (heraldry) Coat (clothing) Welding Autopsy Starfleet ranks and insignia Chess Marching band Cricket ball Punt (boat) Snooker Canadian Armed Forces Straitjacket Order of the Garter Suture Cassock Harp Parachute Floppy disk Aikido Equine conformation Inspector Gadget Screw Colours, standards and guidons Knife Climbing equipment Glossary of partner dance terms Epaulette Sleeve Double bass Boxing Cosmic Era technology Undergarment Tipi Skinhead Irish dance United States Marine Corps Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Gurkha Contingent Canoe Heraldry Sleeve valve Chainmail Volleyball Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Horse Jesuit College Preparatory School Knot Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Archery Tatting Zipper Microphone
