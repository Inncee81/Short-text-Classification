dime without ridges i have a dime that does not have ridges it is the same size as a regular dime is it worth anything i also have a penny that is the same way was someone just playing around with them i did get them at different times and places the dime was on vacation two states away and the penny from a store in my town i meant to say that the penny doesn't have that lip on it it's smooth sorry the dime is im not sure about the penny a dime without ridges being released from the mint is highly unlikely but not impossible moe likely someone filed the ridges off for some reason it used to be when coins were silver and not sandwich with copper nickel that filing the edges of coins was a way to scavenge silver save enough filings and you could sell the raw silver the penny without the lip is another matter since the penny is struck in a die it can't not have an edge unless the die is that way which means a whole lot of lipless pennies are out there from that same die the dime could come out without ridges since the ridges are applied first and then the ridged blank is put through the die how old are these coins if the penny is newer than you will see gray silver zinc if you scrape the edge as after pennies are only copper plated zinc for the dime and other silver coins they started the sandwich thing with i think so shaving the ridges won't work if the silver coin is newer than take both to a coin dealer and have them examined by an expert and make sure you keep a close eye on the coins just in case United States dollar Coin Dime (U.S. coin) United States Mint Farthing (coin) Nickel (U.S. coin) Fischer Random Chess Canadian dollar Group 11 element British coin Florin History of the halfpenny British coinage Zinc History of the British penny (1714-1901) New Orleans Mint History of the threepence Kennedy half dollar Coin die United States dollar coin Penny (U.S. coin) Legal tender Sterling silver Australian dollar Money United States coinage Die making History of the English penny Jamaican dollar Coinage of the Republic of Ireland Pound sterling Roman currency Slot machine In God We Trust Floppy disk Gresham's law Philippine peso Gold standard U.S. two-dollar bill History of the British penny (1603-1714) Coin collecting Sacagawea Dollar Hyperinflation Royal Canadian Mint History of the English penny (1485-1603) Money in Harry Potter Morgan Dollar Currency Nickel Scapula Dime novel Saxophone Seated Liberty Dollar Laserdisc Mexican peso Brazing Coin Coalition South Korean won British Twenty-Five Pence coin History of the British penny (1901-1970) Double Nickels on the Dime Counterfeit MathCounts Brass British Two Pound coin Drill bit 1804 silver dollar British One Pound coin Euro Maundy money Glossary of American football Euro coins Nickel silver Riksdaler Pinball Rufiyaa Livre tournois Eisenhower Dollar Aluminium Betting (poker) Tin whistle Kitchen Coin grading Compact disc Maxilla Cymbal alloys Baht British Five Pound coin Terminal ballistics Jack Thompson Milled coinage Pacific, Missouri Copper British coin Guinea Sheffield plate Handloading
