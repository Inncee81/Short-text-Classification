how do you cut mm acrylic perspex and not using laser cutting i am trying to create my jewelry but all i have is clay ive heard from many people that make flat scene jewelry cut into shapes use acrylic plastic i know that not everyone is going to be like hmm i wanna make jewelry from acrylic lets go buy a laser machine not everyone has that kind of money and i also understand that not everyone is going to go buy a large saw blade or a jigsawblade because they can cut there hands fingers off what other options are there i see so many sites that use acrylic based jewelry that they cut has anyone ever seen the scene diamond with a sawblade how in the freak would you cut the tiny wholes shapes out with it and so evenly and and straight its almost impossible someone please help me out ive read everything you can try cutting it on either side and snapping it but how would you do that around a shape if you want examples go to kiki kannibals jewelry site or love bites and brushes please help to diy you will need acrylic that is less than thick and a sharp blade you'll also need a steady hand a lot of patience also the material will be weaker than if you go down the laser cutting route the reason a lot of people will reccomend using laser cutting services such as lovebites and bruises is because in some instances they are actually cheaper than buying the acrylic and cutting it yourself as they bulk order and bulk laser cut so for the price of a sheet of acrylic you might as well get it cut into your shape and sent to you Knife Bulk vending Polymethyl methacrylate Knitting Solar cell Welding Plastic Woodworking Diamond cut Casting Laser engraving Table saw Glass Brush Space elevator Jewellery Laser Textile manufacturing Paint Lightsaber Gramophone record Manicure Airsoft Saw Dice Pottery Laserdisc Scissors Poker jargon Barbell (piercing) Floppy disk Cardboard Leaf Naruto jutsu Genericized trademark IMac Axe Screw Violin Mattress Tank Radio controlled airplane Drawing Table tennis Combine (Half-Life 2) Mouse (computing) Upholstery Guitar Polymer clay Microeconomics Diamond enhancement Metalworking Bassoon Terminal ballistics Carbon nanotube Diamond simulant Spark plug Brewery Anchor CPU design Katana Envelope Compact disc Volleyball Synthetic diamond Acrylic paint Little Britain Nail (anatomy) Illegal drug trade Sharpening stone Dinghy Filigree Traditional animation Body piercing Skateboarding trick Dairy Ford Motor Company Slide rule Typewriter Wheel of Fortune Computer Musical box Printed circuit board Sword Loudspeaker Gas metal arc welding IPod Ives Manufacturing Company Moonraker Diamond clarity Lego Plane (tool) Solar sail
