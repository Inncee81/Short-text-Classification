how do i get better with my interpretation its for figure skating suppose none of us could hear your program music how would you show us by your entire body facial language what your music is about what kinds of emotions if any stir up inside you when you hear your skating music how can you take what's inside and show it on the outside how can you make your audience feel what you feel how can you make your audience connect to your skating and want to watch you skate think of skating as storytelling you're the actor on stage you need to attach personality to your program maybe connecting a character or scenario to your music would help you act out in your skating you need to show visually the mood of the music happy sad romance bravery etc arms are not the only part of artistry but it may help to start there think of creating different shapes throughout your program think of your entire arm all the way through the fingertips don't just put your arm up think like you are reaching for a star or trying to reach out to someone in the audience think that you are this small on the ice and that your arm movements are going to help you look bigger i like to think of skating as dancing on ice because i love dance but some skaters who may love to skate may not be into dancing find your groove turn on your favorite pieces of music and pretend you are being taped for a dance skate video no matter what the music is turn on your old skating program pieces see if you can re interpret them better off the ice i don't know what level you're at but maybe it'd be good to enter some artistic events where lyrics are allowed where you would definitely be judged on music interpretation the lyrics give you a script now you just have to interpret it with your skating and when you do your program for real i suggest you put on the act real thick we tend to tone down out there so you almost need to overact to the point where you think it looks ridiculous in actuality it'll be convincing pour your heart out music the magic of figure skating by sonia bianchetti here she talks about figure skating being both a sport and art http www soniabianchetti com writings music html and if you read through my entire answer you would have had time to take a ballet class hee hee seriously if you can make the time do take a ballet class or at least a dance class that interests you and possibly an acting class hope that helps Figure skating The Ashlee Simpson Show Roller skating Michelle Kwan Theatre Ice hockey I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Theory of conduct Compulsory figures Cyberspace Marching band Winter Olympic Games Music genre Romantic music Artistic roller skating Speed skating Mixtape Art Empathy Storytelling Current teachings of Prem Rawat Kimi Finster Roxette Novel Philosophy of language Kylie Minogue Garth Brooks Tony Bennett Skateboarding trick Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Whose Line Is It Anyway?
