i need help in a sports related topic if anyone knows how to land an axel in ice skating could u plz help me boy this question popped up a lot this week here is my generic answer some axel tips you need to get the height in your jump before you rotate remember the higher your jump the more time you will have to rotate in the air to make your landing make sure your shoulders hips are level bend that take off knee in your entrance make sure the shoulder on your take off side doesn't creep back otherwise your hip will follow and cause you to prerotate do not prerotate besides the fact it would be cheated you'd be jumping sideways and won't get the height jump up not around use your arms to help you lift up kick your free leg straight through and think of putting your knee up not out like a waltz jump last thing to leave the ice is that toe pick at the height of your jump bring your arms in and cross your legs into your back spin position essentially a loop stand tall in the air and not break at the waist practice axel entrance back spins same thing to say waltz jump back spin but if you say axel entrance that will get your knee up unlike a true waltz jump when you jump think to cross your legs and be in back spin position before you land try to stop your back spin with a check out at the right time as you would for axel you can do this off ice as well do a couple side hops for momentum before you step to jump if you haven't already try it on the harness with your coach it may give you that little bit of confidence you need to land that jump good luck on landing your axel Axel jump Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling holds Glossary of ballet terms Equine conformation Volleyball Glossary of partner dance terms Professional wrestling attacks Pole vault Fast bowling Charleston (dance move) Cheerleading Professional wrestling aerial techniques Piledriver (professional wrestling) Suplex Loop jump Lindy Basic Diving Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Circle (dance move) Toe loop jump Salchow jump Boxing Artistic roller skating Powerbomb Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Breaststroke Horse Backstroke Clean and jerk DDT (professional wrestling) Backbreaker Parade (military) Side pass (dance move) Horizontal bar Muay Thai Lead and follow (dance) Jazz dance moves Strap-on dildo Contredanse Casualty lifting Ice hockey New York Giants Parachuting Table tennis Textile manufacturing Fencing Tango (dance) Kick Kitesurfing Neckbreaker Front crawl Mario Helicopter Flip jump Baroque chess Limit Break Punch (strike) Snooker High jump Glossary of climbing terms Piccolo Junior Saga Billiards Dressage Tonya Harding Blood (computer game) Ski Rugby union Dai dai shogi Snowboarding Tai shogi Golf Salute Mario series enemies Brian Boitano Press Your Luck Weight training Shawn Michaels Double bass Waltz Dai shogi Wind turbine Car handling Philosophy of space and time The Price Is Right Paragliding Badminton Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Michelle Kwan Types of bowlers in cricket
