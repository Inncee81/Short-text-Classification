prferring to be alone mostly is it strange for a man years to prefer to spend his life alone my first relationship was a man i was it was ok for a bit but he drank alot alot had a temper and would ignore me for days walking right by and not a word we fought so much and booze didn't help each other emoy tinally my second was long distance i was he was and a mean drunk loved to play games while drunk he admitted he was using me because he can't get the guys he wants whoaa i walked awy from him and never looked back the rd and last was an ex married guy with kids we had mothing in common except sex and after several fights and him seeing others i said why do you come around he said you know that was that my family life was riddled with drug problems really stressed me out im anxious as is so now at i feel i need to give to me in the past off and on years i have taken trips to new england and pa with a plantonic friend wanna go again but no romances it sounds like you have had lots of hard times with relationships i am sorry that the guys you have dated had problems with alcohol and or drugs it is possible to find someone out there in the world who doesn't do those things at this point anyone who is into this kind of behaviour should be at the bottom of your dating list i would recommend you to just try to enjoy life as it comes and to try and make friends with people you may also ask yourself why you allowed yourself to get involved with those kinds of guys was it low self esteem no other prospects or a genuine interest in the person whatever the answer to your question try to figure it out because that will help you to know yourself better and to make choices against the kinds you have made in the past i would also recommend just getting on match com and trying to make friends that way all good relationships start with a real chemistry between two people people who could be friends just as easily as lovers Humphrey Bogart Human sexual behavior Theory of conduct Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Maison Ikkoku Sex and the City Liam Gallagher Time Out of Mind About a Boy Nicomachean Ethics The Smoking Room Transactional analysis Pitaten Avenue Q EastEnders Alcoholic beverage BDSM Little Britain Alcoholics Anonymous Rape Infantilism Boston Public Microeconomics Days of our Lives Expert system Dead Like Me Poker jargon Sant Thakar Singh The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sexual orientation Socrates Recurring South Park characters Hey Jude The Catcher in the Rye Prostate cancer Daredevil Oasis (band) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Borderline personality disorder Knots Landing Undergrads The Amber Spyglass Polyamory Shaggy dog story Free will Hollyoaks Goodness and value theory Traumatic incident reduction Anal sex Law of value The O.C.
