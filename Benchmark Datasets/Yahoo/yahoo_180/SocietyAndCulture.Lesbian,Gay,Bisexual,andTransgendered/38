in my medical center said the gays and bisexual people can't give blood it means they are anti gay or we have something in us that they dont like i hate that paper with that rules well i am not gonna tell that i am gay i live in mexico in a small town i don't know about mexico but in the us men aren't allowed to give blood who have had anal sex if you're gay but haven't had that kind of sex technically you can donate blood without having to lie however to answer your question it's an old law that resulted from both a homophobic society and a society that didn't understand everything at the time it hasn't been revisited mainly because homophobic republicans still want to pin hiv aids as a 'gay disease ' when it isn't at all gay people aren't any more of a risk than anyone else especially given that all blood is tested now as long as you are being responsible meaning you're not having unprotected sex and you're regularly getting tested for hiv you should absolutely be able to donate blood something that gay people in pretty much every european country can do Human sexual behavior AIDS Anal sex Homophobia AIDS in the United States Gay rights Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Same-sex marriage AIDS pandemic Gay Duesberg hypothesis Pornographic movie Theory of conduct Food and Drug Administration HIV test AIDS reappraisal Blood donation HIV Timeline of AIDS Gay bathhouse Safe sex Singapore gay equality movement Hepatitis C Gay slang Religion and sexual orientation Sex education Crystal methamphetamine and sex Sexual orientation Barebacking Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus AIDS in Africa Methamphetamine Anti-gay slogan Queer Oral sex Pornographic actor Blood transfusion Reparative therapy Homosexuality Ex-gay Biology and sexual orientation Condom Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Outing Marriage Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Section 28 Religion and sexuality Sexual intercourse Homosexuality and Christianity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Lawrence v.
