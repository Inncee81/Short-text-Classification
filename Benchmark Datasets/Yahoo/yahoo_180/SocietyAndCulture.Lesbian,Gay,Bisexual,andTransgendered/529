meeting gays esbians i have never jad a committed relationship with a woman i have however had a sexual relationship with a woman for about two years now we've talked about it and have always basically agreed that we have feelings for eachother but we'd never come out we'd just have this secret lately i have started getting jealous i found her fooling around with my brother and confronted her about it she reminded me i'm not her girlfriend and have no reason to be upset then she went on to say how she'll never care for me as much as i do for her although she says she does care i can't even think about anything else right now my brother rubs it in my face he doesnt know about she and i anyway she has a boyfriend she's supposed to be pretty serious about they've been dating almost a year she's a single mom w kids and i'm always helping out butr in the end i'm just feeling used and jealous and i can't stand feeling this jealous it's not me oops re the whole title thing and where might i be able to meet gays lesbians just to explore whether that's what i am or if it was just a thing with she and i thx i'm thinking about writing a letter is that a bad idea if i do that what's something good to include in there i really think you need to lose this girl how can someone have a sexual relationship with another person for two years and not get attached to them or want a relationship with them it sounds to me like she is using you for sex and it is obvious that you want more than that or you wouldnt be jealous you two want two different things and it is not worth wasting your time you deserve to be in her life not or put a personal ad up online that is how i met my gf of two years now i was leary about it but it really allows you to make what you want known from the start and you are able to weed out those who are not looking for the same good luck hun About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Sexual orientation Boston Public Human sexual behavior Sex and the City Avenue Q Social rule Laura Schlessinger Homosexuality and transgender Theory of conduct EastEnders Kodocha Transsexuality Recurring South Park characters Maison Ikkoku Badly Drawn Kitties Polyamory Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Something Positive Gay slang Pitaten The Ashlee Simpson Show Kyle Broflovski The Smoking Room Great Teacher Onizuka Homosexuality and Christianity Will & Grace George Costanza Big Brother UK series 6 Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Male prostitute Philip J.
