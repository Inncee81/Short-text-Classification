what's up with using lgbt vs glbt like some people use lgbt and others use glbt i personally think lgbt is easier to say with it starting with a vowel but then some say glbt maybe it goes by more commonly recognized because there are less transgendered than there are lesbian but i believe there are more bisexuals than all of them and i think the lesbian and gay population is pretty equal so it should go blgt maybe ladies first i meant to say starting with a vowel sound not vowel typo maybe they should just be ontop of eachother like a fraction but then people would start fighting over whod be on top lmao maybe it should be tlbg to make everyone happy but someone would fight about that too make love not warr LGBT Gay community Gay Bisexuality Homosexuality Gay rights Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Gay slang Queer Sexual orientation Homophobia Transvestism National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce Human Rights Campaign Violence against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered Transgender Lambda Literary Award Pride parade Drag queen Metropolitan Community Church Egale Canada Coming out Same-sex marriage Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Homosexuality and transgender Transsexuality Lesbian Wilson Cruz Homosexuality in Singapore Gay pride Welcoming Congregation Queer theology Sex education The Celluloid Closet Gay rights timeline Gender role Homosexuality and Christianity Same-sex marriage in the United States Section 28 Harvey Milk Liberal Democrats (UK) Logo (TV channel) Homosexuality and Neopaganism International Lesbian and Gay Association Church and Wellesley Vowel Marriage Pronoun game Homosexuality and Scientology Dyke (lesbian) Reparative therapy Transwoman Lesbian feminism Homosexuality and Judaism Day of Silence Heteronormativity Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto Heterophobia London Lesbian and Gay Centre Anal sex Vowel length Phoneme Two-Spirit Gay-Straight Alliance Homosexuality laws of the world Gay agenda CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Autogynephilia Feminism Europride Diacritic Ohio Wesleyan University History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Korean language The closet Log Cabin Republicans Non-native pronunciations of English George Hislop History of the Gay Community Religion and sexual orientation BDSM Ex-gay Same-sex marriage in Spain Civil unions in Ireland Heterosexuality Homosexuality in China Montrose, Houston Human sexual behavior Libby Davies Group sex Hangul Wheel of Fortune Slash fiction Outing Transphobia Terminology of homosexuality Gay village Pinyin Stonewall (UK) Alyson Publications
