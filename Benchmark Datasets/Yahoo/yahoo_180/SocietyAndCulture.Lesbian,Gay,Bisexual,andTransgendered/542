is it possible for the gay and christian world to find unity the answer is yes i know this sounds really pushy but i just got back from chautauqua and i saw this amazing movie by dan karslake called for the bible tells me so it is very much pro gay and it is very much pro religion www forthebibletellsmeso org it interviews five very normal very christian very american families who have enough insight to accept their gay children it talks about literalism and how people take the bible and use it as a weapon like how being gay is considered quote an abomination and then a page later eating shrimp and wearing linen and wool together is an abomination the bible was made thousands of years ago and back then population was declining and gay relationships aren't exactly baby making ones back then abomination meant going against custom it was against custom to eat certain foods and wear certain clothes and to waste semen where it was desperately needed needless to say the population emergency has deflated and now gays lesbians bisexuals and transgendered people everywhere are facing prejudice and we get bible verses shoved in our faces any time we act out against it but you know what the bible was written by people and now it is being misinterpreted by people and they need to be educated we need more priests or bishops like gene robertson that's why i telling you all about this film i want it to get as many viewers as possible i want it in every movie theater across america but it needs your help now if it doesn't make money now film makers can't bump it up to the big screen so check out the website and look for local viewings and spread the word spread the message show christianity for what it should be gay friendly hi there brandy i completely and utterly agree with you as a university graduate who read history i have found that the bible is a great history book however it is as you say open to much misinterpretation people certainly do take the bible and use it as a weapon in the time when the bible was written culture and attitudes were very different then as were the meanings and definitions of certain words just as you have given as an example in the word 'abomination ' people take the bible too literally and adapt the 'meanings' to suit their attitudes i will certainly look out for this film and pass on the message all the best o Homosexuality and Christianity Gay Lesbian Christianity New Testament Bible Homophobia Nation of Islam Criticisms of Christianity Religion and sexual orientation Book of Mormon Creationism Gender role A Course In Miracles Transgender Anglican views of homosexuality Same-sex marriage Biblical inerrancy Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Friends Infantilism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pornographic movie Literature Korban Gay rights Same-sex marriage in Canada Evolutionary creationism Arab Alan Campbell (pastor) Gay slang Judaism Seventh-day Adventist Church Social rule Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Book of Isaiah Human sexual behavior Religion and sexuality Abrahamic religion Fundamentalism Literacy Transsexuality Homosexuality and Scientology EastEnders Polygamy Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Moses Societal attitudes towards homosexuality The Amazing Race Effeminacy History of sex Religion Motion picture rating system Christianity and anti-Semitism Book of Daniel Jew Urantia Little Britain Unitarian Universalism Marriage Queer Idolatry Creation according to Genesis Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Mormonism and Judaism Moloch Jewish principles of faith Ramakrishna Bible translations Old Testament Intelligent design Discordianism Jerry Falwell Biblical studies Christian right Sabbath The Two Babylons Margaret Cho Section 28 Mahatma Gandhi Homosexuality in China Genesis Theology Predestination
