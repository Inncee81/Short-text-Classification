gay catty men i have a friend who is gay and he said there are a lot of catty gay men and jealousy between them is this true and also how about between lesbians i don't want to start an argument i'm just trying to see his side and what other gay people have to say about this thank you guys for your honest answers it is true the cattiness between gay men is very relevant my personal opinion of why this is so is because one it is a defense mechanism to shield the vulnerability or a character defect of the sort or two to express envy or jealousy towards others i myself used to be very sarcastic and caddy though i have realized that it hurts people and that in order for myself not to be hurt i needed to change my behavior therefore i can start a chain of events to reverse the effect it has on me yes i understand that this is a very selfish motive behind my trying to be a better person but it works for me i am making the effort by laying the groundwork for better relationships in the future on the other point about the same behavior in the lesbian culture i understand it is the same but practice more often than not more subtly and more vindictively though i do not have the personal knowledge of that to have an educated opinion based on the fact that i am not a lesbian Lesbian Bisexuality Sexual orientation Religion and sexual orientation Transgender Gender role Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Theory of conduct Gay Reparative therapy Homosexuality Internet troll Coming out Homosexuality and Christianity Homophobia Gay rights Transsexuality Will & Grace Same-sex marriage in the United States Human sexual behavior Friends Religion and sexuality Same-sex marriage Polyamory Domestic violence Alignment (role-playing games) Same-sex marriage in Canada Causality David Hume Queer Ex-gay Gay slang Nicomachean Ethics Effeminacy Revolutionary Girl Utena Asperger syndrome Homosexuality and medical science Simone Weil Outing Free will Social rule Zoophilia People With AIDS Self-Empowerment Movement BDSM Prisoner's dilemma North American Man/Boy Love Association Homosexuality and transgender Numerology Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Expert system Theodicy Biology and sexual orientation LGBT Cultural relativism Anal sex Determinism Laura Schlessinger Rape Deaf culture Karen Horney Slander and libel Anderson Cooper Meaning of life Insanity defense Autism rights movement Plame affair Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Intelligent design Section 28 Marriage Don't ask, don't tell Martial art Gay community Feminism Estoppel Aesthetic Realism Social psychology Dissociative identity disorder Evil Economic inequality General relativity Athrun Zala Aristotle Narcissism Anglican views of homosexuality Boston Public New Testament Objectivist philosophy Transvestism Coercion Guru Mathematics One Tree Hill (TV series) Irony Hate speech
