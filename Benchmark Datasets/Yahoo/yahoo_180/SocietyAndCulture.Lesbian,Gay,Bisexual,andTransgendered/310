am i right or over reacting so there is this guy at this gym i go to who always talks to me he's nice but talks a lot way to much i am nice to him and let him talk and talk even though i am there to work out and that's it but one thing i notice about him is that he always watches me always it slightly makes me uncomfortable he goes to machines that i am on from behind and watches me too he stares at my body he also watches me from the mirror from distances this is constant i feel bad because i am not to comfortable with this guy but i am afraid to say anything to him because ne never talks about me being gay or him being gay he is not american and am afraid that he knows he's gay but does not talk about it at all if i say something he might get defensive and potentially violent as this is always the case with guys who are like that is he kind of stalking me with the staring and watching i also feel bad because when i keep conversations short and quick because i am there to work out not socialize a lot he feels as if i am supposed to talk to him just as much and if i don't i'm a jerk i don't mean to be i am just there to work out ya know but he watches me a lot what does this mean is he being aggressive and stalking me or no i am thinking that too but oh how inconviencancing spelling i think he's crushing on you and admiring your body if you don't like it and don't want to hurt his feelings you could try to switch your gym time or you could politely say to him yeah i'm really trying to focus i've been slacking lately with my workout and put headphones on then just try to ignore him i know what you mean about being there to work out and being uncomfortable the same thing happened to me with some guy in a yellow spandex outfit and after i had old creepy fat men staring at me in the locker room i never went back so try to be polite to him and just basically let him know that you are there to work out and that's it or you could always start talking about your boyfriend to him that might also help or get someone you know to go with you to the gym as he might back down from you then Social rule Little Britain Theory of conduct Friends Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Andrew Dice Clay Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Weight training The Ashlee Simpson Show Megan Griffin Gay slang Totally Spies!
