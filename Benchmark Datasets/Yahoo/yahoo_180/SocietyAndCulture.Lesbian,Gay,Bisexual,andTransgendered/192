first gay experience yesterday and im confused yesterday i had my first gay experience i enjoyed it but it didn't feel right it was different because ive been with women but it felt awkward and not right i didnt feel comfortable at all i thought that if i tried it out that it would answer my question that if me having feelings towards guys were just hormones or more im not quite sure what to do now i mean i enjoyed it but like i said it didnt feel right what does this mean any thoughts or suggestions thanks if you felt like you were doing something morally wrong for you then i'd take that as my sign that this wasn't a lifestyle that i was comfortable leading but if you just thought that it was awkward i think most people gay straight lesbian bi etc feel that way during their first time maybe taking the time to become more comfortable with your partner so you can better communicate what you want and the pace you're comfortable going at would help you enjoy it more don't let all the bashers in here bother you i've always found it so amusing that people who claim to hate gays so much and be so repulsed by their behaviors are the ones that you can't beat out of the gay and lesbian section with a stick i hope you find what you're looking for i wish you luck Homophobia Sexual orientation Transsexuality Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Human sexual behavior Anal sex Homosexuality Biology and sexual orientation Ex-gay Friends Bisexuality Strap-on dildo Homosexuality and transgender Avenue Q Milton H.
