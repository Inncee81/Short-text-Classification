should i be mad at my boyfriend for telling me that he is gay after yrs of dating we broke up a while ago but i am still not over it we broke up a while ago but im still not over it personally i think i should be mad because we grew up together he had so many times to tell me i just feel like i wasted freakin yrs you have every right to be angry i can't think of a single straight woman who wouldn't be enraged at that i've been dating my boyfriend for years now and if he told me he was gay i can't even imagine how devastated and betrayed i would feel it would be really hard to trust another guy after that however staying angry at him doesn't really help you it's not going to change the fact that he's gay and it's not going to help you get over it any faster i think you have to try to forgive him and move on i've found that really making an effort to forgive someone even when it's hard really helps me feel better in the long run if it would help maybe you should try talking to him not to tear into him but to let him know exactly what he did to you and how much you're hurting over it sometimes just getting those emotions off of your chest do wonders for you especially when you have the freedom to tell the person who hurt you what he she did to you a heartfelt apology for stringing you along could go a long way that being said one of my best friends dated two guys who turned out to be gay before she found mr right so don't worry there's hope good luck EastEnders Friends Kodocha Tenshinhan Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Eddie Guerrero Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ron Weasley Sin City Sex and the City One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Ranma __ characters Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an St. Elmo's Fire (film) Laura Schlessinger Boston Public Dawson's Creek Mystique (comics) Series finale God Emperor of Dune Characters of Naruto Pitaten Wallflower (comics) Jam (TV series) Rent (musical) Jean Grey Domestic violence The Ashlee Simpson Show The Amber Spyglass Everwood Darth Vader Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Pok__mon Live!
