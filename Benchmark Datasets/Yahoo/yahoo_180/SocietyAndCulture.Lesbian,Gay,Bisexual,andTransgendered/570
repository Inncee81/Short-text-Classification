how do i explain my bi sexuallity to my friends and family i am and i have both a girlfriend and a boyfriend and i don't know how to tell my family about my relationships the reason i ask is beacuse my family has invited me to come over for a family dinner and i don't know who to bring my gf or my bf or both but how would i explain that to my mom and dad why not wait a while i don't really think there is any rule that you have to tell your family about your sexual desires and preferences it's way too much information for them anyway if you tell them then be prepared for them to get involved in your private business the only person in this world that knows my fantasies and what turns me on and i like all kinds of things is my wife i think some things should stay private let me ask you this do your boyfriend and girlfriend know about each other i am guessing they don't but if they do more power to you that should be enough honesty to make you happy without involving your family who are most likely going to judge you for it anway Infantilism Theory of conduct Phoebe Buffay's songs One Tree Hill (TV series) Human sexual behavior The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sexual orientation Calvin and Hobbes Current teachings of Prem Rawat The O.C.
