do u fit the typical gay stereotype reason i ask is i have a problem w dating and meeting other gay guys i'll illaberate here i'm as gay as they come but i'm messy disorganized i luv heavy metal i'm not into the whole gay scene or rainbows and all that stuff most of the gay guys i've met r slutty as slutty can be i'm looking for a real relationship i don't get along with many gay guys for sum reason they're too meticulous vain conceided or plain luking for a piece of ass i get along mostly with girls of course lol but then again i get along with guys but i don't really fit in as much cause im not sporty into beer or cars but i can guarantee i can out burp any of them lol i don't know just seeing if i am crazy or if others can relate in here maybe i just haven't found the right guy or i need a new group of friends or sumthing plus i'm bored can't sleep and wanted to release sum thoughts i have within this psychotic brain of mine lmfao peace out heck i am not even sure if being gay even should be in the equation at all lol most of us who are different and by different i mean we refuse to conform or follow trends or perpetuate stereotypes have difficulty finding the right person as a straight female i can say with some confidence that what you are feeling is true for so many other people whether you are gay or straight the popular trend of today is shallowness the me attitude decadence promiscuity slutiness high maintenance etc but there are a lot of people out there who don't want these popular types of people i was one of them my boyfriends were always funny intellectual weird and artistic you just need to find someone who suits you is all and because you have higher standards than the norm that might be a bit more difficult but well worth the wait trust me i know i found my man through a deep friendship that blossomed into something more and we are still together years and two kids later moral of the story you are young and you will eventually find someone that is right for you so for now sit back relax and enjoy the ride and pride yourself on not being from the shallow end of the rock pool Avenue Q Gender role Shaggy dog story Sexual orientation EastEnders Human sexual behavior Transsexuality Humphrey Bogart Homosexuality Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Gay slang Pure Pwnage Recurring South Park characters Boston Public Kyle Broflovski Married... with Children Garth Brooks Sex and the City Singapore gay equality movement The O.C.
