what did she mean when she said you're making me nervous i had my hands on her shoulders standing up and she was sitting she knows that i really like her i was going to ask her why she said that but i forgot we talk casually she's in my class i know she doesn't have any feelings for me just wondering why she would say that just maybe she means she is getting feelings when you touch her and it is confusing her maybe your awakening her sexual urges and she doesn't know what to do just be gentle and have a talk to her she may open up to you in more ways than one Milton H.
