first lesbian interest how do i know if its flirting or just friendship i'm a year old female and have been with guys but i had a few younger age encounters with girls and no relationships ever i was just with the same guy for years and we broke up almost months ago i haven't really had anything serious since i recently met this girl who is openly gay and has grown up like that i've starting talking to her and really like her for various reasons i just don't know how to distinguish between her flirting with me or just being a friend what are some things i should look out for i guess and how would i let her know i am interested in more than friendship does she know of your past experiences if not and all she knows is that you just ended a year relationship with a guy its likely she assumes your straight and she like so many of us know better than to get emotional or interested or what ever about a straight person as it usually just leads to upset or heartache so its all on you you need to let her know your not just playing for one team or are interested in being a switch hitter and then you gotta get clever cute and really flirty if she is interested in you as a friend and you make it known to her you are interested in getting to know her better then that will open the gates for you i cant promise she will be into you but there is only one way to find out Friends Social rule Ex-gay Human sexual behavior Something Positive Gender role Gay Gay slang Lesbian One Tree Hill (TV series) El Goonish Shive Dead Like Me Sexual orientation Love Hina main characters Humphrey Bogart Friendship Will & Grace Infantilism Pitaten Anderson Cooper Neighbours Pok__mon Live!
