why did roosevelt gave half of europe to stalin in after wilson created the base for ww with the peace threaty of versailles in the usa and western allies tried to be more practical with its peace threaty in creating an ally in germany instead of an enemy that was good but why in the world was stalin already a threat given the means to be a super power was it the same reason islamic terror states like saudi arabia nd pakistan are supported by bush to make sure we can justify a trillion a year military roosevelt promised stalin already in half of europe against advice of churchill the the allies waited on the rhine for month until the russians made it into berlin that's a great analogy fdr did give away half of europe at yalta in about months before the bomb was operational at potsdam in truman mentioned to stalin that the us had a secret weapon that would bring the pacific war to a close stalin replied use it well comrade indeed we should have used it on the ussr after defeating japan truman should not have honored fdr's agreement the ussr was in ruins and had yet to acquire even the jet airplane we held all the cards and we could've saved eastern europe four decades of misery i believe fdr wanted a swift victory in europe and was willing to go more than half way to satisfy stalin the conspiracy theory that the division was used to start an arms build up to profit the defense industry is plausable again your analogy between fdr and bush both willing to satisfy our enemies at a high price is a good one bush is prudent to assist pakistan but he's too close to saudi arabia for our good Franklin D.
