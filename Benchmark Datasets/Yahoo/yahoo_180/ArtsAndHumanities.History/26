hiroshima equal peace after visiting hiroshima museum i have seen the japanese have down played their role during ww but instead i sensed some hidden message that is asking why the american used the atomic bomb on these cities and are they using japan as a guinea pig on their latest technology every year they repeated the protest about war now can somebody tells me what make america retaliates if is because the japanese bombed pearl harbour what happen if after pearl harbour would the japanese continues to attack america if america did retaliates should read as america did not retaliates about the nanking massacre yes in the museum the japanese put in a figure of to only and further add on however china's figure is joriental i read vaguely and did not find that there 's any declaration by the japanese infact it was surprised attack as written right at the beginning of the web you have provided it was further mentioned on next page that in the japanese foreign minister said the japanese intended to declare war with us just mins b the supposed attack on pearl harbour pls enlighthen further if i missed any point it 's hard to tell if your question asks why america went to war or what america dropped the atomic bomb the hiroshima nagasaki bombs were not 'tests' or 'experimenting' and the decision to use the bombs was not taken lightly us government was more honourable back then it also needs to be remembered that the a bomb was new and little understood technology it was not until years into the cold war that it was fully realised that the a bomb was a whole new moral level of war rather than just another weapon the main reasons the bomb was used were the horrific casualties the allies faced in invading japan japan was obviously defeated from mid but they fought harder and harder fanatically to the last soldier and on okinawa many civilians as well the japanese army revered their emperor as a god and would fight as long as he told them to and he showed no inclination whatsoever to negotiate peace even though the war was utterly futile and destroying japan i am greatly opposed to the use of excessive force in war and the needless killing of civilians but the decision to use the a bomb was absolutely right and the japanese need to ask themselves why they were doing what they did mass murder rape torture chemical warfare experiments militant expansionism compared to germany they have a very unhealthy view of their nation's cations between and Nuclear weapon Pacific War Strategic bombing Surrender of Japan Hiroshima Military history of the United States RAF Bomber Command Participants in World War II Korean War Cold War Operation Downfall Nuclear warfare Second Sino-Japanese War War Polish September Campaign History of nuclear weapons Attack on Pearl Harbor Bombing of Dresden in World War II Strategic bombing during World War II Japanese war crimes U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Isoroku Yamamoto Winter War 2003 Invasion of Iraq Military history of the Soviet Union God Emperor of Dune Terror bombing Gulf War Franco-Prussian War Battle of Okinawa Iraq War Total war Timeline of World War II Crime against humanity European Theatre of World War II Robert Oppenheimer Chemical warfare Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Suicide bombing Empire of Japan Japanese militarism Russell-Einstein Manifesto International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement War of 1812 Shock and Awe Japanese history textbook controversies History of Korea (1900___1950) Aerial warfare Trinity test World War II casualties Japanese atomic program USS Ammen (DD-527) USS Yorktown (CV-10) Kosovo War Anti-Japanese sentiment Militia Blitzkrieg Mutual assured destruction United States Air Force Hirohito Nuclear arms race History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953) Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II History of Japan Battle of the Coral Sea Vo Nguyen Giap Lord's Resistance Army B-29 Superfortress History of the United States Bombing of Tokyo in World War II Terrorism in Kashmir Iran's nuclear program Treaty of Versailles Opposition to U.S. foreign policy Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia Peleliu Terrorism against Israel Nagasaki Battle of the Aleutian Islands detailed account Nanking Massacre Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Iran-Iraq War John Sheridan (Babylon 5) War of the Austrian Succession Imperial Japanese Army Sabra and Shatila massacre Battle of Berlin Governments' positions pre-2003 invasion of Iraq
