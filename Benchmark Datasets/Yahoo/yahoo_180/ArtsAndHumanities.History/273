crusades a real question ok this isnt a religious based reason im athesit so yea during school i was taught that the crusades were almost purely political although some might say that it was a purely defensive move i have to ask why then did they not just go against the ottoman turks the ones who were actually raiding their lands also then why did the europeans send a crapload of untrained soldiers begger theives and other unwanted people from the overcrowded cities of europe also from a political and economical standpoint you can clearly see why anyone would want to invade the middle east the middle east is in a gigantic trade route with cities like mecca jerusalem etc you could make a huge profit out of taxes of course political figures such as the pope could have reasoned that jerusalem was the home of christians and rightously belonged to them if i have these facts wrong say so and plz have multiple websites to prove your answer i still might be stubborn d is catholic your are mistaken in that catholics thought that jerusalem belonged to them remember that islam had control of jerusalem and middle eastern trade routes for centuries before the crusades it is not as if jerusalem was taken over and then the pope sent an army to take it back as for why did europe send a crapload of untrained soldiers that is because that is all there was in europe at the time europe especially at the start of the first crusade was a real backwater filled with minor kingdoms fighting each other there were no overcrowded cities of europe outside of italy and the ruined roman towns everything was small villages surrounding a keep or rudimentary castle of the feudal lord those people went because that was what could be sent if you want to talk about politics one of the major impulses of the vatican was to try to get the minor kingdoms to stop fighting each other the vatican was always interested in alliances and building peace in europe part of the crusades really was about uniting europe against a common cause which was the encroachment and harassment of the islamic caliphates on europe control of the trade routes was never a factor for the vatican it was interested in protecting people that went on the trade routes later crusades were attempts to protect the byzantine empire anyway any really good history book says what i said Crusade Byzantine Empire First Crusade History of Islam History of Europe History of the Middle East Second Crusade Ottoman Empire Middle Ages Jerusalem Manuel I Comnenus History of Germany Kingdom of Jerusalem Late Middle Ages State Reconquista Armenian Quarter History of Ottoman Albania Damascus Bosniaks Mongol Empire Jew Crusade of 1101 Romania in the Middle Ages Jews in the Middle Ages History of early Arab Egypt Christianity High Middle Ages Greeks Franks Nur ad-Din Military history of France Religion in Israel Constantinople Islam Ottoman wars in Europe Cyprus in the Middle Ages Persian Empire Italian Renaissance Suleiman the Magnificent History of the Mediterranean region Medieval: Total War World War I Saladin Fall of Constantinople History of the Balkans Arab-Israeli conflict Skanderbeg Republic History of Slovakia Church of the Holy Sepulchre Jewish history Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor Siege of Belgrade Roman Catholicism's links with political authorities British monarchy Islam as a political movement Kievan Rus' Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Holy Roman Empire Islamic Golden Age Western world 1260s Vlad III Dracula Siege of Acre Serbia Separation of church and state Feudalism History of the Netherlands Principality of Antioch Crimean War Turkic peoples Population transfer History of Lebanon City-state Balkans Persecution of Christians East-West Schism Nationalism Cyprus Israel Christian denomination Eastern Orthodox Church Palestinian Diplomacy Seventh Crusade Maronite History of Christianity Western Roman Empire History of the Roman Catholic Church Icon Bulgaria
