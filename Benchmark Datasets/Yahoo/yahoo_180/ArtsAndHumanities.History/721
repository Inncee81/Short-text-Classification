why did constantine found constantinople constantine was declared emperor in britain why would he shift his capital to the east founding roma nova constantinople instead of just taking the throne in rome like everyone else i couldn't find an adequate explanation for this i know there was already the city of byzantium there but he made it the imperial capital even though he was western and the sole emperor of the roman empire because by the time constantine assumed power rome's importance was spiritual not political since at least the reign of the antonines marcus aurelius trajan the imperial court had been moved from rome to mediolanum which today we know as milan the vast geographic expanse of the empire called for it and milan was in a much better position geographically than rome to recieve information from places like gaul or hispania in the th century ce emperor honorius moved the capital to ravenna because ravenna is surrounded by swamplands and is thus much more easily defensible than milan some emperors went their entire reign without stepping foot in rome it was during the reign of diocletian that the empire was split into two administrative halves the western empire and the eastern empire diocletian envisioned the tetrarchy where two augustus would reign over each administrative halve and an official caesar would be appointed his heir this was because the empire had become so bureaucratized and inefficient that for anything meaningful to happen such as a military expedition usually the emperor himself had to be involved so emperors in the two halves could deal with the two trouble spots on the frontiers the rhine river which separated roman gaul from barbarian germany and the eastern frontier which separated rome from the sassanid persian empire in theory it would have solved two problems the problem of imperial succession which plagued the empire throughout the rd century and the military situation which was eating away at the edged of the empire in reality the tetrarchy collapsed as soon as diocletian retired not only did the wars of succession continue constantine spent nearly half his reign as a usurper but the barbarian migrations continued the enfeebled western half was unable to hold them along the rhine and the eastern half was too pre occupied with the persians to stop them from penetrating over the danube the administrative capitals established by diocletian were milan and byzantium the eastern half benefitted greatly from trade from the middle and far east and egypt was the most prosperous province in the empire meanwhile the western half was extremely poor and africa was the only province still making money constantine probably saw the signs that the west was doomed so he made his capital the capital of the east byzantium renaming it as you pointed out nova roma or new rome but for its citizens they had a nickname for it constantinopolis the city of constantine over time the nickname stuck more than its official name and constantinopolis was eventually shortened to constantinople Ancient Rome Roman Britain Justinian I Praetorian Guard Timeline of Portuguese history (Lusitania and Gallaecia) Roman Governor History of Rome Lugdunum Western world Constantine III (usurper) Marcus Aurelius Italia (Roman province) Crisis of the Third Century Alaric I Theodosius I Hadrian Ostrogoth Franks Parthia Sassanid dynasty Roman Emperor (Late Empire) Roman usurper Roman Navy Trajan History of the Balkans History of West Eurasia Dacia Military history of the Roman Empire History of Germany Flavius Augustus Honorius Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy __stanbul Mark Antony Seleucid Empire Phocas Heraclius Middle Ages Governor Aurelian Persian Empire Year of the Four Emperors Ravenna Valentinian I Tiberius Roman Emperor (Crisis of the Third Century) Roman legion Crispus Ancient history East-West Schism Claudius Ottoman Empire War of the League of Cambrai Military history of France History of Slovakia Rome: Total War Ricimer Byzantine army History of the Middle East Migration Period Qing Dynasty End of Han Dynasty War of the Spanish Succession Arch of Constantine Three Kingdoms History of Italy during Roman times Filioque clause Exarchate of Ravenna Marius Greece Ataulf Late Antiquity Papal States Visigoth Arianism
