what were the original settlers that came to america trying to escape the original pilgrims the colonist even before the revolutionary war my family tree dates back to the 's here in the us that was before it was a country europe must have been bad at the time what are some of the contributing factors was it cruel treatment of it's people the never ending empires what were the real o g's looking for when they settled here on this fine continent i'm sure it wasn't money originally but then it turned to slavery which made the u s the richest country in the world a dark spot on our history do you really think christopher columbus wanted to build an empire or was the course of this country changed over and over until what we have today i just hope the u s a doesn't turn into the historical europe that once ruled it's people with an iron fist which brings me to my next question should we strive for freedom or for domination and perfection is that the real american way also population these days i wonder if they had planned on an explosion of people throughout it's course but why do we put most of our populations in the cities and metro areas we have enough land to create something special one day this country will be developed in to a mecca some came for religious reasons others for economic reasons many in england had been forced off the land by the enclosure movement which meant land owners kicked the peasants off the land in favor of fenced pastures for sheep the right of primogeniture which meant the family title estate and property went to the oldest son lead some to go abroad to seek their own fortunes others were given the choice of going to the colonies or remaining in debtors prison some just had the wanderlust and wished to see new lands some had all or most off the reasons so excess population was bled off to the colonies but nearly all had an economic motive to have a better life Colonial America Colony Colonisation Liberalism History of slavery in the United States Slavery European colonization of the Americas Serfdom American Revolution Capitalism Plantations of Ireland Decolonization History of Spain Spanish colonization of the Americas Midwestern United States Economy of Africa History of Europe Primogeniture Black (people) History of the Southern United States Bretton Woods system Pontiac's Rebellion History of the United States Democracy Black Legend Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Manifest Destiny French colonial empires Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti United States History of the United States (1776-1789) History of the United States (1789-1849) German Confederation Protestant Reformation Atlantic slave trade Population history of American indigenous peoples Kibbutz Treaty of Versailles Culture of Lithuania Poker jargon Two Treatises of Government Barbados History of Vietnam Communism History of Islam South America Rhode Island State City EastEnders Donald Trump Western world American exceptionalism Babylonian law House of Bourbon William Penn Sociocultural evolution Irish Rebellion of 1641 New France Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia Texas Revolution Nationalism History of Trinidad and Tobago Mid-nineteenth century Spain Cultural and historical background of Jesus History of the World Black Death History of Austria Bosniaks History of Brazil Concurrent estate Soviet Union Economic history of Britain Ancient Greece Capital punishment Order of succession Edward Gibbon Wakefield Szlachta Capital accumulation History of Cuba American Revolutionary War Transcontinental nation Radicalism Russian Revolution of 1917 American individualist anarchism German Empire Mennonite Mercantilism History of the Jews in the United States Knots Landing Anarcho-primitivism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Anthroposophy Jew Insurance
