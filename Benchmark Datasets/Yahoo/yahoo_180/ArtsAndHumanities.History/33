just how powerful was the german emperor when wilhelm i was proclaimed german emperor back in just how power came with that new position did wilhelm have enough authority to seriously influence the policies and actions of the german empire or did bismarck hold the real power leaving wilhelm as a mere figurehead akin to the queen of england's present role how powerful can an emperor be how does he or she manipulate the power available to them how astute are they with wielding the trappings of power it is the same with chieftains kings presidents czars emperors the man woman is the measure of their power wilhelm i was a cagey 'foe' of bismark they made a great team and by creating an unwieldy bureaucracy they 'ensured' that a smart emperor and a crafty prime minister chancellor could manage the unruly demands of thousands of rich power wielders and ultimately the millions of 'ordinary' citizens the key was king emperor and prime minister both britain and germany created a system whereby one thick wad could jam the toilet a 'well meaning' but blundering kaiser such as wilhelm the second and a series of clueless stupid chancellors and disaster the same thing happens in america when the prez falls out of sync with the head of the senate and house of reps actually in america there are four branchs of government not three wilhelm the grandfather and grandson wilhelm the second were very different sorts wilhelm the nd lacked the diplomatic skills needed to woo politcians wilhelm made himself impotent among germans once one loses respect it is a downhill spiral world war one was the result of a breakdown of the german givernment there was a lot of oh i thought the kaiser wanted this done said when a piece of legislation resulted in something like the launching of world war one again see amrica for scary analogy the emperor or king or president can choose to be a mere figurehead such as elizabeth or woo seduce with skill as did ronald reagan and provide actual leadership but mostly i am afraid it is a rudderless ship carried on by the sheer momentum of a nation of many milions pax Otto von Bismarck Emperor of Japan Franco-Prussian War German Empire Prime Minister of the United Kingdom President of Germany Wilhelm I of Germany Chancellor of Germany Parliament of the United Kingdom History of Germany Economic history of Britain Chancellor New Republic (Star Wars) Emperor Roman Emperor President of Austria Royal Assent President Prussia Germany Lord Chancellor Presidential system Spring and Autumn Period Parliamentary system House of Lords Bretton Woods system Weimar Republic World War II Soviet Union Joseph Chamberlain Prime Minister Paul von Hindenburg World War I President of the United States Governor General of Canada Canadian House of Commons Separation of powers under the United States Constitution Leadership Politics of Germany George V of the United Kingdom Galactic Republic (Star Wars) Hirohito President of Ireland Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Parliament of Canada Geopolitik Democratic Party (United States) Government of France House of Bourbon Appeal Order of succession Confederacy of Independent Systems Wang Mang Causes of World War II Monarchy in Canada Weimar constitution Victoria of the United Kingdom German Confederation Second war of Schleswig History of Hungary United States House of Representatives Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Congress of the United States Governor-General of Australia Separation of church and state First Battle of the Atlantic Prime Minister of Canada Palpatine Battleship Nazi Germany Louis XV of France Causes of World War I Politics of Canada Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace Yuan Shikai Neville Chamberlain Emperor Gengshi of Han War of the Spanish Succession Napoleonic Wars Greek military junta of 1967-1974 Friedrich III of Germany (Hohenzollern) George I of Great Britain Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom Jedi Tenchi Muyo!
