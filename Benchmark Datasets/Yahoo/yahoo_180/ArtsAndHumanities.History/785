what is your st reaction if you read german chancellor to visit the memorial of hitler and his nazi henchmen and how about the japanese prime ministers who had been visiting the yasukuni shrine with their ministers for the japanese world war soldiers is it purely a religion act i know of no memorials to hitler or any of his henchmen in germany there are the mortal remains of dead german soldiers interred in various cemeteries in germany yasakuni shrine contains the cremains of japanese soldiers going all the way back to the russo japanese war of it is japan's equivalent to arlington national cemetery in the u s and the australian cemetery at townsville in queensland state the cremains of hideki tojo and others who were hanged after the war crimes trials were moved to the shrine from an original burial space behind the base of the konan statue in atami japan since any visit to the shrine by a government official is held away from cameras one cannot say with certaintly that the purpose of the visit was to show respect to the war criminals interred there perhaps it is meant to show respect to those sons of japan who fell in combat during various wars the same as an australian prime minister visiting townsville on anzac day or an american president at arlington on memorial day Yasukuni Shrine Arlington National Cemetery War memorial Responses of Germany and Japan to World War II crimes Japanese war crimes Hideki Tojo Japanese nationalism Anti-Japanese sentiment Shrine of Remembrance Burial Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe President of Germany Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Joachim von Ribbentrop Axis Powers Sino-Japanese relations Chancellor of Germany Hirohito Chancellor Head of state Funeral World War II Empire of Japan State funeral of John F.
