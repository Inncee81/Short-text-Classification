if you could live in any period in human history when would you live any part of the world under the rule of any past or present governments nobody for the pax romana it would be foolish to live in any period of history other than our own context really i mean think about it if you wetre a cro magnon there is no technology and you are hunted as often as you hunt next age and if your not still in the tribal ages or africa australia n america etc then you are greek and in constant war or china and in constant war next age and now it's be roman or die and if you're roman you'll probably die young fighting or of disease famine or maybe you'll just be mugged or killed for political reasons next age and all of a sudden religion matters if your islamic you're hounded by crusaders if you're catholic you're sent off consistantly eight times minimum depending on if you are pluralist or traditionalist into the deep recesses of islam and more than likely beat off if you're orthodox christian you're being raped by everyone and in asia you are dealing with the three kingdoms crises constant war not to mentioni developing feudal japan next age and if your not being shot at by experimental guns on some napoleanoic battlefield you're instead in starvation or slaving on the farms attempting to hide potatos of course plague is around too next age and total war is into the mix sure the world is developing superpowers emerging and all that but you'll soon find that if you didn't choose the depression then you chose war time rations maybe you want to be in the army so you get normal ations only then you are sent off to fight in the war and wwi wasn't exactly known for it's lack of casualties next age and the whole world is paranoid at any minute that the skies will be filled with nukes care of the usa or the ussr sure you being from the future know this wont happen but given a second chance aswell maybe kruschev wont back down in the missile crises then we're back home in our age present everything seems pretty good as is i opt to stick around in my own time Middle Ages Famine World War I Economy of Africa History of Europe Superpower Military history Abortion debate Jew Religion Anti-aircraft warfare Africa History of the World Soviet Union Marriage Vietnam War Religious pluralism History of Islam Gold standard Bosniaks Military history of the United States Western world World War III Roman Empire Persian Empire Separation of church and state Russia British Empire Ancient warfare Martial art History of Ireland Cold War (1962-1991) Weapon Christianity Japanese war crimes Medieval warfare Islam Genocides in history Southeast Asia Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Economic history of Britain Cold War DC Universe Confucianism Heaven History of Bosnia and Herzegovina Poker jargon Capitalism British monarchy Homosexuality Ordination of women Jewish views of religious pluralism United Nations Security Council Crusade Roman Republic Inflation Military history of France Greeks Mongols History of Sudan Democracy Serbia Trinity Jewish history Theodicy Money RuneScape quests Human History of the tank Mongol Empire Civil war British Army Status of religious freedom in Sudan Political philosophy Cremation New World Order (political) Fasting Tag Military history of the Roman Empire Same-sex marriage World government Exorcism Greece Empire Earth Anti-Americanism Ottoman Empire Taboo food and drink Saint Nicholas Reconquista Nationalism Identity Crisis (comics) Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)
