do you know that napoleon was only ever beaten by two men on land wellington and whose the other man its strange you know that this other person is hardly ever mentioned in our history no telivision no films about him documentries or anything else but apparently after beating poor old nap the french appreciated him more than we did i know the name of man but not the storey anybody out there know both hi tom of course your right i had to go to the greenwich maritime museum last week on business and while waiting for my colleague on the st floor open display area by the cafe' i read up on admiral william sydney smith it went on further to say that smith was the only other person beside wellington to beat napoleon on land may be they meant the only other englishmen to beat napolean on land do you know anything about admiral smith he was beaten at the battle of aspern essling in by the austrians commanded by archduke charles he was also defeated at the battle of vyazma in by count mikhail andreyevich miloradovich's russian army and at the battle of leipzig in by von blucher also instrumental at waterloo so that's plus wellington and you could even argue that blucher not wellington was the real victor at waterloo since wellington's stratergy was to hold until the prussians arrived which other man were you referring to update smith was quite a character unpopular with his superiors but a very distinguished navel commander served in many different places but his land victory was at the battle of maida in when he attempted to help the spanish re capture naples he was never allowed to follow up on his victory though as he was recalled immediately after the battle and resumed his navel career he was also a diplomatic ambassador of some distinction and he was involved in the aftermath of waterloo he was also a major figure in the cause of abolition of slavery update interestingly wellington never lost a battle in his career though he himself felt waterloo was far from his finest hour Napoleonic Wars Battle of Waterloo Archduke Charles Napoleon I of France Sidney Smith (admiral) Napoleon's Invasion of Russia Gebhard Leberecht von Bl__cher Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington Peninsular War World War I Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson Battle of Quatre Bras Hundred Days War of the Austrian Succession Battle of Aspern-Essling Battle of Wagram Battle of Ligny History of Austria Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult War of the Spanish Succession John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough Mikhail Andreyevich Miloradovich Battle of Warsaw (1920) French Revolutionary Wars Napoleon III of France Battle of France War of the League of Cambrai Horatio Hornblower Battle of Austerlitz Battle of Leipzig Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II First French Empire Tolstoy French Directory Italian unification Battle of Wavre Scots Guards Alexander Suvorov Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies August von Gneisenau Jacobite Rising History of Germany History of Poland (1795-1918) Andr__ Mass__na The Duke of Wellington's Regiment Military history of France Battle of the Somme (1916) Polish-Soviet War Alexander I of Russia Scots Guards (1805) War of 1812 House of Bourbon Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette Polish-Muscovite War (1605-1618) 29th Regiment of Foot New York Giants Battle of Trafalgar Ravi Shastri Hohenlohe Joseph Radetzky von Radetz Wellington FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan Heinrich Friedrich Karl, Reichsfreiherr vom und zum Stein 33rd Regiment of Foot Isaac Brock Austro-Prussian War Battle of Marengo (1800) Battle of Sedan English Civil War Vyazma Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805) Frederick II of Prussia Otto von Bismarck Edward Gibbon Wakefield 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot Ulysses S.
