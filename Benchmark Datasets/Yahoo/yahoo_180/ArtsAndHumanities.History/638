how did they use pigeons to communicate long ago well a friend told me that a pigeon is only trained to send letters parcels to one area so they only know the way to and fro post office pigeon home and another place but how did they do it anyone can get me a good link or tell me all about it hi mac hull is correct so i can only elaborate in modern times pigeons were placed in the sealed compartments of trucks planes and trains to see if their homing instincts could be fooled no matter what was done the pigeons always found their way back home in ancient times and probably today birds of every type were taught to go between specific destinations by being raised and fed in those two destinations alternately being a bird means your metabolism is real high maintenance and food is the primary reason for and sole means of flight power when a bird of any type learns that there is a reliable source of food to be had in a specific and safe spot they will return to it reliably for the rest of their lives and or for as long as the safe and yummy food continues to present itself why fly away from home well both places are technically home the birds are released at one spot they long for the sky so they usually option to fly to the next destination some birds are duds smile they don't leave the nest literally but those ones usually ended up on the dinner table most birds though will follow their brethren so chicks fledged in one of these arrangements will learn to fly the same route it's a myth to assume that a bird will randomly find someone or someplace to deliver a message some birds do recognize a specific person as their food provider and they will go to them if they see that person in the field this is usually limited to the raptor family though as pigeons are not famous for their eyesight or their learning curve not that raptors are all that smart i kept catching the same owls in the same trap when i was doing cataloging and relocation for the park services the owls were fierce and pissed and it was not an experience you or i would get over quickly but the owls forgot everything within minutes of being released hope this helps Bird United States Postal Service Falconry Mail Airport Bird migration Dog training Rock Dove Kakapo Seabird Albatross Scientology beliefs and practices Animal communication The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases TGV Global Positioning System Hypoglycemia Gerald Durrell Bird of prey F/A-22 Raptor USS Seadragon (SS-194) Tai shogi Heinkel He 112 Homing pigeon Parachuting Ethernet Peregrine Falcon New York Giants Morse Code Capercaillie B-47 Stratojet Ocean's Twelve Ron Weasley Gliding Surveillance Incarnations of Immortality Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Chicken Link (Legend of Zelda) Anchor Dog Worms weapons and tools Killian documents The Amber Spyglass Hamster The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Biblical inerrancy Computer The Family from One End Street Friends Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act College Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Renewable energy Spacecraft propulsion C plus plus Bird flight Bald Eagle Weight training Public-key cryptography Combine (Half-Life 2) Creatures in Bionicle Post office Kain (Legacy of Kain) Fight Club Redundant array of independent disks Vehicular cycling Richard Feynman Tag Naval mine Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Piccolo Junior Saga The Death Gate Cycle Nutrition Son Gohan Cleveland Browns United Parcel Service New Testament Gmail Snowy Owl Wright brothers Evolutionary creationism USS West Virginia (BB-48) The Amazing Race E-mail Paragliding Windows Vista Broadband Internet access Clyde Pangborn Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
