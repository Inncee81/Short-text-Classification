why is it that americans seem to think that they won wwi and wwii all by themselves the americans generally seem to believe that they won wwi and wwii alone without anyone elses involvement when in fact they were inactive in the first instance until and didnt actually engage in battle until a few months before the end of the war and in the second instance were quite willing to let britain face the nazis alone with little more than a milititia for almost two years except for some but very little financial help these decisions would be fine if it wasn't for the constant bleating by us citizens about how they saved the world they seem to forget that unlike the rest of europe britain was still unconquered i'm not denying britain needed help but why do americans insist on trying to make everyone believe they did it alone is this just a lack of education or arrogance on the part of a people with an invincibility complex carlmoles you are a prime example of what i'm talking about the rest of you yanks who say theyve never heared anyone say anything please read his comment it the sort of thing we brits get all the time and is disrespectful to the sacrifice of many thousands of british servicemen and woman not to mention thousands of innocent civilians maybe we just get to see the uneducated imbeciles point of view over here to everybody else thankyou for your honest answers and beleive me i am not anti us quite the opposite in fact though bush no comment it infuriates me and i'm an american there's an extremely vile and dangerous conservative element at work in the american culture right now started in the ' 's that wants to re write history and fire people up the people who actually lived during wwi and wwii weren't like that they did their duty and that's all there was to it scares the hell out of me never would i have thought back in the ' 's when i was a kid that americans could behave so abysmally the people behind this radical conservatism are straight from hell they are also poorly educated and sadly misinformed agree with wounded duck's sarcasm re montgomery if he was your best general thank god for eisenhower bradley and george c marshall World War II The Manchester Regiment World War I Appeasement Battle of the Bulge Operation Market Garden Conservatism Irish Guards Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II George Galloway Western Front (World War II) Battle of France Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Barry Goldwater Supernatural Polish September Campaign Conservative Party (UK) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Laura Schlessinger Red Scare Theory of conduct Islam as a political movement Fahrenheit 9/11 Franco-Prussian War Western betrayal The King's Regiment (Liverpool) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Plame affair History of the British Army George S.
