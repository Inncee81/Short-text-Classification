atomic bombs a necessary evil more than yrs after they were dropped over japan people are begining to think we were wrong some even compare it the holocaust this was a diffent time and different a situation do you think it was a necessary evil to destroy cities do you also think that because of this it has detered another event or worse they were necessary to help convince japan to surrender between the a bombs and the russians attacking japanese territory on the mainland the japanese realized they faced extermination if the kept fighting if they had resisted to the end and the us had neede to invade and conquer the country millions more people would have died the other thing that many people don't realize particulary those that are blindly anti nuke is that the death tolls of the a bomb attacks were not actually all that high in the grand scheme of things the fire bomb raids on tokyo killed more people yes hiroshima and nagasaki were wiped out but they would have been anyway with conventional weapons each city was already scheduled to be bombed because of strategic targets within any comparison to the holocaust is simply idiotic the holocaust was a deliberate and methodical attempt at genocide the a bomb attacks were military actions with new weapons if the us had kept dropping nukes after japan tried to surrender then you could claim it was genocide World War II Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Nuclear weapon Nuclear warfare Strategic bombing Strategic bombing during World War II Surrender of Japan The Holocaust Aerial bombing of cities European Theatre of World War II Bombing of Dresden in World War II Pacific War Participants in World War II Eastern Front (World War II) Polish September Campaign Crime against humanity Japanese atomic program Operation Downfall RAF Bomber Command Bombing of Tokyo in World War II Terror bombing Holocaust denial Second Sino-Japanese War Kosovo War Total war Korean War Weapons of mass destruction Operation Barbarossa Military history of the United States Suicide bombing Battle of Okinawa Vietnam War Iraq War Genocide Hiroshima Japanese war crimes History of Poland (1939-1945) Shock and Awe U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Khmer Rouge B-29 Superfortress 2003 Invasion of Iraq Trinity test Military history of the Soviet Union Gulf War History of Lithuania Armenian Genocide Timeline-191 Bomber Command Nuclear weapon design Terrorism Attack on Pearl Harbor Battle of Britain Chinese Civil War Protoss Curtis LeMay Battle of France Nuclear weapons and the United States United States Air Force Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong Nagasaki Battle of the Bulge Bomb World War II casualties Auschwitz concentration camp Population history of American indigenous peoples Anti-aircraft warfare Mutual assured destruction Empire of Japan Vegeta Persecution of Christians Great Lakes refugee crisis World War III 2003 Iraq war timeline Operation Weser__bung Chemical warfare Rwandan Genocide Second Battle of the Atlantic Timeline of World War II Alien races from the Godzilla films One Year War Peleliu North Korea and weapons of mass destruction Genocides in history Cold War Australian 8th Division USS Yorktown (CV-10) Bombing of Hamburg in World War II War on Terrorism The Destruction of the European Jews John Titor Manhattan Project
