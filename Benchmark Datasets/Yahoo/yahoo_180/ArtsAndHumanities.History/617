iran sided with the nazi's in wwll did the palestinians and other arab nations side with the nazi's also within weeks of adolf hitler s ascendance to power mufti of jerusalem haj amin al husseini contacted the german counsel general in palestine with exception of funding anti semitic riots germans rejected the arab s overtures until when adolf eichmann and herbert hagen were sent to palestine to establish a framework to provide husseini with military and financial aid by nazi germany and fascist italy by then the mufti had already proven his anti jewish credentials to the germans by organizing a three year long riots and massacres on april a crowd of arabs stumbled upon jews in the town of jaffa having been incited by mufti spread rumors that zionists were killing muslims the crowd decided to kill three of the jews they met six days later the arab higher committee was created with al husseini presiding over the new body the committee openly endorsed past violence and began organizing future disobedience on may the british colonial authorities warned al husseini against committing illegal acts but did not appear particularly decisive within weeks massive violence broke out by october nearly people were killed and another wounded colonial forces arrested a few pawns and one major leader but took no action against the mufti the new york times reported on june that al husseini had succeeded in convincing experienced high british civil servants that he is working for the government s interests and that it was in the interest of the government that he should also be president of the new arab high committee so that haj amin el husseini enjoys the government s complete confidence as its unofficial adviser on the arab side of the situation the government believes that he and only he is in a position to appease the moslem masses therefore it gives him every support while at the same time playing into his hands http frontpagemag com articles read aspx guid f b e

most outstanding arab nazi collaborator however was the leader of the palestinian arabs haj muhammud amin el husseini mufti of jerusalem husseini spent most of world war in the axis domain in europe he conferred officially with mussolini and hitler in a petition he submitted together with other arab leaders husseini urged the fuehrer in the name of the arab nation to recognize the arab right to solve the jewish question in the arab countries later he helped the germans recruit an ss division among the bosnian muslims exerting his influence over their imams later on inspiring them during their service one researcher tells us the mufti worked closely with the nazi machinery responsible for exterminating jews this apparatus was part of the ss headed by his friend himmler husseini made energetic efforts to further the mass murder process by preventing the emigration of jews from the axis domain he petitioned the governments of axis croatia hungary rumania and bulgaria as well as their patrons in germany and italy and neutral turkey to prevent jews from leaving the axis zone towards the end of the war when the axis satellite states of eastern europe could see the looming nazi defeat they made plans to release jews especially children from their territory in return for various considerations or perhaps in order to clear themselves with allied public opinion the mufti hearing of these plans exerted his considerable diplomatic influence among the germans and their satellites to stop these children and adults from escaping their fate under the nazis for instance husseini wrote to the prime minister of bulgaria an axis partner urging bulgaria to send jewish children to poland where they would be under stringent control in his words letter of june these children he asserted presented a degree of danger to bulgaria whether they be kept in bulgaria or be permitted to depart from that country http www freerepublic com focus f news posts the arab embrace

power in germany in news of the nazi takeover was welcomed by the arab masses with great enthusiasm as the first congratulatory telegrams hitler received upon being appointed chancellor came from the german consul in jerusalem followed by those from several arab capitals soon afterwards parties that imitated the national socialists were founded in many arab lands like the hisb el qaumi el suri pps or social nationalist party in syria its leader anton sa'ada styled himself the f hrer of the syrian nation and hitler became known as abu ali in egypt his name was muhammed haidar the banner of the pps displayed the swastika on a black white background later a lebanese branch of the pps which still receives its orders from damascus was involved in the assassination of lebanese president pierre
