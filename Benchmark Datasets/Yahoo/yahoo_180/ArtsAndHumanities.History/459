why are the bell towers in italy in a separate structure from the cathedrals partially because they tended to collapse but primarily because they were often built at a different time than the rest of the church most of the oldest bell towers in italy are medieval and were built next to churches that were much older in many cases the older church was torn down and replaced so now the tower is older than the church it accompanies York Minster Gothic architecture Notre Dame de Paris Russian architecture Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace Aberdeen Moscow Kremlin Cologne Cathedral Frankfurt St Albans Cathedral Colchester Spire Duomo di Siena Middle Ages Carillon Lincoln Cathedral Round tower Romanesque architecture Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin Florence Mission San Juan Capistrano Palace of Westminster Gothic Revival architecture Bell (instrument) St Andrews Glasgow Cathedral Stave church Verona Chester Rostov Radio masts and towers Novgorod Bishop Ely Cathedral Kremlin towers Cathedral of Magdeburg Places in the Wheel of Time series Canterbury Cathedral Separation of church and state Campanile Church University of Glasgow Trombone Basilica of St. John The Baptist Robert Lawson (architect) Oakland Cemetery Castle Oxford Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra Cathedral St Paul's Cathedral Old Post Office Building (Washington) World Trade Center Hanover Cathedral of Chartres Organ (music) St. James' Cathedral (Toronto) Ferrara Cathedral architecture Big Ben Potton Christopher Wren Benjamin Mountfort Carlisle Cathedral Baroque architecture Collapse of the World Trade Center Tallest structures in the United States Change ringing Cagliari Towcester Liverpool Cathedral Salisbury Cathedral Leicester City Centre CN Tower Cathedral diagram History of Europe Durham Cathedral Baptistery Lincoln, Lincolnshire Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe Tower Dresden Frauenkirche Church tabernacle Bologna Trento Washington National Cathedral Saint Petersburg Hagia Sophia Church of England Liverpool World's tallest structures Crane (machine) Berlin Medieval music Lightning rod Brooklyn Bridge Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Portsmouth Cathedral Toronto City Hall
