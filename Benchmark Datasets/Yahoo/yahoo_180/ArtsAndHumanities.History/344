what is a brief summary of the story of sir gawain and the green knight i can look it up on wikipedia but first i want to hear what you know about it thanks for the help an experiment in today's vernacular gawain and his homies were chillin' at arthur's court when the green knight showed up and was all you d ds suxxor all the knights went aggro at this then the green knight says yo here's a challenge for you weak a punks i'll let you take a swing at my neck and then i get to take my turn so gawain says i'll take that action and totally chops off the green knight's head and then gk picks up his head and sticks it back on and says okay i get to take a turn next but 'cuz i'm a l t d d i'll give you a year then you gotta find me so i can behead you lol and then he left all the knights were like sux to be you gawain you should totally book it for france or something but gawain's word was bond so he spent the next year looking for gk and having all sorts of wild adventures mainly with hawt chix trying to tempt him finally he finds the gk and says okay guess you get your turn now whatev and kneels down to get his head chopped off and the gk says whoa you took me seriously n b lol because the whole thing was a test to see if arthur's knights were a bunch of smack talkers or if they could back up all their boasts about their honor so gawain passed and get all sorts of accolades and stuff of course later he encountered the tower anthrax filled with naughty maidens in need of a spanking but that's another story Lancelot Gawain J.
