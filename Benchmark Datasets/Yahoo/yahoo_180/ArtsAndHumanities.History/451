why did the u s go to war in kosovo this is a war about which i know very little and i bet i'm not alone did slobadon or whoever he was kill hundreds of thousands of people you have to understand how the usa's foreign policy works who runs the political streams in usa and how decisions are being made the system is run by lobbies military lobby petroleum lobby etc and the decisions are being made according to money and interests all these decisions need to be popular thus a powerful media is being used to control the mood of the masses through carefully filtered and biased information one example of this is the american ruder and fin a jewish marketing company which compared the serbs to the nazis when the attack over serbia was much needed you have to throw away everything you have learned about serbia so far believe in just a handful of sources one of them is noam chomsky as mentioned above serbia is leaned toward russia this could represent a local political threat to american interests in some potential future event the region itself is of no interest to usa but controlling it is stepping russia and some potential new loyal military force is not to be wasted the albanians have been investing constantly into the american lobby system influencing congressmen unlike the serbs who have started doing it only recently since much of the veins in albania and kosovo come from saudi arabia iran syria etc there has been certain compensation from usa in allowing their influence to coexist in the region a better example of this are the bosnian muslims whose country in which they control serbs and croats is purely artificial the war in kosovo has deep historical roots with a quite complex political background but what is relevant now is how it was influenced by usa at some point the albanian terrorists found mutual interests with usa against serbs thus conditions in kosovo started escalating to a point where it was just a matter of time when nato was to attack serbia and the way it happened through racak event and un security council disapproval tells by itself only after nato had attacked serbia creating a humanitarian catastrophe in kosovo and an escalation of attrocities which follow every war did the situation get out of control there was no such thing before the nato attack just before the nato attack the yugoslav army had taken control over much of the territory where the terrorists operated milosevic killing hundreds of thousands of people is an example of propaganda there is much guilt you could add to him but what guilt could you add to someone outspoking the hundreds of thousands number calling for a catastrophe to happen and pushing people into it there have been war crime acts in kosovo just like in every war where the human nature is released but should the judging of such event be given to those who create ground for such event to happen those who will end unpunished and ready to create another such catastrophe like inventing some nuclear weapons in iraq killing those who oppose iraq intervention kelly killed by blair in uk etc what you should know about the war of kosovo is that it is just another dirty war caused by usa where the serbs have been satanized by the western media throughout the entire yugoslav civil war through evil systems like cnn and devils like christine amanpour it is a war in which a powerful country crushed a small country going beyond international conventions and agreements which serve peaceful solutions since usa see's itself beyond international laws and conventions and ordinary people were pushed into a bloodshed by their leaders which is the saddest thing of every war covered with tons of depeleted uranium and cassette bombs not aimed at military personel right now the kosovo war is a war about international agreements against those who see themselves above international agreements it is about the meaning of international agreements why they exist in first place added thedoppest that get rid of the cancer theory has a bad flaw the bad thing about it is that there would be only wc relief not to degrade it p if a country gets rid of all political presure in an act of giving away own territory the reality of politics tells that this would only show that such country is weak and is offering everything it has and soon other territories would radicalize toward the same path kosovo would have taken if given such freedom of choice you really want to imply that if you cut your finger and give it to a vampire that the vampire wouldn't go for your entire body nice try lol there is one good thing about being not on the usa side as much as they have infiltered their dirty money into our political and economic structures and as much as they are constantly trying to get into every pore they can it is that we do not have to be their garbage disposal backyard genetic soy garden or rocketbase with nuclear warhead facing moscow i personally find some pleasure in not being that btw did they clean yet the tons of depleted uranium there i feel sorry for those radiated people there and i do understand why you never answer me anything about depleted uranium in context of that the price of a chance to independence through a bargain with usa has turned bloody expensive i think that a long run nonviolent politics leading toward extended autonomy and eu without the depleted uranium drawback would have been a much better choice the information you can dig through the internet on depleted uranium is horrifying cancer has not only risen in kosovo but in serbia and bosnia too children are the issue with several typical health problems hey check yourself what your friends have brought you http www motherjones com news special reports total coverage
