how is paper made from wood to begin the process pulpwood logs must be reduced to chip form prior to chipping logs are passed through a debarking drum large open ended cylinder within the drum logs collide with one another and rub together removing the bark the bark falls through slots in the cylinder walls and is collected and burned as fuel in the power boilers the debarked logs are conveyed to a chipper which reduces them to small to inch squares with a inch thickness softwood and hardwood chips are kept separate until the pulp is blended at the paper machine since each has its own physical properties wood is made up of small cellulose fibers bound together by a glue like substance called lignin in the pulping process these fibers are separated by cooking the wood with chemicals to dissolve the lignin to accomplish this the chips are loaded into large vessels called digesters on either a batch or continuous basis digesters are designed on the same principle as a kitchen pressure cooker the chips and chemicals are steamed under pressure for to hours until the mixture is reduced to a wet oatmeal like mass the cooking frees the fibers so they can be suspended in water the pulp is blown from the digesters under pressure to separate the fibers it is then washed to remove the cooking chemicals and dissolved lignin and then bleached to the proper shade of whiteness from there the pulp is passed through refiners these refiners roughen the surface of the individual pulp fibers by loosening the threadlike elements from the fiber wall so they cling together when formed into a sheet added after refining are dyes and other additives to give the finished paper the desired properties water is then added to the pulp in a ratio of parts water to one part fiber this furnish as it is called is then run onto the forming fabric or wire of the paper machine the forming fabric is an endless mesh screen that circulates at the wet end of the paper machine there the fibers become interlaced forming a mat of paper and much of the water is extracted traveling at speeds of more than feet per minute the paper is pressed between water absorbing fabrics and wound through a series of steam heated cylinders called dryers where the last of the water in the sheet is removed at this point the paper passes through a size press that applies a starch solution to both sides of the sheet sizing seals the surface so ink cannot soak into the paper during printing since sizing wets the paper the paper must again be dried by traveling through another series of steam heated drums after drying the paper goes through a calendering process that provides a smooth finish by ironing the sheet between heavy polished rollers at the dry end the paper is wound onto spools to form a machine reel and then rewound and slit into smaller rolls on a winder some of these rolls are sent for sheeting and packing into cartons others are rewound to smaller sized rolls and wrapped for shipment a screen is used to separate larger chips Upholstery Wire Fiberglass Jute Pottery Explosive material Mattress Soap Fossil fuel power plant Solar cell Fuel injection Sulfuric acid Movie projector Cookware and bakeware Coffee Fire extinguisher Screw Pebble bed reactor Seismic retrofit Dry cleaning Solar power Lignin Glass Printmaking Model aircraft Steel Printed circuit board Tofu Spark plug Welding Washing machine Carbon nanotube Carbon Leather Aluminium Dishwasher Two-stroke cycle Hemp Dairy Carburetor Alcohol fuel Coir Carbon dioxide Flax Hamster Water purification Drawing Instant coffee Powder metallurgy Radio controlled airplane Sugar beet Campfire Glossary of firefighting equipment Gilding Internal combustion engine Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Knife Bookbinding Glacier Cocaine Torpedo Architecture of the California missions RISC Jet engine Sailing Electric motor Paint Turbocharger Motor oil Woodworking Energy development Stairway Water (molecule) Weaving Hydrogen Titanium Straw-bale construction Transformer Textile Tattoo Hydrogen economy Gas metal arc welding
