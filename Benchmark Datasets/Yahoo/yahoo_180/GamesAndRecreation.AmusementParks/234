people who have rode the top thrill dragster at cedar point is it really scary how does it feel and should i ride it omg the dragster is the most awesome ride in the universe when your in line for the dragster for the first time its scary well for me it was but once your on the actual ride its really scary but once you take off its awesome you get pushed back into your seat and feel your cheeks touching your ears exaggerating alittle then the hill is pretty cool but you can hardly feel going up the hill but you get some air time going over the hill and when your going down you literally feel like your going to crash into the ground but obviously you don't lol and thts pretty much the whole ride you rlly should ride it i highly recommend it Cedar Point Top Thrill Dragster Drag racing Kingda Ka Millennium Force Launched roller coaster Roller coaster Six Flags Great Adventure Diesel engine Powerbomb Internet slang Skateboarding trick Dressage Knott's Berry Farm The Cure Top Fuel RuneScape quests Knoebels Fire fighting Equine conformation Unicycle Sesshomaru Recumbent bicycle The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) AFI 100 Years series Oh My Goddess!
