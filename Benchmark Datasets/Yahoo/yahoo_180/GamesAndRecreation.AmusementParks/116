is disneyworld separated into different theme parks like the disneyland resort disneyland and california's adventure is separate and you have to pay for each one or at least get a park hopper ticket in disneyworld do you also have to pay for the different locations of the theme park like epcot and animal kingdom yep all are seperate if your still in the planning stages i hope this helps you will need about days to do all of magic kingdom most like disneyland days for epcot half the park rides and half is shopping through the various countries you can try and cram animal kingdom into a day and the same with mgm studios but take a day and to really make sure you see it all note mgm studios has alot of shows that are worth seeing but they only have a few showings each day so get there early and plan around them before you do the few rides that are in that park if you are staying in a disney resort make use of the extra magic hours before and after regular hours also the dining plan is really a great value but is only availible when you are staying in a disney resort the place is really huge and i don't doubt that you could fit disneyland park not including the other extra stuff like resorts and parking into the epcot parking lot it is basically a city onto itself has its own freeway system even quest is a story arcade an adult but is really fun but you really need a whole day to do that also kids love it when you price the tickets out getting a day pass with the hopping option and adding on the 'more' which gives you a few entrences to quest both water parks each day each park and pleasure island mostly dance clubs for over crowd it isn't very much for all the entertainment you recieve note quest is not at pleasure island it is at the far end of downtown disney and pleasure island is in the middle of the downtown disney area good luck on your planning and have fun Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Disney's California Adventure Disneyland Walt Disney DisneySpeak The Walt Disney Company Disney-MGM Studios Epcot Disneyland Resort Paris Walt Disney Imagineering Disneyland Resort Magic Kingdom Disneyland Monorail System Anaheim, California Main Street Electrical Parade Carolwood Pacific Railroad Fantasmic!
