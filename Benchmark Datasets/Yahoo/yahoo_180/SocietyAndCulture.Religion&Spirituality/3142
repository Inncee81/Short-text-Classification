bible theories so i was reading my bible and starting thinking about some things scientists think that all our continents used to be one hence pangea in the old testiment when god struck down the tower of babel and confused their languages perhaps this is when the continents broke apart also if a years to us is a day to god then technically it's only been days since jesus left the earth just some ideas that hit me when i was reading my bible the other day what is your thought on these thoughts i think probably that it took time for the continents to part much of the land has changed since creation maybe the flood caused it years is but a day to god probably means that our human lives are so short and god has been here so long that years seems like it is day to him he tells us that our lives are but a vapor to god it probably has only been like two days since jesus was here someone stated that the earth was millions of years old the earth is only about years old adam and eve brought death to the world because of their disobedience to god if the world were millions of years old creatures would have died before adam and eve were even here the fall of mankind is the reason that jesus came to save us from sin and death it is fun to try to learn more and more about god's word good thinking Adam and Eve Original sin Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Young Earth creationism Sin Paradise Lost Genesis Fallen angel Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Devil Justification (theology) Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Satan Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Predestination Flood geology Book of Mormon Eastern Orthodox Church Origin belief Sabbath Theodicy Summa Theologiae Noah's Ark The Amber Spyglass Meaning of life Religion Theosis Noah A Course In Miracles Adam-God theory Demon Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Soul Evil Church of Christ, Scientist Abrahamic religion Christian views of Jesus Mormonism Cain Dispensationalism Virgin Mary in Islam Neon Genesis Evangelion The Fall of Man Prophet Creation according to Genesis Tribulation Gap Creationism Divine grace Slow Train Coming Human Godspell Old Earth creationism Blacks and Mormonism Bible Repentance Sola fide Christian eschatology Jehovah's Witnesses Supernatural Historicity of Jesus Book of Isaiah Infant baptism History of creationism Sacrifice Pre-Adamite Immortality Godhead (Mormonism) Resurrection of Jesus Biblical inerrancy Iblis Bible and reincarnation Trinity Religious pluralism Numerology Noahide Laws Creation science Angel Mary, the mother of Jesus Christian anarchism Nephilim Miracle Religious perspectives on Jesus Intelligent design Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Tower of Babel Evolutionary creationism
