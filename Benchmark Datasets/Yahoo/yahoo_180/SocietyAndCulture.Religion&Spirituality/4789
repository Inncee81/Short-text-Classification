can you help me out anole egg found hi everyone today i found what i think is an anole egg it was under the log i have put in their tank one of the male lizards was laying on it to keep it warm i called petco to see if i should take it out and they said yes so i did and it is under the light on a tupperware cover with mulch that is wet it is night time now and i am wondering if i should turn the light off for the night or lower the light and put the egg directly under the lamp and if you have any other advise on how to care for this egg and to keep it safe and alive i would greatly appreciate it also once it's hatched should i get another tank while it is still little thank you no one answered me but one person and didn't tell me whether i should keep the light on overnight i ask in here because r s has more people so if you know anything about lizards i would greatly appreciate your help thank you in advance i have some lizards and although i havent cared for anoles i would imagine the care would be pretty similar they will need a little heat mat and the light and most lizards need uv if they cant get direct sunlight for now though warmth is important for a little one so i would suggest keeping it on at all times if it is the only heat source at the moment but dimming it at night should be ok they do like the night and day thing in regards to lights on and off i would also advise getting the most suitable tank as soon as because they are very sensitive to being moved around all the time so getting it used to its environment right away is a must but anoles shouldn't need too much space they prefer height to width as like to climb up plants etc good luck with your little guy xx Solar power Light-emitting diode Tank Mulch Sun Lizard Chicken Platypus Bicycle lighting Future energy development Dinosaur Egg (food) Sunlight Carolina Anole Mercury Atlas 6 Clownfish Lighting Brewery Nuclear power Snake Kakapo Light pollution Textile manufacturing Headlight Social rule Cat Campfire Sewage treatment SETI Autonomous building Stage lighting Welding Hamster Power station Solar panel Zerg Plastic Aurora (astronomy) Strap-on dildo Hydrogen economy Vegetarianism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mattress Portable stove Solar variation Pysanka Xenomorph Professional wrestling throws Tarantula Seismic retrofit Thermoregulation Aerial (dance move) Marine aquarium Reptile Floppy disk Planetary habitability Christmas tree The Amber Spyglass Sauna Earthworm Breastfeeding Cannabis cultivation Stairway Colonization of the Moon Incandescent light bulb Jim Morrison Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Capercaillie Compact fluorescent lamp Renewable energy Color temperature Energy development Paragliding Gypsy moth Galileo spacecraft Solar cell Rail terminology Wood carving Sea-Monkey B-47 Stratojet Houseplant Movie projector Global warming Humphrey Bogart Hemp Johnny Appleseed Items in the Metroid series Ionizing radiation Mercury 4 Gramophone record Irrigation Terraforming Emu Diseases of the honeybee Leaf Mars Exploration Rover M16 (rifle)
