why do people say it's wrong to be a gay christian i honestly see nothing wrong with it i'm bi and i've been raised to beleive in god and i just can't see him shunning his children because of who they fall in love with i was taught that god has your life planned out before you're even born so that means that god plans who you fall in love with right besides even though god told all the people who wrote the bible to write we cannot leave out that it was written by man and well being gay wasn't exactly popular back then i know that no matter if i end up with a man or a woman that i'll still love and worship god regardless i just want to know people's opinions sweetheart it matters not what other people think about this but it does matter what god thinks about it and god's view is clear in his word the bible you might want to consider the reason why god destroyed sodom and gemorrah those things were practiced widely there you might also read romans and if you are trying to alude to the bible not being trustworthy because men wrote it even so it was written by god's inspiration so his are the thoughts expressed in it he wouldn't let men write their own ideas in there you say god has your life planed out before you're born are you trying to with that say that you have no choice over your life that is not true firstly you are confusing love with lust those two are completely different and you do have the choice who you let yourself fall in love with love for someone is a choice no god does not plan out your life in a way that you have no say or control in it you have free will all of us do and wether or not being gay was popular back in bible times has no bearing on the way god feels about people being gay if you truly love and worship god the way you say you do then his view will be most important to you and it is his opinion you should seek not other peoples or even your own for human opinion is fickle and biased you cannot trust it but of course you can reason your way out of listening to god's word the way you are doing but that will not makle it right will it and is that truly out of love for god or yourself is it worship to god Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Religion Book of Isaiah Meaning of life Homosexuality and Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sabbath Evil Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religion and sexuality New Testament Religion and sexual orientation Ten Commandments Predestination Church of Christ, Scientist Opus Dei Idolatry Biblical inerrancy Trinity Sin George Fox God and gender Prophet Philipp Melanchthon Sexual orientation Eastern Orthodox Church John Howard Yoder John Wesley Theory of conduct Summa Theologiae Creationism The nature of God in Western theology Urantia Judaism Sodom and Gomorrah Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Simone Weil Divine grace Sant Mat Philo Socrates Human sexual behavior A Course In Miracles Religious pluralism Fallen angel John Wycliffe Angel Love Bible Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Christian eschatology John the Baptist Great Apostasy Jewish Messiah Jehovah's Witnesses Abington School District v.
