atheist and christian arguments what is your problem i am always hearing arguments on christianity atheists and christians wasting their time going on and on trying to prove they are right and shoving religion or non religion down each other's throat why must we even discuss these things sure being christians we're supposed to spread the word but not like that god said her wants us to share his love with other but he didn't mean it that way he meant to simply show others love and compassion and that you are joyful about being a christian not saying that you are one and then letting them come to you and ask what they can do to be like that too it works so my question is what is going on why can't we just all keep our religions and beliefs to ourselves and stop picking fights what is wrong with people if you're a christian why don't you just leave the athiest alone they are people with their own opinions sure you may not like it but how do you feel when people try to get you to turn away from god think about it i don t mean discussing it here i just mean in general i didn't post this to make anyone mad it was simply a question i've been wanting to ask for a while i'm not trying to start an argument thank you thank you thank you i come here for discussion and to hear other people's opinion but too many people are here just to make fun of other people or to be insulting or to nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah at the opposite side i really like it when i find a question that's thoughtful and intriguing and genuine they make it worth the rest of the bs Atheism The nature of God in Western theology Religion Existence of God Theodicy A Course In Miracles God Agnosticism Transcendental argument for the existence of God David Hume Christianity Meaning of life Biblical inerrancy Philosophical skepticism Teach the Controversy Ten Commandments Afterlife Simone Weil Creationism Twelve-step program Epistemology Theory of conduct Freemasonry Opus Dei Philosophy Alcoholics Anonymous Intelligent design Fundamentalism Patriotism Socrates Predestination Pledge of Allegiance Strong atheism Abortion debate Historicity of Jesus Religious Society of Friends Sin History of creationism Evil Ludwig Wittgenstein Cult Deconstruction Free will Pacifism Autism rights movement Charles Darwin's views on religion S__ren Kierkegaard Apostasy Shaggy dog story Sexual orientation Internet troll Theology Originalism Philosophy of religion William A.
