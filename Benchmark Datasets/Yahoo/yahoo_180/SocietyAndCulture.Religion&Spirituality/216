who saw tyra's show on witchcraft and satanism http tyrashow warnerbros com i felt she was kinda a bit attacky on people i actually did catch that one afternoon and as a firm believer in wicca i was a little disgusted by it thank goddess that she chose some really good guests particularly the blonde author i can't recall her name right now and the other white witches who all seemed fairly positive and good representatives even her dark witches which i was very scared about when i heard the little preview came out looking pretty balanced and normal in presenting their side of things and the satanists were just fun but of course the wiccan turned christian girl was awful as heck and all the intros and stuff with soft focus cameras wheeling in the candlelit dark with the sound of creepy music and what sound like dying souls that peeved me off tyra's always been a little sensationalist to me and i got that feeling about that show but at the same time when that christian girl started spouting a little speech at the end tyra actually did look a little disturbed and i recall feeling like even she felt a little bad for the witches and satanists when she said yes well i think that most people feel like you do overall not too bad a show i think it let out a lot of good information and positive images Wicca Witchcraft Witch-hunt Satan Magic (paranormal) Dianic Wicca Witches (Discworld) Satanism The Ashlee Simpson Show Blood on the Tracks Time Out of Mind Satanic ritual abuse Incarnations of Immortality Salem witch trials Margaret Murray Neopaganism Blonde on Blonde Stregheria Princess Knight Pentagram Opposition to cults and new religious movements Bonus Stage Persecution of Wiccans Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism America's Next Top Model LaVeyan Satanism Horned God Norway national football team Backward message Cat John Todd (evangelist) Theory of conduct Wiccan Rede Homosexuality and Neopaganism Gerina Dunwich Force (Star Wars) Hecate Hell Charmed Queen of Wands Anarchism and religion Christian views on witchcraft Xiaolin Showdown Milton H.
