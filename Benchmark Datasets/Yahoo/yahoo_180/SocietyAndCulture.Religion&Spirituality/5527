if god exists if god exists to fight the evil and support the good why do we have police and courts on earth if elements and minerals metls like iron sulphur carbn calcium sodium magnisiam chlorine suphur oxygen hydrogen etc ar required foi lie and whne these are avilable in thier elementary form why should we need to eat cerela pulses fruits vegetables mutton chicken fish vegetables and take the trobleof cooking them and mixingthem with spices peper salt etc why not take them directl and place them ina continer in side the stomuch so that we may nit have to excrete anyhknmg fopr some months as years too it is not the existence of god that decide the rquirement of the police court etc god exiss in yur soul and evrything in this universe exist in god and god al so existes in every thing you copuld see ansd couls not see you do nt see youyr heart functioning and yu do nt see yur bain functioning thea tdoes not mean that you do not have them you also might perhaps feel that you have them too god exists in the so called inanimate beings i refer tothem as beings as done bykrsihna himself for the simple reason that they are very much alive and all the so called animate beigs ar composed of them only also as they are vibrant with energy and the active vibrant electrons and the protons also exist in them god is the soul of every being that being the case it is pertinent for any one to aks why man does commit sins one who asks sucha question is anot a atheist he is a sensible person who raises a verty scientific and sensible question the reason is as follows god does not patake of he actions of any one good or bad if god were to be monitoring the movements and the actions of man at every step why should man exist at all why should man e created at all top make the poit more clear i woud give one example you know that the internal combustion engine is an essentialpart of a car withour which no car will be able to run it is the life of the car it is the engine that gives the motive force to the car wen an accident occurs yu do nt blame the engine and yu know for sure that the engine is in no way responsiblefor any accidetn that any car migh e involved in it is always the brakes the gears the streering wheel the throttle accelerator the rear view mirrora the blinkers and the driver who handles them all that would be responsible for the accident or safe running of the car the driver is the brain of the manwho decises matters the adjuncts of the car ar erthe senses of the man which guide him by hteir inputs if h eman is able to control the senses and use them properly for takin ghis decisions he is sage if he al lows the senses to tke control of him and allows them to master himself he would be lost it is tha simple god has goien man a brain and the five senses to gie his brain the rquired in puts for taking decisions why should god be taking decisons for the man in hois day to day actions yur parents might secure s spouse you cannot expect them to prodiuce your chilren that you must do sorry this has to be put so bluntly to prove a point that no body shoud expect god toguide him in every move of his life having equipped man with all that is necesaary for him to condiuct his day to day life god does nt partake of his dailyactivities so he police sttions etc are created by us to set right mistakes and offences we commit in our daily life but whn we commit the gravest offece that would endanger the whole human species and all the beings in the unierse then god would need to act to se right things this is why god has said as follows the lord does not patake of anyone's evil or good conduct knowledge is obscured by ignorance so people ar deluded verse of the th teachig of bhaavad gita whenever sacred duty decays and chaos prevails then i create myself arjuna verse of the th teaching to protect men opf virtue and destroy men who do evil to set the standards of sacrd duty i appear in age afer age verse of th teaching these are the famous lines mentioned below parithraanaaya sadhu naam vinaasaaya chathukruthaam dharma sansthaapanaarthaaya sambhavaami yughe yughe so god does nt use an axe to cut a thorn below a rose bud but uses it to cut a piosonous tree of immense proportions the police stations are created by us to deal with the petty crimes that we commit on a daily basis and those that don't destroy humanity but when humans commit destructive acts that endanger the world you will see god in action god waits but strikes surely your eyes exist though you do not see them except through some mirror so also yu donot see god and you can see only through the divine eye wisdom that lord krsihna gave arjuna to see the totality of god i think i have given it it is for you to see Constitution of the Turkish
