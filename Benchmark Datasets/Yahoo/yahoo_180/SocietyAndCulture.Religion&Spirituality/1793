opinions please why in your opinions do you think it is easier to be stronger when your personally not involved in a situation for instance people can say you know your strong when what other people say to you doesn't offect how you feel why does somethings bother certain people and it affects others more i had a talk with my dad tonight and he said to me that i will know that i am stronger when my mother in law doesn't bother me with what she says and i can look at her and walk away without being affected but my dad doesn't have a personal connection to her so don't you think that i will always take what she says more personal and to the heart my mother in law has a sharp and evil tougne and is quick to say things that seem to always hurt me tell me your thoughts and if you ever had to deal with this i agree with you if someone is toxic to you and hurts your feelings you should stay away from them you have no obligation to be around people that hurt you some people have no boundries to how they behave i do believe however that you should say something to your mother in law you need to teach people how to treat you and if they can't respect you then you have obligation to have to be around people like that talk to her and let her know it doesn't make you feel right Theory of conduct Alignment (role-playing games) Evil Pitaten Social rule Fathers' rights Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Dog training Abortion debate Ranma __ characters The Fairly OddParents Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Milton H.
