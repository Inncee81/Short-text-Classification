where do we get our perception of who or what god is i always laugh at this quote by mark twain god created man in his own image and man being a gentleman returned the favor mark twain but all jokes aside i do feel that what we attribute god to be often stems from our own desire to have a god that we can relate to i e someone like us or someone we can look up to what do you think wow i am impressed with so many thoughtful responses thanks everyone i just answered two questions the same way and what i said there seems to fit here as well i believe in questioning beliefs and insisting on direct empirical experience and on valid psychological principles that's why i practice contemplative techniques in general and buddhist practices in specific the sorts of experiences i have known through such practices give me to understand that references to god are best understood as poetic utterances gesturing towards and expressive of humanity's deepest appreciative awareness of the living miracle of being so that likely makes me a species of an agnostic gnostic more than a believing in no gods atheist god in other words is to me a three letter poem and if we take it any other way we risk very much commiting a kind of idolatry in making god be a matter of something we think rather than a response to our most sincere encounters with that which we cannot think peace innerpeacemom Atheism God Existence of God A Course In Miracles Agnosticism Simone Weil Meaning of life Supernatural Theodicy Psychology of religion The nature of God in Western theology Gnosticism Creationism God and gender David Hume Soul Idolatry Charles Darwin's views on religion Theology Evolutionary creationism Neuro-linguistic programming Prayer Religious pluralism Jewish principles of faith Meditation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Hindu philosophy Jewish views of religious pluralism Fundamentalism Epistemology Presuppositional apologetics Idolatry in Christianity Philosophy of language Scientology beliefs and practices Deconstruction Atomism New Testament Reincarnation Social psychology Kuzari Psychoanalysis Transcendental argument for the existence of God Summa Theologiae Aristotle Predestination Infant baptism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Human Determinism Judaism Psychology Hinduism Freemasonry Human sexual behavior Buddhism Consciousness Duties of the Heart Socrates Religious conversion Franz Boas Separation of church and state Creation-evolution controversy Sexual orientation Roman Catholic Church Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Cult Superstition Cultural and historical background of Jesus Zohar Cultural relativism Afterlife Humour Koan Devil Swami Vivekananda Bertrand Russell Patriotism Apologetics Christianity Guru-shishya tradition Islam Evolutionism Biblical inerrancy Friedrich Schleiermacher Past teachings of Prem Rawat Book of Mormon Religious studies Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Jiddu Krishnamurti Science The relationship between religion and science
