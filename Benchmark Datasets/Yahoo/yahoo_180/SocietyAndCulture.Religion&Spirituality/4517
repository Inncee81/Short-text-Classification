once you finish your prayer do you fell as if a burden has been lifted do you feel peace that god was listening do you feel as if a load has been lifted just by confessing aloud what is going on or do you feel the need to beg for forgiveness and believe yourself unworthy of receiving anything as this is a question board i did not hink my opinion or belief mattered in my question but to answer the one who asked do you yes i do feel as if a burdan has been lifted and that confessing aloud one on one with god has given me clarity and perspective our belief in almighty god should be a unique uncomparable one it is not like how we ask our manager or boss at work when we want to ask for some favour from him we see so many things his mood if he is busy etc then we go and ask him but asking and praying to god is not the same it is a unique we are asking our creator who is above such humanly behaviour also we should ask with a staunch belief that he will show us way example is how prophet moses with his followers crossed the ocean when his enemy was following him from behind he reached the ocean in front still he believed his god is with him another example is prophet ibrahim when he was about to be thrown into the fire by his enemies till the last second he had a very strong uncomparable belief in the god who has created the fire the enemies and himself so the creator knows how to save him we have to have belief in god and then pray seek forgiveness then the prayer will have its effect man always tend to limit the god's power as finite when he is praying in reality we are praying to the god who has created the minute electron and also the the entire universe which is infinite A Course In Miracles God Zohar Religious pluralism Eastern Orthodox Church Baptism The nature of God in Western theology Abraham Religion Separation of church and state in the United States Jewish principles of faith Divine grace Prophets of Islam Christianity Origin belief Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Predestination Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Determinism Qiyamah John Wycliffe Mass (liturgy) Sola fide Dispensationalism Maimonides John Howard Yoder Abrahamic religion Scientology beliefs and practices Angel Free will Atheism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Church of Christ, Scientist Tridentine Mass Salvation Yusuf al-Qaradawi Christian views of Jesus Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Ten Commandments Idolatry Charles Grandison Finney Apostasy in Islam Prayer in Christianity Roman Catholic Church Religious Society of Friends Merit Duties of the Heart Amidah Muhammad Intercession of saints Gospel of Barnabas Sin Jesus Jan Hus Judaism Meaning of life Biblical canon Christian eschatology Existence of God Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Islamic philosophy Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Creationism Kabbalah Magic (paranormal) Virgin Mary in Islam Presuppositional apologetics Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Resurrection of Jesus Muslim ibn Aqeel Separation of church and state Cultural and historical background of Jesus Opus Dei Biblical inerrancy John Wesley Sacrifice Calvinism Hinduism Articles of Religion (Methodist) Michael (archangel) Religious perspectives on Jesus Holy Spirit Vishnu Philo Devil Coptic Christianity Angels in Islam Justification (theology) James Martineau Martin Luther
