why is it that a few christians that i know are so scared of the devil that they almost can't function one lady i know calls deviled eggs angel eggs instead because she doesn't want to say the devil's name i asked her grandson what she called devils food cake because if she calls it angel food cake it is a whole different cake another one told my daughter that every bad thought she ever had was caused by the devil nonsense it is all relative what is even bad is it all just fear thinking about it for those who live entirely immersed in a fantasy world where nothing happens without religious significance this sort of thing is almost like warding off the evil eye if you really think that a deity watches you constantly in case you brush your teeth in an unrighteous manner then i suppose there's a great deal of background fear that some little slip will lead to the whole house of cards collapsing cd Devil Magic (paranormal) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sinfest Halloween Theory of conduct The Pilgrim's Progress Little Britain Hell Shark The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Witchcraft Christmas Cake Angel Satanism Discworld Demon Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Garfield Exorcism Arjuna YuYu Hakusho Milton H.
