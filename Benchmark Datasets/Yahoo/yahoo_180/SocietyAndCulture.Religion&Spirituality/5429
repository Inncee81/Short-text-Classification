how many christians out there think in god we trust should be taken off money i know there are some out there who believe and support total seperation of church and state do we have any here i never thought about it that way cj good point lol it is sort of a contradiction nina shut up you sound stupid ugh i have had it today with stupid christians save me from my self crocoduck i do i agree with cj although i'd like to add an additional thought no spiritual entity of any faith can be connected to the god that is referred to on the dollar therefore it looks very obvious that stamping in god we trust on money is not so much a statement that god is being trusted but that the god in which they trust is money for example if i stamped in god i trust onto a picture of kim jong il or david koresh it would appear to be a statement saying that they are god or if i stamped it onto a statue of a golden calf it would be an obvious statement that the god i was referring to would be the golden calf in this case in god we trust is stamped on money so naturally i think the god that is referred to is money it doesn't seem to be about any entity of any religion there are too many inconsistencies on the dollar bill for that it appears plain as day to me to be about greed money lol and it's quite obvious isn't it that money is god in america so yes as a christian as a mere human being i do think in god we trust should be taken off the dollar bill because it's a claim that god is money way to lord it over the masses eh i love that you asked this question Meaning of life Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Divine grace The nature of God in Western theology Sola fide Trinity Ten Commandments Salvation Ontological argument Idolatry Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Unification Church Agnosticism Religious pluralism Atheism Opus Dei Christianity Intelligent design movement Predestination Epistemology God Church of Christ, Scientist A Course In Miracles LaVeyan Satanism Separation of church and state in the United States Protestantism Book of Mormon Pledge of Allegiance Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Biblical inerrancy Presuppositional apologetics Monarchy in Canada Theory of conduct Infant baptism Soul In God We Trust Intelligent design Separation of church and state Simone Weil Truth William A.
