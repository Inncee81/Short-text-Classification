the thing about intuition ok so i guess you could say i believe in intuition because sometimes i do get the feeling about something and decide from there alot of people say and am not sure if its in the bible as well that intuition is god speaking to you but then again if life is pre destined why the need for intuition maybe am just concluding too quickly but does anyone else think that way i dont think that life is pre destined and and i dont believe that god is talking to you when you use your intuition i believe that intuition is your body being sensitive to the energies around you every emotion or action puts off energy and if you can calm and center yourself enough then you can pick up on thoes energies and fairly reliably if you really work at it but to be the devils advocate who's to say that it is or is not your god speaking to you if you believe it is and that makes you listen to your intuition more often and you benifit from it then you can call it whatever you like as long as it serves you well Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Numerology Afterlife Religious Society of Friends Religion Josemar__a Escriv__ Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Ontological argument New Age Sant Thakar Singh Meditation Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Phillip E.
