can you tell me everything you know about the st michael the archangel scapular in what ways does it differ from our lady's scapular what is the promise purpose attached to it it looks like some of the people who've already responded have most of the basic information there i'm afraid i don't have much to add i can say that it's supposed to protect the wearer from evil spirits and help him her with the battles ahead in reality though a scapular is not some magic token as i'm sure you've heard it's more of a way of life it's a way of focusing yourself so that you lead a better and holier life in and of itself however it's just a piece of wool as for differences between the st michael scapular and the our lady scapular there are a few physically the st michael one is shaped like a shield rather than as a simple rectangle devotionally the focus is on st michael rather than the virgin the most important difference however is probably in regards to committment for the our lady scapular you have to be formally invested with it by a priest and you must follow some minimal devotional requirements such as saying hail mary's every day optimally you would also follow some of the more basic rules of the order these requirements are all absent with the st michael scapular there is no formal enrollment necessary it needs no commitment and there are no requirements for what you must do it is therefore a little more individualistic nonetheless one is not better than the other both are precisely what you make of them neither more nor less Carmelites Scapular Eastern Orthodox Church Oblate (religion) Blessed Virgin Mary Roman Catholic Church Mary, the mother of Jesus Theory of conduct Holy Spirit Baptism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Commodity markets Ayyavazhi mythology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abrahamic religion Second language acquisition Angel Religious Society of Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Supply and demand Coercion Deconstruction Plame affair Order of the Garter Strap-on dildo The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Japanese tea ceremony Lumen Gentium The nature of God in Western theology Shaman King Compiler optimization Final Fantasy magic Hangul Michael (archangel) Resurrection of Jesus Priesthood (Mormonism) Religion Value system Narcissism Objective-C Military science Who is a Jew?
