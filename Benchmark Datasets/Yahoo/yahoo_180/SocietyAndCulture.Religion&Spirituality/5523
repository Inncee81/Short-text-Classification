religion the truth i wondered what you thought about this well actually i don't care but here goes religion was created to control the masses the truth is we are all made up of energy and the only 'god' in this world is in fact ourselves life is what you make of it and only you can determine if you are a good person or not when we die our 'spirit' leaves the body and is then left roaming the earth until it collects with other spirits and starts the cycle again maybe this time you will be a tree or a new baby who knows but at the end of the day there is no god only yourself and the sooner you accept that the better dying for a religion is stupid and sucking other people into that religion is plain wrong perhaps if you all really thought about it you would realise that deep down all your looking for is someone to believe in who will tell you how to live your life and be a better person at the end of the day you are ugly enough to do that yourself so stop bieng a sheep and start living rock on Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an God The nature of God in Western theology Hinduism Holy Spirit The Amber Spyglass Evil Friedrich Schleiermacher Spiritism Abrahamic religion Abortion debate Religious Society of Friends Meaning of life Gospel of Thomas Kain (Legacy of Kain) Philo Gautama Buddha Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints God and gender Fundamentalism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Urantia Social rule Moral objectivism Soul Jewish eschatology Roman Catholic Church Sola fide Origin belief Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Reincarnation Theodicy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Supernatural Ontological argument Mormonism Scientology beliefs and practices Adam-God theory George Fox Jon Secada Joke Death Comes to Time Ethics Theory of conduct Baptism Mormonism and Christianity Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Human Saint Divine grace Immortality Ten Commandments Chinese astrology S__ren Kierkegaard Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Gandhism Michel Henry Simone Weil John Wesley Original sin Monotheism John Howard Yoder Heaven Rastafari movement Anti-Mormonism Theology Justification (theology) Thomas Carlyle Prophet Exorcism Opus Dei Religious conversion Sri Aurobindo Animism Maimonides God the Father Unification Church Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Eastern Orthodox Church Swami Vivekananda Socrates Satanism The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Tertullian Zoroastrianism InterFaith Kodocha Force (Star Wars) Buddhism Chosen people Brahman Rich Mullins Traumatic incident reduction Theosophy Joseph Campbell Resurrection of Jesus Athanasian Creed Spirituality
