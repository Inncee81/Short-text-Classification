what if you got to know someone and really liked them then you found out thier religon was something other then yours would it change how you see them me personally no to be honest i have no idea what most people in my life's religion is nor do i care i was just wondering i admit to being afraid that some of my friends wouldn't be my friends if they new i was pagan yeah is is freaking smokin wow mystine so because i'm not christian i have no vaules and the mental disorder comment was an insult for people who have real ones why don't you suffer one and see how you feel i'm bipolar with ocd trade ya unfortunatly some people are shallow like that personally i don't care what a person's religious beliefs are as long as they dont try to shove it down my throat condemn me to hell or try to convert me i am not sure what kind of friends you are talking about wether it was someone you really liked and wanted to hook up with or just a friend but either way love and friendship should conquer all i personally know some people that wont be friends with anyway outside of thier religion because well i dont really know i think it has something to do with the fact that if someone doesnt believe what they do then they must worship the devil or something and dont want to get sucked in pretty stupid i know but thats how some people are for some reason who would think that something as peaceful as a religion would shun everyone who didnt think they way they did anyway my advice would be to keep your beliefs to yourself if someone asks tell them but dont volunteer it if they dislike you because of something like that then they shouldnt be in your life anyway Religious Society of Friends Religion Religious pluralism Atomic Kitten Evil Witchcraft Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Trinity Nation of Islam Obsessive-compulsive disorder Love Jon Secada Philipp Melanchthon Cult Little Britain Theory of conduct Satanism Laura Schlessinger Recurring South Park characters Borderline personality disorder Infidels Alcoholics Anonymous Hell George Fox Mojave people Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Rastafari movement Bertrand Russell Christianity and anti-Semitism Reincarnation Apostasy Magical thinking Transsexuality Max Weber Historical persecution by Christians God Opus Dei Religion and mythology She Loves You Sexual orientation LaVeyan Satanism Cliff Richard Christianity Supernatural God and gender Avenue Q Discordianism Sabbath Social rule Evangelicalism Jiddu Krishnamurti The nature of God in Western theology Sociology of religion Witch trial Kurt Cobain Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Humphrey Bogart Marilyn Monroe Scouting Michael Savage (commentator) Idolatry Euphemism Kodocha Sin Kyle Broflovski Sant Thakar Singh Noel Gallagher Zhao Yun Ten Commandments Christian eschatology Richard Wagner Freemasonry The Emancipation of Mimi Bipolar disorder Swami Vivekananda Spiritism John Howard Yoder Dissociative identity disorder Howard Stern Christian anarchism Friedrich Nietzsche Anti-Mormonism Pig (zodiac) Scientology beliefs and practices Pharisees Minister of religion Noam Chomsky Neopaganism Knots Landing Sacrifice Freaks and Geeks Transactional analysis Church of Christ, Scientist
