why does god require death and blood to be able to speak with him why is it that you need to kill an innocent animal and wipe it's blood on the four corners of an altar just to talk to him john constantine your stupidity truly amazes me mtm the bible talks about this in the old testament before jesus by the way i've been a christian all my life too uh that was in moses' time not now and actually if you want to know the truth the only reason god required it was because it was what the people wanted not what god wanted it's all symbolic pointing us towards the truth an altar is something built by mortal hands for the purpose of making an offering upon it usually dedicated to a deity when one obeys the commands of god one is effectually dedicating his or her works upon the altar before god figuratively exclaiming here o my god are my works that i have fulfilled and dedicated to thee therefore being slain upon the altar means that one has sacrificed one s life for the word of god by keeping his commandments moses was commanded to construct an altar to specified dimensions this is symbolic of the commandments of god being specific in their purpose which jesus gives as the greatest law and commandment of all the prophets do unto others what you would have them do unto you also the four corners of the altar are symbolic of the four corners of the earth the earth was laid out precisely as intended by the creators according to the laws of nature given for this type of creation thus in symbolic representation of this the altar was meticulously and precisely constructed for the rebellious jews various instructions and precise details which are a part of the law of moses are detailed in exodus to a large amount these busy laws of building a tabernacle an altar and an ark and adorning them along with all the works to be done with each were given after the people had rejected the simple laws moses had taught them these quotes come from a book explaining all of revelation in the bible it is most amazing Exodus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Moses Prophet Altar Pharisees Divine grace Jewish principles of faith Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Judaism Dispensationalism Sabbath God Korban Tabernacle Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Eucharist Abrahamic religion Eastern Orthodox Church Biblical inerrancy Trinity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Old Testament Sin Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Endowment (Mormonism) Jesus Tithe Christianity Miracle Book of Joshua Holy Spirit Angel Genesis Mary, the mother of Jesus Biblical canon Jewish symbolism Abraham 613 mitzvot Baptism Michael (archangel) Sola fide Torah Justin Martyr Solomon's Temple Resurrection of Jesus Book of Revelation Noahide Laws New Testament view on Jesus' life Creation according to Genesis Bible Satan Sukkot Book of Isaiah Religion Religious perspectives on Jesus Jehovah's Witnesses Mormonism and Judaism New Testament Prayer Book of Mormon Ark of the Covenant Original sin Documentary hypothesis Tribulation Names of God in Judaism A Course In Miracles Plagues of Egypt Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Paul of Tarsus Apocalypse Philo Summa Theologiae Book of Numbers Cultural and historical background of Jesus Messiah Roman Catholic Church Church of Christ Revelation Christian views of Jesus Creationism Noah's Ark Historicity of Jesus Zoroastrianism Serpent Opus Dei Monotheism Leviticus Chosen people Gospel of Barnabas Fundamentalism Jeremiah End times Temple in Jerusalem
