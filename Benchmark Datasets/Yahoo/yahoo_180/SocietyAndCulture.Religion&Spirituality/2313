unforgivable sin i have heard people talk about the unforgivable sin what is it is it real where in the bible do i find it i was under the impression that all sin was able to be forgiven an unforgivable sin is described in mark and matthew these passages involve jesus christ's repeated and widespread public defeat of satan and his demons many readers and theologians have been confused about the true nature of this sin as you read these verses for yourself below bear in mind part of the purpose of jesus christ's ministry was to directly confront darkness with the light of truth in a public battle of pure good versus pure evil the only being in the universe that is more powerful than the evil one is god he is the only one with enough power to bind satan himself and forcibly dispossess him mark states and the scribes who came down from jerusalem said 'he has beelzebub ' and 'by the ruler of the demons he casts out demons ' 'assuredly i jesus say to you all sins will be forgiven the sons of men and whatever blasphemies they may utter but he who blasphemes against the holy spirit never has forgiveness but is subject to eternal condemnation ' because they said 'he has an unclean spirit' nkjv emphasis added note the pharisees made the same charge in mat in matthew jesus says to the pharisees therefore i say to you every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven men anyone who speaks a word against the son of man it will be forgiven him but whoever speaks against the holy spirit it will not be forgiven him either in this age or in the age to come nkjv emphasis added Blasphemy A Course In Miracles Jesus Trinity Holy Spirit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sola fide Book of Mormon Sin Devil Resurrection of Jesus Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Book of Isaiah Demon God Church of Christ, Scientist Angel Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Christian eschatology Summa Theologiae Sabbath Eastern Orthodox Church Original sin Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Roman Catholic Church Justification (theology) Antichrist Ten Commandments Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Divine grace Salvation Nontrinitarianism Mary, the mother of Jesus Gospel of Mark Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Christianity Urantia Gospel of Barnabas Charles Grandison Finney Origen Abrahamic religion Judas Iscariot Theology Christian anarchism Contrition Satanism John Wycliffe Confession Prophet Heaven Mark 16 Paul of Tarsus Gospel of Thomas John Howard Yoder Dispensationalism Apostle Belial New Testament New Testament view on Jesus' life Legalism (theology) Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom Paradise Lost Jehovah's Witnesses Articles of Religion (Methodist) Merit Binitarianism Christian views of Jesus John the Baptist Predestination Repentance Historical Jesus Filioque clause Harrowing of Hell Tribulation Acts of the Apostles Religious conversion Demonic possession Evil History of the English Bible Alan Campbell (pastor) Great Apostasy Christianity and anti-Semitism Gospel of Matthew Beelzebub Judaism Seventh-day Adventist Church Homosexuality and Christianity Book of Revelation Day-Age Creationism Nicene Creed Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Gospel of John Azazel Magic (paranormal)
