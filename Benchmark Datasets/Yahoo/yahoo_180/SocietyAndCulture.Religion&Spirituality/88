why is it that i must choose each religion tells me this i lead a good and just life doing no harm to others and helping those in need when i can i'm not a religious person i do not believe in the existence of god or a heaven or hell yet all those who do tell me that my refusal to accept god into my life tell me i'm going to go to hell i don't worry about this as said i would like to know how any denomination can justify themselves to me as to why they can say that they are the right and one true religion to follow the pagan belief system has spawned many branches eg wiccan druidism neo pagan kabbalah etc yet none claim to be the only way why do dogmatic or structured religions claim they have it right and be damned anyone else largely because they have written scripture that tells them that is the way it is that does not make it right but it is the fact of the matter had all copies for the bible and torah been destroyed we may have seen a more reasonable approach but as the bible has statements like you shall not bow down to them or worship them for i the lord your god am a jealous god and i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me it makes for the idea there can only be one right way despite all nature's evidence to the contrary Religion Ten Commandments Trinity Creationism God Fundamentalism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Judaism Church of Christ Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Hell Kabbalah Divine grace Monotheism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Idolatry Urantia Roman Catholic Church Resurrection of Jesus Great Apostasy Religious pluralism Jehovah's Witnesses Merit Existence of God Bible and reincarnation Jews as a chosen people Heresy Sabbath Atheism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theodicy Soul Witchcraft God and gender Names of God in Judaism Prophet Messianic Judaism Jesus Second Vatican Council Nontrinitarianism Angel Salvation Liberal Christianity Kuzari Freemasonry Evolutionary creationism Biblical inerrancy Jewish views of religious pluralism Islam Mormonism and Christianity Christian eschatology Moses Religion and mythology Modern geocentrism Religious Society of Friends Sin Chosen people Jewish philosophy Christianity and anti-Semitism Restorationism Satanism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Meaning of life Tertullian Hinduism Pascal's Wager Baptist Sacrifice Heaven Religious perspectives on Jesus Cultural and historical background of Jesus Eastern Orthodox Church Spiritism Saint Religious conversion Creation-evolution controversy Prayer Summa Theologiae Christian anarchism John Wycliffe Reincarnation Ethics in religion Gospel of Thomas Satan
