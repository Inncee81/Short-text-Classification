what does born again really mean catholics and protestants agree that to be saved you have to be born again jesus said so truly truly i say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god john when a catholic says that he has been born again he refers to the transformation that god s grace accomplished in him during baptism evangelical protestants typically mean something quite different when they talk about being born again for an evangelical becoming born again often happens like this he goes to a crusade or a revival where a minister delivers a sermon telling him of his need to be born again if you believe in the lord jesus christ and believe he died for your sins you ll be born again says the preacher so the gentleman makes a decision for christ and at the altar call goes forward to be led in the sinner s prayer by the minister then the minister tells all who prayed the sinner s prayer that they have been saved born again but is the minister right not according to the bible often people miss the fact that baptism gives us new life new birth because they have an impoverished view of the grace god gives us through baptism which they think is a mere symbol but scripture is clear that baptism is much more than a mere symbol in acts peter tells us repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit when paul was converted he was told and now why do you wait rise and be baptized and wash away your sins calling on his name acts peter also said god s patience waited in the days of noah during the building of the ark in which a few that is eight persons were saved through water baptism which corresponds to this now saves you not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to god for a clear conscience through the resurrection of jesus christ pet peter says that as in the time of the flood when eight people were saved through water so for christians b aptism now saves you it does not do so by the water s physical action but through the power of jesus christ s resurrection through baptism s spiritual effects and the appeal we make to god to have our consciences cleansed these verses showing the supernatural grace god bestows through baptism set the context for understanding the new testament s statements about receiving new life in the sacrament thus i consider myself born again every time i receive the holy eucharist and confess my sins to a priest peace and every blessing sources the bible catholic com library Merit Calvinism Sacrament Priesthood (Mormonism) Christian eschatology Holy water Ten Commandments Community of Christ Mormonism and Judaism Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Resurrection of Jesus Anabaptist History of Christianity Lutheranism Charismatic Evangelicalism Opus Dei New Testament view on Jesus' life True Jesus Church Mormonism Apostles' Creed Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religious Society of Friends Summa Theologiae New Testament Funeral of Pope John Paul II Jehovah's Witnesses John Howard Yoder Sacrifice Heaven Biblical inerrancy Apostle Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) Idolatry in Christianity Church of Christ, Scientist Seventh-day Adventist Church Eucharistic discipline Novus Ordo Missae John Wycliffe Christian and Missionary Alliance Minister of religion Coptic Christianity Prevenient grace Contrition Charles Grandison Finney Angel Noah Legalism (theology) Holy Orders Real Presence
