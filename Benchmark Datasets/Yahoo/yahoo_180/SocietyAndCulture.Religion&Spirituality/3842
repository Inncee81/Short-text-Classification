to all the complainers on r s would you rather fight than look at bible questions and yes i have hobbies and yes i have a life and no i will not stop and yes i have laundry too just not today because it is my sabbath and why are you here on r s my reason for asking all these questions since i have been asked several times is this the bible has a lot of interesting things in it i want people to see that and search for answers and get to know god that is one way of witnessing so i choose that god has all knowledge he gives everything you need to survive in the bible he gives examples for everyone so that you will know that he is real he gives details who could or would make all that stuff up if my questions intimidate you then just don't look at them if you are too lazy or too uninterested to look them up or type them into the computer then just skip them i don't comment on your questions that i don't like why is that because i am trying to be a considerate mature christian maybe that shows the difference there is room enough for all of us one here so scoot over i will ask these questions end of story fyi anyone can ask to have questions removed people that answer my questions have asked that some of the answers be removed i rarely do that it is not worth my time this is my last comment if i felt i was superior i would not bother reading the bible myself i need jesus more than anyone i know that only by his grace not by anything i can do that i am saved keep it up beth i always enjoy reading your questions and although i'm also a sabbath keeper there are still things i'm learning and your questions really help the best thing is to just ignore although i know it's hard the people who would rather fight and instigate arguments against the bible i know the lord is happy that you are doing this Sabbath Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Resurrection of Jesus Ten Commandments Meaning of life Bible Biblical inerrancy God Emperor of Dune Theory of conduct Religion Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Infant baptism Judaism Rich Mullins Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Supernatural Predestination Historicity of Jesus Biblical canon Paradise Lost Free will John Titor The nature of God in Western theology John Howard Yoder Christian eschatology Saint Peter Young Earth creationism Fundamentalism A Course In Miracles Jews as a chosen people Afterlife Presuppositional apologetics Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Socrates Discordianism Summa Theologiae Creationism History of the English Bible Intelligent design Pharisees On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Acts of the Apostles End times Slow Train Coming Trinity Merit Dispensationalism John Wycliffe Christianity and anti-Semitism Soul Christianity Catechism Miracle Quizbowl Tetragrammaton Criticism of Mormonism New Testament Satan Goodness and value theory Noahide Laws Talmud Past teachings of Prem Rawat Justification (theology) Have I Got News For You Messianic Judaism Origin belief Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Existence of God Avenue Q Satanism Adam and Eve Philosophical skepticism Halakha Alan Campbell (pastor) God and gender Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Plame affair Sola fide Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Objectivist philosophy The Death Gate Cycle Vishnu sahasranama Paul of Tarsus Church of Christ, Scientist Prophet Book of Mormon Social rule Charles Darwin's views on religion Phaedo
