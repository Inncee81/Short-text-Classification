how many violations of jewish law had to take place for jesus to be condemned to death even before jesus was brought to public trial following his arrest in the garden of gethsemane the sanhedrin had already assembled three times in secret and rendered decisions which prove beyond a doubt that the death sentence of christ was determined upon even before his public accusation the first such meeting was held in september of the year preceding the crucifixion this fact is made clear by st john the evangelist in his account of jesus healing the man born blind when he states for the jews had already agreed that if any man did confess that he was the christ he should be put out of the synagogue jn for only a solemn assembly of the sanhedrin had power to pronounce such a decree of excommunication in excommunicating jesus followers they indirectly declared jesus a false prophet and hence subject to the death penalty is this not a proof as nicodemus had implied jn that they had already condemned him without having granted him a hearing or listened to a word in his defense the second such session of the sanhedrin took place in the month of february about four and a half months after the first session the resurrection of lazarus was the occasion that called the sanhedrin into council at this time from jn so the chief priests and the pharisees gathered the council and said what are we to do for this man performs many signs if we let him go on thus every one will believe in him and the romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation but one of them caiaphas who was high priest that year said to them you know nothing at all you do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation should not perish so from that day on they took counsel how to put him to death we see then that at this second council the death of christ was decided upon in the september session his death was proposed only indirectly but this time the sentence is passed the high priest having himself declared that it were better for one man to die this sentence was pronounced without summoning the accused into council without witnesses and without making any investigation of his doctrines or his miracles neither was it pronounced because jesus was found to be seditious or revolutionary but because it was necessary to put a stop to his miracles and thus destroy the peoples belief in him the sentence having been pronounced by the high priest it was ratified by the whole assembly from that day on they took counsel how to put him to death it is a settled question there remains to be determined only the time and the manner of executing the sentence have we not here ample evidence that the condemnation of jesus preceded is arrest and trial the third session was held about three weeks after the second just two days before the passion now the feast of unleavened bread drew near which is called the passover and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to put him to death for they feared the people then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest who was called caiaphas and took counsel together in order to arrest jesus by stealth and kill him but they said not during the feast lest there be a tumult among the people lk mt we notice that at this gathering the question of the sentence of christ is no longer debated his death had already been determined upon at the second session the only things that now remain to be settled are the manner of his death and the proper time for its execution now let us sum up the decisions of the three councils the first council in excommunicating the partisans of christ denounced him as a false prophet and consequently guilty of death in the second council the question of whether he should die was proposed and unanimously decided in the affirmative in the third council his arrest and execution were appointed to take place at the first favorable opportunity we now ask of every sincere israelite if the trial of christ was not a fearful mockery and a lie the subsequent trial of jesus on the eve of the passion entailed no less than violations of jewish law any single one of which would be sufficient to nullify the verdict of the sanhedrin the article is taken from salvation is from the jews website by roy schoeman he mentions violations of the sanhedrin's own laws including the trial of jesus in secret in spite of his popularity with the jewish people placing blame on the leaders at the time http www salvationisfromthejews com sanhedrin html too many polemics no intellectual answers yet comeone is this yahoo answers or a forum for amateur atheists and human culture anthropologists any serious answerers here l'chaim your question has already been applied to jesus by earlier minds you would either think him a madman or impostor or really what he said he was that's where proof miracles come in jesus did say that if you didn't believe what he said then atleast believe because of what he did excellent reasoning jim k you've also answered eventhisidistaken and miranda's questions applying the cunning of the sanhedrin and how they got the romans to execute jesus on sedition charges when they romans were actually least bothered by his miracles or what he did after all jesus did tell his followerrs to obey the authorities he was no political revolutionary who frightened the romans very good article very well thought out the only thing that is missing is that the jewish authorities of the time could not by roman law enforce the death penalty in order to do that they had find a charge that would get the roman's attention thus they chose sedition interestingly when pilate had the charge placed on the plaque above jesus' head the sanhedrin complained yet it was that charge that enabled them to take it to the roman court in the first place see john my only critique of the article is the use of the gregorian calendar's months since the gregorian calendar wasn't instituted until the 's i would be very skeptical of any claim that something occurred in february september or any other month without citing a source for the conversion of the dates
