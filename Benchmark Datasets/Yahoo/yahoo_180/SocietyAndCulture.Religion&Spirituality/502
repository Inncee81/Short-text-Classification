atheists if you saw a christian drinking beer and smoking a cigarette would it ruin their testimony i should have asked why or why not i'm not an atheist i'm a christian but drinking beer is not a sin getting drunk is but not drinking well getting drunk is bad for anyone now smoking isn't directly mentioned in the bible but christians seem to be divided on this issue more than alcohol god consider your body a temple so we shouldn't consume anything or do anything to it physically that would be harmful i personally think smoking is not a wise choice and again even for atheists if i saw another christian smoking i might question them as to why and how they see it's acceptable if i saw another christian drinking i wouldn't think anything of it unless they got drunk and again christian or not it's not a good idea to get drunk also christians should follow the law so underage drinking would make me question them too a christian's testimony should consist of realizing they are a sinner and the repentance of their sins and their faith in jesus christ some atheists are dead set on not listening to christians anyway evangelizing is important but if atheists were to judge you so quick as to say that drinking and smoking makes you less of a christian well that's being judgmental that's bad on their part it simply makes their case for not being a christian lesser a testimony is only as good as the trust it carries if you think that drinking and smoking would lose the trust of an atheist perhaps it would be a good idea to refrain from it however asking atheists this question seems kind of pointless because again they're looking for ways to bring us down don't let them use something like alcohol and cigarettes as a tool godsgirl i think you're missing the point if a christian was actually sinning that would bring down their testimony after all if their testimony was about repenting of sins committing sins in front of someone is hypocrisy i agree that we are all humans and we make mistakes but our salvation is why we're not supposed to sin drinking is not a sin but if it would cause a christian brother or even an atheist to think twice about you it may not be best to do it so your statement about how christians are humans and we sometimes sin sounds more like an excuse and we shouldn't use that Sin Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sola fide Baptism Salvation Original sin Justification (theology) Eastern Orthodox Church Religion Christianity Charles Grandison Finney Infant baptism Soul Ten Commandments Atheism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Calvinism Lutheranism Resurrection of Jesus Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Repentance Gospel of Thomas Evil Christian views of Jesus Summa Theologiae Roman Catholic Church Jesus Predestination Church of Christ The nature of God in Western theology Legalism (theology) Book of Isaiah Hell Prophet Baptist Purgatory Divine grace Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Heaven Great Apostasy Abrahamic religion Fundamentalism Fasting Prevenient grace 613 mitzvot Qiyamah Evangelicalism Articles of Religion (Methodist) Antinomianism Mormonism Homosexuality and Christianity Perseverance of the saints Martin Luther Christianity and anti-Semitism Simone Weil Religious conversion Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Jewish principles of faith Mormonism and Christianity Capital punishment Mortification of the flesh Christian eschatology Excommunication Afterlife Holy Spirit John the Baptist Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Jehovah's Witnesses Merit Urantia Alcoholics Anonymous Church of Christ, Scientist Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Confession Goodness and value theory History of Christianity Moral objectivism Religious Society of Friends Christian and Missionary Alliance Blood atonement Separation of church and state Historical Jesus Trinity
