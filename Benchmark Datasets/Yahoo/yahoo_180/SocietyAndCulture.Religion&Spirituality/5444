can you believe in god and ghosts i'm curious to know the stance on christianity and the paranormal i would assume if you believed in one you wouldn't the other but that isn't what i've always come across i have recently found god you could say but unfortunately i am quite uninformed on his teachings obviously each person is an individual and therefore has individual opinions on said matter but on an overall can anyone shed light on the subject well why not believe in something which doesn't exist if you already believe in another i mean there's no real proof for god nor is there any for ghosts so i say why not believe but if you're asking whether your religions allows such beliefs that is a different question firstly you'd have to define what religion you have faith in Supernatural Soul Atheism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religion God Theodicy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Trinity Creationism Magic (paranormal) Existence of God Predestination Roman Catholic Church Holy Spirit Christianity Philosophy of religion Biblical inerrancy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Baptism Infant baptism Ghost Evolutionary creationism Religious conversion Meaning of life Liberal Christianity Reincarnation Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Heaven Agnosticism The nature of God in Western theology Intelligent design Jewish principles of faith Prayer Demon Faith Neopaganism Hell Church of Christ, Scientist Creation-evolution controversy Idolatry Protestantism Mormonism Morality Islamic philosophy Heresy Mormonism and Christianity Animism Pascal's Wager A Course In Miracles Christian denomination Satanism Free will Jewish philosophy Ontological argument Jehovah's Witnesses New Testament Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Ten Commandments S__ren Kierkegaard Epistemology Bertrand Russell Urantia Russian Orthodox Church Strong atheism Salvation Gnosticism Evangelicalism Religious pluralism Deity Spiritism Witchcraft Sin Goodness and value theory Bah__'__ Faith and Science Unidentified flying object Historicity of Jesus Evil New Age Homosexuality and Bah__'__ Faith Abrahamic religion Who is a Jew?
