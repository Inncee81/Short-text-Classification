which differentiates us more morals or religion i think that moral values cause more disruption than religion i've met people from other religions that i'm closer to since we have the same moral values the opposite is true with people that i have different moral values but that's my opinion on the subject what about you both separate us equally there are those select few that regardless of religion hold their morals high enough to understand that not everyone is going to have the same faith they do and this does not make all those other people wrong but those are rare religion separates the vast majority of people because a great portion of religious people believe their way is the right way everyone else is wrong and they must convert everyone they possibly can to save their souls morals separate people because everyone has different morals what one person sees as unforgivable may be no big deal to others i think that the biggest separation for mankind comes to acceptance until we are willing to accept that each of us is different with different morals faiths ethics and backgrounds we will always be a race divided until we can accept that what works for us may not work for another the problem will always exist Morality Ethics Religion Value system Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Moral relativism God Abortion debate Jewish principles of faith Christianity Sin Human Friedrich Schleiermacher S__ren Kierkegaard Moral objectivism Rudolf Hermann Lotze Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Satanism Religion and sexual orientation Goodness and value theory Monotheism Church of Christ Atheism Abrahamic religion Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Evil Coercion Pacifism Feminism Simone Weil Western philosophy Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Creationism Patriotism Theodicy Jewish views of religious pluralism Atomism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Christian philosophy Meaning of life Homosexuality and Christianity Separation of church and state Zoroastrianism Soul Social justice Human nature Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism David Hume Conservatism The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Ethics in religion Christian eschatology Democracy Homophobia Jewish philosophy Existence of God Charles Grandison Finney A Course In Miracles Scientology beliefs and practices Jehovah's Witnesses Philosophy of mathematics Value Supernatural Reality Economics Religious pluralism Roman Catholic Church Faith Jews as a chosen people Philosophy Religious Society of Friends Bertrand Russell Kohlberg's stages of moral development Religion and sexuality Who is a Jew?
