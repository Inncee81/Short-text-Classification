is there a significant difference between muslim texts published in the west and those in the middle middle east i asked about isbn's earlier and one of my responders asserted that there were radically different versions of the same text depending whether the text was published in the east or in the west is this paranoia or do you know this to be true from reading stuff in the original language it could be that the translations have some discrepancies because translations are based on the translator's interpretation that's why i think it is best to read a few different translations and compare them to get the sense of what the work is trying to say that's true for any work that is translated from another language edit it could also be a matter of linguistics there might not be a word to correctly translate another word from another language so the author might have used a similar word but it could skew the message to some degree Arabic language Deconstruction Philosophy of language Chinese language History of the English Bible Writing system Gospel of John Vietnamese language New Testament Book of Mormon Creation according to Genesis Bible King James Version of the Bible Meaning Dutch language Swedish language Vulgate Creationism Biblical inerrancy Egyptian language Atheism Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Maimonides Masoretic Text Aramaic language Translation Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Cornish language Greek language German language Linguistics C programming language Fundamentalism Jacques Derrida Biblical canon Kensington Runestone Martin Luther Tetragrammaton Kanji Japanese grammar Arab Coptic language Germanic languages Encyclopedia Jesus Cantonese (linguistics) New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures Leet Literature Dictionary Old English language Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible Gospel of Thomas Arabic alphabet Bible translations Old Norse language Jehovah's Witnesses P__li Translation memory Tao Te Ching Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Philosophical Investigations Logic Second language acquisition Women in Islam Ten Commandments Ludwig Wittgenstein Tone (linguistics) XML God Jacob Neusner Gospel of Luke Novel Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Hungarian language Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Postmodernism Croatian language Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Vowel African American Vernacular English Abrahamic religion Metaphor Objective-C Cascading Style Sheets A Course In Miracles House of Leaves Proto-Indo-European language Oxford English Dictionary Mandarin (linguistics) Object-oriented programming Written Cantonese Filioque clause Guide for the Perplexed Varieties of Arabic Willard Van Orman Quine HTML Sign (semiotics)
