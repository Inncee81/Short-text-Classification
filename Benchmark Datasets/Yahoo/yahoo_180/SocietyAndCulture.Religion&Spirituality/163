from all impure actions remain in constant state of peace prepare food for our young old that don't fast or can't fast prepare food for others at work go to work or school and function like every day life as goes whatever that may be inshallah i am sure the list can go on please include something if i missed it regarding what you do that is even more than what is required by allah swt why do you do it i am sure others that don't think we are just plain silly for doing it and starving ourselves of water food alone is a jihad but al hamdoullah for those who are steadfast inshallah ameen all that listed what is the reward in heaven with allah swt inshallah we talked already about the earthly rewards ie your soul body mind forgiveness blessings what is the reward in heaven for this action your only hurting yourself surely your showing such evil they are running out the door to buy qurans we cant make them fast enough go check because of you thank you keep coming back and you hurt us never only yourself haha allah is the greatest and surely he is above all things evil virtues of fasting as menti oned in the qur'an and sunnah the reward for fasting is immense as mentioned in the following hadeeth every action of the son of adam is given manifold reward each good deed receiving then times its like up to seven hundred times allah the most high said 'except for fasting for it is for me and i will give recompense for it he leaves off his desires and his food for me ' for the fasting person there are two times of joy a time when he breaks his fast and a time of joy when he meets his lord and the smell coming from the mouth of the fasting person is better with allah than the smell of musk al bukhaaree also sahl ibn sa d said that the prophet s a w said indeed there is a gate of paradise called ar rayyaan on the day of resurrection those who fast will enter through it no one enters it except for them and when they have entered it is closed so that no one enters it so when the last of them enters it it is closed and whoever enters it drinks and whoever drinks never becomes thirsty ibn khuzaimah saheeh fasting is a shield against the fire fasting is a shield with which a servant protects himself from the fire ahmad saheeh on the day of judgement fasting will say o my lord i prevented him from food an desires so accept my intercession for him ahmad al haakim and abu nu'aim hasan fasting is a means for one's sins to be forgiven the prophet s a w said he who fasts ramadhan due to iman and hoping for reward from allah then his past sins are forgiven al bukhaaree muslim the supplication of the fasting person is answered there are in the month of ramadhan in every day and night those to whom allah grants freedom from the fire and there is for every muslim an supplication which he can make and will be granted al bazzaar ahmad saheeh fasting is an expiation for various sins as mentioned in the qur'aan in verses and the fasting person will be among the true followers of the prophets and the martyrs amr ibn murrah al juhaanee r a a said a man came to the prophet s a w and said 'o messenger of allah what if i testify that none has the right to worshipped but allah and that you are the messenger of allah and i observe the five daily prayers and i pay the zakaah and i fast and stand in prayer in ramadhan then amongst whom shall i be ' he said 'amongst the true followers of the prophets and the martyrs ' ibn hibbaan saheeh fasting is a shield against one's base desires as the prophet s a w told the youth o youths whoever amongst you is able to marry then let him do so since it restrains the eyes and protects the private parts and he who is unable then let him fast because it is a shield for him al bukhaaree muslim once we realise the greatness of fasting and what achievement it leads to we must put all our efforts in performing fasting in the best manner possible and since fasting is worship it must be done solely for allah's sake and no intention is accepted other than pleasing allah and seeking his face with all one's sincerity without a correct intention no deed is of any value in the hereafter we muslims must constantly verify our intentions and consider why we perform fasting do we do so merely because it is the practice of our parents and friends or do we do so because it is part of our tradition or perhaps because we simply want to conform to our environment in order to avoid any problems a muslim who realises that only that which is with allah remains and that he swt is the only one who grants and withholds would not be of those to which the prophet s a w alluded in the hadeeth on the day of judgement a caller will cry out 'whoever performed a deed for someone other than allah may seek his reward from that for which he performed the deed' saheeh al jami Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Jizya Merit Chosen people Prophets of Islam Muhammad Al-Ghazali Ali Roman Catholic Church Aisha 613 mitzvot Noah Sunni Islam
