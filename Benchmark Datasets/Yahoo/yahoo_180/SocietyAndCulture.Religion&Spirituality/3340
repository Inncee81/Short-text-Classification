everyone have you thought how poverty causes strife and conflict while we keep on blaming religion for causing hatred among eachother we do not realize what really causes sickos like laden to continue dictating his warmongering nature on the poor afghans the true cause of most strife and conflict in the modern world is greed which takes advantage of poverty to unleash war on the innocent as the war on terrorism goes on spreading like fire we remain unaware of the solution to ending it blaming any specific religion will spill fuel to the fire because no religion teaches hate the best way to end all of this is to extinguish poverty take for an example afghanistan how do you think does the taliban find so many new recruits because so many afghans suffer from poverty a little bread on the table is enough to lure them to join the taliban if the charity had come from peace and used to educate them with reason the taliban and alqaeda will fade into the history books support charity and education the best solution for peace is ridding poverty jack p did you not hear about the war that goes on for blood diamonds in africa or the farmer landlord conflicts in past china to siar iran does not use religion to control the people iran uses islam to put the basis of moral in the people we iranians control our own democratic nation you are correct it isnt about religion it is about money and power and people will use the poor as pawns in their power games sadly the best solution for peace is ridding poverty one of the nicest quotes i have seen xx Taliban U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Osama bin Laden Afghan Northern Alliance Islamic world Afghanistan Islam as a political movement War on Terrorism Background history of the September 11, 2001 attacks Afghan people Central Asia Al-Qaeda Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Islamism Pacifism The Power of Nightmares Pashtun Kabul province Militant Islam Yusuf al-Qaradawi Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mujahideen Culture of Afghanistan History of the United States (1964-1980) September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for September Politics of Pakistan Balochistan Fundamentalism European influence in Afghanistan Civil war Post-September 11 anti-war movement Arab-Israeli conflict Persian Empire History of Afghanistan History of the Middle East Religion Responsibility for the September 11, 2001 attacks Osama tapes History of Europe Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Conservatism Evil Propaganda Iraq disarmament crisis Israeli peace camp Iraqi insurgency New anti-Semitism Religion and sexual orientation The Left and Opposition to War Hezbollah Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda Nation of Islam Foreign policy of the George W.
