christians can god forgive this see below divorce is rampant in our country even among christians i know the bible says that the two grounds for divorce are adultry and abandonment but many get divorced because of physical and verbal abuse and substance abuse and neglect in marraige and unfufillment and for also being uncompatiable i know some very good people going through this right now can god forgive divorce even though it may not be for the reasons listed in the bible what is the best way to encourage and minister to those getting a divorce because it is a painful process well one way to think about it is to look at the underlying meaning of the words adultery also called unfaithfulness and abandonment a person that violates his or her marriage vows is being unfaithful to his or her spouse and in a strong sense has abandoned him or her even if the person hasn't physically left physical and verbal abuse are clearly violations of marriage vows love honor and cherish are not consistent with abuse substance abuse can also be a violation of the vows but only if it leads to abuse or neglect of those vows i've known people who have a happy marriage despite substance use or even abuse by one or both parties personally i have a bigger problem with the incompatible excuse that one seems like a cop out like i'm not perfectly happy so i'll just leave marriage involves hard work and compromise not compromising on the basic vows like putting up with abuse or infidelity but compromising on the little things like where do you squeeze the toothpaste and who does the laundry if god is the center of a marriage he will help the two parties learn to live with each other in harmony as for whether god can forgive divorce the answer is yes of course god can forgive any and all mistakes jesus forgave the people that crucified him does this mean that people should just divorce and ask for forgiveness when things get tough no god wants them to stay together and work on their marriage if i was ministering to someone who was contemplating divorce i would focus on helping them discover if there were areas of the marriage that they hadn't turned over to god and asked for his help if the answer was yes then i would advise them to keep trying on the other hand i would advise a woman or man that was being physically verbally or mentally abused by a person that had no desire to change to get out of the marriage A Course In Miracles Divorce Marriage EastEnders Eastern Orthodox Church Summa Theologiae Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Same-sex marriage Trinity Roman Catholic Church God Meaning of life Adultery Opus Dei Infantilism Scientology beliefs and practices Merit Religion Women in Islam Love Anselm of Canterbury Christian view of marriage Knots Landing Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Homosexuality and Christianity Alcoholics Anonymous Cult Domestic violence Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Laura Schlessinger Theodicy Unification Church Theory of conduct Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Religion and sexuality Book of Isaiah The nature of God in Western theology Same-sex marriage in Canada Sermon on the Mount Apostasy Dualism (philosophy of mind) Soul Sexual orientation Pope John Paul II John Wesley Articles of Religion (Methodist) John Howard Yoder Martin Luther Creationism Buddhism Capital punishment Anger management Rastafari movement John Wycliffe Paradise Lost Supernatural Mortification of the flesh Friedrich Schleiermacher Euphemism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Religious Society of Friends Predestination Ten Commandments Mother Teresa Aristotle Goodness and value theory Sola fide Church of Christ Existence of God Catechism Kodocha Evil Holy Orders Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Angel Human Sin City Fathers' rights Justification (theology) Contrition Yeshu Louis XV of France Days of our Lives
