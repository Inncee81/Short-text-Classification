dear christians biblical prophesy of prophet muhammad pbuh i have been studying the bible lately actually i have been trying to learn everyones faith since i don't want to pass judgments and want to clear up misunderstanding i wanted to ask about certain verses from the bible and if you can explain them better please be assured i'm not trying to say if your right or wrong trying to get your opinion on my findings john if you love me keep my comandments and i shall pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abde with you forever john but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify to me and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the begining also john but now i go on my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me 'wither goest thou ' but because i have said these things unto you sorrow hath filled your heart for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto yout but if i depart i will send him unto you and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and aprove rightousess and judment did i not say i was asking does it sound like im asserting anything does everyone need a chance to say somethng against islam peace love so the father and holy spirit were sent at different times i thought they were supposed to be forms of one diety sorry doesn't make so much sense to me gets bible i totally understand what you mean and i thank you for being one of the first couple muslims to not stereotype christians may god bless you for learning his word my bible is actually a little different then yours it has the same meaning but ti's a bit easier to understand john if you love me you will obey what i command and i will ask the father and he will give you another counselor to be with you forever the spirit of truth basically jesus is telling his people that if they obey him and believe what he says he will ask his father god to give you a counselor someone who helps you and guides you which is the holy spirit john when the counselor comes whom i will send to you from the father the spirit of truth who goes out from the father he will testify about me and you also must testify for you have been with me from the beginning now jesus is saying that when he gives the people the holy spirit spirit of truth that it will testify give evidence to about jesus and it means you also must testify give evidence that jesus died and rose again about him that you have been his children from the beginning of time you see jesus loves you and i can tell you right now god is very happy that you've been looking into his word and that he wants you to come closer to him nice job on the verses Sola fide Book of Mormon Prophet Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Book of Isaiah God Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religion John the Baptist Salvation Virgin Mary in Islam Mary, the mother of Jesus Christianity Christian eschatology Dispensationalism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Original sin Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Gospel of Barnabas Nontrinitarianism Resurrection of Jesus Angel Abrahamic religion Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Baptism Eastern Orthodox Church Soul Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Abraham Catechism Jerusalem Theology A Course In Miracles Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Charles Grandison Finney Justification (theology) Isa Opus Dei Idolatry in Christianity John Howard Yoder Merit Meaning of life Mormonism and Christianity Moses New Testament Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Predestination Religious Society of Friends Islam Prophets of Islam Religious conversion Biblical inerrancy Perseverance of the saints Christian views of Jesus Miracle Saint Nation of Islam Psychopannychism Divine grace Exorcism Reincarnation Religious perspectives on Jesus Binitarianism Jewish Messiah Gospel of Thomas Chosen people Rastafari movement Christian-Jewish reconciliation Bible Church of Christ Fundamentalism New Testament view on Jesus' life Repentance Godhead (Mormonism) John Wesley Jewish views of religious pluralism Religious pluralism Jehovah's Witnesses Judaism Hell Creationism Noah Apostle God the Father
