muslim men a question on gold i know men are not suppose to wear gold i have seen many muslim men wearing gold when i asked a cousin why his watch was gold he replied it is gold plated and not gold is it true that men can wear gold plated things i would assume all gold would be off limits what about fake gold are there any rulings on these issues i do not mind if women respond i was asking men for their view but others are welcome i know what the hadiths say just i see so many men wearing gold or look a like gold in the country where i live i too have seen muslim men wearing gold they sometimes wear a gold wedding ring or chain or something but it's not allowed some people think it's ok for them to wear on the wedding day but there's nothing in islam that permits this i guess people just do whatever they want whether it's allowed or not Women in Islam Sharia Marriage Women as imams Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Yusuf al-Qaradawi Mufti Hadith Aisha Qiyamah Pope Historical persecution by Muslims Islamic view of marriage Sunni Islam Jennifer Lopez Isa Nikah Mut'ah Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Religion and sexuality Sex segregation Predestination Hizb ut-Tahrir Islam Ramadan Liberal movements within Islam Mary, the mother of Jesus Banu Qurayza Polygamy Succession to Muhammad Caliph Fundamentalism Hijab Muhammad Apostasy in Islam Nation of Islam Professional wrestling match types Shi'a Islam Book of Mormon Jizya Qur'an Nick Berg conspiracy theories Theory of conduct Wahhabism Muslim ibn Aqeel Council on American-Islamic Relations We Belong Together Ordination of women Eastern Orthodox Church Islamic fundamentalism Softball Islam in France Islamic world Same-sex marriage Virgin Mary in Islam Religious conversion Same-sex marriage in Canada Religious pluralism Gospel of Barnabas Salah Rajput Islam and clothing Social rule Jean Charles de Menezes Anti-Defamation League Kilt Order of the Bath Veil Prophet Abd al-Rahman ibn Sakhr Kenneth Bigley Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools SMTV Live Separation of church and state Royal Victorian Order Prophets of Islam Status of religious freedom in Afghanistan Mary I of Scotland Arab-Israeli conflict Meaning of life Fiddler on the Roof Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jihad Boxing Homosexuality and Islam U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Adam and Eve Ruhollah Khomeini Gold standard Nick Berg Status of religious freedom in Sudan Jerusalem Islamic philosophy Abu Hanifa an-Nu'man Birth control Golden Plates Husayn ibn Ali Ali
