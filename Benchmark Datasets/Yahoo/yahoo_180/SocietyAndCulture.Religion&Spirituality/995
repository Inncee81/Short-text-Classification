mormons i am concerned about my son please don't tell me i'm intolerant do you have any suggestions my year old son returned from a mission a little over a year ago he attends the singles ward he has always been akward hasn't dated much was always picked on he has been active in the lds church well he has a girl friend that is baptist that has attended church a few times but you can tell she is not interested in the church for months he told us that they were just friends i guess he thought we were stupid since we knew this wasn't true they are talking about marriage he currently is suppose to pay us rent of per month plus he still owes us over for bailing him out of a financial mess we are strong and active members of the lds church the way things are going they will not get married in the temple and this breaks our hearts who knows if he will remain active in the church we already have one son that is totally inactive i assume we just learn to love this girl who doesn't seem to like us this may not seem like a big deal but it hurts i sure didn't expect a mormon bashing session thank you for all the kind cough cough remarks about how he will hopefully get away from the lds church sorry but i highly resent the implications that i am only thinking about myself instead of my son's happiness we should be thrilled he found someone to love or that we are looking down our nose at her this far from the truth we have consistantly opened up our home so that we can get to know her she came over for christmas dinner and barely spoke to us she has come over twice in the past year he is currently taking two classes a semester at a community college and working full time at wal mart for a little over min wage he's not ready to support a wife i had hoped i would get a comforting suggestion not ridicual about my beliefs i am a concerned mother i am concerned about my son's physical and spiritual welfare and the fact that he's not ready to even think about marriage i am a member of the church always have been it's my opinion that you let him lead his own life who knows what will come if they get married perhaps she will become a member or maybe he'll go her way what matters most is that you continue to love your son and let him know that you always will it's not your place to tell him who to love or where to get married he has to make his own decisions now if you've raised him according to your conscience then you should know that's all you can do now's the time to let him go and you'll never make her like you hopefully a bond will grow over time Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Criticism of Mormonism Book of Mormon Friends Mormonism and Christianity EastEnders Joseph Smith, Jr. Brigham Young University Little Britain Humphrey Bogart Marriage Alcoholics Anonymous Plural marriage History of the Latter Day Saint movement Polygamy Pitaten Laura Schlessinger Theory of conduct Community of Christ Shaggy dog story Fundamentalism Temple (Mormonism) The Inside The Amber Spyglass Mormon missionary Restorationism Avenue Q Adam-God theory Knots Landing Mormonism and Judaism United States religious history Dead Like Me Rent (musical) Marilyn Monroe Heber C.
