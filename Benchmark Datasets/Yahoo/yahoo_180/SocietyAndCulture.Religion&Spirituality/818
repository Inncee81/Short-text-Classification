why can't scientists and evolutionists get it right the first time why do they keep changing their theories and you think christians are wrong so religion and christianity has evolved' and changed over the centuries too the church used to believe the world was flat and also committed crimes thinking they were doing god's will this is no longer the case man's view of god has changed growned or evolved yet atheists use the mistakes of the past to discredit religion both religion and science need to grow as scientific technologies become more sophisticated and as more scientists study a subject theories are rethought and refined darwin was the first to publish a theory of evolution but he did not know what mechanism allowed a species to change over time he suspected that such a mechanism existed because he could see the result of it in the fossil record but he did know know about dna readers of darwin's book were intrigued with the idea of a mechanism and began looking seriously for the mechanism gregor mendel's work with garden peas was rediscovered selective breeding leading to inherited characteristics and further research confirms that dna genes is indeed the mechanism by which individuals in a species are able to pass on their inheirted characterists i think i would be very hesitant to say christians are wrong christianity is a faith not a scientific theory comparing faiths and theories is like comparing apples and oranges having said that i do not think that being christian excludes one from accepting that natural selection acts on species over long periods of time who's to say that god didn't create the whole system and set up evolution so that species could adapt to changing environments over time but this is not something that scientists can observe or find evidence for in the fossil record so they don't include it in their theory The Origin of Species Species Macroevolution History of evolutionary thought History of creationism Sociocultural evolution Evolutionary creationism Creation-evolution controversy Scientific method Intelligent design Human Gregor Mendel Creation science Francis Crick Natural selection Human evolution Charles Darwin Evolutionism Biology Supernatural Evidence of evolution Sociobiology Origin belief Teach the Controversy Flood geology The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex History of science Meme William A.
