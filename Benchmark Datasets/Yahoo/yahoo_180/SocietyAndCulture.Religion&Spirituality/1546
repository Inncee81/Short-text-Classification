why is satanism so misunderstood modern satanism is so misunderstood people think that have crazy rituals where they slaughter animals but no such things heppen they dont worship the christian devil and dont commit petty crimes it is simply another religion alot of people will be suprised to hear that alot of satanic beliefs make sence for example do not preach your beliefes to others i think a few christians could take a leaf out of their book why do other religions not count satanism as a proper religion why do people assume evil when they hear the word satan nicole is the exact type of person i am talking about that is not a satanist belief mumof i see where your coming from im saying that they should learn from their own sayings e g take the log out of your own eye before questioning oters or something like that they dont do any research atal and just asume satanists are evil i am not preaching my religion i am defending it i never once tried to get people to believe in satanism i didnt do something like how can athiests not believe in god ok well the basic reason were called satanists is because we are opposed to christianity most of our teachings are pretty much the opposite to theirs modern satanism is misunderstood partially because of something called the satanic panic in the 's partially because the lack of time and research that people put into finding out about satanism and partially because thats how satanists like it you're right things like you describe don't happen and you're right its a kind of religion but really when you look at it its an atheist practice with rules and occult tendencies not to say that its a bad practice to adopt but it is not always considered a religion because belief in something anything is not always nessicary why do people assume evil when they hear the word satan do you really have to ask this satan is the popular and most familiar figure of evil lavey chose satan as the figure of the religion to scare off individuals who are too weak to really take on the true ideas of satanism and inspire power within the people who adopt the practice Satanism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Evil Religion Atheism LaVeyan Satanism Antichrist Fundamentalism Devil Evangelicalism Witch-hunt Theology Religious conversion Satanic ritual abuse Satan Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Witchcraft Jewish principles of faith Freemasonry Exorcism Gnosticism Magic (paranormal) God Christian eschatology Church of Christ Christian anarchism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Coercion Hell Biblical canon Christianity Sin Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Theodicy Predestination Esotericism Animism Angel Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Neopaganism A Course In Miracles Goddess Biblical inerrancy Theory of conduct Wicca End times Gospel of Thomas Mythology Demon Christianity and anti-Semitism Creationism Prophet Taoism Urantia Scientology beliefs and practices Great Apostasy Confucianism Idolatry Horned God Incarnations of Immortality Abrahamic religion Jesus Criticism of Islam Paradise Lost Apostasy Zoroastrianism Mary, the mother of Jesus Deity Opposition to cults and new religious movements Shamanism Sabbath John Wycliffe Chick Publications Evolutionary creationism Simone Weil Christian views on witchcraft Monotheism Saint False memory Supernatural Resurrection of Jesus Sharia Margaret Murray Baptism Intelligent design Divine grace Dispensationalism Demonology Criticism of Mormonism Church of Satan
