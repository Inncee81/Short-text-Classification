why do some christians say that they have been persecuted for their beliefs and atheists have not i don't believe in god and i live in arizona which means i've gotten persecution all my life do some christians not realize the ammount of persecution they have thrust upon atheists as well as other religions the mayans the aztecs pagans i know christians have been persecuted but saying that atheists agnostics and even other religions have not is just insane and no i am not calling atheism a religion or not here thanks any thoughts okay here's a link look at the first answer http answers yahoo com question index ylt ag hdta jccojzmeshcvbsy ix qid aabhmrb show profile info aa jakex my hair is purple for the fun of it i've had every color and next is red steve arizona is a big christian and lds area i live in a tiny town and it's really strange here if you don't dress a certain way if you wear black if you have piercings or just don't look christian you get persecuted yelled at spit at glared at thw whole deal i'm a good person but because i don't attend their church i get verbally attacked glad i'm moving soon i don't start arguements with random people i don't care what religion another is but i just find it odd that people think that whatever religion they are is the only religion that gets persecuted every group at one time or another was the minority or just simply hated i never said atheists got killed like the christians were i just find it odd that some people say christians were the only ones persecuted but christians have killed thousands of people who didn't share the same beliefs they went so far as to destroy all mayan religion and culture and burn all of the mayans' texts and look at all the other massacres on non christians back then if you weren't christian even if you were atheist you would be dead fast so death among christians for their beliefs is a moot point and ronbo comparing christians that died for their beliefs in past years is like me trying to get compensation for my cherokee ancestors kicked out of their land the arguement just doesn't fly you're quite right it doesn't matter what faith you are whether you have one or not it doesn't even matter what race you are everyone is different and we're all being persecuted for one reason or another because of our differences you just have to ask yourself can't we all just get along stop the hate and the persecution for everyone ends i'm doing my part what will you do Atheism Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Agnosticism Persecution of Christians The nature of God in Western theology God Evolutionary creationism Strong atheism Fundamentalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Existence of God Afterlife Religious pluralism Apologetics Russian Orthodox Church Freemasonry History of creationism Resurrection of Jesus Separation of church and state Piccolo Junior Saga Pascal's Wager Roman Catholic Church Anti-Mormonism Messianic Judaism Immortality Criticism of Mormonism Creation-evolution controversy Alcoholics Anonymous Theology Religion and sexual orientation Persecution of atheists David Hume Judaism Great Apostasy Religious Society of Friends Eastern Orthodox Church Book of Revelation Freethought Mexico Christian eschatology Discworld gods Philosophy of religion Salvation Monotheism Religious conversion Temple (Mormonism) Historicity of Jesus Ten Commandments Columbine High School massacre Sin Cult Prayer Jewish principles of faith Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Sacrifice Book of Daniel Christianity and anti-Semitism Deism Evil Unitarian Universalism Islam Apatheism Rei Ayanami Psychology of religion A Course In Miracles Criticism of Islam Bosniaks Mormonism and Christianity Mormon Jehovah's Witnesses Ten Lost Tribes Meaning of life Saint Christian anarchism Eschatology Biblical canon Predestination Theodicy Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Death Mormonism Origin belief Nontrinitarianism Discrimination Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine)
