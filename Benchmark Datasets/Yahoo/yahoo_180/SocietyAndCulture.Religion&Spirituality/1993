time is the gift of god given to us which we give freely each moment to others from our love is what really brings us the timeless life would you use and exchange god's gift of time to you for eternal life joined to god's life by using it for others with patience and love would you or wouldn't you the impatience are always in a hurry but god's patience is our salvation one of his gifts to us is time time to grow and understand all men included even the atheists and those who hate god and especially the evolutionists we move in time as the fish moves in its element we are bathed in time and moving through it time is a substance we use in order to earn the timelessness of spirit to be born again in other words time is life for without time there is no life who gives life receives life but when we die time ends for us timelessness begin houstonprogressive here's your reason why stillness is required to measure motion if there were no stillness there could be no measurement of movement without movement we could not perceive stillness right time is relative to the stillness of god for the opposite of time is not time time is a movement now is the stillness of god or to put in in another way now is the timelessness of god unselfishly giving up our time we earn timelessness of self in god time then is a gift of life to us to use and to give to find the timelessness of god which we know as everlasting life i find true love transcends time and cannot be measured that way for example with healing you can have all the time in the world but if you don't let go and get to the truth you can stay stuck but forgiveness love and truth can free someone and heal instantly in some cases a baby who lives days is still loved and missed by the parents and is not diminished because they did not spend more time together but is treasured and loved forever so why not value love for lovesake and not judge by time at all if you mean to make the commitment or choice to put spiritual values before material wealth yes i would agree with you without question however this commitment is not always measured by time which is relative or by anything we can judge or compare physically i think everyone has a different way of showing love and we should not place value solely based on time or other human perceptions that fall short Divine grace A Course In Miracles Eastern Orthodox Church God Salvation Justification (theology) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Evolutionary creationism Opus Dei Sola fide Simone Weil Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Baptism Merit Theodicy Roman Catholic Church Sri Aurobindo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eternity The nature of God in Western theology Urantia Ten Commandments Moral objectivism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Original sin Friedrich Schleiermacher Holy Spirit Jon Secada Human Meaning of life Free will Trinity Sin Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Origin belief Perseverance of the saints Bhagavad Gita Michel Henry Church of Christ, Scientist Atheism Infant baptism Immortality Church of Christ Paradox Incarnations of Immortality The Amber Spyglass Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Gospel of Thomas Repentance Christian and Missionary Alliance Heaven Sikh religious philosophy Phaedo Jiddu Krishnamurti Existence of God Determinism Book of Isaiah Human nature Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Amidah Socrates Predestination Articles of Religion (Methodist) Sant Thakar Singh David Hume Philipp Melanchthon Theory of conduct Maimonides Jewish principles of faith Eucharist Fundamentalism Thomas Carlyle Duties of the Heart Resurrection of Jesus Philo Four Quartets Mormonism and Christianity Reinhold Niebuhr Hell Bah__'__ Faith and Science Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology John Wycliffe One Tree Hill (TV series) Athanasian Creed Religious pluralism Guru Evil
