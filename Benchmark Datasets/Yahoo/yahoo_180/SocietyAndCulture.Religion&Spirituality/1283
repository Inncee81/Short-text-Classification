muslims arabic reading why is arabic written differently from that of the qur'an for example in the qur'an you have all the signs such as the zer zobor pesh wa sakin etc but let's take an arabic newspaper as an example whenever i see anything written in arabic other than the qur'an i don't see any of those zer zobor etc so how do i know if something says marhaba murhaba marhiba or what so how do you actually read arabic in that format may you shed some light upon me asslam alikum wa ramatu allah the holy quran is written in othmani script khalef otman r it is kept in this format so it won t be change and after so many non arabs converted to islam it was difficult for them to read quran without the tashkeel which is fatha dammah kassrah sukun etc this was added during the period of saiduna ali bin abi talib r so the main reason for that is to sure that every body will read the holy quran in a correct way because a small change from dammah to fatha will change the whole meaning if you want to memorize quran i advise you to use b thy quran toolbar it is free http www b thy com b thy toolbar english html best luck Qur'an Islam Ali Sunni Islam Arabic language Arabic alphabet Alawite Dhul-Qarnayn Muhammad Islam and anti-Semitism Apostasy in Islam Sufism Arab Salah Mary, the mother of Jesus Qur'an alone Succession to Muhammad Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Kufa Allah Abraham Kaaba Sharia Arabic literature Nation of Islam Jihad Women in Islam Jizya Battle of Badr Quraish God Tetragrammaton Twelvers Abrahamic religion Prophets of Islam Caliph Sunnah Islamic calligraphy Shahadah Nahj al Balagha Husayn ibn Ali Imam Historical persecution by Muslims Tafsir Divisions of Islam Islamic philosophy History of the Arabic alphabet Isra and Mi'raj Muslim ibn Aqeel Abdul Qadir Jilani Khadijah bint Khuwaylid Cyrus the Great in the Quran (theory) Aisha Liberal movements within Islam Apostasy Hafiz Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Saint Uthman Islamic calendar Islam and clothing Islam in France Kafir Al-Ghazali Mu'tazili Dhimmi Osama bin Laden Tawh__d Polygamy Homosexuality and Islam Islamic eschatology Intercession of saints Khabbab ibn al-Aratt Genie Alexander in the Qur'an (theory) Wahhabism 99 Names of God United Submitters International Isa Fundamentalism Salaf Hizb ut-Tahrir Holy Spirit Aqidah
