a possible reason to mormons restricting blacks of priesthood till the 's i got thinking about this question and wondered why my religion would deny blacks of the priesthood until the 's when a possible answer came into my mind back in that day and age there was racism segregation and hatred towards black the white's gave them their own theatres bathrooms back of the bus and water fountains now think of it this way how would it look if a church came out allowing a race that waws hated at the time to hold a higher priesthood let me give you an example please i'm not comparing my church to the taliban at all this is an example the taliban hate americans obviously so how would it look if their ally came out and wanted american involvement in a friendly way they would come attackign woldn't they look what happened to martin luther king jr the mormon church just wants peace and not to spark a war that's why we left ill for utah i'm not trying to start an argument just offering a ossible suggestion any thoughts to gypsy geesjack it is also a biblical term that satan will do anything in the last days to fight off the truth and see how many people he can mislead i believe that the mormon church is fought off regularly daily and a lot of people go to an extent to try and find whwy we are wrong once before an interview a man was asked to go prove that gordon b hinckley was not a prophet of god so the man went and tried to prove him wrong and then he came back minutes later and said i'm sorry but i can't do it i was told by a high councilman once years ago this was the 'real' reason that if blacks had been openly welcomed into the church they would've destroyed the church's welfare system anyway to suggest there was a temporal and humanist not spiritual or christlike reason for the ban of blacks and the priesthood you could be right there's also historical political reasons that go back to missouri being admitted to the union as a free or slave state with the mormon voting block committed to free anyway my somewhat biased opinion is while that episode is in the past the church still needs to 'come clean' and officially retract and apologized for the extreme racist policies and statements made and strike anything from official or unofficial canon that suggests otherwise however that particular dogma is one of the lesser problems the church faces mdna archeology engineering linguistics anthropology and paleo horticulture are not producing any evidence of the bom or confirm smith's 'interpretation' of the egyptian papyri saying it is so because the spirit says so is an extremely unreliable and unsustainable method of discerning 'truth' keep up your research and try to keep your mind open to all sorts of possibilities think of all the things you can tell your grandchildren Anti-Mormonism Book of Mormon Religion Priesthood (Mormonism) Criticism of Mormonism History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Polygamy Mormonism and Christianity Baptism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Succession crisis (Mormonism) Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Joseph Smith, Jr. Fundamentalism Adam-God theory Mormonism and Judaism Opus Dei John Wycliffe Prophet Endowment (Mormonism) Atheism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Martin Luther God Community of Christ Apocrypha Blood atonement Philipp Melanchthon Biblical inerrancy Lamanite Franz Boas Second Vatican Council Eastern Orthodox Church Freemasonry Supernatural Temple (Mormonism) Jesus Mormonism Christianity Holocaust denial Sabbath Christianity and anti-Semitism American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Plame affair Yusuf al-Qaradawi Satanism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ten Commandments Ex-gay Meaning of life Separation of church and state Scientific method The nature of God in Western theology Human Pharisees Theology Arab-Israeli conflict Heresy Resurrection of Jesus Noah Trinity Equal Protection Clause Cult Social rule Ordination of women Christian Identity First Vision Flood geology Creationism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus David Hume British National Party Curse of Ham Simone Weil Homophobia Original sin Apologetics Nation of Islam Restoration (Mormonism) Presuppositional apologetics Justification (theology) Angel President of the Church (Mormonism) Emma Hale Smith Mind control Nineteen Eighty-Four
