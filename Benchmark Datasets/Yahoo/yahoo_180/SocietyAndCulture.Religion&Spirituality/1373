william branham believes that the catholic church is the church that will enforce the mark of the beast has anyone heard this before about the inscription written above the head of the pope s crown it has vicarius felii dei written on it and i read somewhere that it adds up to like this v i c a r i u s f i l i i d e i and the bible says that that number is the mark of the beast has anyone heard about this before and do u believe it any ideas at all thanks i dont know whether its on the crown but its on his throne or sumthing or that's wat i was told anywayz look it up on the internet there's sooo many sites on it wat's the significance hi victory vicarius filii dei has been around for well over years and is supposed to be an inscription on the pope's triple crown however there is no proof that it is and questions to the catholic church on the issue have always received a negative reply and the vfd is not a title commonly used by the pope the books of daniel revelation indicate that there will be a ruling religious power just before jesus returns read daniel revelation in revelation this power is also referred to as babylon if you look up as many references to babylon in the old testament you will find that its meaning is confusion taken from the tower of babel when god confused the tongues of the builders it was babylon that took god's people captive and john the author of revelation uses it symbolically to represent a religious organization that opposes god's true followers for centuries many biblical scholars have equated the catholic church with babylon but modern scholarship suggests something much larger christianity is in a very confused state with this denomination believing this and that denomination believing something else in other words it is in a confused state but in revelation we find that god has a remnant of true believers right at the end of time who have the spirit of prophecy and the testimony of jesus this will be a relatively small group compared to babylon but these are assured eternal life and the first resurrection see revelation whilst those in the babylon confederation will be destroyed and receive god's wrath or death eternal the mystery number can be applied to many other names so it is hardly convincing just to label vfd the number in biblical numerology is representitive of man falling short of god's perfect numbers and multiples of such as and when god gave moses commandments on mount sinai these were not supposed to be treated as the suggestions the first are to do with man's relationship to god the last are dealing with our relationship to each other the principles contained in the commandments form the basis of our moral laws unfortunately various churches have tampered with the first commandments over the centuries and have made tradition paramount in their theology i hope that this has gone some way to answering your question regards h'chat Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Trinity Biblical inerrancy Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Roman Catholic Church Christian eschatology Papal Tiara Pope Book of Daniel Fundamentalism Evangelicalism Vicarius Filii Dei Religion Paul of Tarsus Nontrinitarianism Baptism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses God Sin Saint Peter Apocrypha Abrahamic religion Moses Maimonides Number of the Beast (numerology) Sola fide Great Apostasy A Course In Miracles King James Version of the Bible Tetragrammaton Judaism Holy Spirit Linguistics and the Book of Mormon The Two Babylons Eastern Orthodox Church Old Testament Religious Society of Friends Baptist Church of Christ Mormonism and Christianity Gospel of Mark Jewish principles of faith Whore of Babylon Mary, the mother of Jesus Church of Christ, Scientist Christianity and anti-Semitism Soul Jesus Book of Isaiah Infant baptism Gospel of Thomas Devil Justification (theology) Charismatic Rapture Second Vatican Council Prophet Angel Christian-Jewish reconciliation Pharisees Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Documentary hypothesis Homosexuality and Christianity Icon Myths and legends surrounding the Papacy William M.
