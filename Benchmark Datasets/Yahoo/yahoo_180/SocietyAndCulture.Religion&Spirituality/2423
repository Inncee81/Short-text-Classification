to ex religious people was there a specific thing that made you question your religion what was it hopefully you were religious as an adult i'm trying to write a letter to a religious person i met once who wrote me a letter about her belief in jesus i don't expect to turn her into an atheist but i would like to make her think more critically and any seed of doubt that i can plant into her brain should be enough to set her on the path to rationally evaluate her beliefs any personal experiences will be helpful i just stopped taking every authority figure's word for everything and started to look into things for myself i found that when i read the bible by myself and interpreted it in my own way it was about the most unbelievable thing i've ever read and i read a lot of out there stuff i think some people are just questioners and these people can't just accept all this stuff religion throws at you soly on faith as i have continued my education i have begun to study religious history and it amazes me how easy it is to discover where all these beliefs really come from basically christianity is an amalgam of many different mystery religions that were big before jc supposedly made the scene the truth is it easy to discover what a con religion really is but most people don't want to know the truth they are happy living in a fantasy i actually envy them but i am a truth seeker as much as they are faith havers so we all can only be what we feel we can be Religion Fundamentalism Religious Society of Friends Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Meaning of life A Course In Miracles Theology God Ten Commandments Prayer Supernatural Alcoholics Anonymous Religious conversion Resurrection of Jesus Charles Darwin's views on religion Historicity of Jesus Existence of God Liberal Christianity Creationism New Testament Soul Urantia Paul of Tarsus Christianity Jehovah's Witnesses Sabbath Dispensationalism New Age Gospel of Thomas David Hume Biblical canon Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Theodicy Evolutionary creationism Book of Mormon Fundamentalist Christianity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Biblical inerrancy Trinity Religious pluralism Phillip E.
