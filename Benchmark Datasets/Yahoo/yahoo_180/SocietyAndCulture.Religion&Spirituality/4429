why if there really is a god or allah why if there really is a god do believers think he is such a jerk what i mean is why do we imagine he would ever have anything close to the weak over emotional characteristics of man why do we think if he could make a universe that he would be such a dunce as to get jealous wrathful vengeful or ticked off for stupid reasons why do we imagine he would be silly enough to play head games just to test us why do we think he was in everybody's face all the time over years ago but now he's nowhere to be seen ever why do humans give him any human emotions at all why would we not think he was way above all the petty childish reactionary behaviour of humans why do we think he'd be so insecure as to need our unending worship praise day in day out why do we not respect him enough to think him far superior to us in every way imaginable the god of abraham is painted in a very poor light according to humans big k ur the kind of people who makes god seem like an idiot so can i assume it's partly your fault but josh where is he now he was allegedly talking to everybody years ago why doesn't he come around more often so to speak i mean really why not i know what you mean i don't get it either seems to be a very sad excuse for a supposedly omniscient and omnipotent entity and contradictory too when they believe it's also an all loving god as well as having all those characteristics you mentioned personally i think god is just a name for something that i do not pretend to know in any way i merely accept the possibility of its existence perhaps as some sort of energy that the universe us included is made of makes a bit more sense to me but it's also irrelevant to how i live my life what i don't believe in is the humanly flawed god of religious institutions Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Predestination The nature of God in Western theology Theodicy Prayer Soul Idolatry Free will Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Angel Origin belief Religion Demon Ontological argument Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Prophet Christian eschatology Immortality Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Patriotism Intelligent design The Catcher in the Rye Creationism Sabbath Meaning of life Mary, the mother of Jesus Urantia Trinity Satan Simone Weil Christianity God and gender Human Sin Supernatural Monotheism Storytelling Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Summa Theologiae Allah Abraham Deity Abrahamic religion God Emperor of Dune Ten Commandments Apostasy in Islam Hell Noah Nation of Islam Friedrich Schleiermacher Problem of evil Atheism Satanism S__ren Kierkegaard Vulcan (Star Trek) Cosmological argument Eastern Orthodox Church Goldstein's book Agnosticism Theory of conduct LaVeyan Satanism Salvation American Idiot Rich Mullins Intercession of saints Strong atheism Holocaust theology Time travel Social rule Religion and mythology Jiddu Krishnamurti Ghost Discworld gods Philosophy of religion Open Theism Saint Jewish principles of faith The Amber Spyglass Angels in Islam Scientific method Religious pluralism The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Predestination (Calvinism) Gnosticism Problem of Hell Apostasy Young Earth creationism Chosen people
