hinduinsm and christianity having a common origion looking at the folklore of these religions i tend to think that both these religions have a common origion and then they took on different paths probably cause the preachers of these two religions went to different parts of the world lemme quote some examples story about a man who is instructed by gods to collect one living being of each species in the world and take them onto a ship just before a great storm is about to come the same story can be seen in the matasya avtar of vishnu the story of moses being abandoned in the river in a basket is the all to familiar story of karna from mahabharata the story of man killing his own son in order feed the gods is present in both the religions such similarities between the two religions i feel are more than mere coincidence what do you guys think hi esther your understanding about hinduism is completly wrong lord vishnu himself states in geeta that no matter what form does man pray as long as he prays with a true heart he prays only to vishnu himself as vishnu is everywhere so in that sense hinduism is not a religion with many gods but in essense its a religion with a single god but it gives u the liberty to pray to him in whatever form you may seem fit yes today's hinduism or called as sanatana dharma and christianity has same origin was jesus christ is know as the son of god also there are many references of jesus christ studying vedas at jagannath puri in his childhood or coming back to jagannath puri after resurrection even jagannath juggernaut has been inscribed on the holy cross of jesus christ moreover there are many instances as you have stated which clearly shows it has many things in common moreover the description of god given in many christian scriptures confirm with the description of god in many vedic literatures christianity is one sense a little diluted version of vedic system in a different form following is a very good conversation between srila prabhupada and a christian priest father emmanueal that took back around years book excerpt from the best seller the science of self realization understanding krsna and christ krsna christos christ in near iskcon's center in frankfurt am main west germany srila prabhupada and several of his disciples took a morning walk with father emmanuel jungclaussen a benedictine monk from niederalteich monastery noticing that srila prabhupada was carrying meditation beads similar to the rosary father emmanuel explained that he also chanted a constant prayer lord jesus christ be merciful unto us the following conversation ensued srila prabhupada what is the meaning of the word christ father emmanuel christ comes from the greek word christos meaning the anointed one srila prabhupada christos is the greek version of the word krsna father emmanuel this is very interesting srila prabhupada when an indian person calls on krsna he often says krsta krsta is a sanskrit word meaning attraction so when we address god as christ krsta or krsna we indicate the same allattractive supreme personality of godhead when jesus said our father who an in heaven sanctified be thy name that name of god was krsta or krsna do you agree father emmanuel i think jesus as the son of god has revealed to us the actual name of god christ we can call god father but if we want to address him by his actual name we have to say christ srila prabhupada yes christ is another way of saying krsta and krsta is another way of pronouncing krsna the name of god jesus said that one should glorify the name of god but yesterday i heard one theologian say that god has no name that we can call him only father a son may call his father father but the father also has a specific name similarly god is the general name of the supreme personality of godhead whose specific name is krsna therefore whether you call god christ krsta or krsna ultimately you are addressing the same supreme personality of godhead father emmanuel yes if we speak of god's actual name then we must say christos in our religion we have the trinity the father son and the holy spirit we believe we can know the name of god only by revelation from the son of god jesus christ revealed the name of the father and therefore we take the name christ as the revealed name of god srila prabhupada actually it doesn't matter krsna or christ the name is the same the main point is to follow the injunctions of the vedic scriptures that recommend chanting the name of god in this age the easiest way is to chant the maha mantra hare krsna hare krsna krsna krsna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare rama and krsna are names of god and hare is the energy of god so when we chant the maha mantra we address god together with his energy this energy is of two kinds the spiritual and the material at present we are in the clutches of the material energy therefore we pray to krsna that he may kindly deliver us from the service of the material energy and accept us into the service of the spiritual energy that is our whole philosophy hare krsna means o energy of god o god krsna please engage me in your service it is our nature to render service somehow or other we have come to the service of material things but when this service is transformed into the service of the spiritual energy then our life is perfect to practice bhakti yoga loving service to god means to become free from designations like hindu muslim christian this or that and simply to serve god we have created christian hindu and muhammadan religions but when we come to a religion without designations in which we don't think we are hindus or christians or muhammadans then we can speak of pure religion or bhakti father emmanuel mukti srila prabhupada no bhakti when we speak of bhakti mukti liberation from material miseries is included without bhakti there is no mukti but if we act on the platform of bhakti then mukti is included we learn this from the bhagavad gita mam ca yo 'vyabhicarena bhakti yogena sevate sa gunan samatityaitan brahma bhuyaya kalpate one who engages in full devotional service who does not fall down under any circumstance at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of brahman father emmanuel is brahman krsna srila prabhupada krsna is parabrahman brahman is realized in three aspects as impersonal brahman as localized paramatma and as personal brahman krsna is personal and he is the supreme brahman for god is ultimately a person in the srimad bhagavatam this is confirmed vadanti tat tattva vidas tattvam yajjnanam advayam brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti sabdyate learned transcendentalists who know the absolute truth call this nondual substance brahman paramatma or bhagavan the feature of the supreme personality is the ultimate realization of god he has all six opulences in full he is the strongest the richest the most beautiful the most famous the wisest and the most renounced father emmanuel yes i agree srila prabhupada because god is absolute his name his form and his qualities are also absolute and they are nondifferent from him therefore to chant god's holy name means to associate directly with him when one associates with god one acquires godly qualities and when one is completely purified one becomes an associate of the supreme lord father emmanuel but our understanding of the name of god is limited srila prabhupada yes we are limited but god is unlimited and because he is unlimited or absolute he has unlimited names each of which is god we can understand his names as much as our spiritual understanding is developed father emmanuel may i ask a question we christians also preach love of god and we try to realize love of god and render service to him with all our heart and all our soul now what is the difference between your movement and ours why do you send your disciples to the western countries to preach love of god when the gospel of jesus christ is propounding the same message srila prabhupada the problem is that the christians do not follow the commandments of god do you agree father emmanuel yes to a large extent you're right srila prabhupada then what is the meaning of the christians' love for god if you do not follow the orders of god then where is your love therefore we have come to teach what it means to love god if you love him you cannot be disobedient to his orders and if you're disobedient your love is not true all over the world people love not god but their dogs the krsna consciousness movement is therefore necessary to teach people how to revive their forgotten love for god not only the christians but also the hindus the muhammadans and all others are guilty they have rubber stamped themselves christian hindu or muhammadan but they do not obey god that is the problem visitor can you say in what way the christians are disobedient sri a prabhupada yes the first point is that they violate the commandment thou shalt not kill by maintaining slaughterhouses do you agree that this commandment is being violated father emmanuel personally i agree srila prabhupada good so if the christians want to love god they must stop killing animals father emmanuel but isn't the most important point srila prabhupada if you miss one point there is a mistake in your calculation regardless of what you add or subtract after that the mistake is already in the calculation and everything that follows will also be faulty we cannot simply accept that part of the scripture we like and reject what we don't like and still expect to get the result for example a hen lays eggs with its back part and eats with its beak a farmer may consider the front part of the hen is very expensive because i have to feed it better to cut it off but if the head is missing there will be no eggs anymore because the body is dead similarly if we reject the difficult part of the scriptures and obey the part we like such an interpretation will not help us we have to accept all the injunctions of the scripture as they are given not only those that suit us if you do not follow the first order thou shalt not kill then where is the question of love of god visitor christians take this commandment to be applicable to human beings not to animals srila prabhupada that would mean that christ was not intelligent enough to use the right word murder there is killing and there is murder murder refers to human beings do you think jesus was not intelligent enough to use the right word murder instead of the word killing killing means any kind of killing and especially animal killing if jesus had meant simply the killing of humans he would have used the word murder father emmanuel but in the old testament the commandment thou shalt not kill does refer to murder and when jesus said thou shalt not kill he extended this commandment to mean that a human being should not only refrain from killing another human being but should also treat him with love he never spoke about man's relationship with other living entities but only about his relationship with other human beings when he said thou shalt not kill he also meant in the mental and emotional sense that you should not insult anyone or hurt him treat him badly and so on srila prabhupada we are not concerned with this or that testament but only with the words used in the commandments if you want to interpret these words that is something else we understand the direct meaning thou shalt not kill means the christians should not kill you may put forth interpretations in order to continue the present way of action but we understand very clearly that there is no need for interpretation interpretation is necessary if things are not clear but here the meaning is clear thou shalt not kill is a clear instruction why should we interpret it father emmanuel isn't the eating of plants also killing srila prabhupada the vaisnava philosophy teaches that we should not even kill plants unnecessarily in the bhagavad gita krsna says patram puspam phalam toyam yo me bhaktya prayacchati tad aham bhakty upahrtam asnami prayatatmanah if someone offers me with love and devotion a leaf a flower a fruit or a little water i will accept it we offer krsna only the kind of food he demands and then we eat the remnants if offering vegetarian food to krsna were sinful then it would be krsna's sin not ours but god is apapa viddha sinful reactions are not applicable to him he is like the sun which is so powerful that it can purify even urine something impossible for us to do krsna is also like a king who may order a murderer to be hanged but who himself is beyond punishment because he is very powerful eating food first offered to the lord is also something like a soldier's killing during wartime in a war when the commander orders a man to attack the obedient soldier who kills the enemy will get a medal but if the same soldier kills someone on his own he will be punished similarly when we eat only prasada the remnants of food offered to krsna we do not commit any sin this is confirmed in the bhagavad gita yajna sistasinah santo mucyante sarva kilbisaih bhunjate te tv agham papa ye pacanty atma karanat the devotees of the lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat food that is first offered for sacrifice others who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment verily eat only sin father emmanuel krsna cannot give permission to eat animals srila prabhupada yes in the animal kingdom but the civilized human being the religious human being is not meant to kill and eat animals if you stop killing animals and chant the holy name christ everything will be perfect i have not come to teach you but only to request you to please chant the name of god the bible also demands this of you so let's kindly cooperate and chant and if you have a prejudice against chanting the name krsna then chant christos or krsta there is no difference sri caitanya said namnam akari bahudha nija sarva saktih god has millions and millions of names and because there is no difference between god's name and himself each one of these names has the same potency as god therefore even if you accept designations like hindu christian or muhammadan if you simply chant the name of god found in your own scriptures you will attain the spiritual platform human life is meant for self realization to learn how to love god that is the actual beauty of man whether you discharge this duty as a hindu a christian or a muhammadan it doesn't matter but discharge it father emmanuel i agree srila prabhupada pointing to a string of meditation beads we always have these beads just as you have your rosary you are chanting but why don't the other christians also chant why should they miss this opportunity as human beings cats and dogs cannot chant but we can because we have a human tongue if we chant the holy names of god we cannot lose anything on the contrary we gain greatly my disciples practice chanting hare krsna constantly they could also go to the cinema or do so many other things but they have given everything up they eat neither fish nor meat nor eggs they don't take intoxicants they don't drink they don't smoke they don't partake in gambling they don't speculate and they don't maintain illicit sexual connections but they do chant the holy name of god if you would like to cooperate with us then go to the churches and chant christ krsta or krsna what could be the objection father emmanuel there is none for my part i would be glad to join you srila prabhupada no we are speaking with you as a representative of the christian church instead of keeping the churches closed why not give them to us we would chant the holy name of god there twenty four hours a day in many places we have bought churches that were practically closed because no one was going there in london i saw hundreds of churches that were closed or used for mundane purposes we bought one such church in los angeles it was sold because no one came there but if you visit this same church today you will see thousands of people any intelligent person can understand what god is in five minutes it doesn't require five hours father emmanuel i understand srila prabhupada but the people do not their disease is that they don't want to understand visitor i think understanding god is not a question of intelligence but a question of humility srila prabhupada humility means intelligence the humble and meek own the kingdom of god this is stated in the bible is it not but the philosophy of the rascals is that everyone is god and today this idea has become popular therefore no one is humble and meek if everyone thinks that he is god why should he be humble and meek therefore i teach my disciples how to become humble and meek they always offer their respectful obeisances in the temple and to the spiritual master and in this way they make advancement the qualities of humbleness and meekness lead very quickly to spiritual realization in the vedic scriptures it is said to those who have firm faith in god and the spiritual master who is his representative the meaning of the vedic scriptures is revealed father emmanuel but shouldn't this humility be offered to everyone else also srila prabhupada yes but there are two kinds of respect special and ordinary sri krsna caitanya taught that we shouldn't expect honor for ourselves but should always respect everyone else even if he is disrespectful to us but special respect should be given to god and his pure devotee father emmanuel yes i agree srila prabhupada i think the christian priests should cooperate with the krsna consciousness movement they should chant the name christ or christos and should stop condoning the slaughter of animals this program follows the teachings of the bible it is not my philosophy please act accordingly and you will see how the world situation will change father emmanuel i thank you very much srila prabhupada hare krsna jesus christ was a guru the spiritual leader of the hare krsna movement here recognizes lord jesus christ as the son of god the representative of god our guru our spiritual master yet he has some sharp words for those who currently claim to be christ's followers the srimad bhagavatam states that any bona fide preacher of god consciousness must have the qualities of titiksa tolerance and karuna compassion in the character of lord jesus christ we find both these qualities he was so tolerant that even while he was being crucified he didn't condemn anyone and he was so compassionate that he prayed to god to forgive the very persons who were trying to kill him of course they could not actually kill him but they were thinking that he could be killed so they were committing a great offense as christ was being crucified he prayed father forgive them they know not what they are doing a preacher of god consciousness is a friend to all living beings lord jesus christ exemplified this by teaching thou shalt not kill but the christians like to misinterpret this instruction they think the animals have no soul and therefore they think they can freely kill billions of innocent animals in the slaughterhouses so although there are many persons who profess to be christians it would be very difficult to find one who strictly follows the instructions of lord jesus christ a vaisnava is unhappy to see the suffering of others therefore lord jesus christ agreed to be crucified to free others from their suffering but his followers are so unfaithful that they have decided let christ suffer for us and we'll go on committing sin they love christ so much that they think my dear christ we are very weak we cannot give up our sinful activities so you please suffer for us jesus christ taught thou shalt not kill but his followers have now decided let us kill anyway and they open big modern scientific slaughterhouses if there is any sin christ will suffer for us this is a most abominable conclusion christ can take the sufferings for the previous sins of his devotees but first they have to be sane why should i put jesus christ into suffering for my sins let me stop my sinful activities suppose a man the favorite son of his father commits a murder and suppose he thinks if there is any punishment coming my father can suffer for me will the law allow it when the murderer is arrested and says no no you can release me and arrest my father i am his pet son will the police officials comply with that fool's request he committed the murder but he thinks his father should suffer the punishment is that a sane proposal no you have committed the murder you must be hanged similarly when you commit sinful activities you must suffer not jesus christ this is god's law jesus christ was such a great personality the son of god the representative of god he had no fault still he was crucified he wanted to deliver god consciousness but in return they crucified him they were so thankless they could not appreciate his preaching but we appreciate him and give him all honor as the representative of god of course the message that christ preached was just according to his particular time place and country and just suited for a particular group of people but certainly he is the representative of god therefore we adore lord jesus christ and offer our obeisances to him once in melbourne a group of christian ministers came to visit me they asked what is your idea of jesus christ i told them he is our guru he is preaching god consciousness so he is our spiritual master the ministers very much appreciated that actually anyone who is preaching god's glories must be accepted as a guru jesus christ is one such great personality we should not think of him as an ordinary human being the scriptures say that anyone who considers the spiritual master to be an ordinary man has a hellish mentality if jesus christ were an ordinary man then he could not have delivered god consciousness thou shalt not kill or thou shalt not murder at a monastic retreat near paris in july of srila prabhupada talked with cardinal jean danielou the bible does not simply say do not kill the human being ' it says broadly thou shalt not kill ' why do you interpret this to suit your own convenience srila prabhupada jesus christ said thou shalt not kill so why is it that the christian people are engaged in animal killing cardinal danielou certainly in christianity it is forbidden to kill but we believe that there is a difference between the life of a human being and the life of the beasts the life of a human being is sacred because man is made in the image of god therefore to kill a human being is forbidden srila prabhupada but the bible does not simply say do not kill the human being it says broadly thou shalt not kill cardinal danielou we believe that only human life is sacred srila prabhupada that is your interpretation the commandment is thou shalt not kill cardinal danielou it is necessary for man to kill animals in order to have food to eat srila prabhupada no man can eat grains vegetables fruits and milk cardinal danielou no flesh srila prabhupada no human beings are meant to eat vegetarian food the tiger does not come to eat your fruits his prescribed food is animal flesh but man's food is vegetables fruits grains and milk products so how can you say that animal killing is not a sin cardinal danielou we believe it is a question of motivation if the killing of an animal is for giving food to the hungry then it is justified srila prabhupada but consider the cow we drink her milk therefore she is our mother do you agree cardinal danielou yes surely srila prabhupada so if the cow is your mother how can you support killing her you take the milk from her and when she's old and cannot give you milk you cut her throat is that a very humane proposal in india those who are meat eaters are advised to kill some lower animals like goats pigs or even buffalo but cow killing is the greatest sin in preaching krsna consciousness we ask people not to eat any kind of meat and my disciples strictly follow this principle but if under certain circumstances others are obliged to eat meat then they should eat the flesh of some lower animal don't kill cows it is the greatest sin and as long as a man is sinful he cannot understand god the human being's main business is to understand god and to love him but if you remain sinful you will never be able to understand god what to speak of loving him cardinal danielou i think that perhaps this is not an essential point the important thing is to love god the practical commandments can vary from one religion to the next srila prabhupada so in the bible god's practical commandment is that you cannot kill therefore killing cows is a sin for you cardinal danielou god says to the indians that killing is not good and he says to the jews that srila prabhupada no no jesus christ taught thou shalt not kill why do you interpret this to suit your own convenience cardinal danielou but jesus allowed the sacrifice of the paschal lamb srila prabhupada but he never maintained a slaughterhouse cardinal danielou laughs no but he did eat meat srila prabhupada when there is no other food someone may eat meat in order to keep from starving that is another thing but it is most sinful to regularly maintain slaughterhouses just to satisfy your tongue actually you will not even have a human society until this cruel practice of maintaining slaughterhouses is stopped and although animal killing may sometimes be necessary for survival at least the mother animal the cow should not be killed that is simply human decency in the krsna consciousness movement our practice is that we don't allow the killing of any animals krsna says patram puspam phalam toyam yo me bhaktya prayacchati vegetables fruits milk and grains should be offered to me in devotion bhagavad gita we take only the remnants of krsna's food prasadam the trees offer us many varieties of fruits but the trees are not killed of course one living entity is food for another living entity but that does not mean you can kill your mother for food cows are innocent they give us milk you take their milk and then kill them in the slaughterhouse this is sinful student srila prabhupada christianity's sanction of meat eating is based on the view that lower species of life do not have a soul like the human being's srila prabhupada that is foolishness first of all we have to understand the evidence of the soul's presence within the body then we can see whether the human being has a soul and the cow does not what are the different characteristics of the cow and the man if we find a difference in characteristics then we can say that in the animal there is no soul but if we see that the animal and the human being have the same characteristics then how can you say that the animal has no soul the general symptoms are that the animal eats you eat the animal sleeps you sleep the animal mates you mate the animal defends and you defend where is the difference cardinal danielou we admit that in the animal there may be the same type of biological existence as in men but there is no soul we believe that the soul is a human soul srila prabhupada our bhagavad gita says sarva yonisu in all species of life the soul exists the body is like a suit of clothes you have black clothes i am dressed in saffron clothes but within the dress you are a human being and i am also a human being similarly the bodies of the different species are just like different types of dress there are soul a part and parcel of god suppose a man has two sons not equally meritorious one may be a supreme court judge and the other may be a common laborer but the father claims both as his sons he does not make the distinction that the son who is a judge is very important and the worker son is not important and if the judge son says my dear father your other son is useless let me cut him up and eat him will the father allow this cardinal danielou certainly not but the idea that all life is part of the life of god is difficult for us to admit there is a great difference between human life and animal life srila prabhupada that difference is due to the development of consciousness in the human body there is developed consciousness even a tree has a soul but a tree's consciousness is not very developed if you cut a tree it does not resist actually it does resist but only to a very small degree there is a scientist named jagadish chandra bose who has made a machine which shows that trees and plants are able to feel pain when they are cut and we can see directly that when someone comes to kill an animal it resists it cries it makes a horrible sound so it is a matter of the development of consciousness but the soul is there within all living beings cardinal danielou but metaphysically the life of man is sacred human beings think on a higher platform than the animals do srila prabhupada what is that higher platform the animal eats to maintain his body and you also eat in order to maintain your body the cow eats grass in the field and the human being eats meat from a huge slaughterhouse full of modern machines but just because you have big machines and a ghastly scene while the animal simply eats grass this does not mean that you are so advanced that only within your body is there a soul and that there is not a soul within the body of the animal that is illogical we can see that the basic characteristics are the same in the animal and the human being cardinal danielou but only in human beings do we find a metaphysical search for the meaning of life srila prabhupada yes so metaphysically search out why you believe that there is no soul within the animal that is metaphysics if you are thinking metaphysically that's all right but if you are thinking like an animal then what is the use of your metaphysical study metaphysical means above the physical or in other words spiritual in the bhagavad gita krsna says sarva yonisu kaunteya in every living being there is a spirit soul that is metaphysical understanding now either you accept krsna's teachings as metaphysical or you'll have to take a third class fool's opinion as metaphysical which do you accept cardinal danielou but why does god create some animals who eat other animals there is a fault in the creation it seems srila prabhupada it is not a fault god is very kind if you want to eat animals then he'll give you full facility god will give you the body of a tiger in your next life so that you can eat flesh very freely why are you maintaining slaughterhouses i'll give you fangs and claws now eat so the meat eaters are awaiting such punishment the animaleaters become tigers wolves cats and dogs in their next life to get more facility regards srinivas kumar
