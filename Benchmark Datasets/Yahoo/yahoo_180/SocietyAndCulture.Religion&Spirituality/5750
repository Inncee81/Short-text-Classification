how do i thank all those who how do i thank all those who submitted answers to my question yesterday i guess sometimes i get too passionate about our faith being put down but i forget that we are not to judge others but as many of the answers stated we are supposed to let the holy spirit do the convicting and we are to just love people which i do whatever your choice is in how you live i'm sorry if i offended anyone and can you forgive me if i did it is normal for a person to be careful with what he says unfortunately this sometimes does not apply more importantly when salvation is concerned your belief leads you to your salvation and if you are sure of what you believe then you must boldly tell others what they should know not to please them but to make them see the truth you are doubting now because deep in you you know that you should have told what is supposed to be told if i am to ask for forgiveness of course you r forgiven and will never get offended god bless ur kind heart Salvation Roman Catholic Church Sola fide Divine grace Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Infant baptism A Course In Miracles Baptism Martin Luther Forgiveness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Predestination Eastern Orthodox Church Christianity Book of Isaiah Christian views of Jesus Charles Grandison Finney Theory of conduct John Wesley Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Justification (theology) Book of Mormon Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Soul Socrates Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Free will Merit Religion Religious pluralism Mormonism Amidah God The Brothers Karamazov Sikhism primary beliefs and principles John Howard Yoder Mary, the mother of Jesus Eucharist Indulgence Mortification of the flesh Catholicism Holy Spirit Lutheranism Holiness movement Abrahamic religion Paul of Tarsus Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) United Methodist Church Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Salvation Army Repentance Calvinism Saint Jan Hus Evangelicalism Meaning of life Nontrinitarianism Revelation Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Biblical inerrancy Papal Infallibility Christian apologetics Resurrection of Jesus Reincarnation Theodicy Jon Secada InterFaith Past teachings of Prem Rawat Christian-Jewish reconciliation Contrition Tertullian Phaedo Apostles' Creed Devil Legalism (theology) Separation of church and state Abraham Capital punishment Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Theology Confession Rule of St Benedict John Wycliffe Great Apostasy Catechism True Jesus Church Jesus S__ren Kierkegaard Criticism of Mormonism Athanasian Creed New Testament Perseverance of the saints Community of Christ Zohar Ten Commandments Nicene Creed
