heavy metal and christianity details i just finished downloading gb of christian metal mp i was very surprised at things most of it its acctually good very good some of it doesn't resemble christian songs neither the rithim or the lyrics now that makes me think what exactly is the diference between these christian metal bands that i'd never guess are christian and other secular metal bands does the lyrics matter i usually don't understad what they are saying does the band beliefs count if so well tom araya is christian i think the whole thing for born again christians is very very subjective for example i don't mind listening to pantera but i really object listening to super joint well both bands should be equally spiritually acceptable or not since phil anselmo sings in both i think he writes too i dont know you thoughts paz de cristo if they reach one soul and turn them to christ and their salvation is genuine than i dont see the harm in it no where in the bible does is say that one form of music is prefered over another but it does say not to have any appearance of evil i leave that to the individual to decern with the leading of the holy ghost i listen to christian heavy metal and rap too have for years Pantera Music genre Eastern Orthodox Church Hip hop music Church of Christ Holy Spirit Salvation Religious Society of Friends Infant baptism Phil Anselmo Religion Rich Mullins Christian anarchism Salvation Army Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Predestination Jehovah's Witnesses Baptism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Gothic metal A Course In Miracles Book of Mormon Church of Christ, Scientist Justification (theology) Music history of the United States (1980s to the present) Music history of the United States Eucharist Ten Commandments Alternative hip hop Slow Train Coming Heavy metal music Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Atheism Metallica Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses American Pie (song) Theology Merit Iglesia ni Cristo Backward message Protestantism Purgatory Timeline of trends in music from the United States (1970-Present) Witchcraft Supernatural Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Resurrection of Jesus Heaven African American music Karma Iron Maiden Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Trinity Bible Moral objectivism Aleister Crowley Therion (band) Perseverance of the saints Human nature Christian Jesus Catholicism Evil Samples of music from the United States Time Out of Mind Music history of the United States (1960s and 70s) Mortification of the flesh Legalism (theology) Baptist Slayer Repentance Rapping Separation of church and state Christian metal Sola fide Atomic Kitten Christian-Jewish reconciliation Free will Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Evolutionary creationism Death rock Urantia Biblical inerrancy Gospel of Thomas Afterlife Pain of Salvation Second Vatican Council Historicity of Jesus Origen Rock (music) Christian eschatology Meaning of life
