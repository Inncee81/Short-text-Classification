is there a way for me to become more aware of my sixth sense i didn't know what else to call it other than i believe that in spirits around us positive and negative i also believe in psychic abilities and some really being in touch with theirs i have very little ability to get in tune with these feelings but would like very much to is there a way to become more aware of this realm the first step is understanding that your are already in this realm we spend so much of our day busy with urgent things that we dont just stop and think about what is important i waited for a while to see miracles now i see that the miracle is life it is right under our nose the whole time once we become aware of this our entire perception of reality begins to mold to its true divine shape i found that my best way of following this greater understanding is to make sure i make the time daily to sit in silence and allow life to speak to me life is so much more real than we percieve at first and if we practice and search for more our five senses will become more in touch with eachother also making sure to be nice to mean people even if it doesnt make sense at the time being nice and helping people always boosts your clearity of perception this is what all the great teachers tell us to do but we are too selfish to just go out and do it i have seen angels and various other things that science could never explain because science is only going to show you what your senses show you i was raised christian and was told many things by people that tried to keep my mind afraid to be free but i have seen that death is impossible and we have to let our fears go we create fear and it keeps us locked into a selfish basic existance i could go on all day keep searching and thinking about everything and show that greater force that you are serious about letting go and it will show you what you have chosen to not yet see A Course In Miracles Supernatural Reality Force (Star Wars) Neuro-linguistic programming Carlos Castaneda Free will The nature of God in Western theology God Church of Christ, Scientist Scientology beliefs and practices Religion Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Rudolf Steiner Existence of God Past teachings of Prem Rawat Friedrich Schleiermacher Numerology New Age Ontological argument Alaga__sia Spiritism Anthroposophy Summa Theologiae Emanuel Swedenborg Theory of conduct Meme Religious Society of Friends Infantilism Immanuel Kant Alcoholics Anonymous Science S__ren Kierkegaard Transactional analysis Magic (paranormal) Epistemology William James Sant Thakar Singh Simone Weil Meditation Philosophy of mathematics Milton H.
