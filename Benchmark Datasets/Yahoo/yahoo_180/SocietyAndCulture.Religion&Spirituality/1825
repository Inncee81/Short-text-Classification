a question about self control a federal judge by the name of robert sweet once allowed a lawsuit by two overweight teenage girls they blame mcdonalds for making them fat will business now increase at mcdonalds since fat people will now eat more mcdonalds so that they can also sue should judge sweet be concerned that these two fat girls err i mean thinly challenged girls who have no self control at all may hear his name sweet and try to eat him too ok obesity is one of those issues that really makes me angry people are ruthless toward fat people and it's disgusting to me i've made it no secret that i'm fat i'm five feet tall and pounds i'm a big woman with a lot of blubber and i've received more downright cruel comments about my weight than my dark skin or my gender and i mean cruel cruel comments that aside i very very rarely eat at mcdonald's it's revolting it's a complete generalization to state that fat people will eat there more for the sake of suing i don't need mcdonald's to get rich i have other nasty little schemes for that mcdonald's has always provided their nutritional information if anyone wanted to know what was in that crap it's available the problem isn't always self control i do not over eat i never over eat it's uncomfortable and it makes me feel horrible the only reason i'm fat is because i eat high calorie food and i'm inherently lazy obesity is in fact a choice though i choose to be this fat i know what i have to do to lose the weight so no place that i eat is to blame for the size of my a there is no need to try to be politically correct fat is not a dirty word i'm fat and it's a fact don't treat it like an insult and there's no reason to tip toe around it fat is a body type you don't have to like it but it is a body type more people need to accept and realize this until i make the decision to lose weight this is my body type judge sweet is well i imagine he simply wants publicity like so many judges lately they are elected officials you know lastly i really like you but i don't think you have any idea what it is like to be fat i don't want pity or sympathy i simply want understanding i made myself this way and i have to undo it but i don't need anyone else commenting on it in the mean time and neither do these opportunistic girls rant edit thank you to those who e mailed me but edits and deletions are not necessary i'm not offended it's just important for me to tell people what it's like to be fat i get angry yes but offended it takes an awful lot to actual offend me Little Britain Atkins Nutritional Approach Super Size Me Anorexia nervosa Binge eating disorder Obesity Dieting Goodness and value theory Garfield Bodybuilding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Transsexuality Political correctness Theory of conduct Nutrition Vegetarianism Physical attractiveness Breastfeeding Hamburger Body mass index Healthy eating God Emperor of Dune Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Beavis and Butt-head Internet troll Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diabetes mellitus Ron and Fez Social rule Intelligent design Insulin Hamster Milk Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Fathers' rights Egg (food) Veganism Intersex surgery Puberty GED Characters in the Smurfs Humphrey Bogart The Apprentice 2 Ethnic issues in Japan Craps Adjustable gastric band Invader Zim Eric Cartman Fat acceptance movement Low-carbohydrate diet Tocopherol Tofu Terri Schiavo Lawsuit Fast food Expert system Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ontological argument 613 mitzvot The nature of God in Western theology Intelligent design movement Equine conformation Originalism Private Eye Shit Friends Weight loss Folic acid Boxing Trans fat The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Domestic violence Jean Grey Food guide pyramid Plame affair Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Polyamory Guns N' Roses Characters of Naruto Slander and libel Springfield (The Simpsons) Sento Economics
