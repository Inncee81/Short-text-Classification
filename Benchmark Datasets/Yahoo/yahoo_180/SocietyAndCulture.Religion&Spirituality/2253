christians what do you think of brian mclaren i have heard conflicting things about mclaren and the emerging church movement i am not so concerned about the things emergents do such as meet in bars burn candles reject church buildings etc but i am concerned about some of their teachings especially those of brian mclaren what do you think there is a great deal in this movement as a whole and particularly in mclaren s teaching that concerns me as well the biggest problem in evaluating the ministry of brian mclaren and other emergents such as leonard sweet is that they are chameleons they act differently among conservative evangelicals than they do elsewhere but how they act among evangelicals is sufficient to discover that they are not themselves evangelical in their beliefs or practices for example mclaren is on record berating the idea of blood atonement rejecting the notion of eternal hell dismissing the historicity of scripture denying the sinfulness of homosexual practices and embracing religious pluralism many evangelical scholars such as d a carson and millard erickson have harshly criticized mclaren and the emerging church movement but in some evangelical quarters it is still considered cool and sophisticated to be on the cutting edge with these people i think it is quite clear that by orthodox christian standards mclaren s views are heretical i have pasted a few quotes from mclaren s works to illustrate what i am saying i was relaxing in my parents swimming pool with my brother i asked him how the engineering business was going and he reciprocated how s the ministry world going okay i said except that a couple of weeks ago i realized that i don t know why jesus had to die then peter without skipping a beat without even a moment s hesitation said well neither did jesus brian mclaren we should consider the possibility that many and perhaps even all of jesus hell fire or end of the universe statements refer not to postmortem judgment but to the very historic consequences of rejecting his kingdom message of reconciliation and peacemaking the destruction of jerusalem in a d seems to many people to fulfill much of what we have traditionally understood as hell i hope people can understand that some of us show our love for god by seeking better answers when our current answers seem unworthy of god brian mclaren as in so many issues these days the problem isn t the bible it s the assumptions we bring to the bible about how it is supposed to be interpreted we make demands of the biblical writers that we don t make of any other writers and i m not sure our demands are sensible or fair at all as an analogy i often refer to the wizard of oz in my teaching does this mean that i believe dorothy was a historical figure no it means that i accept the story of oz as being part of our culture and that i can use it to illustrate truth or provide analogies to truth brian mclaren for too many people the name jesus has become a symbol of exclusion as if jesus statement i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me actually means i am in the way of people seeking truth and life i won t let anyone get to god unless he comes through me brian mclaren i don t believe making disciples must equal making adherents to the christian religion it may be advisable in many not all circumstances to help people become followers of jesus and remain within their buddhist hindu or jewish contexts rather than resolving the paradox via pronouncements on the eternal destiny of people more convinced by or loyal to other religions than ours we simply move on to help buddhists muslims christians and everyone else experience life to the full in the way of jesus while learning it better myself i would gladly become one of them whoever they are to whatever degree i can to embrace them to join them to enter into their world without judgment but with saving love as mine has been entered by the lord brian mclaren the problem with the critics conservative evangelicals here is that they think they have a superior timeless gospel that floats above any culture brian mclaren we must be continually aware that the old old story may not be the true true story brian mclaren below are some good books on this subject carson d a becoming conversant with the emerging church grand
