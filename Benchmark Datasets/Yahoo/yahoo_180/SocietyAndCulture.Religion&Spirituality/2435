if you had to belong to another religion other then the one you have now which one would you choose and why i asked this question a while back and found that buddhism was an extremely popular second choice for a religion i would probably go with hinduism it sort of seems like if there were any gods that wanted to be worshiped they would have told mankind about themselves from the very beginning and they wouldn't have suddenly come up with completely new rules at random points in history hinduism is the oldest known religion that is still in existence and its earliest known scriptures are still considered its most important the vedas judaism might be old too but its obviously a very exclusionary religion it was just meant for one nation why would a real god take so much interest in one nation the idea that the god of all of mankind would so narrowly focus his attention on one tiny group of people is just plain stupid Monotheism Religion Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Hinduism Religious pluralism Hindu History of Hinduism Fundamentalism Vedas Eastern philosophy Prayer God Theology Saint Smartism Philosophy of religion Sacrifice Gautama Buddha Henotheism Origin belief Predestination Hindu deities Avatar Indian caste system Idolatry Christianity Yoga Vedic civilization Divine grace Religious conversion Pantheism Chosen people Mantra Satanism Buddhist philosophy Trinity Zoroastrianism Karma Agama Hindu Dharma Magic (paranormal) Upanishad Brahman Advaita Vedanta Moses Jainism Sacred text Neopaganism Dharma Scientology beliefs and practices Bah__'__ Faith The nature of God in Western theology Islam Meditation Judaism Heaven Urantia Omnipotence Karma in Hinduism Ayyavazhi and Hinduism Adi Shankara Rastafari movement Aryan invasion theory Caste Brahmanism Cosmology Reincarnation Religious perspectives on Jesus Deity Afterlife Icon Meaning of life Bhakti Religion and abortion Hell Prophet History of Buddhism Abrahamic religion Neofascism and religion Taoism Rig Veda Ayyavazhi Evil Tantra Kali Yuga Sexual orientation Abraham Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Pascal's Wager Religious Society of Friends Hindu scripture Jewish principles of faith Shaivism A Course In Miracles Jewish views of religious pluralism Demon Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism
