i have to fire guys there all good people its just hard to find the words to start the conversation it will get done but i don't know how to start that conversation to close friends employees who aren't that close no problemo but this i chose to ask in this section because i know after all the bs there are honest people here even so called enemies i used to work for a merger crazy bank and we were forever laying off people due to merger activity i had to do in one day as i recall the best advice i can give you is keep it short and to the point don't open yourself up for negotiation or be wishy washy you don't want to end in a conversation that can get your company sued don't speculate just stick with the facts of the decision allow the person some private time to gather themselves before they have to face their co workers sometimes if you have a conference room you can go to it makes it easier than co workers seeing an endless parade of people in and out of your office wondering if they're next etc be prepared for all types of reactions i've had people jump for joy and i've had people get very angry and everything in between don't expect them to remember anything you say about paperwork benefits severance and such sometimes the shock of the event prevents them from absorbing all the information they need so make sure they know where they can go to ask questions good luck this indeed sucks for both you and them i hated this part of my job Plame affair Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete Cliff Richard Health insurance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Labour economics The Ashlee Simpson Show Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an G-Man (Half-Life) One Tree Hill (TV series) Something Positive Equine conformation Craps Galactic Civilizations Bank Current teachings of Prem Rawat Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Avenue Q Trade union Economic inequality Phoebe Buffay's songs Hearing impairment Contract Timon and Pumbaa Anarchism and society Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Suffering (game) Transport Workers Union of America Poker jargon Surveillance Mergers and acquisitions Freeters Teen Girl Squad Publicly funded medicine The Apprentice 2 Public domain Religious Society of Friends Little Britain Eric Bischoff Sub-Zero Reservoir Dogs Aerial (dance move) Evan Mecham Piccolo Junior Saga Jon Secada Transactional analysis Ethnic issues in Japan John Howard Yoder Karl Rove Good Morning, Vietnam The Wonderful Wizard of Oz RuneScape quests Sears Holdings Corporation Chess strategy and tactics Polish September Campaign Jean Charles de Menezes Hiberno-English Termination of employment Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Blood (computer game) Sweatshop Kodocha Customs and etiquette of Japan Copy protection Capitalism Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Sydney Riot of 1879 God Emperor of Dune The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Password The Shining (film) The Marshall Mathers LP Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword W.I.T.C.H.
