why do you view paganism as a bad thing okay if you are against paganism witchcraft and the like can you explain to me why it is so wrong without using the bible as a reason i want real reasons not just because that's what my pastor tells me or anything i'm looking for any reason why someone would think that pagans are immoral besides the words in the bible personally i see nothing wrong with pagans it's earth based peaceful and they don't practice animal sacrifice or anything like that they do nothing wrong and don't condemn others' ideas so why such a problem i'm gnostic by the way please don't tell me to pray or to go read the bible i have a few times or quote bible verses i want a reason from you not just something someone told you agnostic i mean i can't type worth crap jake that's funny i can say the same about your bible but i'm not here to fight and i'm not going to attack you like you attacked pagan beliefs rif actually i learned these things for myself and found my own ideas seeing how christians treat pagans is good enough proof for me i want to share my idea about your question actually i observed that most pagans behave better than some people who are attached with religion does some people misinterprets paganism because they aren't fully exposed to different views beliefs in life people who are against these pagans just based their views on what they heard or read we should be open minded be realistic on what is happening around us some pagans do commit mistakes yes but we should also ask ourselves are we not if we judge other people their faiths beliefs we are already committing mistake what matters most is that follow what is right or good without harming other people or creature that's what human really means Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religion Trinity Atheism Theory of conduct Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity A Course In Miracles God Christianity Idolatry Witchcraft Supernatural Ten Commandments Satanism Sin Evil Theodicy Sacrifice Soul Historicity of Jesus Neopaganism Creationism Tertullian Discordianism Religious Society of Friends Theology Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Sabbath Great Apostasy Bible and reincarnation John Wycliffe Nontrinitarianism Resurrection of Jesus Historical persecution by Christians Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Jewish views of religious pluralism Predestination Morality Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Wicca Meaning of life Love Reincarnation Satan God and gender Prophet Origen Existence of God Book of Mormon Merit Christianity and anti-Semitism The nature of God in Western theology Religious conversion Evolutionary creationism New Testament Church of Christ, Scientist Prayer John Howard Yoder Opus Dei Demon Christian anarchism Salvation Human Socrates Hell Origin belief Religious pluralism Paul of Tarsus Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Utilitarianism Church of Christ The Two Babylons Paganism Ontological argument Religion and sexuality Scientology beliefs and practices Judaism Heresy Ethics Yeshu Karma Afterlife Homosexuality and Christianity Rudolf Hermann Lotze Christian eschatology Goodness and value theory Jews as a chosen people Young Earth creationism
