question for christians jesus christ will decide our faith based on our acts in life he said do not judge so why the christian church and the followers are so judgmental they should rest assured that no sinner will get away when last judgment day comes and by now means i am generalizing all christians the christian church's teachings are no longer reflective of the teachings of jesus they have become about maintaining power and control over people through the use of fear intimidation and hate now does this sound like anything jesus taught during the taking of jersusalem during the crusades men women and children who were jewish muslim and christian were slaughtered as the crusader army took the city in the name of jesus christ does this sound like the teaching of jesus people such as constantine boniface and others have changed the face of christianity too the point that there is so much hatred and mistrust for those that are not christian and the intolerance that brings has caused so much devastation throughtout the world the need to be in power to have control to be the only true religion of god has caused so much death and suffering not only by christianity but also by judaism and islam the simple fact is that all of the world's religions have the same basic beliefs at their foundation but have chosen to emphasize the differences to polarize people and in doing so gain control over them trust your inner connection to the divine experience it share it but do not push it on others let their experience of the divine be just that theirs god in purest form is love Christianity Sola fide Sin Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Religious conversion Prophet Abrahamic religion Divine grace Salvation Predestination Church of Christ, Scientist Charles Grandison Finney God Baptism Bible and reincarnation Religious pluralism Christianity and anti-Semitism Eastern Orthodox Church Holy Spirit Heaven Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Original sin Roman Catholic Church Creationism History of Christianity Justification (theology) A Course In Miracles Mary, the mother of Jesus Resurrection of Jesus Chosen people Gospel of Thomas Islam Calvinism Paul of Tarsus Separation of church and state Jesus Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religious perspectives on Jesus Soul Sabbath Great Apostasy Clergy Idolatry Religious Society of Friends Summa Theologiae Church of Christ Heresy Nation of Islam John Howard Yoder Mormonism Judaism Dispensationalism Infant baptism Christian views of Jesus Historical persecution by Christians Evangelicalism Christian denomination Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Protestantism Criticisms of Christianity Qiyamah Messianic Judaism Messiah Catholicism Baptist Community of Christ Theology Second Coming Opus Dei Mortification of the flesh Criticism of Islam Christian anarchism Christian Book of Isaiah Jewish views of religious pluralism Apostle Satanism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) End times Atheism Ordination of women Reinhold Niebuhr Sharia Lutheranism Purgatory Catechism Christian views of women Mirza Ghulam Ahmad
