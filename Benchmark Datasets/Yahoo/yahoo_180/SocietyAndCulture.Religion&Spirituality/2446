what is the difference between zen buddhists and other buddhists i heard they don't believe in reincarnation and they eat meat unlike most buddhists and even though a lot are in japan they're atheist and don't believe in shinto coexisting with buddhism or something cause they're atheist zen evolved in japan long after most other forms of buddhism had been established d t suzuki is probably the most respected author on modern zen although my favorite is the british author alan watts it is not necessary to believe in god or reincarnation to practice zen but belief in karma is basic to all buddhism and for this reason i doubt many zen buddhists eat meat we believe in the inviolability of all sentient beings that said many compromises are required to practice zen in the west just as the fundamental tenets of all buddhism came to japan from elsewhere and were changed so now we in the west are adapting zen and other forms to the realities of life here that's why i recommend alan watts as he was a westerner Buddhism Eastern philosophy Zen Karma Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki Alan Watts Karma in Hinduism Buddhism in the United States Koan Buddhist philosophy Atheism Shinto God Reincarnation Nondualism Japanese tea ceremony Tantra Tibetan Buddhism Suma Ching Hai Hinduism Afterlife Buddhist cuisine Nichiren Buddhism Rebirth (Buddhism) New Age Fundamentalism History of Buddhism Religious pluralism Mantra Theravada Taoism Korean Buddhism Soul Religion in Japan Ken Wilber Miyamoto Musashi Buddhist texts Ethics in religion Samurai Gary Snyder Schools of Buddhism Social justice Advaita Vedanta Faith in Buddhism Unitarian Universalism Haiku Bodhidharma Vegetarianism Samsara Meditation Bible and reincarnation Muromachi period Soyen Shaku Immortality Dharma Separation of church and state Hindu philosophy Nichiren Shoshu Mahayana Idolatry Spiritual evolution Satori Shunryu Suzuki Chan Yoga Discordianism Buddhist art Bushido Kukai Moksha Theosophy Chinese in Singapore Dogen Origin belief Soka Gakkai International Japanese Buddhism Simone Weil Jesus Vegetarianism and religion Yogacara Sangha A Course In Miracles Deconstruction Religious conversion Friends of the Western Buddhist Order Hindu Shakuhachi Determinism Neo-Confucianism Hakuin Ekaku I-Kuan Tao Tathagatagarbha doctrine
