christians how does it make you feel when you see so many un believers on r s answering questions with such malice and disregard to our lord at first it was overwhelming to me now it just saddens me how about you even though the question has been posted for a few minutes your answers are giving me hope b b thanks for the heart felt message you gave and thank you for being concern for us christians but i guess with me choosing to have something someone to believe in feels better then having nothing to believe in at all but i am great full for you speaking on your opinions and not using my god's name in vain or through blaspheme angel it hurts me to the bottom of my soul anytime i hear or see the name of our lord and savior being misused and i must admit there are things said here that make me very mad and very sad to the point of tears i think of my jesus being spit upon and beaten to the drgree that he was disfigured beyond explanation every crack of that whip was mine to take every stumbling step up that hill was my step to take it is me that should have scared hands and feet and i should have been rediculed as i hanged naked on a cross tormented even unto death but jesus took my place not because he had to but because he loves me enough to pay for my sins even while i was still living in sin don't misunderstand me i am still a sinner the very fact that i get mad is proof of that but because of jesus i no longer live in sin i no longer practice sin and when i fall i am forgiven and i do fall it is not possible for someone to understand the idea of having a personal relationship with your god and savior unless they have experienced a spiritual birth the carnal mind only sees and feels and understands that which is carnal those who would blaspheme our god the father son and holy spirit do not know what they do and christians are not to have harsh words about anyones religious beliefs either it is a sin indeed to act in such a juvenile manner we should be examples of god's love to the world our very existence is to glorify our god and savior i think it is time to become friends and to share our experences to love with a divine love that is unconditional honest and true god be with you evangelist william m butler st luke ministries Justification (theology) Ten Commandments Salvation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Trinity A Course In Miracles Sola fide Christianity Book of Isaiah Mary, the mother of Jesus Resurrection of Jesus Theodicy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Eastern Orthodox Church Repentance God Roman Catholic Church Christian views of Jesus Jesus Baptism Hell Perseverance of the saints Christian eschatology Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Original sin Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Predestination Church of Christ, Scientist Religious Society of Friends Charles Grandison Finney Calvinism Opus Dei Religion Merit Dispensationalism Angel Christ Infant baptism Eucharist Evangelicalism Divine grace Homosexuality and Christianity John Wycliffe Creationism Gospel of Thomas Protestantism Acts of the Apostles The Pilgrim's Progress Exorcism Urantia Sabbath Holy Spirit Baptist Meaning of life Biblical inerrancy Abrahamic religion Slow Train Coming Mortification of the flesh Simone Weil Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Evil Catholicism Mary Magdalene John Wesley Catechism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Judas Iscariot Mormonism End times Reinhold Niebuhr Jewish eschatology Prayer in Christianity Rich Mullins Religious perspectives on Jesus Jon Secada Holiness movement Immortality John the Baptist Pentecostalism Zohar Martin Luther Supernatural God the Father Jewish principles of faith The nature of God in Western theology Charismatic
