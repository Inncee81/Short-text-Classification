is bible only christianity logically consistent greetings this question is for bible only christians and by that i mean those who believe that core doctrines should only be those which can be derived from the bible itself what are the books of the bible shouldn'y the very question of what books are in the canon be one of the most central doctrines since almost everything else flows from that can you demonstrate which books are part of the canon without going outside the bible if not then doesn't that fly in the face of the rule that core doctrines must be backed up by the bible alone personally for me the question of the canon shows the necessity of an authority outside the bible that leads me to take a literal understanding of the church as the pillar and foundation of truth and it is what made me realize that jesus did not just hand people a bible rather he built a church that is why i am considering catholicism or orthodoxy i look forward to the comments and answers provided by others wow this is a great point i never thought of this before the rule of these types is the bible is the only source for important doctrines but then this is an important doctrine for these types the bible has books in the nt and in the ot but then that important doctrine can't be backed up with the bible there is no passage in the bible which says how many books it has or how many books are in the ot or how many are in the nt much less what exactly those books are you are right the 'bible only' style of christianity has a serious contradiction internal to it what a flaw New Testament Biblical inerrancy Eastern Orthodox Church John Wycliffe Book of Revelation Sola scriptura Bible Infant baptism Opus Dei Biblical canon Fundamentalism Book of Mormon Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Presuppositional apologetics King James Version of the Bible Liberal Christianity Ordination of women Resurrection of Jesus Catechism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Roman Catholic Church Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Predestination Origen Nontrinitarianism Evolutionary creationism Book of Daniel Mormonism and Christianity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Jewish principles of faith Existence of God History of the English Bible Great Apostasy Creation according to Genesis Perseverance of the saints Christian eschatology Religious pluralism Gospel of Thomas Urantia Evangelicalism Holy Spirit Christian denomination Philipp Melanchthon Historical Jesus Justification (theology) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Soul Church of Christ, Scientist Biblical studies Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Bible and reincarnation Protestantism Paul of Tarsus Religious conversion Salvation Free will Theology Anglicanism Prophet Catholicism Mary, the mother of Jesus Old Testament Ten Commandments Gospel of Mark Christian History of Christianity Creationism Sabbath Christian-Jewish reconciliation Young Earth creationism Gospel of John Qur'an Church of Christ Christian apologetics Seventh-day Adventist Church Christian anarchism Binitarianism Iglesia ni Cristo Papal Infallibility Authorship of the Pauline epistles Baptist Total depravity Jesus Moses Charismatic Homosexuality and Christianity Logic Baptism Religion
