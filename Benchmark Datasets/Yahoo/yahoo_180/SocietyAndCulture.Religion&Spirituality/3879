if satan punishes those who sin doesn't that make him more morally grounded than god after all a child rapist can receive god's grace simply by appealing to his ego and asking forgiveness through christ though it doesn't change the fact that he's still a child rapist satan wouldn't put up with this he'd torture the guy for all eternity and who could argue with that i think all child rapists should go to hell whether or not they ask jesus into their lives doesn't mean a thing on a moral level given the circumstances i'd have a lot more respect for the devil mello yellow free will was given to man by god not satan mellow god is omnipresent all knowing past present future he created us with the ability to do wrong and the knowledge that some men would do evil things if i raised and released a pit bull into a crowded school yard that resulted in the mauling deaths of several children who would be held responsible the dog satan or myself mellow i'll see you on the free will aspect but it doesn't change anything god is still omnipresent so what about my pit bull analogy satan does not punish sinners he is the one that influences them to sin in the first place second you have to have truly repentant heart god knows if you are serious or just giving him lip service a lot of times when one is so engrossed deep in sins like serial killers rapists hitler stalin people of that nature it is hard for their hearts to come to a place a repentance dog turn on your im so we can have a flowing dialogue i don't get your reasoning if it's freewill given by god it is just that free will your own choice how can you blame god for one's own decisions dog do think think you have freewill whether you believe god exists or not i think your answer is yes are you glad you have freewill again i'm assuming your answer is yes either god really truly gives us freewill or he doesn't concerning your pit bull analogy god just gives you freewill he doesn't influence you to sin or raise or train you to sin i see where your coming from in your analogy but i just don't think that is in accurate analogy concerning god being the one to blame for murderers your right he is omniscient finite man does not know what god he doing but he is always working i could say a lot more i could rebuttal better vocally i actually am not a big fan of typing you see how this site can frustrate me on big issues like this Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Original sin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin Satan Hell Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Devil Paradise Lost Summa Theologiae Salvation Capital punishment Predestination Evil Christian eschatology Charles Grandison Finney Justification (theology) Sola fide Repentance Satanism Eastern Orthodox Church Incarnations of Immortality Anselm of Canterbury John the Baptist Soul Baptism Theory of conduct Religion Merit Religious pluralism Indulgence Blood atonement Christian demonology Contrition Christian apologetics The nature of God in Western theology Religious views of suicide Infant baptism Simone Weil Roman Catholic Church Purgatory Divine grace Moral objectivism Problem of Hell Heaven Jewish principles of faith Determinism School of Salamanca Arminianism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Predestination (Calvinism) Daredevil Mormonism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief John Howard Yoder Reincarnation Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Judas Iscariot Urantia The Divine Comedy 613 mitzvot Abortion debate Antichrist Presuppositional apologetics Criticisms of Christianity Reinhold Niebuhr Christianity and anti-Semitism EastEnders Ethics in the Bible Sin City Jan Hus Omnipresence Duties of the Heart Demon Martin Luther Ten Commandments Prophet Time travel Human nature Fallen angel Miracle Sabbath Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible
