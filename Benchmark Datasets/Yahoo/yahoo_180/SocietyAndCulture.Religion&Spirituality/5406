muslims salaat significance i have an internship at a mosuqe alhamdulillah i offer zuhr and asr salaat while at work and everytime we women make ruku and sit with our hands on our knees and recite the tashahud or even allahmumma maghfirli war hamni wh dhini war zhukni i notive that the women always point their index finger out as if trying to count or point to someone they all do it always i asked my mom why and i don't know if she was joking with me or not but she said they were pointing to allah my question is what is the significance of pointing the index or even both the index and middle finger together outwards like that and if it is for trying to point gesture to allah swt what's the meaning of that thank you for clarifying this to me may allah swt bless you i took the foll from a book called fiqh us sunnah but apart from the foll if you require further clarification i suggest you write to islam qa com one should sit for the tashahud and place his hands in the following manner ibn 'umar reported that when the prophet sat for the tashahud he would place his left hand on his left knee and his right hand upon his right knee and he would form a ring like fifty three and point with his index finger in another narration it is reported he would close his hand and point with his index finger related by muslim wa'il ibn hajr reported that the prophet would place his left palm on his left thigh and knee he would place the end of his right elbow upon his right thigh and would then close his right hand forming a circle in another narration it states he would make a circle with his middle finger and thumb and point with his index finger then he would raise his finger and wa'il saw him moving it to make supplications related by ahmad explaining the hadith al baihaqi says the implication of 'he would move it' is that he would point with it not that he would continue to move it this would be in agreement with the narration of ibn az zubair who reported the prophet would point with his finger while supplicating and he would not move it this is related by abu dawud with a sahih chain an nawawi also mentioned it reported az zubair when the prophet sat for tashahud he would place his right hand on his right thigh and his left hand on his left thigh he would point with his middle finger and would not look beyond his pointing related by ahmad muslim and annasa'i this hadith shows that one is to place the right hand on the right thigh without closing the hand making a fist and that he is not to look beyond his pointing the preceding three hadith are all authentic and one may act by any of them one should point with one's right index finger bending it a little until one says the salaams at the end of the prayer reported numair al khaza'i i saw the messenger of allah sitting in the prayer with his forearm along his right thigh his index finger was raised curved or bent a little and he was supplicating this is related by ahmad abu dawud an nasa'i ibn majah and ibn khuzaimah with a good chain said anas ibn malik the messenger of allah upon whom be peace passed by sa'd while he was making supplications and using two fingers the prophet said to him 'just one sa'd ' this is related by ahmed abu dawud an nasa'i and al hakim ibn 'abbas was asked about a man who pointed with his finger while supplicating and he said this is sincere devotion says anas ibn malik that is imploring mujahid maintains doing this hinders satan according to the shai'iyyah one points with the finger only once when saying except allah in the statement bearing witness the hanifiyyah raise the finger in the denial part of the statement there is no god and put it back down during the confirmation part except allah the malikiyyah move the finger to the left and right until they finish the prayer the hanbaliyyah point with the finger every time they mention allah as a reflection of the oneness of allah and they do not move it Jizya Islam Sex segregation Aisha
