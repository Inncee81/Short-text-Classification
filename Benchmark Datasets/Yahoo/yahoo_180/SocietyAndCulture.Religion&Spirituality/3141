what is your opinion of god i am not neccessarely and athiest but then again i am not a firm believer in my opinion i think god was basically made up by man since as human beings we need to believe in something or someone when everything is wrong or need comfort we want to believe something is out there listening to us and therefore we get comfort for believing someone is out there looking out a neat example we discussed in my philosophy class was that if we were to leave a couple of kids in an island and return years later they would have created some sort of god they worship eventhough they were never taught about religion or a god but because that is what they find comfort in i would just like to hear what other people have to say p s no joking around with my island story example plz this is serious lol i think it is obvious that god exists just look at all the creation he put the instinct of an existing higher authority in each human being a longing to find the true god that needs to be fulfilled for example it is true that african nations believed in a creator before modern european missionaries ever came there i don't think that the primary reason that people worship god is that they are seeking comfort but that each person has a kind of instinct like deep down inside they know that there is a higher authority out there even if they've never been taught about that Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Trinity God Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Religion Soul Spiritism Animism Jewish principles of faith Simone Weil Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Existence of God Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Human nature Creationism Human Satanism A Course In Miracles Ten Commandments Prophet Islamic philosophy Eastern Orthodox Church Supernatural Philosophy Gnosticism Creation-evolution controversy The nature of God in Western theology Urantia Theodicy Religious Society of Friends Genesis Pantheism Nontrinitarianism Charles Darwin's views on religion Angel The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Ontological argument Liberal Christianity Jews as a chosen people Deity Creator God Maya mythology Jewish views of religious pluralism Holy Spirit Monotheism Prayer Sant Thakar Singh Mythology Fundamentalism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Kuzari Idolatry Deconstruction Patriotism Theory of conduct Maimonides History of creationism Alan Watts Leviathan (book) God Emperor of Dune Jewish philosophy Church of Christ, Scientist Cosmology Opus Dei Religious conversion Divine grace Islam Freemasonry Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophical skepticism Atheism Pandeism Friedrich Schleiermacher Sant Mat Alcoholics Anonymous Origin belief Socrates Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Jiddu Krishnamurti Book of Isaiah Trimurti Determinism Roman Catholic Church Mormonism and Christianity
