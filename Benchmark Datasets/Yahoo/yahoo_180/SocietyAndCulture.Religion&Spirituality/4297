we must love ourselves first yet we are not born knowing how to love love is an art which we need to learn most of us carry deep wounds inside these wounds can contaminate and sabotage our efforts to create and sustain love and yet we are supposed to love god and who or what teaches to love i think we are all born with a basic capacity and ability to love i think it is natural from birth for us to love our parents because they take care of us and protect us as we grow older we learn the deepness and meaning of love from our parents we learn the different kinds of love such as love of a friend love of a sibling love of a boyfriend girlfriend i think where love gets messed up first is by parents who abuse a child abuse one another don't demonstrate their love or sexually abuse a child as we get older and go out on our own even if we can love we get hurt and have our hearts broken some people give up or harden their hearts along the way life squeezes the ability to love out of some people if you want to know the truth i believe each time love gets messed up in someone's life it's due to the fact that someone around that person or the person himself herself did not follow the commandment treat others as you want to be treated if we all did that at all times with everyone around us there would be no heartbreak or wounded hearts Love Pitaten Laura Schlessinger Theory of conduct Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Adoption Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Friends Ten Commandments Justification (theology) Domestic violence John Howard Yoder Polyamory Dissociative identity disorder Jon Secada Kodocha Charmed Abortion debate Narcissism Children of God The Death Gate Cycle Fecal incontinence Child abuse The Giver Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Sub-Zero One Life to Live Urinary incontinence Child sexuality Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Good Times Anger management Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Church of Christ, Scientist Mina Mongoose Sant Thakar Singh Transsexuality Social rule Storytelling Charles Grandison Finney Socrates Summa Theologiae Sathya Sai Baba Sex and the City Scientology beliefs and practices Great Teacher Onizuka The Human Stain Karen Horney Current teachings of Prem Rawat Dead Like Me Human Philosophy of education Incarnations of Immortality Meaning of life Humphrey Bogart Bleeding Paradox Transactional analysis W.I.T.C.H.
