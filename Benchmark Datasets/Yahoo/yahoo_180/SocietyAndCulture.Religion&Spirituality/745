opionions on what you think is a pyschic power and if you even think they are real or not this spells it out for you cold reading is a technique used to convince another person that the reader knows much more about a subject than they actually do even without prior knowledge of a person a practiced cold reader can still quickly obtain a great deal of information about the subject by carefully analyzing the person's body language clothing or fashion hairstyle gender sexual orientation religion race or ethnicity level of education manner of speech place of origin etc this technique is also called offender profiling citation needed cold readers commonly employ high probability guesses about the subject quickly picking up on signals from their subjects as to whether their guesses are in the right direction or not and then emphasizing and reinforcing any chance connections the subjects acknowledge while quickly moving on from missed guesses performers such as lynne kelly kari coleman ian rowland and derren brown have used this technique at either private fortune telling sessions or open forum talking with the dead sessions in the manner of self proclaimed psychic medium john edward and his british counterparts only after receiving acclaim and applause from their audience do they reveal that they needed no psychic power for the performance only a sound knowledge of psychology and cold reading citation needed many famous psychics on the other hand claim that their abilities actually stem from paranormal means or intuition and deny that they are employing cold reading techniques in an episode of his trick of the mind series broadcast in march derren brown demonstrated how easily people can be influenced through cold reading techniques by repeating the

i often see images that are a bit unclear and which may sometimes mean more to you than to me if you help we can together uncover new things about you one of the most crucial elements of a convincing cold reading is a credulous subject eager to make connections or reinterpret vague statements in any way that will help the reader appear to have made specific predictions or intuitions while the reader will do most of the talking it is the subject who provides the meaning after assuring that the subject will play along the reader will make a number of probing statements or questions typically using variations of the methods noted below the subject will then reveal further information with their replies whether verbal or non verbal and the cold reader can continue from there pursuing promising lines of inquiry and very quickly abandoning or avoiding unproductive ones in general while only some of the information comes from the reader most of the facts and statements come from the subject and are then refined and restated by the reader so as to reinforce the idea that the reader got something correct even very subtle cues such as changes in facial expression or body language can indicate if a particular line of questioning is effective or not combining the techniques of cold reading with information obtained covertly also called hot reading can leave a strong but false impression that the reader knows or has access to a great deal of information about the subject because the majority of time during a reading is spent dwelling on the hits the reader is able to obtain while the time spent recognizing misses is minimized the effect is to give an impression that the cold reader knows far more about the subject than any ordinary stranger could the forer effect barnum statements barnum statements named after p t barnum the american showman may also be used these statements seem personal yet apply to many people and while seemingly specific such statements are often open ended or give the reader the maximum amount of wriggle room in a reading they are designed to elicit identifying responses from people the statements can then be developed into longer and more sophisticated paragraphs and seem to reveal great amounts of detail about a person the effect relies in part on the eagerness of people to fill in details and make connections between what is said and some aspect of their own lives often searching their entire life's history to find some connection or reinterpreting the statement in any number of different possible ways so as to make it apply to themselves a talented and charismatic reader can sometimes even bully a subject into admitting a connection demanding over and over that they acknowledge a particular statement as having some relevance and maintaining that they just aren't thinking hard enough or are repressing some important memory statements of this type might include i sense that you are sometimes insecure especially with people you don't know very well you have a box of old unsorted photographs in your house you had an accident when you were a child involving water you're having problems with a friend or relative
