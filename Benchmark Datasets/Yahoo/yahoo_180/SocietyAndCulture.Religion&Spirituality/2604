what do you think of the idea of christian wicca ok i've known a couple people who claimed to be both christian and wiccan at the same time and recently i've even seen some pro and con articles about it here is a wikipedia article with links to them http en wikipedia org wiki christian wicca personally i don't see a problem with practicing more than one religion if the beliefs aren't hostile in this case your interpretation of christianity is very liberal however the two world views do contradict each other in many ways implying one must be reinterpreted to fit the other i don't see any problem with these sorts of beliefs but am not sure they're really wicca and possibly not christian either i suspect part of the problem is the misconception that any witch is wiccan and any magic user is a witch perhaps these people should try other magic and or a different label anyway that's my view of it what do you think does it make since to be a christian and wiccan or even practice christian wicca just to be clear i expect that many conservative christians will not believe its possible the criticism that really interested me was this one given by a witch http www witchvox com va dt va html a usva c words id since i had always taken wicc to be non exclusive like eastern religions and expect most resistance to the idea to come from the christian side wiccan for many years wiccan and christianity are two distinct religions with distinct belief systems that are sometimes not reconcilable with each other certainly a person can draw from both but not practice both and satisfy the terms this is about language not about belief a person can believe what they wish that being said if you are a christian of some variety you believe that jesus was the son of the one true god and saviour of humanity if you are wiccan of some sort you believe in multiplicity of divinity polytheist pantheist etc the observace of the cycle of the seasons practice withcraft and abide by the wiccan rede if you believe jesus is the one true son of god saviour of humanity and you practice witchraft you are some sort of christian witch but likely not a wiccan if you are worship jesus and the biblical mythos as one possible examples of the magical family mother goddess father god etc etc abide by the wiccan rede etc then you might be some sort of wiccan who uses the biblical pantheon but not a christian i think any of these beliefs are valid and fine and between the worshipper and the divinity s they follow just pointing out that the terms christian and wicca are about as incomgruous as buddhist muslim Goddess God Christianity Fundamentalism Dianic Wicca Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Idolatry Religion Magic (paranormal) Monotheism Witch-hunt Theology Stregheria Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions God and gender Atheism Historical persecution by Christians Anarchism and religion Trinity Ten Commandments Jesus Creationism Mythology Mary, the mother of Jesus Hell Biblical inerrancy Religious perspectives on Jesus Satanism Homosexuality and Neopaganism Paganism Liberal Christianity Shamanism Wiccan Rede Judaism Roman Catholic Church God the Father Salvation Pantheism Deity Abrahamic religion Christian views on witchcraft Philosophy of religion Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Animism New Testament Catholicism Prayer A Course In Miracles Jewish principles of faith Ancient Greek religion Henotheism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Prophet Church of Christ Restorationism Nontrinitarianism Hinduism Religious Society of Friends Gospel of Thomas End times Satan Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Persecution of Wiccans Divine grace Islam Criticism of Mormonism Christian Reconstructionism Meaning of life Jewish views of religious pluralism New Age Paul of Tarsus The nature of God in Western theology Historicity of Jesus Jehovah's Witnesses Gnosticism Evangelicalism Christ Theodicy Messianic Judaism Feminism Resurrection of Jesus Reincarnation Eucharist Hecate Binitarianism Margaret Murray Jew History of Christianity
