calling all christians question for you let me ask this question again jesus talked about false prophets and teachers as a christian do you feel that you are in a church or group that follows the bible strictly what makes you so confident in your group or church are you doing what jesus comanded the st century christians to do for example go town to town house to house preaching the word of god this is what the letter of paul and peter are all about preaching to neighbors friends and everyone jesus did not stop preaching after he got baptized all he did was spread the word does your church or group follow these steps so state the name of the church or group and let us know what they do seconds ago days rukidding what are you talking about im not even a christian just wondering what church follows the bible the most since there are so many different ones i was just curious but i know what group you think i belong to but i don't but it's funny how everyone gets defensive i love these direct questions there is no way of getting around such questions it is either you do or you don t follow that command if not why not those who chose not to answer it are probably those who are not following christ s command to preach jehovah s witnesses are the only ones who on a consistent basis preach god s kingdom worldwide we preach in over lands to be exact as i alert and sitting down writing this to you my fellow brothers and sisters across the world are sleeping preparing to share another day in the ministry just as jesus commanded while our brothers and sisters across the world are preaching we are sleeping preparing for another day of going from house to house and from door to door we certainly do not hold back what is profitable to others acts i enjoy doing it just as jesus did jesus preached before he was baptized as did i and jesus preached after he was baptized as do i we do not preach the blues we have something better to offer we do not get paid to go out there and preach we do it because of the love we have for our fellow friends family and neighbors the thing that separates us from every other religion is our love in fact john i am giving you a new commandment that you love one another just as i have loved you that you also love one another by this all will know that you are my disciples if you have love among yourselves there it is we do not get involved in wars because john states if anyone makes the statement i love god and yet is hating his brother he is a liar for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot be loving god whom he has not seen we do not get involved in the political affairs nor do we put our trust in them because to them no salvation belongs also we obey god as ruler rather than men and we know that it does not even belong to man to direct his own step man has truly dominated man to his injury psalm acts jeremiah ecclesiastes every year we have our district convention our seats are filled with brothers and sisters from different nationalities backgrounds languages etc yet no fights have ever erupted why john yet when member nations gather together at the united nations to talk peace harsh words are used the meeting goes haywire and people s needs are often not met the meeting turns into an unproductive one in fact just have the israelites and palestinians all in one room at the un and see how that turns out conversely put our brothers and sisters from israel and palestine at a district convention and look at the difference of love that is shown why corinthians love is long suffering and kind love is not jealous it does not brag does not get puffed up does not behave indecently does not look for its own interests does not become provoked it does not keep account of the injury it does not rejoice over unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth it bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things acts for a certainty i perceive that god is not partial but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him isn t that a beautiful thing many religions have tried to preach and go from house to house but their efforts fail why because they do not have jehovah god s holy spirit many of us who preach the good news on a regular basis would not be able to do so without that holy spirit in fact some of us said that we would never knock on a stranger s door and now look lo and behold knocking on a stranger s door preaching the good news to them because these other religions do not have jehovah s holy spirit they fade in their efforts to preach and go back to their normal lives which are not in harmony with jehovah s will we had a radio station that announced the different talks that would take place however it was determined that the best way to reach people was by going to their homes this is how we can discern what their motives are and what they are really feeling you do not know that there is a widow who just lost her husband by preaching on television or on the radio she is in need of comfort that cannot take place through the television she needs kind words spoken to her condolences and being told about the resurrection hope perhaps she just needs someone to have tea with you cannot do that through the television or radio because everyone has different needs it is vital to see what one is thinking from his or her own heart our theocratic ministry school and service meeting helps us to become effective speakers in the field ministry being more flexible with our presentations and being more effective preachers and teachers certainly preaching the good news is rewarding and never tiresome in fact if we do not preach we can be bloodguilty ezekiel when i say to someone wicked you will positively die and you do not actually warn him and speak in order to warn the wicked one from his wicked way to preserve him alive he being wicked in his error he will die but his blood i shall ask back from your own hand but as for you in case you have warned someone wicked and he does not actually turn back from his wickedness and from his wicked way he himself for his error will die but as for you you will have delivered your own soul and when someone righteous turns back from his righteousness and actually does injustice and i must put a stumbling block before him he himself will die because you did not warn him for his sin he will die and his righteous acts that he did will not be remembered but his blood i shall ask back from your own hand and as for you in case you have warned someone righteous that the righteous one should not sin and he himself does not actually sin he will without fail keep on living because he had been warned and you yourself will have delivered your own soul Philipp Melanchthon Religious pluralism Jan Hus Evangelicalism Genesis God and gender
