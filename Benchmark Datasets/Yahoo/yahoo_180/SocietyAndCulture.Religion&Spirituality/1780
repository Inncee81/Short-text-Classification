where does the bible ever mention dinosaurs the reference to the leviathan made a nice description of a crocodile not a dinosaur behemoth sounds much more like a hippo or rhino so that isn't it either after all the claims that there were dinosaurs mentioned in the bible i'd really like to know where because i've read it and never seen any such thing anniekd thank you for the link but unfortunately there were absolutely no scientifically verified statements made just twisted half truths and outright lies to push the writers beliefs btw whether or not they are mentioned in the bible started to matter when certain members of the christian community in here started stating as fact that they are religious hymn recited on the festival of shavuot celebrating the giving of the torah known as akdamut wherein it says the sport with the leviathan and the ox behemoth when they will interlock with one another and engage in combat with his horns the behemoth will gore with strength the fish leviathan will leap to meet him with his fins with power their creator will approach them with his mighty sword and slay them both thus from the beautiful skin of the leviathan god will construct canopies to shelter the righteous who will eat the meat of the behemoth ox and the leviathan amid great joy and merriment at a huge banquet that will be given for them this gives a different take on it too its just another one of those diversions some people make because they cant accept the truth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ten Commandments Religion Biblical mythology Judaism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Apocalypse Creationism Shavuot Jewish services Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Biblical canon Korban Leviathan (book) Genesis Sabbath Liberal Christianity Abrahamic religion Mary, the mother of Jesus Apocalyptic literature Creation-evolution controversy Meaning of life Flood geology Legalism (theology) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Maimonides Jews as a chosen people Mormonism and Judaism Unclean animals Jesus Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Free will Fundamentalism Young Earth creationism Church of Christ, Scientist El (god) Rosh Hashanah Haftarah Phillip E.
