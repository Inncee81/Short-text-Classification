but as the church is subject to christ so also let the wives be subject to their husbands in everything ephesians also peter wives likewise be submissive to your own husbands that even if some do not obey the word they without a word may be won by the conduct of their wives when they observe your chaste conduct accompanied by fear caps for emphasis question christian ladies what exceptions are there to submitting to a saved or unsaved husband's god given headship in marriage please give appropriate scripture to support your view thanks in advance for your replies bless you the tone of some of the replies from professing christians certainly leaves a bit to be desired if you disagree with me or feel that i have conveniently quoted selectively fine however i feel that it would be an appropriate witness for professing christians to express their disagreement in love no incidentally there is nothing in the bible to suggest that a woman ought not to submit to her christian husband if he is failing to love her as christ loved the church and vice versa applies as christians we ought to obey these commands out of obedience to christ not as a response to our spouse's obedience no obedience to these commands both for men women is not conditional upon our partner's obedience heretic not a bad answer and from a non christian too searcher your answer proves that obedience to god's word always ultimately issues in blessing thank you my husband is not christian and i will respect him and stand behind his decisions but if he told me to deny jesus and kill or steal etc then that's where i would have to draw the line because that would mean that he would be trying to get me to renounce my belief therefore i will not disobey god to obey my husband and if he doesn't like it then he can leave and i will let him corinth but if the unbeliever leaves let him do so a believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances god has called us to live in peace Ten Commandments Sola fide Christian anarchism Homosexuality and Christianity Jehovah's Witnesses Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eastern Orthodox Church Roman Catholic Church Charles Grandison Finney Salvation Trinity Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Dispensationalism Mary, the mother of Jesus Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Marriage Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Martin Luther Christian views of women John Howard Yoder Predestination Church of Christ John Wycliffe Sharia Christianity Baptist John Wesley Calvinism Religion Women in Islam Anti-Mormonism Free will Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sabbath Jan Hus Paul of Tarsus Infant baptism Justification (theology) Same-sex marriage Articles of Religion (Methodist) Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) A Course In Miracles Baptism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Resurrection of Jesus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Papal Infallibility New Testament Religious pluralism Divine grace Apocrypha Holy Spirit Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Polygamy Lutheranism Jewish principles of faith Catholicism Christian views of Jesus Merit Fundamentalism Vestments controversy Heresy Old Testament Abrahamic religion Authorship of the Pauline epistles Bishop Separation of church and state Christianity and anti-Semitism Simone Weil Alan Campbell (pastor) Religious Society of Friends Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Mormonism and Christianity Biblical inerrancy Eucharist New Testament view on Jesus' life Great Apostasy Philipp Melanchthon Franciscan Biblical canon Community of Christ Blessed Virgin Mary Saint Peter Anglican views of homosexuality Pharisees Opus Dei Book of Isaiah Nontrinitarianism Celtic Christianity Scientology beliefs and practices Meaning of life
