do you believe the un will soon try to over throw world religion in attempts to attain peace i asked this question in the politics section and got good logical answers would like to see how the lovers of religion n any religion view this question very interesting just as i suspected asking this question got me exactly opposite answers than in the government section people that are more religous take a protective stance over this question and say it will not happen hmmmm i disagree i believe it will soon kdude im talking about organized religion not about people studying the bible in there backyard jr nice job kinda hard to explain that in one paragraph or less huh hehe iddybug very nice explanation i hope people take the time to read it i believe that they will try to do this soon because bible prophecy indicates this to be true rather than living up to their un commitment to settle their international disputes by peaceful means nations or whole blocs of nations have often resorted to war claiming that the matter was essentially within their domestic jurisdiction article since the un s formation twenty million persons have died in wars a mournful fact attesting to the cost of that failure nation against nation by thomas m franck in highly symbolic language the book of revelation describes the destruction of babylon the great at revelation we read the ten horns that you saw and the wild beast these will hate the harlot and will make her devastated and naked and will eat up her fleshy parts and will completely burn her with fire the ten horns symbolize all the political powers now on the world scene and that support the united nations the scarlet colored wild beast itself the image of the devil s bloodstained political system revelation according to bible prophecy the political powers associated with the united nations will turn against the world empire of false religion and devastate her all false religions will be affected some political systems have already shown their impatience with false religion s interference in political and social spheres some socialistic countries have taken a stand for atheism and have reduced religion to a virtual nonentity as in albania or to a compliant handmaiden as in russia and china elsewhere political rulers show strong resentment for the liberation theology of some catholic priests in poorer countries yet others repress religions that get involved in racial matters even in so called liberal countries some politicians resent clerical meddling in politics and social issues when we study the history of the worldwide empire of religion we can easily see why god the supreme judge has a basis for the execution of babylon the great yes in her was found the blood of prophets and of holy ones and of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth revelation false religion s complicity in regional and world wars has made her guilty in god s sight for the blood of all those who have been slaughtered on the earth according to the biblical indictment babylon the great has been judged worthy of destruction by reason of her historical record of spiritual fornication with world rulers her bloodguilt in wars and her spiritistic practices therefore god has judicially determined that babylon the great must be destroyed revelation it remains to be seen just what further issues will provoke the political elements worldwide to act against false religion but one thing is certain the execution of babylon the great by these elements will be not only their will but also the will of god revelation states god put it into their hearts to carry out his thought even to carry out their one thought by giving their kingdom to the wild beast until the words of god will have been accomplished also see jeremiah in the lord's prayer we say in part thy kingdom come it's only by this kingdom that peace worldwide can be established since no man has been able to do this Judaism Doctrines of
