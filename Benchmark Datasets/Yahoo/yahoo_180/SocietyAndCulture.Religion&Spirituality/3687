did you know that your pastor probably didn't write the sunday sermon himself there are organizations that write sermons and sell to pastors all over the country if you listen to several different pastors either your own on tv or the internet in any given week you will notice that a lot of them feature the same theme in the sermon i don't mean the same words just the same theme this is no coincidence or miracle i'm not just referring to holiday themes no point really except i think people have a right to know well yes i'm just finding that out and i must say i am disillusioned about some tv preachers they're still good tho hell that's better than the pastor my mother listens to he just discusses church gossip then tries to string in bible verses for meaning lol Alan Campbell (pastor) Church of Christ Religious Society of Friends Expository preaching Charles Taze Russell Jan Hus Minister of religion Bible William M.
