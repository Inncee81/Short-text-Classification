a question for jews i go to a congregational christian church which means we learn about other cultures and i just wanted to learn more about judaism what is it like god and stuff that u believe i dont believe that jesus was gods son etc and all about the crusifying stuff or w e so im not really christian i was just born into a christian family so im really interested in other religions i know about how jews dont believe in the new testament and how the bible is more than one book or w e we the jewish people believe that there is one god who is all powerful all knowing and all seeing we believe that god does not take physical form we believe that we are obligated to take care of others who are in need to take care of ourselves and be healthy and to take care of the physical world we believe in the laws of the torah genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy very orthodox jews view these rules as immuatable laws more liberal jews view the laws as a guide as to how we are to live our lives rather than a set of legalistic rules our book of scriptures is called the tanakh which encompasses the torah the prophets or nevi'im such as the books of isaiah ezekiel malachai etc and the writings or kethuvim such as ruth esther the song of solomon etc they're mostly the same books as christians consider to be the old testament the so called new testament is not a part of our beliefs in any way we strongly believe in debating what things really mean we love to discuss and argue although not in the sense of having an argument or being angry we believe that all righteous people have a place in the world to come not just jews and we don't believe you have to be a jew to be a good righteous decent person we accept converts but we do not seek them we do not proselytize or try to get people to become jewish we believe that if someone is intended to be jewish that he she will find their way to us we do not have a priesthood although once we did a rabbi is a spiritual leader but he is not a priest just a jewish person who is better trained in jewish literature and thought than the average jewish person any jewish person who is knowlegable may conduct services even marry two people although sometimes secular law requires someone ordained if you're interested there are some good books out there i highly recommend every person's guide to judaism by stephen j einstein and lydia kukoff another good resource is http www aish com thanks for asking God History of Christianity Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Clergy Jesus Trinity Noahide Laws Apocrypha Angel Heresy Kabbalah Septuagint Midrash Religion Deuteronomy Names of God in Judaism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Chosen people Paul of Tarsus Biblical inerrancy Homosexuality and Christianity Talmud Jews as a chosen people Demon Baptism Divine grace Shabbat Haredi Judaism Moses Legalism (theology) Missionary Miracle Schisms among the Jews Proselyte Predestination Holy Orders Historicity of Jesus Biblical studies Religious pluralism Ordination of women Torah im Derech Eretz Roman Catholic Church Religion and sexuality Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Kashrut Israelite Book of Daniel Christian views of women Original sin Joseph Soloveitchik Idolatry Brit milah New Testament Kuzari Divine Providence Articles of Religion (Methodist) Islam and Judaism Role of women in Judaism Book of Ezekiel
