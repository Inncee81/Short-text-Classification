what is christian tolerance is it being totally accepting of everything or are there limits beyond which you refuse to go i guess what i'm asking is this i want to know what the thresh hold is that will cause you to say this is far enough any further and i begin to compromise my faith and obedience to god at what point in being tolerant do you feel you've been too tolerant if at all my own view is that those who tolerate and accept everything value nothing am i right wrong why only serious and intelligent responses welcomed thank you so far i've received answers and i've given all thumbs up interesting very interesting answers so far i've received answers and i've given all thumbs up interesting very interesting answers sdw wow you are a person after my own heart for a moment there i thought i was reading me outstanding answer in every respect irish a very thoughtful and appreciated answer it does lend a marked sense of grace to the question does it not tuberoot thank you for your insightful response i've read your answers to many questions in r s and the reigning attribute in all of them is your obvious devotion to and love of god by the way i don't know who gave you that thumbs down or why but it was not me utuk your answer poses almost as many questions as the responses this question has received maybe more too bad there's not enough stay awake time left to explore them maybe later good answer too ozperp overall i agree with the premise of your answer however there are certain elements i would like to engage you in concwerning them but as i just told utuk there's not enough stay awake time left in my eyelids to adequately address them at this time good answer though thank you for your insight very interesting the cliche is love the sinner hate the sin tolerance these days has become its own religion it seems not only is everyone entitled to their own independent set of beliefs but everyone has to feel that everyone else's beliefs are equally valid and that truth is completely subjective to the individual the problem with that is that many faiths teach that among other things their faith is right and all others are wrong and they are supposed to try to convert others to their faith christianity falls into this category christians are considered intolerant because the teachings of their faith condemn certain behaviors what these people don't like to see is that they are in fact intolerant of the christi ans' fundamental beliefs tolerance in itself is the biggest hypocrisy personally i adamantly oppose tolerance i actually preach intolerance this is not because i don't think that people are entitled to their own opinion but i feel that our current state of tolerance is a cop out for the truth truth is real it is objective it is absolute and it is out there somewhere we don't need to all sit on our laurels being accepting of all beliefs doing that we are wasting valuable time that we could be working together to find the truth Theodicy Evil New Testament Summa Theologiae Religious pluralism Atheism Roman Catholic Church Charles Grandison Finney Socrates Predestination Justification (theology) Ten Commandments Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief The nature of God in Western theology Sin Abortion debate Cultural relativism Fundamentalism Sola fide Victor Cousin Salvation Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Great Apostasy Church of Christ Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Jehovah's Witnesses Simone Weil Jewish principles of faith A Course In Miracles John Wycliffe Sexual orientation Infant baptism Cult Creation-evolution controversy Goodness and value theory Religious Society of Friends Homosexuality and Christianity Divine grace Martin Luther Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Calvinism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Christianity Idolatry Islam School of Salamanca Religious conversion Christian eschatology John Wesley Trinity Christian anarchism Social justice Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Eucharist Intelligent design movement Friedrich Schleiermacher Judaism Reinhold Niebuhr Opus Dei George Fox Philosophy of language Abrahamic religion Revelation Slavoj __i__ek Philosophical skepticism Baptist John Howard Yoder Ethics Criticism of Mormonism Moral relativism Resurrection of Jesus Theology Gospel of Thomas Intelligent design Anti-Mormonism Mary, the mother of Jesus Jewish views of religious pluralism Infantilism Consciousness Heresy Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Philosophy
