what makes a saint a saint and who decides that weren't they sinners too what makes them so special what does some body have to do to become a saint how many saints are there hi and congrats on a very good question but i have to warn you that the truthful answer is gonna make me about as popular as a hair in a biscuit esspecially with the catholics and i know because i was brought up catholic anyway here goes you asked for it saint means set aside one i teach from the manuscripts and the description of a saint is nothing like what you think when satan rebelled he caused a great war all of us yes we were all created souls then responded in different ways to that war some followed satan many stayed neutral and didn't care as long as it didn't affect them and then there was a group who stood loyally on gods side right from the beginning and satan was defeated god could have just destroyed those who followed satan but he was not too happy with those who stayed neutral either so instead of destroying all those children a plan was devised for the redemption of them the plan was that the age would be destroyed not the earth not the terrafirma just the age changed and god brought in the second of the earth ages which is the flesh age where each soul would come thru one time born of woman with all memory of the past erased to make an ultimate decision of who they would follow christ or satan to make the plan work two things had to hold true first each soul must maintain freewill to make decisions without the interference of god in the individual life this is the answer to those who would ask why does god let bad things happen to good people its because he promised not to interfere second theres not much use in being able to choose between good and good so we needed a comparitor satan provides that comparitor in this flesh age his spirit roams around etc etc okay that was for background so you understand what i'm talking about back to the saints remember that group that i just told you about who remained stedfast on gods side and with god defeated satan well right after the war and before god changed the age and put adam and eve in the garden a couple of things happened first thing was satan was judged and condemned to death the reason he is still alive is only because remember we need him as a comparitor he will die soon enough the other thing that happened was that another trial was held but this was for those who stayed loyal to god during this trial god found them justified and named them his election now you remember the criteria for being one of the election you had to have stayed on gods side during that war with satan which was way way before adam and eve often in scripture the elect or election is called by another name what name s a i n t s or set aside ones set aside for what they assisted god in defeated satan last time and when satan comes as antichrist this time these elect or set aside ones will defeat him again thats what the elect are set aside to do in this generation these are those in mark who christ says will be delivered up before death just another of satans many names as a witness against him and as a testimony for the true christ thats what they are set aside to do in fact scripture describes these elect or saints as the only ones in human flesh who do not have free will they simply do not need it they are not here to make a decision between christ and satan they already proved to god whom they would choose so they do not need free will and god can interfere in their lives he moves them to ready them for what they are to do now how in the world can a church name a saint you tell me and how insulting must it be to god that any human would dare name one that person they name a saint on earth may have been the holiest person we ever heard of but they may have been one of those who followed satan in the war we do not know how can man impose on god to add to his list no man no pope no church can ever name anyone a saint i'll leave you to figure out just how happy god is gonna be with the whole bunch of them oh and to make it worse after they name a saint then they have the nerve to
