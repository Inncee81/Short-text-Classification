why should one listen to god about how to raise my children when he had to drown his own kids in the flood to the person who said satan created the flood um god himself says he is going to bring forth a flood if my son or daughter has sex before marriage should i then drown them because they have sinned that's the way god does it one can try to defend or justify god's actions but in the end it isn't just the flood story that places god in the wrong but the killing of all the first born children of egypt who were innocent and to many other examples of a god who in the end if he existed would need to ask for our forgiveness for creating satan and knowing what a stain he would be to god himself and humans alas some of you will continue with your illusions in the face of logic you have a very good point there Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theodicy Original sin God Summa Theologiae Genesis Sin Incarnations of Immortality Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Religion Infant baptism Sola fide Eastern Orthodox Church Deluge (mythology) Evil Satan Michael (archangel) Apostles' Creed Baptism Salvation Justification (theology) Problem of evil Fallen angel Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Capital punishment A Course In Miracles Grimke Sisters Noah Hell Satanism Theory of conduct Abortion debate Reincarnation Trinity Jesus Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Ten Commandments Maya mythology Creationism Moses Heaven Ra (board game) Dissociative identity disorder Goodness and value theory Herod the Great La Llorona Homosexuality and Judaism Adam and Eve Ex-gay Problem of Hell Demon Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Religious views of suicide Religion and sexuality S__ren Kierkegaard Japanese mythology Do the Handicapped Go To Hell?/Probably Ayyavazhi mythology Plagues of Egypt Value system Perseverance of the saints Ontological argument Insane Clown Posse Marriage Miracle John Howard Yoder Roman Catholic Church The Amber Spyglass Noah's Ark Soul Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Kuzari God the Father Ayya Vaikundar Charles Grandison Finney Flood geology Witch trial Book of Isaiah Cain Urantia Resurrection of Jesus Free will Jacob Karma in Hinduism LaVeyan Satanism Babylonian law Sexuality in Christian demonology Predestination Phaedo The Pilgrim's Progress Book of Job Virgin Mary in Islam Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Purgatory
