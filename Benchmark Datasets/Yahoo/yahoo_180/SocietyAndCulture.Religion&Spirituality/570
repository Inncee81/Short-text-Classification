what is the best memory that you have of church while growing up my dad is a pastor so there is quite a few i am a little too young to remember this incident but i have heard the story many times when my brother was just old enough to go to the bathroom by himself we had an evangelist come to the church the way the church is laid out there is the main sanctuary and the platform went way back on one side was a food pantry that led out to the main hall way and on the other was my dad's office now my brother had to go to the bathroom so he went out to the hall way were the bathrooms were at using the main exit not the pantry it was about fifteen minutes later and my parents were worried about him so just as my mom is getting up to go check on him my dad sees my brothers leg stick out from the pantry door on the platform a second later you see the rest of my brother wearing nothing but a smile my dad tells my mom honey go get your son my mom goes up to get him and he runs away from her darting to the other side of the platform everyone in the sanctuary sees him except the evangelist people begin to laugh and the evangelist doesn't understand why he is trying to preach holy ghost fire and people are laughing he finally turns around and when he realized why people were laughing he called the rest of the service off now is that the best memory i don't think so but it is the funniest i do remember having to sit in the main service because there wasn't a children's church sometimes i also remember as i got older and moving to a new church how great it was meeting new people and making new friends i remember then getting older and going to youth group and helping out in children's church i have some really good memories i don't think that i can pick a favourite god bless Piccolo Junior Saga Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story The Shining (film) Grandview, U.S.A.
