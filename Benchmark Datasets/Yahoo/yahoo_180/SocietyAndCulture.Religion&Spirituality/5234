is it possible that we may have chosen the life we have before we were born it seems quite possible to me that the soul wisdom selects its challenges to help with unfoldment but could this have started before birth this comes from a chap i know who's son suffers with schizophrenia the son says that when you die you have choices a go to heaven nirvana b return to earth c or you can go to the 'planning room' to design lives that will help souls to learn it is a really interesting view from the mouths of babes i have heard that schizophrenics are aware of themselves multi dimensionally but are out of alignment the energies are not flowing cleanly as it were and so therefore the discord anyway i am aware of the same options from a slightly different perspective but the planning room it is real and the main tool for the planning it is likened unto a computer think about that parallel all you ya'ers there are the designers and they assist the returners with their various options based on the issues who is available where etc then birth happens we go from the best of intentions and the best laid plans into bodies our intended looks change the plans change it all becomes abstracted as it has to pass through the judgments held within the soul soul as our anchor our portal to being here so those then are the karma's that create the challenging circumstances the buddha realized there are not enough austerities to be performed to be good enough as the dark night of the soul has no bottom so instead to walk the middle path to be light to accept self as simply good enough right now and whoosh suddenly self transcends time and you are free of said karma's they still exist in a sense but you are no longer at the effect of them brilliant child hope he gets the assist he needs to be in peace Reincarnation Soul Karma Bhagavad Gita Christian eschatology Heaven Hinduism Determinism Buddha Force (Star Wars) Theodicy Mahayana Karma in Hinduism Hell Sri Aurobindo Immortality A Course In Miracles Original sin Summa Theologiae Out-of-body experience Religion Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Dharma Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eastern Orthodox Church Jiddu Krishnamurti Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Rudolf Steiner Brahmanism Samadhi Kain (Legacy of Kain) Anchor Guru Bible and reincarnation Phaedo Ken Wilber Pratitya-samutpada Incarnations of Immortality Neo (The Matrix) Time travel Hindu philosophy New Age Yin Shun Sin The Matrix Sant Thakar Singh Digital World Book of Isaiah Buddhist philosophy Gautama Buddha Moral objectivism Psychoanalysis Goodness and value theory S__ren Kierkegaard Stereoscopy Duties of the Heart Stage lighting Predestination Merit Yoga Wheel of life Evolutionary creationism Free will Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ayya Vaikundar Pysanka Phoebe Halliwell Nightmare (Soul Calibur) Meditation Rebirth (Buddhism) Human nature Nirvana Sutra Reiki Origin belief Advaita Vedanta Moksha Samael Aun Weor Ethics Idolatry The Death Gate Cycle Legacy of Kain Sant Mat Oxford English Dictionary MP3 Religious Society of Friends Lord of Light Sikhism primary beliefs and principles General relativity Religious views of suicide
