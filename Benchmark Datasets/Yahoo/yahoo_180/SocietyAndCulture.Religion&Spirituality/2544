can you be addicted to religion christianity my childhood best friend became a born again christian just before he got married he got a good job he and his wife had a couple of kids bought a big house and they joined the local country club with their renewed faith life seemed pretty good but as the years have worn on his faith became more and more of a priority in his life to where i stopped seeing him socially eventually he dropped out of the country club and more recently he quit his job to become a student at a baptist seminary i could never bring myself to criticize him for his faith despite my personal feelings about it because it made him so happy but this ongoing trend has me scratching my head wondering if this source of hapiness hasn't taken him a step too far absolutely if you really believe in the reality of the christian god then you have a responsibility to do the will of god and seek his way for your life reading the bible will lead you to the realization that following the tenants of jesus requires you to give up on material things like homes jobs cars etc and preach the good news about christ just like the disciples christianity leads honest followers to ruin almost every time only christians who are not willing to give up on material wealth and worldly happiness can survive and it is a direct result of ignoring jesus' teachings Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religion Eastern Orthodox Church Christianity Evangelicalism Calvinism John Howard Yoder Restorationism Sabbath Urantia John the Baptist Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Intelligent design movement Evil Paul of Tarsus Charles Grandison Finney Sola fide Jesus Soul Religious Society of Friends Eucharist Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Divine grace Ten Commandments Holy Spirit Great Apostasy Summa Theologiae Christianity and anti-Semitism Fundamentalism Liberal Christianity Heaven The Pilgrim's Progress Roman Catholic Church Religious pluralism United Church of Christ Baptist God Iglesia ni Cristo Catechism Resurrection of Jesus Christian-Jewish reconciliation Dispensationalism New Testament Church of Christ, Scientist Creationism Nation of Islam Sikhism Gospel of Thomas Mary, the mother of Jesus Christian views of Jesus Religious conversion Biblical canon John Wycliffe Sin Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Salvation Theology Mormonism and Christianity Gospel George Fox Separation of church and state Anglicanism Rich Mullins Christian anarchism Cultural and historical background of Jesus Fasting Pharisees Mission (Christian) Friedrich Schleiermacher Messianic Judaism Rick Warren Gospel of John Origen Christian New Testament view on Jesus' life Justification (theology) Jehovah's Witnesses Original sin Religious perspectives on Jesus Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod Unification Church Buddhism Christian apologetics Historicity of Jesus Unitarianism Mormonism
