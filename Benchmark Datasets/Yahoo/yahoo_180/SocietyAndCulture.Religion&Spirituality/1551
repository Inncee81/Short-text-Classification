why is animal sacrifice okay i think that an animal has every right to live just like a human does yes animals are food i eat meat but when they're sacrificed they aren't killed humanely usually it's a slow death by knife either you kill it as quickly and humanely as you can for food or you kill it defending yourself not sacrificing it to some god or goddess that is cruel enough to demand blood is there something that i'm missing isn't that animal abuse do any religions still practice this if so which ones and can anyone tell me why people think it's okay to sacrifice an animal here are some pics from the 's these animals were not killed in a quick painless way http www galenfrysinger com nepal sacrifice htm i won't attack any one religion as many religions have practiced this throughout the ages this is just one page of pics cheez actually no not at all i'm agnostic pagan i've never seen a pagan do anything but be kind to animals nicole satanists the church of satan ones at least aren't allowed to hurt animals it's in their commandments and voodoo practitioners don't sacrifice animals but do have large feasts instead to honor their lwa only a few people that are eerie non mainstream fanatics of these religions do eerie huh hm yeah i think a chicken is just the same as a cow or anything else when i was a kid i had two chickens as pets i can't see sacrificing the poor things now i'll have to look that up a bit more animals are relevant in this world yes they are also living things that needs to be cared yes again but they usually use animals as sacrificial offerings because they are considered purer than human during the offering ceremony the way they kill quick killing that animal is for the animal not to feel much pain for the person conducting the said act won't feel much guilt lastly i think that is the effective procedure for the success of the said sacrificial offering Sacrifice Religion Voodoo Human sacrifice Korban 613 mitzvot Aztec Cat Chicken Historical persecution by Christians God Eucharist Animal rights Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Sharia Zoophilia Noahide Laws LaVeyan Satanism Kosher foods Theory of conduct Vegetarianism Animism Christianity Evil Taboo food and drink Vegetarianism and religion Fundamentalism Egg (food) Reincarnation Saint Sin Tenshinhan Persecution of Ancient Greek religion Exorcism Buddhism Wicca Brahmanism Unclean animals Magic and religion Magic (paranormal) Bl__t Sabbath Culture of Haiti Hell Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Amber Spyglass Witch-hunt Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Kyle Broflovski Whaling Animal testing Satanism Prayer Satan Paganism Articles of Religion (Methodist) Hera Torture Blood (computer game) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Great Apostasy Cannibalism Magical thinking Blood libel Goat Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ancient Greek religion Veganism Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Halaal Theology Demon Dissociative identity disorder Germanic paganism Domestic rabbit Vedic civilization Margaret Murray Bullfighting Hecate Jewish cuisine Hinduism Religious conversion Hunting Capital punishment Witch trial Shark Criticisms of Christianity Religious pluralism Neopaganism Rich Mullins Judaism Idolatry
