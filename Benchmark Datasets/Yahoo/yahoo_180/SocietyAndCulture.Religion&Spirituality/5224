anger at a religion is it a turmoil of conscience i've been thinking about conscience a lot lately i think i need to clear some definitions up first though conscience is your inner conception of what is right and wrong developed as a result of what you were taught as a child your personal moral reliasations as a teenager life experience which altered and spiritual revelations that changed your mind something else i haven't thought of yet consciousness is self awareness i'm not really asking about that here i'm talking about conscience inner moral compass people who are angry against a religion that they have left and who actively try to pull down the faith of people who still believe in that religion are they doing this in an unconscious attempt to break down the moral conditioning which they now reject would it help them more to find their inner peace if they turned inwards to reconstruct their own consciences to wholeness rather than trying to obliterate the outward religion thanks everyone i realise that some people leave religion for consciencious reasons ie truly believe something different and are fully at peace with their decision i see now also that the anger frustration might be against the interference of people rather than the accusations of inner conscience aurura dawn i accept that people arrive at different beliefs to mine through an honest consciencious process thank you for explaining your feelings and perceptions with such clarity your words made me realise that missionary zeal to share our perception of truth is something that all people feel when they have come to their place of inner peace norrispenguin i love your response thanks jeffyb i agree evangelicals and ex whateverists both have an equal right to tear down other people's beliefs none i can see that there would be quite a bit of backlash against evangelicals who resort to guilt and fear tactics to control other people in some cases the anger is related to struggles for power perhaps those who are angry at religion feel that the religion has taken their power away and they are struggling to find their own empowerment again hence anger thanks i hadn't thought of that lol twinsma and marbledog i love your answers too twinsma your answer helped me to understand a bit more marbledog i agree with you cobradene oh so true i think that would be true in some cases for people who leave their religion for those reasons remember though that there are a million and one different reasons why people leave a religion and then try to show others what they have learned kind of like missionary work but in reverse and so your theory although very valid and well thought out would only apply to a select few Religion Coercion Scientology beliefs and practices Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity God Jewish principles of faith Friedrich Schleiermacher Conscience Theory of conduct Supernatural Psychology of religion Consciousness Atheism Mind control Simone Weil Evil Baptist S__ren Kierkegaard Sigmund Freud Neuro-linguistic programming Moral objectivism Narcissism Christianity Sin Epistemology Homophobia Meaning of life Brainwashing Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Sexual orientation New Age Salvation Abortion debate Fundamentalism Milton H.
