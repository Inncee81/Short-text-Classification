what is m theory in physics m theory sometimes also called u theory is a proposed master theory that unifies the five superstring theories in the early s it was shown that the various superstring theories were related by dualities which allow physicists to relate the description of an object in one super string theory to the description of a different object in another super string theory these relationships imply that each of the super string theories is a different aspect of a single underlying theory proposed by witten and named m theory M-theory String theory Superstring theory M-theory (simplified) Physics Supersymmetry Supergravity Heterotic string Quantum mechanics Particle physics Edward Witten Category theory D-brane Brian Greene Theory of everything Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Hidden variable theory Wave-particle duality Kaluza-Klein theory Maxwell's equations Unified field theory Michio Kaku Light Physical cosmology Multiverse Sociology Adjoint functors Fundamental interaction Quantum mind Grand unification theory Scientific consensus Psychometrics Numerology Philosophy of mathematics Spacetime Electron Database Gauge theory Quantum gravity Atomism Kolmogorov complexity Music theory Equivalence of categories Burkhard Heim Gravity History of science Why 10 dimensions?
