am i delusional i believe in a creator i define the creator as the first cause though by first cause i attribute no qualities at all to that 'god' i might as well just call it the big bang and have done with it the big bang was responsible for the 'creation' of space and time anything before the big bang is not subject to before the first cause physical laws etc the singularity in where the big bang came from which is already unbounded by space and time this creator of mine have plenty of scientific evidence from the hubble constant to the cosmic microwave background to deuce cause and effect does not apply on the quantum level these infinite values cause most physical equations including those of einstein's general relativity to stop working at a singularity no i would love to know more about it i have to admit though you would have to express it in a language this simple girl from texas will understand scientist i am not first cause i am going to look it up now a basic explanation might go something like this consider some event in the universe whatever event you choose it will be the result of some cause or more likely a very complex set of causes each of those causes would be the result of some other set of causes which are in turn a result of yet other causes thus there is an enormous chain of events in the universe with the earlier events causing the later events and either this chain of events has a beginning or it does not currently the theory of the cosmological history of the universe most widely accepted by astronomers and astrophysicists includes an apparent first event the big bang the expansion of all known matter and energy from a superdense singularity or singular point at some finite time in the past though contemporary versions of the cosmological argument most typically assume that there was a beginning to the cosmic chain of physical or natural causes the early formulations of the argument did not have the benefit of this degree of theoretical insight into the apparent origins of the cosmos the big bang theory however does not address the issue of the origin of the primordial singularity so it does not address the issue of a 'first cause' in an absolute sense plato's demiurge and aristotle's prime mover each referred to a being who they speculated set in motion an already existing stuff of the cosmos a millennium and a half later aquinas went on to argue that there is an uncaused cause which is just another name for god and to aquinas it remained logically possible that the universe has already existed for an infinite amount of time and will continue to exist for an infinite amount of time in his classic summa theologiae he posited that even if the universe has always existed a notion that he rejected on other grounds there is still the question of cause or even of first cause Cosmic microwave background radiation Summa Theologiae Human Atomism Quantum mechanics Hubble's law Timeline of cosmology God Philosophy Physical paradox Entropy Time travel Plasma cosmology Creationism Causality Existence Astronomy History of science Scientific method Many-worlds interpretation Logic Existence of God History of physics Bah__'__ Faith and Science Dark matter Fred Hoyle Supernatural Teleological argument Philosophy of language Science String theory Special relativity Atheism Big Bang nucleosynthesis Cosmic inflation Philosophy of space and time Gravitational singularity Creation-evolution controversy Sociocultural evolution Big Crunch Free will Time Theory of everything Dynamical system Mathematics Fine-tuned universe Species Doomsday argument Mathematics of general relativity Einstein's field equation Astrophysics Occam's Razor Tests of general relativity Philosophy of mathematics Western philosophy Timeline of the Big Bang Meaning of life Extraterrestrial life Manifold Creation science Luminiferous aether Albert Einstein Anthropic principle Steady state theory Quantum gravity Hilbert space Zeno's paradoxes Edwin Hubble Metaphysics Path integral formulation Thomism
