if jesus is the only way why was the christian god so short sighted the bible states everyone knows of god via natureand the world and all that is required is to accept there is a god to get into heaven so accepting this as absolute why would the christian god then send down it's son and then make it the only way to get into heaven why change the rules midstream and screw over people who may have been doing what they were supposed to or were they grandfathered in via the old laws the people who existed before the rules were written and given to moses didn't have rules to follow so they only had to believe in a god surprises me no one who answered this question realized this jesus could only come at a cirtain time in history so that he could be condemned by jewish law and killed under the roman practice of crucifixion i don't understand it all either but i decided it's best to trust the creator that he knows what has to be done to save his creations what people were doing before is fine because they were doing what god told them according to their ability and thier knowledge responsibility only comes when you know something and have been taught what to do and not to do concerning it jesus' sacrifice shows that you can be blameless from what has happened contrary to god's will in the past because jesus accepted the consequences of sin for us however this world isn't easy for anyone we should not make it worse for ourselves or eachother by being condemning but encouraging afterall jesus was condemned already the reason why people say that jesus is the only way to god the father heaven is because when the father came and showed us the way he wanted us to live through jesus so we could understand he was the creator therefore he was the way and the path itself to truth and life if there is only one creator there is only one path to him all the other paths merge into the path to god but a person can only go there if they can accept going there Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Free will Justification (theology) Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an A Course In Miracles Jesus Original sin Resurrection of Jesus God Ten Commandments Religion Sola fide Eastern Orthodox Church Christianity Predestination Roman Catholic Church Sin Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Judaism Sabbath Religious pluralism New Testament Creationism Abrahamic religion Religious perspectives on Jesus Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Pharisees Cultural and historical background of Jesus Book of Mormon Nontrinitarianism Mary, the mother of Jesus Summa Theologiae Revelation Theory of conduct Christian eschatology Holy Spirit Baptism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Christian views of Jesus Supernatural Religious conversion Young Earth creationism Church of Christ Theodicy Jewish principles of faith Jewish Messiah New Testament view on Jesus' life Merit Great Apostasy Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Calvinism Urantia Genesis Historical Jesus Mormonism Justin Martyr Gospel of Barnabas Christianity and anti-Semitism Sacrifice Prophet History of Christianity Religious views of suicide Homosexuality and Christianity Jewish views of religious pluralism Heresy Halakha Gospel of Thomas Idolatry Chosen people Noah John Howard Yoder Infant baptism Separation of church and state Origin belief Angel Charles Grandison Finney Miracle Gospel of John God Emperor of Dune Christian apologetics Catechism Criticism of Mormonism Abraham Meaning of life Soul Book of Isaiah Mormonism and Christianity Fundamentalism Capital punishment Mormonism and Judaism Gnosticism Satanism The nature of God in Western theology Mirza Ghulam Ahmad
