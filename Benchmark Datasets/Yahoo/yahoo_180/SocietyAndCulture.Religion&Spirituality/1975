non moral relatavists by what maxim do you live by for me increase actual and potential happiness of all affected around me and decrease all actual and potential suffering of all affected around me ambiguous but it works well nonetheless my own happiness would matter and it would be equal to that of another furthermore sending anyone my livelihood would cause a greater decrease in my own happiness than it would cause an increase in your own and also incapacitate me from being able to increase the happiness of others in the future if i die from starvation a pedophile would cause much more harm to others than he would happiness therefore making that null and void it sounds simple but calls for foresight and context for it to work that is a contradictory maxim a pedophiles happiness depends on an innocents suffering so without morals which do you please edit a pedophile would cause much more harm to others than he would happiness therefore making that null and void probably but are you truly basing your decision that pedophilia is wrong on the basis of the statistics that indicate these children grow up to have severe emotional problem or on the basis of the moral revulsion you feel for pedophiles lets take a more ambiguous issue veganism we know it's better for health and the environment which would reduce human suffering and we know it reduces the actual and potential suffering of animals but if we eliminated the consumption of meat from our lives hundreds of millions of people would be adversely affected by the loss of ranches loss of jobs in the industry and all the associated industries from fast food joints to marketing agencies human life is not a black and white matter whenever some thing gains some other thing else loses you can't beat entropy in order for some things to prosper and live other things must suffer and die a true non moral relativist would probably advocate something like mr spock did in star trek ii the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few but human beings will never adopt a doctrine like this because we are not machines Abortion debate Peter Singer Utilitarianism Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Ethics Animal rights Famine Microeconomics Childlove movement Social justice Vegetarianism Inflation Sexual orientation Human Economic inequality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dieting Domestic violence Capitalism Anorexia nervosa Drug abuse Dairy Global warming and agriculture Religion Free trade Cancer Model (economics) Tariff Sant Thakar Singh Spanking Relativism Theodicy Capital accumulation Objectivist philosophy Simone Weil Child sexual abuse Overpopulation Derek Parfit Evil Extinction Intelligence quotient Bernard Williams Entropy Merit Infantilism Clinical depression Happiness Animal testing Food Political economy Altruism Gerrymandering Dissociative identity disorder Liberalism Veganism Meme Supply and demand Cultural relativism FairTax Addiction Labour economics Moral relativism Child pornography Chronic fatigue syndrome Breastfeeding Atkins Nutritional Approach C programming language Oil depletion Criticism of libertarianism Consensual crime Future energy development M16 (rifle) Black hole Religion and sexual orientation Policy Debate Immortality Kyoto Protocol Energy economics Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Human sexual behavior Unemployment David Hume Worldwide green parties Alignment (role-playing games) Ecology Genetically modified food Effects of global warming
