how many christians have actually read the webpage about god not healing amputees http www whydoesgodhateamputees com god htm i am not talking about reading the first couple of paragraphs or skimming over it i am talking about sitting down and actually taking the time to read the entire page how many christians have actually done this for those who have not i am not interested in your responses right now please save them for later i am only interested in hearing from the christians who have read the entire thing cresha b you are right you do not have to read anything suggested by anyone else if you choose to read only the bible that is your right however if you wish to engage in religious discussions with any level of intelligence it only makes sense to view other sources if for no other reason outside references i am curious though do you know how the bible went from being a bunch of random books to one big book compiled of several different books if you do not know that how do you know the bible is the word of god some books may have been left out or some may have been included that shouldn't have been the bible didn't fall from the sky one day as a complete package from god it was pieced together by men how and why did this piecing together take place before you can say you know the bible is true you must first have a clear understanding of its origin so you know that it is a credible source any book can claim to be the word of god you must verify the claims pastorart yet again you pester me with your silly thoughts no i did not right it so your suspicions are incorrect had i written it it probably would have been not as polite and neutral sounding why would i suggest you read something that i didn't write i shall answer that with another question why should i read the bible if you didn't write it christians ask me to read the bible all the time i have read it cover to cover some parts as many as times it is too bad christians refuse to read the material which questions their beliefs especially when the people they argue with are usually willing to read whatever material the christian provides what a sure sign of a closed mind sad indeed well after reading your question i went in and read the article you can now count at least one christian who has read the article since you did not ask for opinions or thoughts on the subject i will refrain from elaborating you asked two questions and got two answers from me thanks for asking and have a nice day Intelligent design A Course In Miracles Creationism Book of Mormon Church of Christ, Scientist Intelligent design movement The nature of God in Western theology Supernatural Bible Soul Biblical inerrancy Meaning of life Infant baptism New Testament Theology Prayer Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Free will Historicity of Jesus Theory of conduct Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Theodicy Resurrection of Jesus Biblical canon Socrates Jewish principles of faith Wedge strategy Creation according to Genesis Existence of God Transcendental argument for the existence of God Ten Commandments John Wycliffe Qur'an Creation-evolution controversy God Fundamentalism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Scientology beliefs and practices Teach the Controversy Predestination Homosexuality and Christianity End times Charles Darwin's views on religion Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Idolatry Deconstruction Jewish views of religious pluralism Evolutionary creationism Gospel of John God and gender Urantia Gospel of Mark Agnosticism Apocrypha Tetragrammaton David Hume Young Earth creationism Expository preaching Sexual orientation Cultural and historical background of Jesus Devil Creation science Witchcraft Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Epistemology Religious Society of Friends Origin belief Alan Campbell (pastor) Apologetics Trinity Sant Mat Nation of Islam Phillip E.
