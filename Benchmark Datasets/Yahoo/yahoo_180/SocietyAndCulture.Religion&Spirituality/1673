why bible fundies don't you respect a person's choice in becoming catholic everytime you hear a person wanting to convert to catholicism you always fill in that person with lies and personal biases against the church don't you respect people's right to choose if the church is false let them find out for themselves and let them sort it out why do you think you know better jlcrit just because you don't understand what catholicism is all about when you were a cradle catholic doesn't make you a valid witness against the church your opinion is irrelevant just like the rest of the people like you jlcrit by the way it's not the church's fault if you understood its teachings and dogmas the wrong way again your opinion and your biases are irrelevant you're a disgrace to the catholic church sorry i'm just voicing out my opinion just like you do wanzanna if you want to be corrected make an indepth research about catholicism and the catholic catechism but of course ignorance is bliss so i won't suggest any further study for you after all it's your choice to stay in ignorance jeremiahrootsr oh so you're enlightened you think your path is the right path what made you think so for your own convenience ridiculous terisina do you think i'm not aware of the inquisition did it happen all over the world talk about history and education it seems like you lack the knowledge wanzanna i hate cut and past so don't be lazy and study that religion if you really want to be corrected they are so insecure with their beliefs that they can not stand thinking that someone might find a better way this is also the same reason they spend every waking minute of their lives trying to convert others using slander and propaganda to discredit other religions no wanzanna but since you have never been catholic and most likely have never studied catholicism you should keep your mouth shut i just answered a question on the catholic faith and every single fundamentalist used it as an excuse to try and convert him even though he specifically said in his question not to do this so either fundamentalists are illiterate or incapable of respecting other people's wishes Religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Christianity Jewish principles of faith New Testament Religious conversion Opus Dei Evolutionary creationism Satanism Trinity Supernatural Abrahamic religion John Wycliffe Homosexuality and Christianity Buddhism Existence of God Deconstruction Atheism Traditionalist Catholic Religious pluralism Philipp Melanchthon Soul Christian eschatology Intelligent design Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Church of Christ Meaning of life Ten Commandments Creationism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Anti-Mormonism Heresy Sexual orientation Religion and sexual orientation Catechism Fundamentalism Cult Separation of church and state Second Vatican Council Baptism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Scientific method Abington School District v.
