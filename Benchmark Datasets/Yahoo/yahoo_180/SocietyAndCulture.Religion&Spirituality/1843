how can atheism not be an ideology i mean sure no one believes in gremlins so technically we re all agremlinists but not believing in gremlins is not an ideology but only because the concept of believing in gremlins is absurd the concept of believing in a god or gods is not considered absurd in fact it s considered the norm people who choose not to believe are considered eccentric so whilst there s a theist majority the opposite of theism becomes an alternative just like hot and cold water are opposites of the same medium ok i guess if you want to allow theist to dictate terminology you are correct but remember that it wasn't too long ago when theists called minorities less than human so just because a majority attempts to interpret other beliefs in a certain light doesn't mean they are correct or that their terminology is correct atheism is really a denial of beliefs that are not supported with tangible evidence that is not really an ideology but acceptance of reality as we know it Atheism Supernatural Existence of God Strong atheism God Theodicy Theism The nature of God in Western theology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Origin belief Intelligent design Jewish principles of faith Religion Young Earth creationism Agnosticism Antony Flew Creation science Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Open Theism A Course In Miracles Belief Falsifiability Nontheism Sexual orientation Monotheism Creation-evolution controversy Problem of Hell Conservative Judaism Creationism Problem of evil Fundamentalism Secularism Deconstruction Coercion Biblical inerrancy Theistic realism Postmodernism Deism Reconstructionist Judaism Panendeism Argument from morality Epistemology Scientific method Transsexuality Historical revisionism (political) New Testament Philosophy of religion Jews as a chosen people Simone Weil Karl Marx Nihilism Pantheism Naturalistic Pantheism David Hume Heresy Predestination Discordianism Reincarnation Christian apologetics Deity Reality Islam as a political movement Intelligent design movement Sola fide Patriotism Apostasy in Islam Hell Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Atomism Teleological argument Philosophy of mathematics Surplus product Human Theory Religious conversion Christianity Weak agnosticism French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Religious pluralism Free will Luminiferous aether Separation of church and state Trinity Political economy Abrahamic religion Anarcho-capitalism Pascal's Wager Scientology beliefs and practices Holocaust denial Bah__'__ Faith and Science Libertarian socialism Anti-communism Hindu philosophy Great Apostasy Church of Christ
