help i don't know how to believe in anymore also for god did a lot of people believe in him at one time does evolution and god go together and what about the contridictions in the beginning of evolution there was the colliding or the planets but then what happened before that in another sense god created the stuff in seven days but then what happened before that i am just to much stuck in the middle both make sense but they both contridict too much although since i was raised in a christian setting why is there so many believes under it why is there so many believes under it how do i know if it's right or wrong i like being right not wrong will god still love me what happens if my believe is wrong will god get angry at me or do anything how do i know if the athiests are correct the problem is just is what if there is hell i don't want to burn up i just want to do things right what if what i believe in is wrong how do athiests or yourself know that you correct about not being a god heaven or hell then what happens next but mmoynan it says in the bible that if you don't believe in god you'll be sent to hell i am more christian but i want to do what is right and i do believe in a bit of evolution myself your main problem is not really evolution vs creation both are theories i believe in creation because it is what the bible teaches but evolution is just a theory i don't know what so many believers are under you said that you are trying to do right believe correctly and you wonder if god will still love you nobody is perfect so you will never be able to do enough right to go to heaven if you were raised as a christian you know that the bible says that we can't get to heaven on any of our works because god wants perfection and we miss that mark sin jesus died to pay the penalty for our sins but also to break the power of sin in our lives he will come to live inside us and change us to be more like him if you know he is inside of you if you know that the holy spirit is inside you then you will not need to be concerned with hell i know there are plenty of atheists out there who do not believe because they are constantly writing in this forum they can cause doubts but do not listen to anybody else believer atheist or person from any other religion everybody believes what they want to believe i was once like you raised in the church but influenced by others to doubt i was always taught that if i wanted to be closer to god i needed to read his word read his word pray to him jeremiah says you will call to me and come and pray to me and i will listen to you you will seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart atheists tell you what they believe since they believe it to them it is true i'm telling you what i believe is true and what i know has worked in my life but as long as you listen to all these other voices mine included you'll be confused stick to god's voice don't listen to any others try him test him read his word see if he keeps it and make up your own mind when i listen to too many voices i can be very indecisive also if you read and believe the bible figure out in yourself why you believe it is harder to be knocked for a loop if we know what we believe and why we believe it but it sounds as though you want to believe in christ so check him out God Eastern Orthodox Church Ten Commandments Religion Charles Grandison Finney Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theodicy Church of Christ, Scientist Creationism Evolutionary creationism Soul Trinity Justification (theology) Book of Mormon Abrahamic religion Baptism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Roman Catholic Church Religious Society of Friends Church of Christ Spiritism Christianity Calvinism Hell New Testament Holy Spirit Merit Prophet Nontrinitarianism John Howard Yoder Angel Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Jesus Gospel of Thomas Original sin Simone Weil Devil Biblical inerrancy Book of Isaiah Dispensationalism Sola fide Divine grace Resurrection of Jesus Atheism Immortality Philo Summa Theologiae John the Baptist Emanuel Swedenborg Young Earth creationism Religious conversion Teach the Controversy Fundamentalism Indulgence Sant Thakar Singh Mary, the mother of Jesus Free will Opus Dei Afterlife Intelligent design Binitarianism Supernatural C.
