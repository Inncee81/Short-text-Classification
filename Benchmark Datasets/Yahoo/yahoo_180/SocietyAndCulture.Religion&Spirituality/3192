i'm an atheist looking for a miracle do you think it will happen i'm not looking for a major miracle mind you at least nothing like raising the dead or ending the war in iraq no the miracle i want is to have one day without seeing all of the bashing posts the fundamentalists put up about atheists now before everyone says but it goes two ways atheists always say this and that about christians let me point out something we atheists do point out that fundamentalist christians are narrow minded and judgemental and some say it with less tact than others however the thing that is most aggravating about the fundamentalist's posts is that they tell us we are going to be tortured for eternity i find it most insulting that they have the arrogance of assuming that we deserve such punishment now it could just be me but i think this attitude of oh you'll pay i'll be glad to see it is a bit worse than what i've seen atheists post about fundamentalists anyway anybody think i'll see this miracle any time soon dr g jeanielunchbox alia i agree darth i've never understood how it is that they rationalize attacking other denominations of christianity either darth kerilyn love ya sweetheart i have to agree with you its terrible here and i as a christian even get reprimanded by some of those people strange i thought this was a free country and you could believe anything you wanted but it seems here lately some think they know better and this needs to stop alot of people are getting hurt here because of these people they need to back off i will believe as i wish and i will act how i want to no matter if certain people here like it or not you have no right to judge me or anyone else Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religion Atheism Supernatural A Course In Miracles Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Afterlife Sin The nature of God in Western theology Immortality Christianity Miracle Theory of conduct Agnosticism Summa Theologiae Existence of God Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Pledge of Allegiance Simone Weil God Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Salvation John the Baptist Soul History of Christianity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jewish Messiah Resurrection of Jesus Moral objectivism Ten Commandments Alcoholics Anonymous Historical persecution by Christians Hell Church of Christ Infantilism David Hume Abrahamic religion Merit Persecution of Christians Divine Providence Homosexuality and Christianity Freedom of speech Scenes from a Memory Creationism Apologetics Religious conversion Utilitarianism Free will Bertrand Russell Angel Predestination Islam Qiyamah Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Liberal Christianity Jewish philosophy End times Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Darth Revan Religious pluralism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Coercion Fundamentalism Phillip E.
