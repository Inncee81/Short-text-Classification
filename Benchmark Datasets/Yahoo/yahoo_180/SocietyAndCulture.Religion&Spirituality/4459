i must not ask very good questions so why doesn't anyone answer them i am new here my questions are honest i need some answers too i have yet to see an honest question in r s fall to the wayside perhaps you could add an example or two of what you've been asking that would make the answer to this question possible that being said there are a couple of possibilities the first is that you express them in such a way that it is unclear what you are asking an example would be this christian stylists we wonder what they style clothing swimming pools and what the question implies are they money hounds pedophiles inventors of hairdos so we sigh and move on another question to avoid is one that is just plain stupid christians are you breathing right now that's just nincompoopery why bother so your question this time is actually provocative yet unclear and therefore impossible to accurately answer give some examples Alignment (role-playing games) Little Britain Lie Immortality Singlish Joke Irony The nature of God in Western theology English grammar Biblical inerrancy Justification (theology) Epistemology Supernatural Pi Sola fide G__del's incompleteness theorem Ethics Atheism Extreme Programming Contract Infant baptism Jumpstart 3rd Grade Modal logic Nudity Crossword Theory of conduct IP (complexity) The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything Resurrection of Jesus Jeopardy!
