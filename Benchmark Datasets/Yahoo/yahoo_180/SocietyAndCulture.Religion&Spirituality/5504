are you for abortion do you not know that it is murder everyone likes to throw in that what if you were raped what if you were going to die what if something is wrong with the baby who would take care of your kids its not murder because it hasn't been born yet well i hope someday your eyes will be opened if something like that was to happen i would have faith in my lord that whatever happened would be his will i am sure it would be hard for alot of you to believe but i would not have an abortion even if the doctors said i would die my life and my baby's life is truely in gods hand's not the dr's yes they could save me but only because of the ablilty god gave them and i have had to make the choice of having an abortion i could have been crippled for life i kept my baby and she is one of the most beauitful wonderful gifts from god and i am not crippled thank you lord yes it's murder those that say it's not really a human being where do you get your information even the supreme court could not say it was or was not a human being the legality of abortion is decided on the fact that a women has a right to privacy and nothing more this is why pro life supporters sometimes shock people with the pictures of the aborted fetus guess what it looks like a human being fingers eyes toes arms legs yup it's a baby at the precise and unique moment of conception a woman is 'pregnant' with a new individual this is an accurate and informed medical description it is the same terminology used by prof john dwyer pre eminent australian aids expert and researcher who has described the moment that the sperm enters the ovum as the creation of a new and unique individual well known medical writer professor derek llewellyn jones author of everywoman has also written that when the male genetic material from the sperm joins with the female genetic material in the ovum a new individual is formed it's a new individual even in scientific terms most contraceptives used today are not really contraceptives but are abortifacients they do not always stop ovulation sometimes fertilization occurs but the embryo cannot implant into the wall of the uterus and it's expelled from the body hence an abortion the correct term to describe any interference with the pregnancy after conception has occurred is abortifacient this is the precise biological description for any drug or device that acts to end a pregnancy once it has begun at conception http www pfli org faq oc html the truth is that pregnancy happens when sex works the way it's supposed to our society has gotten the idea that we should be able to have sex without the problem of pregnancy and children but this goes against nature and against god pregnancy is not an accident of sex it is the purpose of sex contraception and abortion has given us the idea that sex is for pleasure and maybe children one day i used to be pro choice adamantly pro choice i thought every woman should have the right to live their lives without unwanted children i saw this as a way to equalize men and women men could have sex and it didn't affect their career or lifestyle why should women have to be burdened it makes me sick to think i was that blind the point is that when you have sex you should always consider pregnancy it is a natural consequence of sex so don't have sex if you are not willing to have a child with that person don't have sex if you cannot afford to bring a child into the world abortion is not the answer abstinence is Fertility awareness Religion and abortion Twin Sexual abstinence Childbirth Menstrual cycle Sex education Roe v.
