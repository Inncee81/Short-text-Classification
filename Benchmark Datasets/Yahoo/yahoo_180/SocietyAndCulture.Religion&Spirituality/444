if a sinner was to die before the end of the world is he judged immediately after death or he has to wait i mean wait for everyone else hope the question is clear he goes to the holding tank of hell or hades or sheol and waits for the resurrection of the damned revelation then i saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it from his presence earth and sky fled away and no place was found for them and i saw the dead great and small standing before the throne and books were opened then another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged by what was written in the books according to what they had done and the sea gave up the dead who were in it death and hades gave up the dead who were in them and they were judged each one of them according to what they had done then death and hades were thrown into the lake of fire this is the second death the lake of fire and if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire Hell Christian eschatology Harrowing of Hell Sheol Hades Bangsian fantasy Jewish eschatology Soul Angel Sanctuary Heaven Salvation Angel Tartarus Purgatory Phaedo El (god) Last Judgment Rapture Minos Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Origin belief Justification (theology) End times The Amber Spyglass Qiyamah Operation Market Garden Ezekiel Sola fide Resurrection of the dead Preterism Michael (archangel) D'ni timeline The Death Gate Cycle Death (personification) Devil Christian views of Jesus Sin The Matrix character names Book of Daniel Apocalypse Mahou Sentai Magiranger Jeremiah Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Leviathan B__b Death Tribulation Ghost Apostles' Creed Arnold Murray Biblical inerrancy Eleusinian Mysteries The Eyre Affair El (Canaanite god) Callisto (Xena) Gospel of Thomas Lucifer Intercession of saints Rhea (mythology) Fire and brimstone Saint Seiya Theseus Book of Ezekiel Afterlife Palace of Westminster Blood (computer game) Book of Revelation New Testament view on Jesus' life Wyatt Earp Millennialism Four Quartets Gehenna Biblical canon The Dunciad Sub-Zero Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope Zeus Spiritism Abrahamic religion Mormonism Thomas Cole Cronus The Vampire Chronicles Poker jargon The Pilgrim's Progress Immortality Gospel of Mark Dies Irae Piccolo Junior Saga Battlefield (Doctor Who) Encantadia Jewish Messiah Helen Book of Isaiah Earthsea Nation of Islam Duties of the Heart The Brothers Karamazov
