if you could help someone outside your faith would you paraclete the spirit and not paraclete the holy spirit very important point a spirit in the new testament is a human prophet therefore jesus had predicted the comming of a human prophet spirit after him and not the holy spirit jesus would not have used the word he for the holy spirit he would have used it instead in john above read john below beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world john also see john or an inspired human for example read corinthians thessalonians etc there had been many cases of deliberate modification of the biblical text by members of the christian clergy themselves as well as deliberate large scale projects to correct the bible and the writings of the early fathers such as the deliberate insertion of the verse of john which is now universally discarded it is therefore possible that either the word holy could have been dropped by a careless copyist or someone could have inserted the word holy to convey his personal understanding of the text which was it in order to arrive at the answer we must follow the same path of detective work the biblical scholars themselves do we must study the characteristics of the paraclete and compare them to both the holy spirit and to a spirit muslims believe that muhammad peace be upon him was the one intended and not the holy ghost in the christian's own gospel of barnabas muhammad is mentioned by name here the trinitarian church however has done its utmost to obliterate all existing copies of the gospel of barnabas and to hide it from the masses or to label it a forgery see chapter for this reason it becomes necessary to show that even the gospels adopted by paul's church also originally spoke of muhammad peace be upon him christian scholars see evidence of tampering especailly with the word spirit in the famous anchor bible we find the following quote the word parakletos is peculiar in the nt to the johnannine literature in john ii jesus is a parakletos not a title serving as a heavenly intercessor with the father christian tradition has identified this figure paraclete as the holy spirit but scholars like spitta delafosse windisch sasse bultmann and betz have doubted whether this identification is true to the original picture and have suggested that the paraclete was once an independent salvific figure later confused with the holy spirit the anchor bible doubleday company inc garden city n y volume a p we are about to see some of the evidence that goes to prove this position does the holy spirit speak or inspire important note the greek word translated as hear in the biblical verses whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak is the greek word akouo ak oo' o meaning to perceive sounds it has for instance given us the word acoustics the science of sounds similarly the verb to speak is the greek verb laleo lal eh' o which has the general meaning to emit sounds and the specific meaning to speak this verb occurs very frequently in the greek text of the gospels it designates a solemn declaration by jesus peace be upon him during his preachings for example matthew obviously these verbs require hearing and speech organs in order to facilitate them there is a distinct difference between someone inspiring something and him speaking something so the paraclete will hear and speak not inspire muhammad peace be upon him as seen above did indeed fulfill this prophesy whatsoever he heard from gabriel the qur'an the same did he physically speak to his followers in the qur'an we read god swears by the star when it falls your comrade muhammad errs not nor is he deceived nor does he speak of his own desire it is naught save a revelation that is revealed unto him the noble qur'an al najm the holy ghost was already with them in the above verses we read if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you the comforter can not be the holy ghost because the holy ghost according to the bible was with them already and even quite active long before the coming of jesus peace be upon him himself and then throughout his ministry read for example genesis and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters samuel and when they came thither to the hill behold a company of prophets met him and the spirit of god came upon him and he prophesied among them samuel and the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tidings and his anger was kindled greatly then he remembered the days of old moses and his people saying where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock where is he that put his holy spirit within him isaiah for he john the baptist shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb luke and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee luke and it came to pass that when elisabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elisabeth was filled with the holy ghost luke and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost and prophesied saying luke and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him luke and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost simeon that he should not see death before he had seen the lord's christ luke and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him jesus and a voice came from heaven which said thou art my beloved son in thee i am well pleased luke then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send i you and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the holy ghost john did they or did they not already receive the holy ghost was jesus peace be upon him not still with them when they received the holy ghost was the holy ghost not with simeon mary elisabeth and zacharias before the birth of jesus peace be upon him was the holy ghost not with moses peace be upon him when he parted the seas there are many more similar verses to be found in the bible in the above verses we are told that if jesus peace be upon him does not depart then the parakletos will not come thus the holy ghost cannot be the one originally intended since it was already with them the contradiction is quite obvious selective translation jesus peace be upon him too is a paraclete the word paraclete is applied to jesus peace be upon him himself in john my little children these things write i unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate parakletos with the father jesus christ the righteous john notice how the translators have managed to translate this exact same word one way advocate in reference to jesus peace be upon him and another comforter with regard to the coming parakletos why would they want to do such a thing the reason is that the translators did not want the christians after reading we have an advocate parakletos with the father jesus christ the righteous to then read and i will pray the father and he shall give you another advocate parakletos can we see why this would make them nervous well what was jesus peace be upon him he was a prophet read this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee matthew and jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people luke muhammad peace be upon him was also a prophet of god we have already demonstrate in chapter one how the verses of the bible themselves prove quite conclusively that jesus peace be upon him was neither a god nor part of god almighty but an elect messenger of god the concept of his divinity was concocted by paul and his ministry during the first three centuries after the departure of jesus peace be upon him and is explicitly refuted by the bible itself and jesus' apostles another paraclete now go back to john and notice the words another paraclete if the comforter is the holy ghost then how many holy ghost's are there the word another is significant we have already seen how this term is applied to jesus peace be upon him himself in english another may mean one more of the same kind or one more of a different kind if the latter were the one intended then the current christian interpretation might bear some merit however if one more of the same kind was what was intended then this is positive proof that the coming paraclete would be just like jesus peace be upon him a human being and a prophet not a ghost the actual greek word used was the word allon which is the masculine accusative form of allos al' los another of the same kind the greek word for another of a different kind is heteros het' er os prof abdul ahad dawud formerly rev david benjamin keldani bishop of uramia says if you don't read it your lost as the rest you have the time to
