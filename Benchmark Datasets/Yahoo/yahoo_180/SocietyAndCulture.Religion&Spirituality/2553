does punishment restore some kind of grand equilibrium that crime upsets details in other words is there a yin and a yang between crime and punishment explanation i've believed for sometime that punishment of any kind cannot rectify a murder or rape or violations of personal autonomy getting even with a perpetrator does not bring the universe back into harmony then the epiphany i had today was this the entire christian doctrine is based on the premise that i've rejected for years that punishment can rectify a crime that an even ratio of violence is harmony but what i realized is i reject the death penalty for the same reason i reject the philosophy of christianity's core doctrine substitutionary atonement they both rely on the premise that harmony is found through a golden ratio of crime to punishment reactions yes i understand the value of deterrence and protection that's why i don't want the prisons open but that's not related rachel qvt i bothered to read it go on rachel qvt so what was the point of jesus dying if not for substitutionary atonement i agree with your basic premise i reject the death penalty for the same reasons first of all even if you want to have some form of retribution through substitutionary atonement the punishment will never fit the crime if a guy rapes a girl how would that type of punishment work you'd get someone to rape him what about if someone kills ten people you can't kill him ten times as punishment if your sense of justice is rooted in the eye for an eye philosophy you'll never be satisfied the problem with punishment for crime in society is that it's necessary to maintain some guise of order but it's not always a deterrent especially with capital punishment we see that violence just begets more violence but instead of the violence being called a crime it's called justice i don't think biblical substitutionary atonement is in the same category although i can see where you would think that i have more to say about this but as it is my answer is already longer than your question and no one will bother to read it anyway Capital punishment Theory of conduct Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Theodicy A Course In Miracles Rape Jewish principles of faith Anarcho-capitalism Calvinism Phaedo Capital punishment in the United States Murder Social justice Charles Grandison Finney Substitutionary atonement Salvation Evil Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Capital punishment in the United Kingdom Limited atonement Original sin Christianity Trinity Atonement Creationism Merit Sharia Justification (theology) Infant baptism Simone Weil Fundamentalist Christianity Religion Abortion debate Torture Punishment Liberal Christianity Biblical inerrancy Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Resurrection of Jesus Fundamentalism Plame affair Judaism Maimonides Anselm of Canterbury Serial killer Polygamy Anarchism Scientology beliefs and practices Objectivist philosophy Reincarnation Female genital cutting Civil rights Fallacy Divine grace Blood atonement Ethics Biblical canon Arminianism Libertarianism Retributive justice Jehovah's Witnesses Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Liberalism Taoism Nontrinitarianism Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Christian eschatology Hangul Jewish philosophy Christian Identity Originalism Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Unitarian Universalism Tonality Crime in Australia Pharisees Indulgence Modernism Lynching in the United States An eye for an eye Mormonism Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution Summa Theologiae Church of Christ European Convention on Human Rights Soul Discordianism Prison reform John Howard Yoder Infantilism Philosophy of science Christianity and anti-Semitism Nicomachean Ethics
