i want to read the bible but there are so many versions im athiest agnostic but i want to read the bible so it can help me in literary studies many novels have allusion and references of the things in the bible my english teacher once said knowing the bible since he was raised catholic helped him understand the allusions in college while his college buddies were pretty much clueless in many books i read like inherit the wind or to kill a mockingbird they have quotes from the king james bible simon in lord of the flies was an allusion to jesus's death i didnt realize that until my friend told me but then there are so many versions and every bible is so long which should i read i know many bibles are the same but just different wording and spelling but im talking about the bibles that have subtle and sublime differences possible by the author to make us interpret it differently or by their religions way list all the different versions of the bible too the bible is like a rock that has water running over it since the beginning of time the water is man's interpretation of the rock so over time the water tries to shape the rock to what it wants it to be the written bible is the leftovers of centuries of story telling from generation to generation for example and she bare him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and ishbak and shuah and jokshan begat sheba and dedan and the sons of dedan were asshurim and letushim and leummim and the sons of midian ephah and epher and hanoch and abida and eldaah all these were the children of keturah ect these are a lot of people to be passing down the history through story tellers in the early days starting with genesis miraculously the wisdom and truth found its way to be written on the dead sea scrolls where king james of england had scholars put together the first bible and was copied by hand by priests before gutenberg published his first book which was the bible this was the only translation of the bible for many years and was written in the same type of language people spoke more details on this can be found at http www greatsite com timeline english bible history now the real question is why has mankind decided in our materialistic and lazy culture that we should deserve the easy option of bible translations what is the real fight about from the beginning of the bible there is a character who still finds his way into our daily lives that the bible has made into a villain and one of the many underlying story lines tells of this villain the villain is a fallen arch angel named lucifer who thought he was equal with god and has been trying since the beginning of time to beat god at his own game what better way than to tamper with god's own words and to confuse his good followers satan lucifer knows that man has been given free will and the option of being lazy so who wouldn't want the bible that promises easier reading and is not written in an old english dialog why not water down god's word just a little bit more and more and more until its potency and original meanings are gone i read in the kjv there was a part where jesus' apostles ask him how they can perform the miracles that he performs and he told them that it could only be done through prayer and fasting then the niv and other translations left out the part about fasting that's like getting a new puzzle that doesn't have all the pieces this is how satan wants to weaken us so that we can't be more like god and not have the full story i personally view the new translations of the bible as a new way of telling me that i'm stupid as if the original kjv would be too hard for me to understand of my own comprehension i don't need an overly educated person telling what the bible says when i can just read it for myself and use my own ideas to judge what i think it means the bible is straight forward and full of common sense the bible is a history philosophy spirituality and study guide to life that constantly makes life clear again my advice is just to read the original kjv that has the reference guide down the middle that shows where the bible repeats itself isaiah and jeremiah do foretell of the the christ child if you read carefully don't let the other versions tell you what to think use your own common sense and let your spirit do all the thinking for further reading here are some reference points why is my choice of a bible translation so important dr wayne grudem with jerry thacker for a list of all current translations in the english language http www geocities com bible translation
