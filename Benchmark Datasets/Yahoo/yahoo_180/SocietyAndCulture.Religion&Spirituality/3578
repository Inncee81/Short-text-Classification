what does god accomplish by sending us sinners to hell for eternity is there any purpose for creating something only to destroy and eternally torture a large portion of it the majority of mankind would be sent to hell by the bible's definition of a righteous believer why does god set up the rules in such a way thanks einstein but that isn't an answer uh created to worship you're saying god created us to get rid of us mmmmm trust me if hell was real nobody would want to go to say we send ourselves is a bit like saying the jews sent themselves to the gas ovens during wwii well i was hoping for a christian answer but instead of answering the question they only said we choose it ourselves i wanted to know why god set it up like that not the end result of it interesting squirt who do you think the gods really were then ok spiritual gunslinger interesting ideas about hell if you're right then i think i'll gladly go my own way if your god is real then he is an egocentric sadist hell doesn't seem so bad as an eternity in blind worship of a monster that would set up the universe in such a way ok going to try to do the best i can with limited space god perfect created man for fellowship god gave only one prohibition don't eat of tree of knowledge of good and evil after all why would he want us to know about evil grief pain suffering such on both adam eve stumbled on this one and now there is the stain of rebellion in their heart god is still perfect with perfect justice so he departs from adam eve why because his perfect justice can not stand in the presence of wrong doing without taking action satan thinks he has won the big one either god forgo his perfect justice and compromise in order to save man or he chooses to never again have fellowship with man god looses with either of those choices and satan wins the penalty of death enters our world was never a creation of his this punishment can only be removed with the perfect sacrifice and satan still wins because with the mark of sin on man no one is no longer perfect and the sacrifice can't be made god comes to man walks our world of hurt with us takes on the sorrows we feel and offers himself as sacrifice death is now defeated satan realizes a royal flush isn't the biggest hand to in this case of texas hold em jesus now offers a gift of salvation man now has a choice accept or reject eternal fellowship once again some choose to accept the gift and in return are given eternal fellowship some choose to reject the gift of fellowship physical death comes to all some have accepted the gift of spiritual life and will have fellowship with god those who have rejected the gift of fellowship with god come to realize they have also rejected life after spiritual death god honors man's heart to those that want eternal fellowship he honors them with citizenship in his kingdom to those who did not want fellowship with him in this life he will honor that same wish in the next life ergo no heaven did he create us to destroy us or do some of us choose to reject the gift of heaven's citizenship now as for him torturing anyone in hell not going to happen that's right you've just heard a christian say you will not be tortured and to understand it you have to understand this while i live here on this world the pain suffering grief this will be the only hell i know for those who choose not to enter heaven this world will be the only heaven they know joy happiness fulfillment laughter see when you are in hell it means you are completely seperated from anything of god that means for eternity no joy no happiness no fulfillment no laughter and all that leaves is a loneliness you have never felt a sadness so deep it will leave you crushed with its weight so please if any of this has even caused you or any other to pause please email me and i will do my best to answer your questions because i'm just one hungry man trying to show another hungry man where the bread of life is
