historical jesus what is truth i believe he existed and still does i need no proof because he lives in my heart you would have to experience it to understand it faith but here is something very interesting for those who say he was a myth historical jesus a recent movement to reinterpret the new testament record the search for the historical jesus is a rather recent undertaking of so called scholars and realists who look to dissect the biblical record and paint a real picture of the man jesus for about the last years including most recently the jesus seminar intellectual debate has made its way into the mainstream media based on the supposed goal of separating historical fact from mythology the problem is that the entire historical jesus movement is a product of the th century philosophy of naturalism in that all debate begins with a shared yet concealed presupposition that anything outside the realm of natural explanation can never be backed by historical evidence in a nutshell the movement holds that it's impossible for the gospel accounts of jesus to be historically accurate because they record things that simply can't happen like people walking on water food multiplying and people being raised from the dead of course this is not scholarly evaluation of the historical evidence or biblical manuscripts this is strict adherence to the philosophy of naturalism historical jesus the unchanging reality of the new testament record when examined the historical jesus movement of the last years has unearthed nothing that undermines the gospel accounts there is no new evidence supporting the idea that jesus was merely a good man there is no new evidence debunking the accounts of miracles and the resurrection based on new analysis of myth theory over a long period of time to the contrary recent discoveries have given more credibility to the nature and content of the new testament record than ever before actually except for the propagated view of the mainstream media the trend in the last two decades has been for liberal scholars to become more conservative in their views on the reliability of the new testament record not less recent finds in archaeology are showing more not less consistent detail of the time culture religion and politics at the time jesus walked the earth at the same time biblical manuscript credibility has taken great leaps forward not backward do these things prove the miracles or resurrection of jesus no however when these things are combined with the record of historical accuracy messianic prophecy early church growth christian persecution and extra biblical sources we see powerful substance not mythology underlying the claim that the writers of the new testament record were eye witnesses to the events themselves for instance we know from sources outside the bible that the apostle paul died during nero s persecution in a d we also know that paul was still alive at the close of acts so acts must have been written sometime before a d since acts was a continuation of luke's gospel we know that gospel must have been written even earlier still any scholar including those in the historical jesus movement will tell you that the gospel of mark predates the gospel of luke this supports the writing of mark in the s a d only about two decades after the crucifixion of jesus outside the gospels no legitimate scholar will dispute that paul wrote romans in the mid s why is this important because paul declares that jesus is the resurrected son of god in the opening lines of that new testament letter galatians is another undisputed letter of paul written in the mid s why is this important because paul discusses his interaction with peter and james two of jesus primary disciples at least years earlier in galatians and finally in corinthians paul proclaims the earliest record of the christian creed in which jesus died for our sins was buried and was raised from the dead three days later why is this early creed so important because scholars using the historical records of paul and his early travels to damascus and jerusalem place the above creed at about a d just to years after the death of jesus christ historical jesus the true record the historical jesus movement holds that the gospels were fabricated or seriously distorted as the stories of jesus evolved into the late st or early nd century however this theory is not supported by the evidence time and again the new testament writers claim to be eyewitnesses to the facts giving detailed geographic political and cultural details to bolster the record all of the manuscript evidence presented above is dramatic because it establishes that basic christian doctrine developed far too quickly for a myth to intervene and distort the historical record especially when so many witnesses were still alive to contradict the alleged errors or myths read it all before you answer thanks translucent your mixed up jesus is the reason for christan how could there be christians before him your statement makes no sense honshu have you ever read josephus antiquities book ch par or letter of mara barsarapion a d how about the gospel accounts did you know the first gospel account gospel of luke was actually recorded while jesus was alive but was not transcribed as a full text until around ad that's less than years after the crucifixion of christ alanagkelly a collage course on jesus existence i see they are gonna try to prove it and not be bias get real i suggest you read the post i listed above yours did they show you that in collage the bible old and new testaments tells us about the only important aspects of jesus' life i see no point in mankind dissecting altering or explaining the details years later p s for those who don't know when the books of the new testament were written there's a book with many scholarly views called the case for christ by lee stroebel i highly recommend it
