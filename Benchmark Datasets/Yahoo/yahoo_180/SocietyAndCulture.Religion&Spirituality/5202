i want to be a hare krishna but my mom wont let me i want to chant go to the temple and severe lord sri krishna but my mo wont let me what can i do to change her mind i am it is not a colt at all i feel happy and safe when i used to go to the temple thanks people i know i have to obay my mom untill i am of age but she says it is the devil and she never tryed it in fact she hate s new things i love her and krishna very much it would depend on your mother's reasons does she have her own religion or is she against religion in general hare krishna is a beautiful religion imo i'm reading bhagavad gita at the moment just started so i don't know much it might help to explain to your mother about krsna consciousness in a way that emphasises the hare krishna view that god goes by lots of different names tell her that she could just as easily practice this great principle inserting the name that she uses for god if she has a god i find the hare krishna devotion to god and their respect for other religions very appealing even if your mother is an atheist it is good to share with her from the books the various hare krishna doctrines about the names of god and the reason why you and they respect other religions it will show her that you're not going to become fanatical or be brainwashed remain calm and approachable try not to be upset but keep reading the books for inspiration if your mum is religious you could go to the church mosque temple saint with your mum on the days when she normally does such things discuss spiritual truths with her there are many similarities explore both your mother's religion and your own so that you can understand these similarities and point them out to her express to her your heartfelt desire to continue learning from the hare krishnas as a hare krishna you can worship god as jesus christ allah jehovah or any other revealed name or as lord krishna it doesn't make a difference to you you might want to wear the fancy robes to set yourself apart but remember that this can be pride your purpose is to serve lord krishna so just remain krishna conscious in all that you do and you will have sufficient love and insight to deal respectfully with your mother it may take time for you mother to see your point of view stay calm and devoted to the lord and she will see the benefits keep reading about all religions they all contain truth it will comfort your mother if she sees your reading from the religious text that she believes in why not do a project where you cross reference hare krishna texts with hers so it is easy for you to point out the similiarities that would be fun and also very rewarding International Society for Krishna Consciousness God Vishnu sahasranama Krishna Ten Commandments Hindu philosophy Theology Saint Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Yoga Radha Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Idolatry Bhakti Soul Trinity Advaita Vedanta Book of Mormon Religious conversion Hindu Eastern Orthodox Church A Course In Miracles Ramakrishna Prophet Bhajan Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Prayer Fundamentalism Jiddu Krishnamurti Arjuna Hare Krishna Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Guru Roman Catholic Church Christianity Christian eschatology Philipp Melanchthon Cult Church of Christ Abrahamic religion Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Simone Weil Monotheism David Hume Ishta-deva Mary, the mother of Jesus John Wycliffe Holy Spirit Sin Baptism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Church of Christ, Scientist Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Religious Society of Friends Sabbath Mormonism and Christianity Human Predestination Avatar Existence of God Atheism Vishnu Bhakti yoga Religious perspectives on Jesus Opposition to cults and new religious movements Calvinism Past teachings of Prem Rawat Hindu scripture Islam Charles Grandison Finney Scientology beliefs and practices Love Friedrich Schleiermacher New Age Urantia Devil Animism Moral objectivism Indian caste system Spiritism Sacrifice Rastafari movement Religious pluralism Nation of Islam Hindu deities Eucharist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Revelation Brahman John Howard Yoder Adi Shankara Great Apostasy The Mother Chosen people
