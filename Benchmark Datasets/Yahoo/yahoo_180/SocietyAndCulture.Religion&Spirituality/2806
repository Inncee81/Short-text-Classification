creationists is the same description of evolution as the one you argue against because below is the mainstream scientific description of evolution and this may eliminate the constant creationist misrepresentations and misunderstandings that are dishonestly asserted read on without variation which arises from mutations of dna molecules to produce new alleles natural selection would have nothing on which to act a population is a group of individuals living in the same geographical area and sharing a common gene pool the gene pool is the sum of all genetic information carried by the members of a population all genetic variation in a population is generated by mutation mutation is any heritable change in dna mutations can be changes of a single nucleotide base or may involve changes in chromosome number whether a mutation is good neutral or harmful depends on how it affects survival and reproductive success this says nothing of religion or gods but it is a description of what is observed in the natural biological world over to you so if you must argue against evolution this description is the one you must argue against there is no other scientific description of evolution if reading was their strong point we wouldn't be having this argument Molecular evolution Gene Mutation Species DNA Human Neutral theory of molecular evolution Macroevolution Price equation Evolution of sex Reproduction Genetics Meme Natural selection Human skin color Polymerase chain reaction Biology Genetic drift Race DNA repair Cell (biology) Genetic engineering Y chromosome Cancer Junk DNA Intelligent design Francis Crick Genetic algorithm Biology and sexual orientation Genetic code Modern evolutionary synthesis Mitochondrial genetics Biodiversity Specified complexity Irreducible complexity Genetic disorder Intelligent design movement History of evolutionary thought Bioinformatics International HapMap Project Memetics The Origin of Species Extinction Intelligence quotient Genealogical DNA test Hardy-Weinberg principle Sociobiology Scientific method Darwin on Trial Small population size History of creationism Human Genome Project Evolutionary creationism Genetic screen Creationism Eugenics Race and intelligence Darwinism Human genome Senescence Transposon Sociocultural evolution Creation-evolution controversy The Selfish Gene Sequencing Teach the Controversy James D.
