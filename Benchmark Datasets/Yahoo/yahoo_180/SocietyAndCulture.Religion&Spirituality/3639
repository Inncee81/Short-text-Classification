do you think that mitt romney being mormon will affect whether or not he becomes president how so and why or why not yes unfortunately people are prejudiced and don't take the time to gain a true understanding of things before passing judgment on others if people honestly knew what being mormon was about they would know that it could only make for an honest compassionate self sacrificing level headed president unlike other religions the mormons have great tolerance for other faiths and beliefs they also hold freedom as one of the highest ideals and priorities so even if they do not believe in other religions or matters like homosexuality or abortion they will fight for your right to choose for yourself they would lay down their lives for you regardless of your faith they share what they have with the rest of the world you could hate and persecute them and they would still love you or try to anyway i am impressed by the mormons not every individual mormon is a good example of course but for the most part they strive to be christ like in the way they live too bad others don't see this truth however i can't understand why people don't examine mitt romney first as a man and as a politician instead of dismissing him solely because of his religion did the kennedys get dismissed for being catholic may god guide the man any man who is elected to run this country Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mitt Romney Christianity Opus Dei Religion Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Separation of church and state God Homosexuality and Christianity Fundamentalism Roman Catholic Church Mormonism and Christianity Sola fide Anti-Mormonism Church of Christ Summa Theologiae Religious pluralism Chosen people Prophet Book of Mormon Priesthood (Mormonism) Evil Religious Society of Friends Atheism Jewish views of religious pluralism Revelation Supernatural Christian anarchism Christian eschatology Theory of conduct Heaven Blacks and Mormonism Divine grace Theosis Great Apostasy 2004 Republican National Convention Mexico Liberal Christianity Blood atonement Religion and sexual orientation Judaism Urantia Justification (theology) History of the Latter Day Saint movement Merit Jehovah's Witnesses Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Jewish principles of faith John Howard Yoder InterFaith Rick Santorum Religious conversion Theodicy Restorationism Sikhism Abrahamic religion Trinity Heresy Original sin Community of Christ Criticism of Mormonism Criticisms of Christianity S__ren Kierkegaard Discordianism A Course In Miracles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Ted Kennedy Ethics Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Hindu deities Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Protestantism Calvinism Latter Day Saint Second Vatican Council Freedom of religion Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Satanism Alignment (role-playing games) Idolatry Republic Gospel of Thomas David Hume Religious perspectives on Jesus Eastern Orthodox Church Aesthetic Realism Falun Gong Anglicanism
