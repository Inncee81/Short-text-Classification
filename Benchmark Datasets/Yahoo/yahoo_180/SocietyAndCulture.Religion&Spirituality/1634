did joseph smith have a messy room my mom says revelation only comes to those with clean rooms it was a quote from some prophet so that's where my mom got it from interesting i don't know about that sorry but our lesson on sunday was about reverence reverence is more than just a sunday attitude it's devotion and respect in your everyday life one of the points spencer w kimball made was that being clean and neat in appearance and in our homes and meetinghouses shows reverence and respect reverence helps us to feel the spirit of love remember the song reverence is love the spirit of love is the same spirit that brings revelation so i figure your mum is partly right however my home is often very messy and i get revelations all the time and so does my husband what you need to receive revelations is faith prayer and quiet pondering upon the scriptures or whatever problem it is you are trying to get revelation for quiet peacefulness meditation that's how you get revelation cleaning the mess helps one to focus and feel peaceful but it is not essential to receiving revelation Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Temple (Mormonism) Endowment (Mormonism) Book of Mormon Church of Christ, Scientist Prophet Doctrine and Covenants Christianity Adam-God theory Idolatry Rastafari movement Religious Society of Friends Hinduism God Jewish principles of faith Philipp Melanchthon A Course In Miracles Community of Christ Joseph F.
