something for atheists and everyone really to think about all the facts of the world are dependent upon a set of basic physical facts in short the laws of nature for example your computer can be explained in terms of electrons protons and neutrons it might be more easily explained another way but knowing these basic facts implies all of the higher level facts cpu ram etc jane lives in an age of neuroscience where every physical fact that there is to be known about the brain is known she is the world's leading neuroscientist jane has also been raised in a room that is only colored in black white and shades of gray she knows everything about neural processes the physical makeup of objects etc however she does not know what it is like to see red no amount of reasoning from all the physical facts she knows will give her this knowledge therefore some higher level knowledge what the color red looks like is not based upon physical laws i'll let you decide the implications did i ever mention god why must people drone on about wavelengths of light i get that it has nothing to do with this argument think about it thank you um this isn't some elaborate metaphor for anything i'm not trying to prove the bible or trying to prove the existence of god the color red and its perception is still based on physical laws but i can see that's not what you're getting at you seem to be trying to say that there are certain things that are beyond our scope however jane is not incapable of seeing red take her outside that room and she'll see it just fine so she's not incapable of seeing red whether she has already seen it or not in that case red is not beyond her scope just beyond her current means you also make the leap that there must be something that we are incapable of understanding as a physical phenomenon which is unfounded it's certainly possible but that alone is no reason to assume there must be and if i were to extend this to where i think you'd take it given the section you posted this question in we shouldn't assume anything about the nature of that unknown should it exist i don't think any of us would think that jane should just guess what red looks like Color Cognitive science Science Psychology Artificial consciousness Supernatural Qualia Philosophical skepticism Light Intelligent design Philosophy of mathematics Existence of God Physics Scientific method Creationism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theory of conduct Causality Francis Crick Philosophy of science The nature of God in Western theology George Lakoff Quantum mechanics Philosophy of perception Free will Emergence Cyberspace Falsifiability Big Bang Cosmological argument Quantum mind CPU cache Religion Metaphysics Soul Mind-body problem Human brain Natural deduction Epistemology Meaning of life Deconstruction Consciousness Fine-tuned universe Gravity Determinism Theodicy Transcendental argument for the existence of God Philosophy of mind Particle physics Central processing unit Nuclear fusion Timeline of the Universe Franz Boas God Many-worlds interpretation Where Mathematics Comes From Atheism A New Kind of Science Philosophy Abstraction Goodness and value theory Philosophy of space and time Miracle Electron Atomism Intellectual property Microeconomics Labor theory of value Teleological argument Logic Extreme Programming Telepathy Neuroscience Neuro-linguistic programming Friedrich Schleiermacher Human Technetium Tonality RGB color model Fundamentalism Mathematics Postmodernism Reincarnation Belief Mythology Species G__del's incompleteness theorem Electromagnetic radiation Unified field theory Cosmology RISC Temperature Entropy Turing test Doomsday argument Astronomy
