atheist evolutionist have you found that missing link yet i'm still waiting on that michelle it is immenant could be this year bye bye god bless here is a link that is worth checking into http s int com what i want to know is how all of those animals got buried in the glaciers with undigested food in their stomachs and still chewing food according to evolution they just stood there for millions of years waiting for the weather to get cold and eventually it snowed on them while they were eating buttercups hee hee hee i wonder why winter weather isn't creating more glaciers and how did all of those fish fossils wind up on top of the mountains i know there was an animal that liked to bury fish and all kinds of other animals on the mountain tops so they ran down to the lakes and caught a fish and then ran up to the mountain top to bake it in the dry rocky soil no that isn't quite right i don't recall seeing too many creatures turning into fossils around my yard when they're just kind of laying there in fact they're usually eaten by some other animal i think it has to be wet and have compression or something to make a fossil so he must have run back down to the lake and filled his mouth with water and then back up to the top of the mountain and spit on the fish to make them wet and then stomped on them to compress them when did the first woman appear or was it a man that all of a sudden zapped himself from chimp to man did he then teach the female chimp how to become human we should really work on teaching these chimps in the zoo how to do it here are a few more interesting links http www creationscience com onlinebook inthebeginningtoc html http www angelfire com mi dinosaurs mammoth html http www answersingenesis org home area fit chapter asp http www icr org articles print http www biblediscoveries com flood html http www sixdaycreation com facts flood june html former environment of frozen mammoths there is a common misconception that the mammoth lived in areas of extreme cold this widespread belief comes primarily from popular drawings showing mammoths living comfortably in snowy arctic regions the artists in turn were influenced by earlier opinions based on the mammoth's hairy coat thick skin and a inch layer of fat under the skin however animals with these characteristics do not necessarily live in cold climates let's examine these characteristics more closely wooly mammoths study http www grahamkendall net unsorted files a frozen mammoths txt something interesting in this study suffocation occurred in several ways a physical burial by falling ice particles b breathing too much carbon dioxide gas from evaporating dry ice and c freezing lung tissue thereby preventing the diffusion of oxygen into and carbon dioxide out of the lungs dirty lungs from extreme winds muddy hail fell http www creationscience com onlinebook frozenmammoths html http www christiananswers net q aig aig c html Desert Lake Water Ice core Effects of global warming Drowning Global warming Death Valley National Park Climate change Bird Geology of the Grand Canyon area Avalanche Energy development Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Rebreather Stone Age Dinosaur Climate of Salt Lake City Renewable energy Water (molecule) Severe weather terminology (United States) Sea level rise Diving suit Cetacea Food preservation Thermoregulation Nerpa Fossil 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Mammoth Young Earth creationism Climate of the United Kingdom HyperText Transfer Protocol Biology Permian-Triassic extinction event Carnivorous plant Leaf Rocky Mountains California Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Plant Little Ice Age Paleoclimatology Snowball Earth Ozone depletion Answers in Genesis Animal Snake Global warming and agriculture Evidence of evolution World Wide Web Geography of India Natural disaster Earth Hydrogen economy Mars Sulfur Biodiesel Disaster Pulmonary alveolus Breathing gas Solar variation Earth's atmosphere Peat First aid Tetrapod Yosemite National Park Fire extinguisher Acid rain Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Vacuum Mummy Weathering Gaia theory (science) Glacier National Park (US) Tlingit Cro Utah Solar system Domain Name System Coffee Prostate cancer Hamster Elephant Weather lore Fog Phase (matter) Global cooling Carbon Iditarod
