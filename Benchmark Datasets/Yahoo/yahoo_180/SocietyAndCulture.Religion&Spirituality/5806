jesus is not god why do you call him god jesus cannot save you only god can jesus himself will be judged on judgment day please don't follow paul he is just a man follow jesus follow god corinthians when all things are subjected to him then the son himself also will be subjected to the one who subjected all things to him so that god may be all in all but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father mark and matt but god knows all his knowledge is without any limitations verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do john again he said i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgement is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which has sent me john but god is not only all powerful he is also the source of all power and authority i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god john he is also reported to have cried out while on the cross my god my god why hast thou forsaken me matt if jesus were god then couldn't this be read myself myself why hast thou forsaken me would that not be pure nonsense when jesus prayed the lord's prayer luke was he praying to himself when in the garden of gethsemane he prayed o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt matt was jesus praying to himself no man hath seen god at any time john ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape john he also said in john god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth that jesus would say that no one had seen or heard god at any time while his followers both saw and heard him is clear proof that jesus was not god john my father is greater than i when someone referred to him as a good master in luke jesus responded why callest thou me good none is good save one that is god furthermore jesus drew clear distinctions between himself and god when he said i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me john jesus gave clear evidence of his subordination to god rather than his equality with god when he said in luke not my will but thine be done and in john i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which has sent me that jesus would admit that he did not come into the world on his own initiative but was directed to do so that he would acknowledge another being as greater than himself and that he would negate his own will in deference to affirming the will of another give clear proof that jesus is not the supreme one and therefore jesus is not god biblical evidence of jesus being a servant of allah and having no share in divinity jesus and the devil in the bible in the new testament of the bible in the th chapter of the gospel according to matthew the th and th verses clearly indicate that jesus is an obedient mortal and god is the master and lord according to his saying in the th verse it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god in this chapter we read that the devil actually carried the messiah and took him from place to place how can the devil carry god glory be to allah he is above such blasphemy then the devil orders him to prostrate before him and worship him even tempting him with worldly possessions how can the devil even dare such an audacity with god when the devil wanted jesus to comply with his orders he jesus replied by saying that it was written in the previous books thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve matthew children of god jesus never called himself son of god as far as i know but he used to call himself the son of man mark although he heard himself being called by that name he did not object as assumed in the bible and did not consider the title exclusively for him according to the biblical term in the old testaments every god fearing righteous person is called son of god in matthew we read blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god in matthew that ye may be children of your father that is in heaven god the father in matthew be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect in matthew otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven matthew not everyone that sayeth unto me jesus lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven n b the word 'lord' here was translated as rabb in the arabic version of the bible so that people may be convinced that jesus is god but if one studies the rest of the verse one will note that the verse bears testimony to the subservience to god's will of the messiah jesus there for the correct translation should be not everyone that sayeth to me o my master shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven it is obvious from the above readings from the bible that the term 'father' is used for god in numerous places in the bible it is never used exclusively for jesus matthew at that time jesus answered and said 'i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes' jesus the worshipper matthew and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray i say if jesus is god or part of god then why did he pray in fact prayer is always from a submitting needy and dependant one for the mercy of allah the almighty as mentioned in the qur'an o mankind it is you who stand in need of allah but allah is rich free of all wants and needs worthy of all praise and in qur'an there is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the most gracious allah as a slave jesus a prophet of allah matthew and behold one came and said unto him 'good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life ' and he said unto him 'why callest thou me good there is none good but one i e god but if thou will enter into life keep the commandments in the above verse we not the acknowledgement of his submissivness to allah's will matthew and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parable they perceived that he spoke of them but when they sought to lay hands on him they feared the multitude because they took him for a prophet here it is proved that all those who believed in jesus in his lifetime did not believe in him being god or the son of god or one in the doctrine of trinity but they believed in him as being a prophet only this is indeed one of the strongest points of evidence against those who believe in the divinity of jesus incarnation of god if only they pondered jesus a servant of allah matthew but be not ye called rabbi for one is your master even jesus and all ye are brethren here it is clearly that jesus was servant of allah and that there is only one master and he is allah in the arabic version of the bible this verse has been translated so that jesus is meant to be the master whereas the english rendering is nearer the original sense matthew and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven from this you will not that fatherhood and sonship is meant to be the relationship between the lord and his servants it is meant in a general sense and not specifically for jesus matthew but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only this is a definate proof that the final hour is unknown to any but allah thus jesus' knowledge is imperfect all other men allah alone is all knowing all wise http groups yahoo com group welcome islam
