best fiction bible or harry potter both of them are filled with fantasy and fable but which one is a better read mark twain wrote about the bible it is full of interest it has noble poetry in it and some clever fables and some blood drenched history and some good morals and a wealth of obscenity and upwards of a thousand lies i haven't read any harry potter but i am guessing it's better it is unfair to read them side by side the bible is at a disadvantage because it is so old by the time harry potter came along we had thousands of years of literate history to draw from the bible is an early work of mankind it should be judged in the frame of the period it was written in very few ancient works could get published today the bible is certainly in that list too if someone came along today and wrote the bible it would fail on editing no one would publish it harry potter of course has the advantage of shakespeare milton poe kipling and the bible it also has the advantage of millions of failed and mediocre stories the bible has noble poetry not much but it is there and it is quite good there are clever fables and interesting stories some of the morals are good some are horrendous and should be considered immoral behavior now the lies are extraordinary but it is important to remember that is was initially read by a magic believe non critical thinking audience with deeply limited understanding of the natural world harry potter is a far better book and it may even have better morals still i can think of some nice criticisms of rowling's work and i would love to sit down and ask her why she did some things the way she did on the other hand i am incapable of producing even close to that quality of work so it is an ignorant peasant criticizing the queen in a way she possesses an interesting honor her book is better than the foundational work of over one billion believers that really is quite good maybe she should consider starting a religion it can't be worse than christianity or islam Harry Potter Literature Novel Bible J.
