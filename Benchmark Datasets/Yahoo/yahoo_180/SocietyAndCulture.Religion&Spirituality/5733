what lessons has suffering taught you accept periods of suffering with gratitude knowing that suffering can teach you very important lessons barbara ann kipfer namaste peace and love a good question my friend may i respond from my buddhist perspective it may reveal some small wisdom and provide another aspect for comparison from my poor insight all of life's experiences both the good ones and the bad ones each have suffering as a characteristic this sounds awful and negative yet let me explain further with some simple examples this may shed some light on selfishness and it's role in causing unnecessary suffering and help us all avoid it's nasty side an example of a good experience carrying with it suffering is ice cream let me explain ice cream is great to eat yet if the self is allowed free reign in the consciousness this simple and delightful experience can prove nasty if we indulge the self with tanha pali for craving for ice cream in moderation then exhibit mild upadana and eat it we feel great and we enjoy this delicious stuff with relish all well and good and we feel great no harm done if the self is allowed its freedom within the consciousness thus overwhelming our wisdom in regards to ice cream however things can turn out quite differently as we've all experienced ice cream overdose and the ascociated illness and sickly feelings of it i won't need to elaborate on this selfish overindulgence thus the lord buddha advises the middle path to avoid such self induced suffering and thus can a good experience turn very nasty indeed all due to selfishness a rather crude and extreme example of course yet the lesson is clear without wisdom selfishness can and does cause suffering as well as an example of a good experience carrying with it suffering as an integral part as long as we are careful and wise we avoid such suffering of course the wisdom avoid the upadana ascociated with self and you avoid the suffering ascociated with good experiences an example of a bad experience carying with it suffering the example of the death of a friend this one sounds easy yet death and the ascociated feelings of sadnesss and grief are often misrepresented and misinterpretted as the bad parts or the parts to be avoided and released as it were this is so however the feelings themselves are normal as well as a normal part of these experiences when we feel these feelings of grief and sadness this is quite ok we are human beings after all with feelings such as these feeling these feelings does not inhibit our growth as spiritual beings rather we feel these feelings because we are human beings with feelings of love and compassion from a buddhist perspective such feelings of loss are selfish feelings it is true but they are because we miss the person who died this is not a wrong view or wrong action rather they are normal feelings they are the dukkha ascociated with death this is a normal part of life they are caused from love for the person and are therefore from the true self rather than the selfish one however when these feelings are held long after the event has passed this is upadana caused by the self it is owned and this ownership causes other feelings to arise such as depression and it is this suffering which is the bad one as it were and can be avoided if the observer's stance is taken from the outset thus observing grief and sadness and then leaving these feelings with the event we have witnessed the wisdom then in this case is to avoid the upadana ascociated with self and you avoid the suffering ascociated with bad experiences you can see then that the wisdom is the same in both cases of good experiences as well as bad ones avoid upadana and you help yourself avoid the suffering ascociated with these experiences as well a avoid the suffering ascociated with the self and its characteristic selfishness and clinging some thoughts on suffering from a buddhist Pratitya-samutpada Buddhism Religion Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Sant
