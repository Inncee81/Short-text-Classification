i want to check out a few islamic books but cant find them on amazon is it common for them not to have isbn's i ve typed in words that should bring them up but i cant manage to dig up any isbn's could it be possible that muslims can object to the isbn system in some way or is it that muslims havnt yet caught up with western publishing practices and its universal or so i thought catalogue ing system a lot of books published in the middle east are released by smaller publishers who may not use the isbn system in smaller religious distribution setups it would be totally unnecessary the same happens in the us with local interest books and some religious books and even some poetry books but there is plenty about islam in english published in the us that should be reasonably easy to find i guess it depends on what you mean by islamic history hadiths alquran politics art Hadith Islam Daniel Pipes Sunni Islam History of Islam Islamic fundamentalism Sufism Book Fundamentalism Jihad Divisions of Islam Arabic literature Sharia Islamism Shi'a Islam Religious conversion Business ethics Women in Islam Yusuf al-Qaradawi Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi Abrahamic religion Dhimmi Islam as a political movement Qur'an Qiyamah Southeast Asia Al-Andalus Islamic world Religious studies Muhammad Iqbal Middle East Ghazw Object-oriented programming Futuh Orientalism Wahhabism Mahmoud Mohamed Taha Afghan people Religion Jizya Middle Ages Ruhollah Khomeini Egypt The Left and Opposition to War ISBN Strap-on dildo United Submitters International Islam in France State Mysticism Predestination Fiqh History of Buddhism Atheism Bosniaks Madrassa Publishing Palestinian Saint Nation of Islam Balkans Islamic calligraphy Arabic language Halaal Muhammad Crusade Salman Rushdie Caliph Turkic peoples Conservatism Salafi Historical persecution by Muslims Christoph Marcinkowski Celt Democracy Islam in Pakistan Islamist terrorism Islam in the United Kingdom Sabians Islam and Judaism Republic Status of religious freedom in Iran Anglo-Saxon literature Women as imams Judeo-Christian Education in the United States Islamic religious leaders Windows 2000 Unclean animals Jew Ibn Khaldun Islam and anti-Semitism Sunnah Status of religious freedom in Pakistan Bank Encyclopedia Tamil people Apostasy
