mulims what if i told you that not all christians believe in the trinity i am a christian and i definently don't believe in the trinity but i do believe that jesus is god not by being a second person of a trinity and yes the trinity teaching does sound polytheistic im strictly monotheistic and believe in only one god who is our father the reason i believe that jesus is god because i believe that the same god of the ot manifested himself in flesh the same one god was our father in creation the son in redemption and holy spirit in regeneration this concept is not the same as the trinity believe they believe in persons i only believe in one who manifested himself in three ways while god is in bodily form jesus he is known as the son jesus said that that the father is greater than he because god was talking about his humanity when trinitarians explain things i think you would agree that it doesn't make any since at all and they contradict themselve too much if you want to talk more on this to understand please e mail me god bless the original teaching of the trinity is one god consisting of three person not manifestations some people have come the the knowledge that it is impossible that god can be three but yet one god so they say he is not seperate but one god manifested in three ways this is the teaching of oneness apostolics which makes more since apostolics do not hold the belief of a trinity only one god manifested in three ways not persons right on if trinitarians believed in one god the word trinity would not exist trinity the union of three persons father son and holy ghost in one godhead or the threefold personality of the one divine being who has personalities not god he said he's the same yesterday today and forever he said that there is no one beside him nor ever will be trinitarians can't explain that one away however i do think a lot of people come to an understanding but still label it under trinity they don't realize that trinity really is meaning gods or like a headed being that's not god then there are the real trinitarians who do believe in gods bleh you've got to listen to people beyond their labels Nontrinitarianism Oneness Pentecostal Holy Spirit Godhead (Mormonism) Monotheism Baptism Christ Justification (theology) Eastern Orthodox Church Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Henotheism Christianity Athanasian Creed Predestination Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Pentecostalism Salvation Unitarianism Arianism Soul God and gender Mormonism and Christianity Supernatural Sola fide Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Abrahamic religion Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Meister Eckhart A Course In Miracles History of Christianity Church of Christ, Scientist United Pentecostal Church Religious perspectives on Jesus Existence of God Kabbalah Book of Mormon Jewish principles of faith Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Angel Roman Catholic Church Christian eschatology Jesus Creationism Free will Mortification of the flesh Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friedrich Schleiermacher Origen Hell Incarnation William M.
