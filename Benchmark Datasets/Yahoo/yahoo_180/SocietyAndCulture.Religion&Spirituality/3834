are all atheists like the ones on r s i hope so that'll make my life so much easier in all my questions today all the feedback i've recieved has been nothing but garbage from atheists i can easily argue anything they've thrown my way and explain everything backed with perfectly logical arguments and i'm only learning more and more everyday the thing about atheists is that they are limited to facts and proof which they have none of and rely on logic which i can use just as well if not better because god created everything so anything is an argument for the existence of god it'll get to a point where even dawkins himself would be speechless the reason for this is because i know god exists i'm also expecting alot of ridicule and insulting remarks on my behalf but the beauty about that is none of you know me or know what i'm capable of my potential is limitless don't even assume you have even begun to figure me out i am in no way you're average christian that is something i can prove god has a plan for me and i know exactly what it is just give me time just because i'm not right now doesn't mean i won't be in a position to prove myself not even all atheists in r s are alike when you set up this interview with dawkins let me know i've read most of the other ones he's had with people of different faiths i doubt there's much more you could contribute than what they have done btw not all atheists use dawkins in that manner none of you know me yet you assume you know others it never ceases to amaze me how people will do the very thing they claim no one else can do to them good for you you're not average though honestly i haven't seen how you are above average as i see so many other christians doing this very thing an open challenge in a forum that is made for simply asking questions and answering them i'm not sure if you're just another fundie so to speak who's out to try to prove something that is something i can prove are your words or just another who thinks doing to others what they do is somehow going to change someone else's mind if it won't change yours when they do it how is it you think that when you do it it will change their minds Atheism Existence of God Strong atheism Theodicy Intelligent design Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ontological argument Intelligent design movement Antony Flew Theory of conduct Philosophical skepticism Biblical inerrancy Richard Dawkins Presuppositional apologetics G__del's incompleteness theorem Creationism Charles Darwin's views on religion Phaedo Agnosticism God Philosophy Apologetics Cosmological argument Teach the Controversy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religion Teleological argument Afterlife Transcendental argument for the existence of God Deconstruction Philosophy of language Phillip E.
