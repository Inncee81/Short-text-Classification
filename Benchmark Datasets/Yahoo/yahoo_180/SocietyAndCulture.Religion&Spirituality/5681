creationists is this a good proof for creationism i have discovered a valid proof of creationism that goes like this premise all things that exist in time require an intelligent creator premise all things that exist in the universe exist in time conclusion all things that exist in the universe require an intelligent creator thus creationism is true this argument is valid because there is no way for the premises to be true and the conclusion false you evolutionistas might argue against me because my first premise is false but then you would be requiring the argument to be sound i don't require my arguments to be sound because that discriminates against deaf people if my argument was sound only people who could hear would be able to understand it if you evolutionarians want to discriminate against the deaf go right ahead but i'm going to make sure everybody gets my arguments including those who can't hear sound now that i've proven creationism i think i'll soon turn my sights to intelligent falling i think a retarded monkey urinating on a goat dressed in s m leather is more proof of creationism than that Ontological argument Existence of God Theodicy Creationism Logic Presuppositional apologetics Argument from ignorance Teleological argument Intelligent design Contradiction Propositional calculus Theistic realism Creation-evolution controversy Supernatural Fine-tuned universe Fallacy Atheism Logical argument G__del's incompleteness theorem Intelligent design movement God Philosophical skepticism Music Reductio ad absurdum Natural deduction Evolutionary creationism Cogency Determinism Teach the Controversy Deductive reasoning Falsifiability Philosophy of science History of creationism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Specified complexity Transcendental argument for the existence of God Atomism Phaedo Causality Galileo Galilei Rule of inference Controversies in autism Term logic William A.
