what is the difference between being disciplined and being legalistic i am doing bible study on discipline this is the question that was asked and i studied discipline but could not come up with legalistic i appreciate your help and insights thank you being disciplined means either having self control or its a measure taken usually against children for misbehaving such as taking the car keys away from a teenage driver who just got a speeding ticket or got home too late being legalistic is when a religious group creates a bunch of man made rules which they assume will make one a better christian but their rules are not found in or based on the bible like the church which creates a rule which says that their people can't go to movies which are rated r then the passion of the christ comes out which is good moive and the church looks at its rule book and says r rated we can't see that or the church which sees a bunch of hippies wearing bell bottom trousers and they agree to ban bell bottoms hoping that will keep their teenagers from becoming hippies then a member of the us navy in uniform wants to visit the church and he is told he's not allowed to because he's wearing worldly and sinful bell bottom trousers that's legalism pastor art Theology Church of Christ Church of Christ, Scientist Infant baptism Excommunication Divine grace Same-sex marriage Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief The Pilgrim's Progress Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Bob Jones University Justification (theology) Homosexuality and Christianity Mennonite Baptist Sin Religion and sexuality Book of Mormon Original sin Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Beard Catechism Children of God A Course In Miracles Evangelicalism Paul of Tarsus Spanking Calvinism New Testament Predestination Separation of church and state Charles Grandison Finney Biblical studies Salvation Martin Luther Slow Train Coming Sacrifice Religious Society of Friends Marriage Pope Christian views of women Bible Polygamy John Wesley Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sola fide Lutheranism Eastern Orthodox Church C.
