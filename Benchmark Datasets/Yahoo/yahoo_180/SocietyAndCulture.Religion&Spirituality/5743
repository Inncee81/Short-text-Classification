if we are made in god's image his image does that preclude that god has a feminine aspect yes i know god knows no gender but people preach that we are of him and made in his image well what about females and if we are made in god's image too why don't people say that we are made in her image or at very least we are made in his her image as well why are all the women in the bible jezabel's and whore's the suffix his with respect to god often is used to describe god's father like qualities and is in itself no indication of gender from a christian point of view all churches which derived from paul saul and the apostle peter simon all stick ridgedly to a patriachal belief steming from st century pharisee tradition however if you study essene judaism and also if one studies the kabalah there one finds that god has both masculine and femine aspects in equal measure in early judaism many demigods had male and female aspects a belief steming from sumarian and vedic religions which both predate judaism and from which jewish tribes probably diverged from in early christian sects such as the nazarene's we see an equal male and female aspect of god's and all beings such as angels in short all beings in god's kindom have both male and female aspects although they are one spiritual body in the material world all soul's are split in two mortal bodies eve is made from adam's rib hence even angels and demigods that exist in the material world have separate male and female bodies one popular saying attributed to jesus was that until the two become one and until the male becomes like the female and the female becomes like the male and until the inside becomes like the outside and the outside becomes like the inside then it is not possible for one to enter the kingdom of heaven also some scholars point to evidence that jesus had female apostle's whom worked along side their male counterparts helping to spread the word to women folk one of the critizism's of st century judaism was that it had become patriachal to the extent that women were not aloud to become priests and that women were not given equal status to that of men such tradition also spread into gentile christendom because paul believed strongly that women were inferior that and other things has led many scholars to question whether paul really did embrace christianity or did he mearly join christianity in order to contaminate it with jewish tradition one consequence of that is the fact that roman christians tried to slander myriam of magdala mary magdalene in order to justify labeling those whom worshiped her as the female aspect of jesus as heretical we see such hatred against magdalene worshipers by the holy sea as late as the middle ages when both the cathars and the knights templar were almost totally wiped out Eastern Orthodox Church Acts of the Apostles Christianity and anti-Semitism Historical Jesus History of Christianity Gospel of Thomas Holy Spirit Religious perspectives on Jesus Apostle Heresy Catholicism Fundamentalism New Testament Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religious pluralism Divine grace Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Religious conversion Saint Peter Kabbalah Gnosticism Ebionites Baptism Dispensationalism Christian views of women Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Historicity of Jesus Yeshu Saint James the Just A Course In Miracles Bible Mary, the mother of Jesus Heaven Christian eschatology Messianic Judaism Christian denomination Demon Christian-Jewish reconciliation Monotheism Prophet Book of Revelation Original sin Feminism Urantia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Islam Ten Commandments Opus Dei Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Gospel of Barnabas Ordination of women Goddess Noahide Laws Henotheism Mormonism and Christianity Binitarianism Icon Devil Celtic Christianity Predestination Zoroastrianism Gospel of John Salvation Apocalyptic literature Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Soul Nontrinitarianism Tetragrammaton Persecution of Christians God the Father Creationism
