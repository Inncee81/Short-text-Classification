for young earth universe as well believers why did why did god put the photons from distant stars already in their path at creation also why did he make so much of the earth appear old why did he change how certain molecules decayed over time to make everything look older than it really is did he do that to trick us a theist do tell n wff i don't think that's what the bible said but that might be my poor understanding of it we can verify fairly well dating techniques no home day did your pastor feed you that where did you come up with that idea there is no evidence for that at all you seem to be grabbing for answers out of the air i'm sorry dh but pseudo science doesn't cut it saying a clock runs slower on the top of a mountain because time is slower at high altitudes is just silly if a clock ran slower at much higher altitudes and it was a mechanical device it is more likely to be because gravity has less of an effect on the mechanisms making them run slower force of gravity is f mg where g is the acceleration of gravity which changes from an earthly frame of referenc the higher up you go reduce this force by increasing altitude would of course slow down a pendulum type mechanism because the pendulum isn't accelerating as fast and isn't imposing as much force on the rest of the clock i'm starting to think you're replacing your bible with science fiction you're coming up with absolutely groundless claims with no evidence your fantasies will surely gain you rewards in heaven a theist erosion rates aren't static reread your science book the helium argument even points to earth being much much older than years but even that is explained with a little bit of research there's evidence for a young earth so show us some some that hasn't been debunked that is addendum a theist perhaps as part of your studies you should investigate the definition of the word debunked and how to spell helium as to your examples pffft rotflmao erosion i http www talkorigins org indexcc cd cd html erosion ii http www talkorigins org indexcc cd cd html helium http www talkorigins org indexcc ce ce html ocean salinity i http www talkorigins org indexcc cd cd html ocean salinity ii http www talkorigins org indexcc cd cd html Time travel Intelligent design Gravity Supernatural General relativity Flood geology Black hole Age of the Earth Jet engine Variable speed of light Vacuum Creationist cosmologies Sun Falsifiability Religion Uniform Resource Locator Physics Mass Tide Origin belief Quantum mechanics Timeline of the Universe Atheism Modern geocentrism CPU design Sea level rise Noah's Ark Supernova World Wide Web Soul Existence of God Pendulum Extraterrestrial hypothesis Scientific skepticism Dark energy Fine-tuned universe Young Earth creationism Solar variation Helium Moon Richard Feynman Non-standard cosmology Reincarnation Science Tests of general relativity Biblical inerrancy Theodicy Planetary nebula Goodness and value theory The nature of God in Western theology Force Transmission Control Protocol Solar system Time dilation Special relativity Luminiferous aether Old Earth creationism Equivalence principle God Electrophysiology Causality Solar wind Galileo Galilei Decompression sickness Evolutionary creationism Lightning CPU cache Hydrogen Uniform Resource Identifier Fundamental interaction Plasma cosmology Theory of conduct Ice core Welding Spacecraft propulsion Roswell UFO incident Kyoto Protocol Strong atheism Fermi paradox Internal ballistics Future energy development Domain Name System Isaac Newton Anti-gravity Coriolis effect Agriculture Carbon dioxide Intelligent design movement
