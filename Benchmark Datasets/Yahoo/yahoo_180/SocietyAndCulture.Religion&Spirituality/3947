is it a sin to pray for somebody to die this is a tough one originally i would have said no to those like hitler osama bin laden or just a rapist that de flowered your child but i think that while the person is alive we should be praying for their immortal soul like paul they could have a conversion and do great good but even if all they did was die sin free that would indeed be a miracle while it may seem to be a paradox i still believe in the death penalty there will be those that refuse to repent plenty of time should be given so they can make peace and then remove them those that truly repent i would not mind seeing them released but if it is a ploy i have no problem with them being deleted Original sin Sin September 11, 2001 attacks Charles Grandison Finney Soul Osama bin Laden Evil Abrahamic religion Divine grace Reincarnation Amidah Phaedo A Course In Miracles Background history of the September 11, 2001 attacks John the Baptist Hell Eastern Orthodox Church Purgatory Indulgence Immortality Bill Clinton Capital punishment Priesthood (Mormonism) Responsibility for the September 11, 2001 attacks Antichrist Sunni Islam Duties of the Heart Summa Theologiae Salvation Church of Christ Repentance Religious pluralism Theodicy Person of the Year Mother Teresa Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Duke Nukem 3D Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Neoconservatism in the United States 1998 U.S. embassy bombings Death Alan Campbell (pastor) Excommunication Christian views of Jesus Nachman of Breslov Sola fide Resurrection of Jesus Abu Musab al-Zarqawi Baptism Bertrand Russell Merit Infant baptism Political decoy Incarnations of Immortality 2003 Invasion of Iraq Great Jubilee Prevenient grace Jewish principles of faith 613 mitzvot Robert Fisk Baptist Opus Dei Maimonides Jewish eschatology Israel ben Eliezer Book of Mormon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Canonization Mortal sin John Howard Yoder September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for September The Fall of Man Osama tapes Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Jesus Ludwig Wittgenstein Propaganda Bin Laden family Intercession of saints Qiyamah Patty Murray Roman Catholic Church U.S. government response to the September 11, 2001 attacks 2004 Osama bin Laden video Team America: World Police John Berryman Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Videos of Osama bin Laden Vishnu sahasranama Confession Stoicism Ayman al-Zawahiri Virgin Mary in Islam Jubilee (Christian) Anselm of Canterbury
