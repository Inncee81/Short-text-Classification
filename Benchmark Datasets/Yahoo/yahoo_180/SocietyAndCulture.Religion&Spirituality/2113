i am skeptical of this did the ayatollah khomeini really say this quote a man can have sex with animals such as sheep cows camels and so on however he should kill the animal after he has his orgasm he should not sell the meat to the people in his own village however selling the meat to the next door village should be fine ayatollah khomeini tahrirolvasyleh fourth volume darol elm gom iran i have found this in many places on the web see below and i am highly skeptical of this however perhaps some shia readers have a copy of this volume and can confirm or deny it thanks http www realityspoken com unwisequotes http www freethinker co uk p http www cubamania com cuba showthread php threadid i'm not a fan of the old bastard but i'm afraid the quote is wrong what it actually says is one of things which will cause an animal to be haram although it was originally halal is a human having sex with it and because of this work sodomizing the animal its meat and the meat of its lamb which will be born after sodomizing will all be haram along with its milk wool and hair if the animal which someone had sex with is an edible animal like a sheep cow or camel it should be killed zebh and burned if it is one of the animals which is not usually eaten but is used for riding and transportation like a horse or donkey it should be taken out of the city and sold in another city Livestock Taboo food and drink 613 mitzvot Milk Dairy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Meat Vegetarianism Kashrut Horse meat Domestic sheep Camel Slaughterhouse Zoophilia Cat Veganism Ruhollah Khomeini Domestic goat Iranian Revolution Working animal Goat Cattle Unclean animals Apostasy in Islam Stock car (rail) Sheep husbandry Halaal Agriculture Salman Rushdie Castration World Wide Web Sharia Wool Horse Pern People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Kosher foods Domestication Vegetarianism and religion Kangaroo Mahmoud Ahmadinejad Hybrid Saddam Hussein Orgasm Llama Shi'a Islam Cheese Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Iranian presidential election, 2005 Book of Isaiah Lamb (food) Web server Guns, Germs, and Steel Sin City Beef Najaf Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Rais massacre Pork Qom Roswell UFO incident HyperText Transfer Protocol Agriculture in Australia Sheep Joke Anthrax Uniform Resource Locator Elephant The 120 Days of Sodom Dairy cattle Korban Narnia Trigun Ali Khamenei Animal husbandry Timeline of 20th century Islamic history Cuisine of Africa Gelatin Domestic rabbit RuneScape quests Guinea pig Bastard!!
