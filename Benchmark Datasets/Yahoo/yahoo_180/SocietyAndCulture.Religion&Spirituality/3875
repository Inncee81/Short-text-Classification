jehovah's witnesses why do you believe christ was the first of god's creations when john says the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god he was in the beginning with god all things came to be through him and without him nothing came to be what came to be through him was life and this life was the light of the human race jehovah's witnesses believe that jesus is actually michael the archangel how and where they get this from i do not know but that s what they believe they say that michael was born as a human named jesus lived a perfect sinless life and died for our sins he was not divine in any way after his resurrection which was only of the spirit and not of the body and spirit he simply returned to heaven as michael the archangel several problems with this if jesus is an angel then is means he is a created being like us and not god the son second person of the holy trinity that being the case several instances in the bible instantly become wrong first jesus is our judge and forgave sin however christians understand and know that only god can judge and forgive sin so then if he is nothing more than a spirit creature angel how could he be our judge and forgive sin second in the bible there are several scriptures showing that jesus was worshiped this happened when he was on earth and happens now in heaven if he is a created being like us then no one on earth or in heaven could worship him or they would commit idolatry remember the second commandment thou shalt have no other gods before me thirdly and this is somewhat of a minor point the witnesses have jesus as an archangel and believe that this is the highest form of angel they have it backwards there are actually classes of angel and the archangel is one of the lower ranks despite what the jw s think seraphim cherubim thrones dominations virtues powers principalities archangels angels as you can see the archangel is second to last anyway hope my comments help god bless and take care Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Eastern Orthodox Church Mary, the mother of Jesus Original sin Christian eschatology God Sola fide Abrahamic religion Holy Spirit Christianity Fallen angel Baptism Jehovah's Witnesses Michael (archangel) Justification (theology) Soul Sin Nontrinitarianism Hell Jesus Summa Theologiae Hierarchy of angels Idolatry in Christianity Idolatry Satan A Course In Miracles Heaven Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Urantia Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Gabriel Religious perspectives on Jesus Prophet Roman Catholic Church Christian views of Jesus Blessed Virgin Mary Apostles' Creed Church of Christ, Scientist Mormonism Paradise Lost Book of Mormon Divine grace Binitarianism Resurrection of Jesus Virgin Mary in Islam Book of Isaiah New Testament Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sabbath God and gender Angels in Islam Repentance Articles of Religion (Methodist) End times Genesis John Howard Yoder Saint Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Qiyamah Eucharist Merit Confession Biblical inerrancy Religious Society of Friends Angel Sanctuary Origin belief Christian Godhead (Mormonism) Paul of Tarsus Dispensationalism Athanasian Creed Immortality Infant baptism Adam and Eve Theodicy Mormonism and Christianity Predestination Reincarnation Great Apostasy John the Baptist Mortification of the flesh Theosis Requiem
