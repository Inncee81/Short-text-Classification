catholic going to bar bitzvah i'm a catholic going to my friend's bar bitzvah and i have no idea what to wear bring how long it will take or anything like that please help thanks bar mitzvah a suit might be in order suit and tie or shirt and tie it's considered a somewhat formal affair you take them a gift as it is a birthday party the premier birthday party there will be a jewish ceremony with a rabbi and cantor and reading from the torah you will toast them with real wine it would be offensive not to toast them but it's only a shot glass full you can consider it communion as jesus was jewish and the drinking of wine is part of the jewish ceremony just don't be obvious or christian about it just remember jesus as you drink the wine and remember the birtday boy and your friend and you are honoring him his traditions and family as a christian and catholic it is your duty to honor and respect this privillage it is not a violation of any rules to particiapte you are not becoming jewish or leaving the faith you are simply honoring a good friend and his family in the way they choose to do things remember paul said christians are basically annexed in to the chosen people thing the jewish by way of jesus it's a very high honor for a non jewish person to be invited to a jewish ceremony it means you are a very special person to the boy and his family you can wear a skull cap don't forget the pope wears one remember the catholic religion is a modification of the jewish religion paul and peter put as much into it as they though the the roman pagans could digest then there will be a dinner there will be music singalong songs probably horrible accordion playing of a three to six piece reed and horn band maybe a dj these days who knows they usually do sing alongs substituting the birtday boy's name it's hokey but the grandparents love it and it's for the family to honor the coming of age this is you know basically what the cathliocs call first communion and you know girls buy special dresses for that and boys wear suits and it's very ritualistic and parents take pictures and slap you on the back and shake your hand so that is basically what this is equal to he is now considered a man an equal in the temple or church that's what first communion is all about you might be called up for a candle lighting ceremony as part of his friends and it might be best to let his senior jewish friend light the candle as they have more experience then you eat and talk and have fun if there's a girls coming of age event next door or something you can organize a raid with him and your firneds and do some real dancing unless of course it's conservative then only men can dance with men dinner is usually like half a chicken kosher of course which just means it's the upper portion and packaged under supervision of a rabbi kosher meats often taste better than regular meats it's a most of the day event if they do it up right maybe ask his jewish friends they you know what they are planning to wear generally it is semi fomal which means suit and tie like how people used to dress for church but don't anymore then again the jewish people may have also gone more casual too it's been years since i attended one so things may have changed alittle Birthday Coming of age Eucharist Sabbath Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eastern Orthodox Church Judaism Roman Catholic Church Mormonism and Judaism Ten Commandments Clergy Sukkot Priest Baptism Jewish services Mass (liturgy) Religious conversion Jewish holiday Kosher foods 613 mitzvot Kashrut Cliff Richard Rabbi Jewish bereavement Trinity Abrahamic religion Catholicism Who is a Jew?
