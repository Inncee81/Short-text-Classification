religious people a lot of times i see people claiming that you have to believe in whatever god goddess etc that they do or you don't get to go to heaven or their version of it do you people that do this realize that no human being can change a belief just because they want to you can't force yourself to think differently usually until you see a reason or proof and usually reading the bible or other book is not seen as proof here's an example there are really unicorns they live in the desert around my house you have to believe in them or my creator will string you up from the ceiling with floss so change your ideas right now because it's the right thing let me guess you still don't believe in unicorns that is because you can't force yourself to change a belief if it happens it does and if not it's no fault of your own so please don't say that we need to change our beliefs because we just can't it's not human nature the brain just wasn't built like that thoughts saying that changing a belief is easy is just like saying changing your skin color is sorry i didn't mean to attack or anything i just find it odd and annoying that people think it's so easy to do i think you are right i think it takes a movement of god in your life i don't know what else to say about it i recognized that moment when it came for me i responded to god i cannot honestly speak about anyone else i'm not them i don't know what they've been through i don't know what experience has led them to believe or disbelieve whatever they do and i don't know what god is doing in their life or has done for example i know life seems really unfair for a lot of people who have a hard luck story so how can i expect to persuade them that there is a loving god if i haven't experienced what they have so i just sort of leave it alone unless a person is genuinely interested or it just naturally becomes my turn in a conversation to give my two cents kinda like answering a question in y a so i basically believe that god is the one who actually does the converting and i just try to help when i can and mostly concentrate on not pushing it on anyone because i know that just pisses people off The nature of God in Western theology Theory of conduct Atheism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Religion A Course In Miracles Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Intelligent design Origin belief Predestination Supernatural Meaning of life Theodicy Creationism Afterlife Religious conversion Socrates Scientology beliefs and practices Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Human Trinity Simone Weil Resurrection of Jesus Jewish principles of faith Free will Dualism (philosophy of mind) Christianity Scrooge McDuck Judaism Soul Prayer Social rule Discordianism Charles Darwin's views on religion Evil Eastern Orthodox Church Francis Crick Themes in Blade Runner God Emperor of Dune Ten Commandments Existence of God Fundamentalism Al-Ghazali Goodness and value theory Faith and rationality Milton H.
