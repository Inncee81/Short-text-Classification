when we speak of spiritual sense of the word what do we mean by that i am having a conflict with the word spiritual or spiritually and the soul because allah swt says spirits or jinn s are not part of us they are separate creation so what is really spiritually if its part of the spirits jinn any clarity would be appreciated thank you salam swain yes that is why i am having this conflict the word spirit means nd creation of allah swt the jinn and if we associate spirit with human we have taken apples and oranages and mixed them just like they did with iblis and jibreal a s you can see how its error is prevalent inshallah i would say soulful and religion and then make a different one called spirituality emotions sister recon we don't say proud we say humble puffer fish takes hr to get back down to size after it puffs up and its in total wadu what about you we are not proud allah hates the proud tell your friends we are humble to be muslims and proud of muhammed saw and all the prophets a s and we are proud to be alive yes but not proud muslims error makes terror please convey the message to all this is what they see and allah swt hates the proud go read it salam correct this error before it corrects you inshallah be khair thank you swain in my opinion spiritual sense or power means real mind power on the other hand the meaning of spiritual and the religious becomes more common in hindu religion spiritual provides information about traditional sanskrit mantras chanting and worship etc to almighty many spiritual traditions promote courses of study in spirituality moreover the spiritual implies religious but converse may not be true and this is my own opinion that is why i consider spiritual power more superior than religious power the spiritual power is real mind power which direct connects yourself with almighty without considering any religion in my views the spiritual power comes out from soul or soul is the birth of spiritual power which can be said as sound of soul or more precisely inner sound as we know that soul is immortal and it cannot be destroyed by any weapon neither by fire nor dry by air etc similarly spiritual power comes out from its base or birth place that is soul i thank to the questioner to ask interested question for readers due to the fact that such question is not related with any particular religion of course such question may open a new era for all of us to learn the truth to know almighty Religion Soul Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chosen people Scientology beliefs and practices Hinduism Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Angel Abrahamic religion Islam Idolatry Nation of Islam Demon Simone Weil Guru Devil Mantra Exorcism Sikhism Fundamentalism Sant Mat Vishnu sahasranama Religious Society of Friends Love Prophet Mary, the mother of Jesus Prayer Religious pluralism Meaning of life Eastern Orthodox Church Trinity Sharia Predestination Creationism Bhajan Satanism Reincarnation Genie Human Philo Al-Ghazali Supernatural Yusuf al-Qaradawi Ten Commandments Judaism Bhagavad Gita Infant baptism Sin Rudolf Steiner Animism Theology Meditation Buddhism Baptism Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Ayyavazhi Smartism Monotheism Atheism Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses A Course In Miracles Apologetics Brahman Force (Star Wars) Vishnu Kuzari Evolutionary creationism Opus Dei Deconstruction Aikido John Howard Yoder Emanuel Swedenborg Religious conversion Apostasy in Islam Christianity Rudolf Hermann Lotze Urantia Spirituality Anthroposophy Arabic alphabet Sufism Islamic philosophy Criticism of Islam Eastern philosophy Sri Aurobindo Faith Adam and Eve
