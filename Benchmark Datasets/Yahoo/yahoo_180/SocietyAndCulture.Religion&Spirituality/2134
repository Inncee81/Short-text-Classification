what time of the day is usually the most intimate between you and the lord jesus some of us like to wake up a few minutes earlier in the morning to seek the lord as the rising dawn to seek his fresh presence and be fed by him as the manna some at noon when the day presses in and some at night to close off each day and reflect on how that day weighed in terms of eternity what you learned from that day what you wish u had done differently each day we should have some time set aside to be with the lord tell me about yours morning quiet times were always the most effective for centering me but the times when christ is actually most precious is the dark times of the soul usually during very painful periods of my life it usually gets to be between and am and there's no one to call but christ and then he shows me he heard me it's the knowledge that when i'm feeling so low that he's always near that is so precious example of him hearing me i became permenantly disabled after an accident in year after year passed and even my closest of friends fell away even forgetting my birthday even my sisters in dallas forgot my birthday my folks were harried with trying to get us moved to dallas and all the pitfalls that hit in between so they usually left a card on my bed and hurried on one year a couple of months before my birthday i heard a commotion at the back door and i went to find my dogs chasing something that ran into my house it was a baby blue jay bird i cared for it from my front porch it had this strange tangle of gray pinfeathers on it's chest one day it was gone on my birthday i was again alone no one called no one sent a card i wondered why i even still was living so useless in this world forgotten i asked god why i was forgotten then there was this incredible commotion at my back door horrible screaching was madly echoing i went to the door and opened it to find my blue jay tangled gray feathers on his chest all grown up sitting on the phone line near my back door singing his poor little heart out blue jay's can't sing mind you but the word came to me he's singing 'happy birthday' to you for me my god loves me so good every year since on my birthday a blue jay shows up on my window sill and it sings it's little screeching heart out it's nearly years now today august th i walked outside this morning and was greeted with loud shreiks of hysteria i thought sheesh birdy what's the problemo then i remembered i called to it come here little blue jay are you singing to me sure enough a blue jay came down out of the covering mulberry leaves and continued to screech it's little heart out thank you god for singing over me today zephaniah the lord your god is with you his power gives you victory the lord will take delight in you and in his love he will give you new life he will sing and be joyful over you peace The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story The Death Gate Cycle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Jazz Singer Cliff Richard Jon Secada Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sin City The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Slow Train Coming Time Out of Mind The Ashlee Simpson Show John the Baptist Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Social rule Miss Saigon Blonde on Blonde The Shining (film) Book of Isaiah Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Humphrey Bogart Salad Fingers John Howard Yoder Frankie Laine Past teachings of Prem Rawat The Emancipation of Mimi Bhajan Care Bears Kain (Legacy of Kain) Kodocha Love and Theft Little Britain Shen Gong Wu Harry Nilsson Carrie Jacobs-Bond Sabbath Columbine High School massacre Birthday Buddy Guy Paul Is Dead The Birds (film) Sydney Riot of 1879 A Course In Miracles Friends Charles Peace The Subtle Knife Dean Koontz The Inside Book of Mormon Link (Legend of Zelda) Milton H.
