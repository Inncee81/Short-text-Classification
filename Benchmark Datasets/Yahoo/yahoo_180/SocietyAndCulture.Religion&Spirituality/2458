do you believe in evolution is it a sciencetific fact no i don't believe in evolution i know that the process of evolution has occurred i have seen it a lot of people on this board confuse the process of evolution and the theory of evolution i'll clarify for those that care to read the process of evolution is simply a change over a long enough period of time that presents itself in an organism or population of organisms it has been seen in just about every phylum i can think of although i'm not sure if i've seen any papers documenting it protists just haven't looked the theory of evolution explains how the process works it is based on three facts that scientists have seen and also documented genetic variation mutation and natural selection the process of evolution is considered a fact or better stated evidence for the theory of evolution all these things are documented have been peer reviewed and are accepted by the scientific community there is no implication of god or the devil or allah or anything else in any of these things the evidence is based on purely observing natural phenomena and the theory is based on logic and deductive reasoning edit a couple of responses to answerers i believe in evolution as i believe in roulette wheels science can explain everything imaginable about a roulette wheel except who is going to win science can explain everything about evolution except what is going to win survival and what isn't this is good i hadn't thought about it that way before at least not in those specific terms but you're correct there is no implication at all of what will win and what will lose because it's almost impossible to predict with anywhere near close to certainty it can help predict what traits of an organism will survive over many generations with a given amount of information on the environment but it doesn't make any grand claims that one species or organ will survive and one won't it is fact only to those poor brainwashed intellectuals who refuse to accept that evolution other than minor variations is impossible if you would rather be ignorant that's fine with me just don't vote or procreate on behalf of the rest of the world nothing in science is 'fact' however its pretty much been proven to be true and if it isnt its still the best theory around explaining how humans came to be and yes i obviously believe in it the evidence is right there in front of my eyes i would only disagree on semantics science doesn't profess to be truth only descriptions of facts and evidence Scientific method Creationism Religion Karl Popper Meme Logic Macroevolution Supernatural Intelligent design movement Sociocultural evolution Natural selection Theory Philosophy of science The Origin of Species Evolutionary creationism Philosophy of mathematics Creation-evolution controversy History of creationism Teleological argument Sociobiology Atheism Theory of conduct Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Flood geology G__del's incompleteness theorem Mathematics Epistemology Teach the Controversy Young Earth creationism Franz Boas Irreducible complexity Randomness Falsifiability Francis Crick A New Kind of Science Evolutionism Deconstruction Darwin on Trial Reincarnation William A.
