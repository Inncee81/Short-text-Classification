christians question about faith i realize the whole point of faith is to believe without proof but why would god choose faith as the way to him when he already knows that isn't going to be good enough for so many people atheists for example are usually intelligent good hearted folks who simply refuse to believe in something that can't be proven does god have a certain standard of people he wants in heaven is this his own survival of the fittest for heaven is it so the only ones who make it are the ones who have enough strength of character to have faith in something that reveals itself to none of our physical senses i believe in god but i have so many questions about his methods interesting question and one that i can't answer with certainty because i'm not god as such i can't presume to say why he emphasizes faith or if he wants a certain standard of people however i can speculate a bit smile perhaps the five physical senses you mentioned aren't the only ones human beings have the ability to use and perhaps god does want to have fellowship with people that can use more than their physical senses to view the world and make decisions after all if we are removed from the limitations of the physical body when we die then people that can't operate outside the physical senses would be quite unable to function if man is wholly defined by his physical body then god would know that and if he desired a relationship with his creation then it makes sense that he would reveale himself to people in a way that could be perceived by the five senses if man is more than his physical body then perhaps faith is the sense of the part of us that god most wants to reach it is also possible that choosing to exercise that faith could be the trigger that allows man to perceive god with his physical senses that faith provides the necessary calibration to allow the physical senses to perceive the presence of god and don't forget that the physical senses can lie to us if you've ever seen a mirage in the desert you know what i mean i'm not discounting the value of our physical senses but i've lived long enough to know that if those senses are the only tool i have for perceiving the universe then i'm going to make a lot of mistakes i'm going to eat things that taste good but are bad for me even poisionous one final observation is that god has tried the physical senses strategy at many different times throughout history for example in the old testament the isrealites had physical proof of the existence of god through his actions in delivering them from slavery in egypt they certainly saw the boils and insects and all the plaguest they heard the cries of the suffering they felt the dry land as they crossed the sea and they saw the pillars of fire and within days of seeing and hearing and smelling et cetera all this physical proof they still choose to melt down their jewlery and build a golden calf to worship Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theodicy Religion Ten Commandments Existence of God Idolatry Simone Weil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Supernatural Creationism Meaning of life The nature of God in Western theology Biblical inerrancy Atheism Eastern Orthodox Church Human Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Roman Catholic Church Soul Summa Theologiae Origin belief Christian eschatology Sin Original sin A Course In Miracles Predestination Causality Determinism Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Religious conversion Free will Justification (theology) Merit Jewish principles of faith Perseverance of the saints Urantia Theory of conduct Intelligent design Sola fide Immortality Salvation Philipp Melanchthon Creation-evolution controversy Reincarnation Intelligent design movement Resurrection of Jesus Al-Ghazali Fundamentalism God and gender Friedrich Schleiermacher Angel Heaven Book of Isaiah Maimonides Victor Cousin Evolutionary creationism Human nature Qiyamah Utilitarianism Trinity Judaism Philosophy of religion Calvinism Genesis Phaedo Philosophy of mathematics Gospel of Thomas Ontological argument Piccolo Junior Saga Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief John Howard Yoder Duties of the Heart Gnosticism Mary, the mother of Jesus God Emperor of Dune Anthroposophy Rudolf Hermann Lotze Presuppositional apologetics Goodness and value theory Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Scientology beliefs and practices Christianity Abortion debate Richard Allen (reverend) Vulcan (Star Trek) Scientific method Cultural relativism Plagues of Egypt Infant baptism Liberal Christianity Evil Consciousness Exorcism
