do you think a bunch of guys got together and wrote the bible and said this they made it so that woman would look slightly inferior to man as a ploy to stay in control and brainwash women and men that women were somehow inferior that gave them the edge also they wrote rules in there so humanity wouldnt get out of control 'your creator' wrote this so it must be true but a bunch of men from the old times just wrote it true or false i don't think they wrote it to make women look inferior however i do believe those men thought women were inferior i tried to read the bible and got disgusted with it because over and over and over again it degrades women more or less refers to them as sneaky luring and enticing whores who will ruin a man cause him to cheat on his wife and lose his heavenly inheritance that was just within the first pages so then i skipped to proverbs and it was more of the same god did not say those things and i refuse to believe that he did was all of the writing inspired by god i beg to differ furthermore bible researchers and historians all acknowledge that much of the bible was rewritten during the s and s by men don't get me wrong i believe in god but do i take the bible literally word for word heck no what really makes me laugh is that many of those who disagree with you haven't even taken the time to read the darn book they just repeat what they hear like little parrots Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bible Ten Commandments God Charles Darwin's views on religion Discordianism Church of Christ Prophet Book of Mormon Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Philosophical skepticism Creation according to Genesis Religion Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Opus Dei Angel Urantia Time Out of Mind Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Church of Christ, Scientist Trinity A Course In Miracles Eastern Orthodox Church New Testament Presuppositional apologetics Jewish principles of faith Chosen people Biblical inerrancy Fundamentalism Creationism Religious conversion Resurrection of Jesus Nation of Islam Socrates Book of Revelation Predestination Abrahamic religion Jews as a chosen people EastEnders Documentary hypothesis Dispensationalism Ontological argument Mormonism and Christianity The Origin of Species Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Satan Sabbath Paradise Lost Fallen angel Joke Genesis Tetragrammaton Evolutionary creationism Religious Society of Friends Alan Campbell (pastor) Media and ethnicity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Social rule Spidey Super Stories Humphrey Bogart The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Leviathan (book) Antichrist Devil Scopes Trial The Dunciad Intelligent design movement Apocrypha Soul Religious pluralism H.
