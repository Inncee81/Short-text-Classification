why do anti choicers lie to get their point across pro lifers anthropomorphize a blob of cells with no brain or consciousness no ability to suffer or even be aware of what is happening to it when a pregnancy is aborted into something that actually has an internal monologue saying things like i don't like that doctor and generally frets about being aborted they have a habit of attributing qualities to blastocysts embryos and fetuses that even newborns and toddlers don't have that is ludicrous also it's only called a fetus from the third month onward and the vast majority of abortions are done way before then pro lifers who always seem to be in favor of the death penalty interestingly enough make the molehill of an unfeeling non sentient blob of cells less than an inch long inch at the two month mark into the mountain of a child physically indistinguishable from a newborn who not only can magically feel pain but is somehow imbued with more self awareness and sentience than a newborn it's shocking and hilarious how little understanding these idiots have following is the type of crap anti choice jackoffs make up to try and demonize abortions with my commentary added this is a 'meme' that i've seen pro lifers spread around a lot and actually use as an argument it has not been cut in any way month mommy i am only inches long but i have all my organs i love the sound of your voice every time i hear it i wave my arms and legs the sound of your heart beat is my favorite lullaby lol right out of the gate we are swamped in bs a four week old embryo is at most one fifth of one inch long it has almost no internal organs no ears to hear a voice or another's heartbeat nor arms nor legs to wave the only thing it's got is its heart which only begins to beat on day month mommy today i learned how to suck my thumb if you could see me you could definitely tell that i am a baby i'm not big enough to survive outside my home though it is so nice and warm in here sorry embryo the pro lifers are still telling dirty lies the irony of me pretending to directly address an embryo is intentional satire people p you have no real thumb to suck yet hell no real developed mouth to put it in either and even if you did thumbsucking is only shown to start happening around month three months later and if you were to see an embryo at this point without magnification you would think you were looking not at a baby but at a fleshy bean because that is the shape the embryo is and it's also only about an inch long at eight weeks attention take note that it is by this point that the vast majority of abortions have already occurred abortions that happen after this point happen more because of a health risk to the pregnant woman than for any other reason therefore the very few valid points interspersed beyond this point matter very little overall month you know what mommy i'm a girl i hope that makes you happy i always want you to be happy i don't like it when you cry you sound so sad it makes me sad too and i cry with you even though you can't hear me okay i'll let them get away with this because it's at week twelve the last week of month you barely made it when sex becomes distinguishable so hooray the pro lifer makes their first true statement unfortunately it's followed by a very false one it's not possible for a fetus to cry not before it's got air in its lungs sheesh month mommy my hair is starting to grow it is very short and fine but i will have a lot of it i spend a lot of my time exercising i can turn my head and curl my fingers and toes and stretch my arms and legs i am becoming quite good at it too again we've got a 'half truth' in here the development of the lanugo the hair that's being referred to does happen here but it's temporary it's gone before birth and for reference this fine hair covers much of the body we're not talking about 'head hair' here which some newborns have and others don't the fetus is capable of basic movement by this time so the last sentence is alright i guess month you went to the doctor today mommy he lied to you he said that i'm not a baby i am a baby mommy your baby i think and feel mommy what's abortion this is some of the most obvious anthropomorphization yet guys children don't have anything resembling sense of self identity until several years after birth much less a fetus having the capability to literally disagree with something of course that is also not mentioning the fact that a fetus doesn't understand english again jackoff pro lifers are attributing qualities to embryos and fetuses that even newborns don't have month i can hear that doctor again i don't like him he seems cold and heartless something is intruding my home the doctor called it a needle mommy what is it it burns please make him stop i can't get away from it mommy help me let's start at the beginning a fetus doesn't even know what a 'person' is much less have the ability to 'dislike' a specific person or for that matter know his her gender much less profession again not even newborns are capable of this the fetus here is shown asking about things in the same way that one would only expect a child of or years to be able to shrieks of pain and cries for help are attributed even though the actual process of abortion at this point again i can't reiterate enough that it is extremely rare in the third trimester let alone the second and done most often because the pregnant woman's health is at risk is still nothing like the kind of prolonged agony a pro lifer would like to have you believe it is month mommy i am okay i am in jesus's arms he is holding me he told me about abortion why didn't you want me mommy again no sense of self in a fetus it doesn't even know what a 'mommy' is much less who it should refer to that way or even how to tell the difference between people the why didn't you want me at the end is a fallacious appeal to emotion which dodges the reality of the situation even if you don't abort an unwanted pregnancy it's still an unwanted pregnancy going through the whole pregnancy and having the kid grow up to truly with the level of understanding these idiot anti choicers would like to have you believe a freaking embryo or fetus has feel unwanted and know that their whole life was a 'mistake' is that really better than stopping an unwanted pregnancy as soon as possible think about it without a religious crutch or fantasies of embryonic sentience and you'll know the answer p s the majority of pregnancies are miscarried before the mother or obviously the embryo is ever aware of what's happened more information http www demnos com blogs stories baby thoughts htm a blog entry containing the source for the dishonest abortion 'account' i ripped apart apparently its initial form was that of an e mail chain letter http www womenshealthmatters ca centres pregnancy pregnancy second html http www stronghealth com services womenshealth maternity trimesters cfm this and the source above are where i got the real information about what goes on during pregnancy and what the embryo fetus is and is not at a given point in time http blog youngpeoplefor org story someone else exposing the flaws in the same account http www everything com index pl node id a source showing just how many pregnancies 'abort' themselves with no outside intervention less than two thirds of pregnancies make it to birth it's interesting how no one is addressing the question the above is an exposition of anti choicers lying about embryonic fetal development just plain lying in order to make abortion sound worse than it is i notice none of you anti choicers have any objection to the lies i exposed that's very telling you know the ends justify the means for you guys huh how disgusting when the facts don't support you just lie right you lot sicken me because they are blinded by ignorance first most abortions are related to the woman's age accordingly to researchers the number of teenage abortions has increased each year one million american teenagers become pregnant and of these pregnancies are unintended about of pregnant teenagers choose to have an abortion rather than raise a child second the concept of when life begins is essentially religious if one accepts that life begins at the instant of conception it means that a soul enters into the fertilized egg at this moment and when an abortion is performed a life is ended now we must consider who has the right to end the life of another human being third the baby medically becomes alive at around weeks when it can survive without the mother fourth what about anencephalic baby born without a brain but still has a brain stem imagine you have wanted a baby for all of your adulthood and have tried for years without success finally you get pregnant you find out the baby is anencephalic would you rather have the baby only to watch it die minutes to hours after birth or have an abortion and try again the baby cannot feel pain cannot see can barely breathe and sometimes can't by itself it has nothing about it you can literally hold it up to a light and see the light on the other side through the baby's pink little head seriously you are going to deny a woman her right not to feel as much pain fifth freedom is a right freedom is having the choice to make decisions and actions that change you and those around you you take away a persons freedom when you take away the right to their body don't think i'm pro abortion i'm pro choice abortion should usually only be used when needed and it's not very good if it's used as birth control but still it isn't your life to run and it's not your choice to make
