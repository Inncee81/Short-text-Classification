muslims and music ok as many of you already know i am interested in islam so do not take my questions offensive is there any restrictions in islam as of what type of music one can listen to can one attend concerts would it be a sin if i go to the beach and i don't cover my head thank you all for your inputs thank you for this opportunity and may allah swt bless you always if you choose or you don't choose that is your choice ultimatly and that is for you given as a gift first muhammed saw didn't have electricity so just be smart about it inshallah as a joke mo got no mp or ipod secondly don't announce anything to anyone before you announce it to allah swt cause he must be allowed to intervien and you cannot just sit on the fence and think the barn yard dogs are not going to come looking for meat so again be careful your best is the quran in english right now no ok its not the word of allah swt only the arabic is but its quite a unique structure that doesn't rely on nouns and verbs to hold it together like we know all other religions of the world again another proof from allah for you as you exist he is preparing your home in heaven al hamdoullah inshallah ameen third if your not thrashing about like mental case and using the music as a means to attract others then ok go nuts hahaa so that is double negative that means postive yes you can listen but if it defaces the lord its what is called makroob allah don't care he is absolute it don't bother him one bit its only transgression against ourselves that we end up seeking and that is not his will so when we say oh god well he says yes what can i do for you you calling on me first or your money or whatever you made before me more important didn't i give you life he will say to you and then death and then ultimatly life eternal where choose not me you will not be able to deny him at that time surely all things will be revealled so again be careful you can do what you like with your hair but you can talk to you sister beside you that are strong for that guidance there is many posts no man can tell you anything about it in force only in peace so again be careful the beach is not really the best place to go unless its private cause your exposing your fruits and seeing others but its not haram its just frowned upon alot is frowned upon and alot is not and there is limits set by your lord surely the absolute one has order you must seek that order to match your soul its custom fit for you only you ok nor i or any muslim on this planet can choose that that is for you salam God Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Predestination Qur'an Abrahamic religion Women in Islam Mary, the mother of Jesus Apostasy in Islam Virgin Mary in Islam Original sin Religious pluralism Isa Sharia Religion Allah Islam and anti-Semitism Muhammad Nikah Mut'ah Sin Sufism Satanism Magic (paranormal) Religious conversion Nation of Islam Hell Qiyamah Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Poker jargon John the Baptist Adam and Eve Summa Theologiae The nature of God in Western theology Salah Salvation Kafir Angel Ten Commandments Saint Jizya Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Heaven Fundamentalism Meaning of life Soul Sola fide Muslim ibn Aqeel Exorcism Atheism Love Moral objectivism Theodicy Repentance Prophet Theory of conduct Fasting Five Pillars of Islam Arabic alphabet Angels in Islam Al-Ghazali Alawite Holy Spirit Hijab Eastern Orthodox Church Creationism Criticism of Islam Rich Mullins Jesus Abraham Polygamy 99 Names of God Talaq (Nikah) God the Father Religious views of suicide Idolatry Eid ul-Fitr Marriage Intercession of saints Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Al-Baqara Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Hizb ut-Tahrir Succession to Muhammad Singlish Irish syntax Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Roman Catholic Church Afterlife Divine grace Prayer Vegetarianism Status of religious freedom in Malaysia
