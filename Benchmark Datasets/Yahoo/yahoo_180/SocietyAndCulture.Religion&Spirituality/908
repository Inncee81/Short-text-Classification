what is the root cause of our society's troubles i heard roy hattersley blame poverty but i think he is wrong i think it is a lack of spiritual nutrition i would be grateful for your views thank you real poverty degrades people and often forces them to do desperate things that's why the bible writer of proverbs said 'keep falsehood and lies far from me give me neither poverty nor riches but give me only my daily bread otherwise i may have too much and disown you and say 'who is the lord ' or i may become poor and steal and so dishonour the name of my god ' that's why jesus said we should ask god for our daily bread another problem is explained in ecclesiastes 'when the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out the hearts of the people are filled with schemes to do wrong ' justice speedily carried out is a great bulwark against growing evil but when the wheels grind almost to a standstill and the judiciary is biased or corrupt evil escalates perhaps the apostle paul pointed to our individual responsibilitites by saying 'i have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation whether well fed or hungry whether living in plenty or in want i can do everything through him who gives me strength ' philippians godly contentment is a spiritual gift given to those who have learned to be busy waiting on the lord in faith and obedience doing those good works god has appointed for them to do for his glory and the benefit of others not themselves John Howard Yoder Ten Commandments Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sola fide Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Opus Dei Book of Mormon Justification (theology) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Eucharist Eastern Orthodox Church Epistle to the Philippians John Wycliffe Evil Religion Articles of Religion (Methodist) Creationism Summa Theologiae Authorship of the Pauline epistles Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Christian monasticism Salvation Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Simone Weil Resurrection of Jesus Leviathan (book) Soul Didache Original sin Mass (liturgy) Biblical canon Holy Spirit God Theory of conduct Catholicism Roman Catholic Church Appeal Pope New Testament Chosen people A Course In Miracles Great Apostasy Jewish Messiah Paul of Tarsus Philipp Melanchthon Book of Isaiah Catechism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Perseverance of the saints Biblical inerrancy Sin Bishop Apostle Devil Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Church of Christ, Scientist Saint Peter Merit Trinity Christian eschatology Jewish principles of faith Martin Luther Bah__'__ divisions Scientology beliefs and practices Salvation Army Restorationism Theodicy Council of Jerusalem Goodness and value theory Truth Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Paradise Lost Baptism Jehovah's Witnesses Vestments controversy George Fox Endowment (Mormonism) God and gender Revelation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abrahamic religion Sant Thakar Singh Apocalyptic literature Predestination Infant baptism Epistle to the Ephesians Second Vatican Council Religious Society of Friends Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
