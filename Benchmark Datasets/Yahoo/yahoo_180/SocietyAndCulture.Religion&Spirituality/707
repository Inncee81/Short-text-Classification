christians do you ever congratulate yourself on a job well done or is that too prideful continued during a conversation today with a friend of mine i was reminded of the final line from the devil's advocate vanity definitely my favorite sin this is a genuine question born of curiosity i want to know what christians consider prideful how they deal with pride in themselves etc do you acknowledge your skill and success when you've expertly solved a problem or completed a task do you enjoy the spoils of all your hard work do you agree when people compliment you do you ever strive to be especially attractive how do you determine what's prideful and what isn't and are there gray areas what do you do when you feel you're too prideful how do you avoid pride justin c'mon are you so jaded that you can't believe a person like me would simply be curious i love keanu reeves too and al pacino and charlize theron was soooo good too ever see sweet november there's a bit of a difference between self esteem and pride self esteem has a humility about it a sense of humour about one's self while pride looks down on others to build the self up there is no love involved self esteem asks what can i contribute while pride says what's in it for me looking especially attractive is different than pride consider the other sins like sloth and gluttony a fear of pride might make you fall into those sins taking care of your body and keeping clean and healthy are good for the soul too success and hard work are admirable qualities but pride can definitely detract from those fruits a no one is better than me attitude can result in feeling threatened and uneasy when someone more successful appears this can lead to envy another sin or inspire envy in others keeping the ego in check is a difficult task accepting a compliment gracefully respects another person's opinion i think it is mostly about balance as with most other religions most other religions strive to avoid the seven deadly too it does take work no matter what walk of life but no one said it was easy either Seven deadly sins Keanu Reeves Virtue Social rule Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Theodicy Theory of conduct Alcoholics Anonymous Paradise Lost Merit Sinfest Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Extreme Programming Original sin Jack (comic) The Amber Spyglass Evil Alexander Technique Philipp Melanchthon Karen Horney Eastern Orthodox Church Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Abortion debate Narcissism Reincarnation Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Soul Charles Grandison Finney Simone Weil Fallen angel Joseph Louis Lagrange John Wycliffe Religion Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Polyamory Summa Theologiae Homosexuality and Christianity Roman Catholic Church Alignment (role-playing games) Objectivist philosophy Duties of the Heart George Fox The Merchant of Venice Iago John Howard Yoder Homophobia Sin Love Sexual orientation The Brothers Karamazov Devil's Advocate (film) LaVeyan Satanism Scientology beliefs and practices Justification (theology) Plame affair Supernatural W.I.T.C.H.
