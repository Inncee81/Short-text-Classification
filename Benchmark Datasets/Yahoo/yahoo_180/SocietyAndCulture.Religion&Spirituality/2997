what is the difference between muslim women wearing the hijab and catholic nuns wearing the habit today why are they worn in the first place is it to show that men are superior in some way if not why don't men wear the hijab or habit in various cultures it is quite acceptable for a man to wear a skirt scotland england etc why are men who make their women wear these coverings not themselves made to do the same so as not to temp other women my experience and observation i was at an estate sale recently and a muslim family came there the husband wife and young boys the father and boys were dressed like any other american only the woman was in the hijab it was a very hot day and the mother was sweating buckets and frankly no disrespect intended quite smelly it was obvious her children adored her her husband walked around with a scowl and stared at everyone his wife had a gentle smile behind her veil and seemed contented as a non muslim it appeared to me that the wife was a lovely and very humble person the husband was very controlling and didn't appear kind jealousy this makes me wonder if the hijab is no longer a religious symbol but a means of oppresion for muslim women abused women of any religion or non religion are controlled women and learn to accept this as their normal way of life they become uncomfortable outside of their 'normal' way of life again just my observation so if i'm to understand the muslim who have responded the women are to be basically invisible accept for their voice and the men can't control their lust and may attack a woman due to lack of restraint so if a woman is raped it is the woman's fault because she exposed her face or a bit of arm whoa i'm glad i'm an american sorry i find that to be barbaric but then it is not my religion and every adult is entitled to believe the way they choose according to the laws of their country as to the nuns i think most have that one right their garment is worn to let the world know their faith and that they are not available for marriage as they serve a life of devotion to their church they too are to dress respectfully but this does not mean they are have to cover every square inch of their body to please god the rapist is cruel person who is not controlled by what the woman wears the attack is to cause pain and humilation because rapists are insane controllers corinthians for a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels the king james translation is a bit obscure in this respect as in many others but if you look at some of the other translations http bible cc corinthians htm it comes down to the same thing christian women should all wear a similar garment to their muslim sisters Women in Islam French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Eastern Orthodox Church Sharia Ten Commandments Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Clothing Headgear Marriage Nun Sabbath Mary, the mother of Jesus Veil Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Roman Catholic Church Sikhism Rape Theodicy Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses God Religion and sexuality Ordination of women Sola fide Soul Fundamentalism Polygamy Divorce Homosexuality and Christianity Trinity Circumcision Monk Salvation Islam and clothing Christian views of women Religious conversion Islam Anglicanism Noah Saint Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Religious pluralism John the Baptist God and gender Separation of church and state Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Mormonism Abrahamic religion Idolatry Sinfest Church of Christ Islam in France Supernatural Rule of St Benedict Mother Teresa Alawite Jehovah's Witnesses Endowment (Mormonism) Chosen people Isa Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Royal Assent Christianity Faustyna Kowalska Holy Spirit Paul of Tarsus The Two Babylons Origin belief Genesis Evolutionary creationism Abortion debate Grimke Sisters Yusuf al-Qaradawi Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Japanese tea ceremony Criticism of Mormonism Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
