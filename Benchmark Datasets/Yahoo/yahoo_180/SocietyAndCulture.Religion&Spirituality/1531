according to human standard the defintion injustice means a blunt statement of fact timely expressed is labeled untactful tactless because it is painful and embarrassing to guilty listeners so much like the atheists who are predominantly leftist in mind set demonstrates in their predictable behavior and especially so here in ya r s you can always see them protest to them truth is unjust to the unjust and must be suppressed because of the discomfort which it brings tell me it's not true those who are guilty or is my observation wrong c'mon prove your case and forever shame the devil the hypnopope must be the chief culprit going around hypnotizing every one with his weird and confusing brand of philosophy and world's view notice that you are adverse to my present which is good you see god's truth will torment you unceasingly until you surrender or you may go mad with the truth have you heard of going mad going against god's truth thatguyjoe sorry to disappoint you i am not who you think i am we are all born with a perception of morality even little children can tell you whether your behavior is fair or unjust we all detest injustice or any kind to resent injustice is supposed to be good without due deliberation this would apparently appear to be correct even to the most untutored of men to overcome outward injustice is to attain the obvious symbol of good in oneself to champion the cause of justice is desired by men for the ultimate apparent virtues of goodness and honor for centuries society has been in favor of what is called justice spiritually inclined persons are still persecuted by a multitude of pressures for living in contrast to the current standards of deceit the rebellious element of society who fall victim to dope addiction crime delinquency and mental illness often in reality are merely fighting against hypocrisy of social pressures becoming obviously unjust in their rebellion to the apparently just here is a strange underworld battle fought between hypocrites the holier than thou do gooders who are responsible for the rebellion of those who are now obviously wrong the downtrodden members of the human race who are usually the most gifted and who clearly see through the false standards of the piety set standard which uphold and sustain their own unholy image by their rebellion towards worldly and religious injustices and pressures the down trodden ones are only tricked into expressing the same evil attitudes of their enemy which side of the fence are you re phrased gifted people are a threat to the conformists who criticize them and ridicule them with unbearable often hysterical pressures the light of truth is an unbearable agonizing threat to the lives of the unspiritual the agony of being exposed in our wrong doing is more than any of us can bear soon the gifted one reflects the subtle undercurrent of insidious pressure by outwardly fighting back then expressing the same ugliness of his accusers tricked into bearing the stigma of their guilt the gifted person becomes confused at his own compulsive behavior he burns up his creative energies by fighting back and expressing the ugliness of society while society then becomes satanically relieved of a holy contrast then mad complacent do gooders sit back in mass judgment to punish the obvious offender what a screwed up world we live in pardon my vernacular strangely mixed up the cream of mankind find themselves tumbling down to the level of beasts because of their hate of hypocrisy i hope you are not one of those innocent victim joe thus enraged unable to think clearly more and more confused they must then bear the guilt of other men madmen crucifying their own wins in the flesh of good men to conform to the apparent goodness of the group offers a vain and empty life if we fight it we turn into guilty outcasts and obviously wrong even in our own eyes in this topsy turvy world evil rises to the top and good men are sinners men of faith prefer this crucifixion of the body by men rather than the crucifixion of their own souls faithless men bleeding into the ranks of swine would forfeit a hopeful heavenly palace for a solid earthy sty trading an unlimited hope for heritage for immediate certain hogwash by virtue of their emotional reaction of hostility they fall victim to other men there is a rebellion to create rather than a rebellion to destroy it is the trick of cruel men to throw the burden of their folly upon a scapegoat by irritating you with subtle petty meaningless injustice to tempt you into hating them thereby causing you to fall fall from your virtue and latent superior qualities hope this long diatribe help put some proper perspective on my part in answer to your protest correction mistyped below madmen crucifying their own sins not wins in the flesh of good men jesus' truth is offensive to many just like he said it would be Mahatma Gandhi Moral objectivism Soul George Fox Human nature Book of Isaiah Merit Ethics
