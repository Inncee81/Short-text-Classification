why is it that religious fundies only attack evolution what about quantum mechanics or relativity i've yet to see a question posted trying to debunk those 'wacky' theories is it because the fundies know that their feeble minds could never hope to tackle these complex theories seems to me that with the logical capacities that these people are working with they'd have serious trouble contemplating why their cars get hot in the sun honestly do they watch the flintsones like it's a documentary are they completely incapable of serious rationale discourse or are they just offended by the prospect that maybe the entire universe wasn't created for their viewing pleasure that they weren't made in the image of god that the bible isn't really infallible maybe they lost their ability to reason properly through some sort of natural selection within the church like killing whoever questioned the bible any thoughts historically fundamentalism was a response to the publication of darwin's origin of species and arose out of the distribution of a series of pamphlets called the fundamentals which insisted on the accuracy of scripture as opposed to the ideas expressed in darwin's work despite the passing of long years since origin's publication many people still find it difficult to grapple with the notion that humans aren't some special set apart creatures that have nothing to do with biology they like to think that they will somehow miraculously live forever in a blissful state surrounded by beauty and harmony the idea of death and the anihilation of the personality that must inevitably follow is one which fills them with horror and revulsion so they cling desperately to a fiction Creationism History of creationism Evolutionary creationism Charles Darwin Intelligent design Intelligent design movement Meaning of life The Origin of Species Supernatural Religion Charles Darwin's views on religion Species Bah__'__ Faith and Science Creation-evolution controversy Teach the Controversy Evolutionism Sociocultural evolution Natural selection Summa Theologiae The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Creation science Soul Flood geology Logic Philosophy of language Origin belief New Testament History of evolutionary thought Franz Boas Wedge strategy Young Earth creationism Immortality Determinism Predestination Modern geocentrism Fermi paradox The nature of God in Western theology Atomism Isaac Newton Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Theory of conduct Biblical inerrancy Public domain Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Fundamentalism Christian eschatology Theology A Course In Miracles Theodicy Ethics Mathematics Jewish principles of faith Scopes Trial Goodness and value theory Separation of church and state Evolution Quantum mechanics Inception of Darwin's theory Science Buddhism Many-worlds interpretation Ten Commandments Immanuel Kant Dialectic Patriotism Consciousness Liberal Christianity Rudolf Hermann Lotze Trinity Atheism Social Darwinism Albert Einstein Aesthetic Realism James Martineau Peter Singer Macroevolution Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Reincarnation Karl Popper Moses Artificial consciousness Sociobiology Friedrich Schleiermacher Phaedo William A.
