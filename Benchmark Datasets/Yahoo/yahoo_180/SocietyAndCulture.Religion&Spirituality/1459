atheists please answer do you believe all things that can't ever be scientifically proven are false or do you just think ideas which seem illogical are false do you consider atheism a religion btw i'm not religious and not an atheist or anything else if that helps i didn't give examples because i suspected that would bias the answers ok maybe i do need to give examples forces such as gravity magnetism et cetera are excluded everything we know about the universe shows us that it is amenable to reason besides if anything is not amenable to reason then we would have no way of knowing the truth about it anyway so it's axiomatic that any claim or assertion which is supported by neither reason nor evidence is unjustified that doesn't necessarily mean it's not true but it does mean that it's unjustifiable to state as a fact that it's true atheism is not a religion it is the absence of religious belief Atheism Religion Existence of God Agnosticism Creation-evolution controversy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Strong atheism Deconstruction God Theodicy Intelligent design Creationism Supernatural Evolutionary creationism G__del's incompleteness theorem Separation of church and state History of creationism Freemasonry Falsifiability Fundamentalism Epistemology Bertrand Russell Philosophy of science William A.
