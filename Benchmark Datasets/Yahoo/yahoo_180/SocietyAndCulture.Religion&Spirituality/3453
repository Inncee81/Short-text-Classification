muslims how many average muslims enjoy conversing about religion i have met one muslim in real life and she was really nice but it seemed like religion for her was an externally imposed part of her culture rather than something she was personally passionate about i would like to make friends with some real life muslims in my town because i want to discuss religion i really have no intention of converting i'm a lds christian i just want to learn about islam as one of the religions of the world that help people to reach for god if i make friends with muslims in my town i'm just wondering how likely it is that they will wish to discuss religion with me and still be my friend if i do not convert oh i live in australia maybe you can visit the masjid close to where you live explain you want to meet some muslim women who are interested in teaching you about islam and that you just want to learn and not convert i am sure you should be able to find a few willing to do so Religious conversion Islam Fundamentalism Muhammad Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Abrahamic religion History of Islam Vishva Hindu Parishad Predestination Islam and Judaism Status of religious freedom in Iran Marriage Nation of Islam Apostasy Hindu Supernatural InterFaith Religion in China Sin Prophet Status of religious freedom in Sudan Ahmed Deedat Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Hui people Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Trinity Meaning of life Religion and sexuality Isa Sociology of religion Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Dhimmi Southeast Asia Chosen people Theology Islam in the United States Bosniaks Religion Abraham Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia Religion in Hong Kong Christianity Magic (paranormal) Islam in Turkey Hijab Reincarnation Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs Jewish views of religious pluralism Ludwig Wittgenstein Baptism Islamic philosophy Paul of Tarsus God Evolutionary creationism Eid ul-Fitr Animism Shi'a Islam Mission (Christian) Criticism of Islam Chittagong Salah Historical persecution by Muslims Separation of church and state Love Religion in India Sharia Original sin Excommunication Hajj Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Jihad Judaism Subud Abu Bakr Islamic world Sufism Islam in France Virgin Mary in Islam Islamic conquest of Iran Historicity of Jesus Alcoholics Anonymous Religion in Israel Fasting Islam as a political movement Jew Islam in Algeria Iconoclasm Palestinian Aurangzeb Sexual orientation Islam in Bangladesh Mahatma Gandhi Malay people Islamic conquest of South Asia Alawite Yusuf al-Qaradawi Endowment (Mormonism)
