papal infallibility and pre martin luther christians from ce until martin luther cut the blanket the catholic church was the vessel carrying christianity through the centuries families warred over the papal seat false popes dual popes even popes who probably didn't believe in god fought for the power of the position one was exhumed ex post facto excommunicated and burned a week or so after his death i'm not certain when the papal infallibility thing came into being but i'm wondering if say cesar borgia enjoyed papal infallibility any christian scholars know the answer papal infallibility has certain strictures it doesn't mean at all that the pope can't make a mistake it means when they speak ex cathedra or from the chair of peter this means they speak with the authority of peter the first pope when it is an issue pertaining to what catholics must believe then as long as he says he's speaking ex cathedra he can't make a mistake actually there are very few instances when this happens the last couple of popes never made this kind of statement revision of my previous answer from wikipedia the free encyclopedia in catholic theology papal infallibility is the dogma that by action of the holy spirit the pope is preserved from even the possibility of error when he solemnly declares or promulgates to the church a dogmatic teaching on faith or morals as being contained in divine revelation or at least being intimately connected to divine revelation for all such infallible teachings the holy spirit also works through the body of the church to ensure that the teaching will be received by all catholics this doctrine was defined dogmatically in the first vatican council of according to catholic theology there are several concepts important to the understanding of infallible divine revelation sacred scripture sacred tradition and the sacred magisterium the infallible teachings of the pope are part of the sacred magisterium which also consists of ecumenical councils and the ordinary and universal magisterium in catholic theology papal infallibility is one of the channels of the infallibility of the church the infallible teachings of the pope must be based on or at least not contradict sacred tradition or sacred scripture papal infallibility does not signify that the pope is impeccable i e that he is specially exempt from liability to sin according to the complete idiot's guide to understanding catholicism in reality the pope seldom uses his power of infallibility rather than being some mystical power of the pope infallibility means the church allows the office of the pope to be the ruling agent in deciding what will be accepted as formal beliefs in the church since the solemn declaration of papal infallibility by vatican i this power has been used only once in when pius xii defined the assumption of mary as being an article of faith for roman catholics Fundamentalism Protestantism Papal election Theology Biblical inerrancy Filioque clause Sola scriptura Eucharist Jewish principles of faith Trinity Dogma Anglicanism Sola fide Pope Benedict XVI Holy Spirit Papal bull Syllabus of Errors Paul of Tarsus History of Christianity Philipp Melanchthon Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Johann Joseph Ignaz von D__llinger Immaculate Conception Tridentine Mass Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Religion Christianity and anti-Semitism Creationism Evangelium Vitae Papal Tiara Pope Paul VI Religious Society of Friends Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Existence of God Idolatry Angel Origen Indulgence God Baptist Modern geocentrism Ten Commandments Separation of church and state Council of Constance Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu Pope Pius IX Throne Sin History of the Roman Catholic Church Sign of contradiction Abrahamic religion Jubilee (Christian) Protestant Reformation Resurrection of Jesus Sabbath Jan Hus Nicene Creed Clerical celibacy Christian eschatology John Henry Cardinal Newman
