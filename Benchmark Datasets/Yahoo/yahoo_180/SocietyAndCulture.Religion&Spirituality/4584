the paradox of religions religion a believes that all beliefs are valid religion b believes only its belief is valid does religion a believe that religion b's belief is valid to elaborate if religion a believes that all beliefs are valid then religion a also believes that religion b's belief is valid but religion b's belief is that only religion b's belief is valid then does religion a believe in the belief that only religion b's belief is valid if yes then it is in direct conflict with religion a's belief that all beliefs are valid because religion b states religion a is not valid if no then it is in direct conflict with religion a's belief that all beliefs are valid because then religion a states religion b is not valid they cancel each other out the paradox of religion that's why i only believe in a god and never a religion the law of non contradiction says tha a cannot equal non a another way to state that is to say any two religions or philosophies and doctrines and statements or propositions that diametrically contradict each other cannot be both true since all religions diametrically contradict each other and they all say they are coming from god they can't all be true the possibility that they can all be true is ruled out but there are still possible alternatives they're all false one is true and all the rest are false i would rule out possibility for the following reasons if you look at archeology about half of the artifacts they find have to do with religion they find burials grounds that are religious in nature they find temple areas all cultures and all the different empires had some kind of a religion also man cannot do away with religion communism tried to eliminate christianity and all religion lenin said that religion was the opiate of the people he outlawed it and persecuted anyone who practiced religion yet communism could not conquer religion it eventually conquered communism man just seems to have an innate desire to know about god he seems to have been created that way for that reason i don't believe all the religions are wrong because if that were true than god would have created man with an innate desire to know about him not necessarily to know him personally but never left any revelation about himself logically that leaves only one possibility and that's that there is one true and all the rest are false which one is true first of all you would look for one of the big religions it couldn't be one of the smaller sects that only a few thousand people know about because that would be to say that god only revealed himself to a few thousand people worldwide i would look at all the big religions and pick one that seems to have the signature of god my pick is christianity the signature of god is prophecy in the old testament books that were all written anywheres from to years before christ was born there are prophecies of his first coming and specific details about his year life on earth there are over prophecies about his nd coming which is still to come what does that mean the gospels namely mathew mark luke and john are the story of the life of christ suppose mathew mark luke and john had just said 'i don't have time to write a book about the life of christ i'm too busy preaching the gospel' and they never wrote those books we still could have re created the life of christ from the old testament all written between and years before he was born in fact for the first years after the death of christ that is how the gospel was preached from the old testament the new testament hadn't been written yet the bible also had amazing insights into scientific principals thousands of years before those principals were discovered seventeen times in the old testament the bible says that god is 'stretching the heavens' for thousands of years bible scholars were puzzled about what that phrase could possible mean then in edwin hubble discovered that the universe was expanding and for the first time we knew what that phrase meant those and many other similar things are what i would call the signature of god no other holy book has those things mortimer adler was a famous philosopher he was also the chief editor of the encyclopedia brittanica for some years at the university of chicago he was also an athiest at the end of his life he decided to do a study on religion he studied religion for years to see if any of them could possibly be true he immediately ruled out all of the eastern religions because he said they all violated the rd law of logic the law of noncontradiction that left only religions christianity judaism islam although he felt that judaism and christianity were related as were all in some ways he picked christianity because he felt it's holy book had gods signature on it and he became a christian before he died god never put us on this earth with a desire to know him but with no revelation of him you say that's why i only believe in a god and never a religion what good does it do you to believe in a god and not know anything about him you could never know whether you were living the way he wanted you live and therefore could never know whether you were on your way to heaven or hell to know that you would need to have some kind of revelation from that god you'd have to have somekind of a holy book with that holy book comes a religion whether you like it or not i agree with you that the idea that all religions are true is self defeating but i don't see why one religion can't be true and all the rest false in fact i think that one is true
