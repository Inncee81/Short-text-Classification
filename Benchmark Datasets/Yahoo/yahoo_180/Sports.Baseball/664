do you truly believe that tom glavine may just well be the last pitcher to win games no absolutely not it'll be a while maybe at least years or so but i don't see why it won't happen again i mean glavine himself is a shining example of why it could people say five man rotations spelled the end of the game winner guess what glavine pitched his entire career in a man rotation occasionally he'd pitch games in a season but starts is not all that out of line for the league leaders these days people also say that pitchers not going longer in games reduces the number of decisions they get which if true is only marginal the percentage of decisions by starters on the average today is the same as it was in but again it doesn't affect glavine as much as he's never been a inning type guy he's cracked exactly three times in his career which top players in the league can do even these days bronson arroyo did last year and it was only a few years ago that roy halladay did and randy johnson did regularly glavine's never been one to go particularly deep into games either he averaged over innings a start exactly twice in his career i mean this is ridiculous people say he's the last game winner because no one else is on the immediate horizon but these things come in waves do you know how many players won games between and a span of years three will come again not in a good long while but it'll come again Toronto Blue Jays Greg Maddux Tom Glavine John Smoltz World Series Roger Clemens Baseball statistics Randy Johnson Starting pitcher Pitcher Baseball International League Pedro Mart__nez Tris Speaker October 5 in baseball Sandy Koufax Nolan Ryan 300 win club 2004 American League Championship Series Atlanta Braves Batting average 2005 World Series Seattle Mariners Hank Aaron Boston Red Sox Satchel Paige Chicago White Sox Oakland Athletics No-hitter Complete game 2004 World Series Win (baseball) Detroit Tigers 1991 National League Championship Series October 10 in baseball October 16 in baseball 2003 World Series Houston Astros Andr__s Galarraga Ty Cobb Los Angeles Dodgers Jim Palmer October 22 in baseball 1903 World Series 1987 World Series Firpo Marberry Jamie Moyer Bronson Arroyo Cy Young Grover Cleveland Alexander San Diego Padres Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim St. Louis Cardinals Softball Ichiro Suzuki Mariano Rivera Art Nehf Alex Rodriguez New York Mets 1919 World Series Ted Williams Wilbur Wood Dennis Eckersley Major League Baseball All-Star Game Florida Marlins Reggie Jackson October 1 in baseball Milt Pappas Babe Ruth October 28 in baseball 2005 English cricket season Red Sox Nation Don Newcombe Sammy Sosa Robin Ventura 2001 World Series Luis Tiant October 4 in baseball Bob Friend New York Yankees Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Manny Ram__rez Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 Pete Rose David Wells National Football League October 21 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Ravi Shastri Yao Ming Strikeout Willie Hern__ndez Marius Russo Claude Osteen
