does height really matter in baseball im years boy who dreams playing ball in the big league im currently ' '' and lbs and i think my final height would be around ' '' so i asked my self that how can i pitch against batters like ' '' im a pitcher btw i throw middle s right now but im sure i can throw at least high s in pro league i think most of the mlb scouters are looking for huge guys especially huge pitchers do you think i can make majorleauge with this height it really depends on who's looking you'll find some div college coaches that will tell you that they only look for pitchers who are over foot you'll find other scouts that will look more at control and speed i think the most important thing is to not get discouraged by looking too far ahead what i mean is just keep looking at the next level of ball that you need to get to in order to make your dream happen if your i'll assume that you are playing high school ball i'll take a guess and say that your playing at the junior varsity level the main focus you should have now is how effective your going to be at the varsity level if your at varsity you need to be looking to see how you can match up at one of the college levels and so on talk to your coach he can point you in the direction that you need to go if you get to the next level then you start to think of making a career of it just stay focused at what you need to do the problem at looking too far ahead is you might get easily discouraged if you go through a bout of bad starts and such i really hope your dream comes true hook me up with tickets when you make your first pro start Baseball Pitcher Softball Baseball statistics Sandy Koufax Tris Speaker Minor league baseball Major League Baseball Satchel Paige World Series American football Pedro Mart__nez Fast bowling Volleyball Chicago Cubs National Football League Randy Johnson Stolen base Negro league baseball Nolan Ryan Earned run average Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) Mike Piazza Strike zone 2004 World Series Andr__s Galarraga Houston Astros Starting pitcher Batting average Japanese baseball No-hitter Basketball 2005 World Series Perfect game Roger Clemens Reggie Jackson Knuckleball Designated hitter New York Yankees Home run Jerry Coleman Ty Cobb History of baseball in the United States Babe Ruth Hit by pitch Ben Sheets Bunt Field hockey Willie Mays Barry Bonds Ted Radcliffe Atlanta Braves Roger Federer Hank Aaron 2004 College World Series Umpire (baseball) Luis Tiant Cy Young Derek Jeter Fenway Park Mike Scioscia Jim Thorpe Florida Marlins Chicago White Sox Cincinnati Reds Super Bowl XXVII New York Giants Yao Ming Canadian football Squash (sport) Origins of baseball Pitcher's mound October 20 in baseball Rugby union Hideo Nomo 1919 World Series Tim Wakefield St. Louis Cardinals Jim Palmer Jerry Lucas One Tree Hill (TV series) Bryan Robson Greg Maddux Montr__al Expos Peter Shilton Texas Longhorn Athletics First baseman FC Rostov Eric Gagne Detroit Tigers San Francisco 49ers Major League Baseball All-Star Game
