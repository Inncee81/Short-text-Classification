cubs fans only playoffs i feel like every year no matter what happens we're not going to make it last night i watched the red hot cubs play like the first of the year cubs against the mets add to the fact that soriano is now out for a month i really feel like this is as close to getting in the playoffs as we could get the cubs were so hot for a month and a half and now they have seemed to just fizzle out their wins look like a strain to win rather than better baseball why can't things just work out also why is the bullpen so sporatic everyone talks about how great the bullpen is and what numbers they have put up but i dont see it i'm a cards fan but i'm still going to answer you pretty much have only one team to worry about and that's the brewers the cards are now out got swept by the nats ouch and don't appear to be getting any pitching back so i'll cheer for them but it's going to take a christmas miracle anyways the brewers appear to be falling faster than the cubs and i believe the cubs can make the playoffs but getting beyond the nlcs would be doing more than i would predict World Series St. Louis Cardinals Major League Baseball television contracts Chicago Cubs Detroit Tigers Boston Red Sox Chicago White Sox New York Mets Florida Marlins Curse of the Billy Goat 2005 World Series October 12 in baseball Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Toronto Blue Jays October 4 in baseball Wrigley Field San Francisco Giants 1957 World Series 2004 World Series Milwaukee Brewers Houston Astros Oakland Athletics International League October 10 in baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) National League San Diego Padres Sandy Koufax Steve Bartman MLB on NBC Cincinnati Reds Hank Aaron October 9 in baseball Los Angeles Dodgers October 15 in baseball New York Yankees Pittsburgh Pirates Satchel Paige Cleveland Indians October 3 in baseball 2004 American League Championship Series 1986 National League Championship Series Reggie Jackson Philadelphia Phillies Baltimore Orioles October 1 in baseball Babe Ruth's Called Shot Ty Cobb 1987 World Series 2003 World Series Terry Francona Playoff Kerry Wood (baseball player) National Football League White Sox-Cubs rivalry New York Giants History of baseball in the United States 1986 World Series Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Tim McCarver Miami Dolphins Sammy Sosa October 8 in baseball Vin Scully MLB on FOX Jerry Coleman Red Sox Nation Minnesota Twins Babe Ruth ESPN25 Robin Ventura New York Knicks Baseball NBA Finals October 16 in baseball October 14 in baseball Mois__s Alou 2005 National League Championship Series National Football League Lore October 21 in baseball Interleague play Pete Rose Los Angeles Kings Jamie Moyer October 2005 in sports September 2005 in sports October 7 in baseball 1999 National League Championship Series Rick Aguilera October 5 in baseball National Hockey League rivalries Pittsburgh Steelers Buffalo Bills Darryl Strawberry Torii Hunter Cap Anson
