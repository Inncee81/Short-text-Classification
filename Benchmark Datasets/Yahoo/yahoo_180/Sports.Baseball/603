why do people think glavine will be the last game winner really the two main arguments are that five man rotations are going to reduce starts and therefore wins and that starters get fewer decisions because they'll be yanked earlier but glavine himself pitched in a man rotation for his whole career and was never a really huge workhorse only topped ip times which guys like randy johnson exceeded regularly only a few years ago hell bronson arroyo had ip last year and in spite of that glavine still won games the increased use of bullpens hasn't really had an effect on the number of decisions by starters according to the ny daily news last week starters get roughly the same percentage of decisions as they did years ago plus bullpen use may actually preserve leads these days you usually don't see a starter go an inning too long and unravel like you might have in years past actually the idea that there are more no decisions in baseball than before is a myth like i said above according to the daily news starters get the same percentage of decisions these days that they did years ago and glavine and maddux and clemens pitched in a man rotation his whole career it's the sort of mawkish soppy stupid storyline that the mediots like shovelling from their daily columns it carries melancholy overtones of we'll not see this again the times they are a changin' it was better back in the olde dayes all of which is nonsense but the proles seem to lap it up being a sportswriter means never having to be held accountable for anything you write Greg Maddux John Smoltz Toronto Blue Jays Roger Clemens Starting pitcher Pedro Mart__nez World Series 1957 World Series October 5 in baseball Tom Glavine 2001 World Series 300 win club Randy Johnson 2003 World Series Babe Ruth 2004 American League Championship Series Atlanta Braves October 10 in baseball 2005 World Series Sandy Koufax Detroit Tigers Chicago White Sox Boston Red Sox Florida Marlins Seattle Mariners Tris Speaker Jamie Moyer International League Win (baseball) Firpo Marberry Troy Glaus Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Hank Aaron October 22 in baseball Baseball No-hitter Red Sox Nation October 16 in baseball October 12 in baseball Nolan Ryan 2004 World Series Major League Baseball television contracts David Wells Baseball statistics Ty Cobb 1999 National League Championship Series Rollie Fingers Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Jerry Coleman 1903 World Series October 9 in baseball Houston Astros 1991 National League Championship Series Andr__s Galarraga October 28 in baseball Alex Rodriguez October 21 in baseball Grover Cleveland Alexander Reggie Jackson Jim Palmer Byung-Hyun Kim Bill James Manny Ram__rez Oakland Athletics Satchel Paige 1987 World Series Minnesota Twins October 20 in baseball New York Mets Earned run average Claude Osteen Batting average Los Angeles Dodgers Bronson Arroyo Dave Righetti October 13 in baseball Fernando Valenzuela October 4 in baseball Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game 1993 World Series Barry Bonds Chuck Dressen Tim Wakefield October 2005 in sports 2005 National League Championship Series Indianapolis 500 Johan Santana October 15 in baseball Chicago Cubs Al Leiter Salary cap October 1 in baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 October 26 in baseball San Diego Padres
