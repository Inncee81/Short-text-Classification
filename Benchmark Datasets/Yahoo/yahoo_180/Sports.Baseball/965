why does mlb allow their umpires to get and stay so damn fat do we really need another john mcsherry situation to happen for those of you who don't know who john mcsherry was he was a former mlb ump who was an ump for like years and around years ago he was working homeplate on opening day in cincinnati and like seconds into the game he basically fell right onto his face and died from a massive heart attack they said he was close to pounds how about that fat ass bruce froehming he has been an ump for like years and is retiring this year good riddance why aren't there weight standards that these guys have to adhere too in hockey the linesmen and refs are in shape granted they are skating the entire game burning off calories same with nhl refs running and nba refs running burning off calories but with baseball these guys are very stationary the whole game standing there etc i bet with all the star hotels they stay at on the road they eat lobster steak and drink beers every night whatever the reason it's not good for them to be fat like eric gregg who died last year of a stroke he was a black ump for like years and was huge come one guys put down the philly cheese steaks put down the hamburgers their has to be a way for them to become thinner fit is always better than fat mlb just really lets these guys pack the pounds on and i guess the umps union doesn't care about them it is very unhealthy especially in the dog days of summer like right now in a lot of the east coast states south and mid west like plus percent humidity and they wear black which attracts the sun and makes them even hotter and the homeplate guy must be even hotter with the mask and the equiptment i'm surprised that more of these fat umps aren't passing out on the field and having heart attacks strokes during the game like mcsherry mlb doesn't want that to happen again that was a very sad day for baseball stonewall jackson i'm just making an observation what is your deal don't you agree they are huge being fat is unhealthy duh good question maybe they let them stay fat because they want there to appear to be a presence behind the plate players may be more apt to mouth off if it was some puny runt making calls Baseball Major League Baseball television contracts World Series Houston Astros Major League Baseball 1919 World Series Softball Pete Rose Umpire (baseball) Hot dog 2004-05 NHL lockout MLB on FOX Hamburger Poker jargon Theory of conduct Cincinnati Bengals ESPN25 Salary cap Jackass: The Movie Atkins Nutritional Approach NBA Finals Boston Red Sox Satchel Paige Combine (Half-Life 2) Sports timeline Reggie Jackson June 2004 in sports Playoff Kyle Broflovski St. Louis Cardinals Social rule Toronto Blue Jays Chicago Cubs Obesity Negro league baseball Teen Girl Squad Laws of cricket Oakland Athletics Barry Bonds International League November 2004 in sports Vin Scully National Football League August 2005 in sports Baseball Hall of Fame Milk Babe Ruth Baseball statistics MLB on NBC October 2005 in sports Hank Aaron Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an June 2005 in sports Los Angeles Dodgers Shaggy dog story June 8 in baseball National Hockey League All-Star Game Mercury Atlas 6 January 2005 in sports October 20 in baseball Ron and Fez The Jim Rome Show Al Michaels Equine conformation Cheesesteak Jerry Coleman Stanley Cup New York Knicks Arizona State University Time Out of Mind Cincinnati Reds Game show Michael Jordan Detroit Tigers New York Yankees Billboard Hot 100 Swingout Cuisine of Denmark Super Size Me Internal ballistics Draw poker Little Britain Los Angeles Kings History of baseball in the United States Los Angeles Clippers Babe Ruth's Called Shot Wild at Heart (Buffy episode)
