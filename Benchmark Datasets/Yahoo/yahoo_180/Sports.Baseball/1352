how can i change a fast pitch softball swing to a slow pitch swing i played fast pitch softball through high school but now am now playing co ed slow pitch having a hell of a time not swinging too soon and i'm making contact too close to the grip any pointers starting stance starting bat position where should my weight be over my feet should i use as big of a bat as i can manage or small with slow pitch you want to wait and explode always swing at the very last possible moment good pitches will be good hits don't take a bad pitch in slow pitch they pretty much have to give you a cookie always be able to lift your front foot off the ground that is about on the badck and on the front stay to the back of the box i teach to hold the bat straight up and down so the knob is pointing to the dirt and the endplug is pointing strait to the sky this allows you to use an endloaded bat without feeling that weight you want to use an endloaded bat and as heavy as you can feel good with and as you get stronger move up a half an oz in weight the reason the ball goes far and hard is because the bat does not slow down much after contact if you have a bat speed of mph before contact and mph after contact you will hit poorly if you have a speed of mph before and after you will be over the fence swing hard and don't slow down at contact contact is the most important factor in hitting consistently well practice i mean really practice every bp day to watch the ball and bat touch the cneter of the ball and the centerline of the barrel the whole barell of the bat is sweetspot now with the composites but the farther out to the end you hit the more physics comes into play and you will get better power i always teach that if you cannot make perfect contact on a hit then why would you ever put a full swing on a ball i take a bucket of balls and have the batter just tap them back towards the field anywhere with no power or muscle into it just the bat and the ball like a bunt but with a little swing to it and no dampering this allows you to get the feedback of a perfect contact hit the ball will go much further when it is hit in the center and it hits the centerline of the bat barrel stance is not important you dont want to be moving and you dont want to move the bat around you stay still and explode at the last moment hit for perfect contact and don t slow down at contact swing hard through it with a big follow through i prefer having batters let go of the back hand right after contact so not to teach the brain to slow down becasue it will hurt by letting go this message never gets sent becasue it doesnt hurt try this until you understand it it will work i have taught it to many many people with great success boys and girls a few bp sessions and you will understand where to stand and how to wait and explode after about three tijmes of tapping balls tossed to you from a bucket and letting the bat tap them to the field you willstart to have perfect contact good luck Volleyball Aerial (dance move) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Laws of cricket Cricket Equine conformation Swingout Batting (cricket) Sandy Koufax 1957 World Series Baseball Stars Baseball statistics Bunt Fielding (cricket) Car handling Professional wrestling throws Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Pitcher Batting average Satchel Paige Tris Speaker Professional wrestling holds Table tennis Babe Ruth Ty Cobb English cricket team Sydney Riot of 1879 Baseball bat Internal ballistics Glossary of American football Tag History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Skateboarding trick Badminton Lindy Basic Yorker St. Louis Cardinals 2005 World Series Brian Close Indian Oil Cup 2005 Helicopter Poker jargon Tennis Electrophysiology Golf club (equipment) Ravi Shastri Tenshinhan Golf Circle (dance move) Pedro Mart__nez Ayrton Senna Four square Protoss 1986 World Series Terminal ballistics Babe Ruth's Called Shot Side pass (dance move) Parade (military) Wing Chun Rugby union Football (soccer) Rounders History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Field hockey First baseman Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Snooker Dog agility Rugby union positions Andr__s Galarraga Strike zone International League Baseball scorekeeping Squash (sport) Wind turbine Suplex Batsman 2004 World Series Mixed martial arts Wrigley Field Contredanse Types of bowlers in cricket Tai Chi Chuan Horse gait RuneScape quests Glossary of climbing terms Blood (computer game) Glossary of nautical terms The Shining (film) Out (baseball)
