will john smoltz make the hall of fame in my opinion i don't think he should but i think he will primarily because of he will be compared with dennis eckersley starter turned reliever who in years went with saves k's and era as oppossed to smoltz so far in seasons all with the braves has gone and saves k's and era smoltz is and i believe is signed for more seasons if he winds up pitching till he is he should get to wins and with wins and over saves he should be a lock by then also he probably will have k's when he's done http www baseball reference com s smoltjo shtml http www baseball reference com e eckerde shtml he's a lock for the hall one of the greatest pitchers of this generation i think if he wasn't a closer i think he would be around wins with his long time teammates of glavine and maddux i've never liked the braves but i always respected those guys when they were together and winning straight division titles Greg Maddux Dennis Eckersley Atlanta Braves Tom Glavine Toronto Blue Jays Rollie Fingers World Series October 3 in baseball 2005 World Series Roger Clemens Hank Aaron October 13 in baseball 1999 National League Championship Series Closer (baseball) October 22 in baseball Los Angeles Dodgers Sandy Koufax Boston Red Sox October 15 in baseball October 17 in baseball Save (sport) October 26 in baseball St. Louis Cardinals Kelvim Escobar Oakland Athletics October 24 in baseball October 16 in baseball Cincinnati Reds October 20 in baseball Baseball Miguel Tejada 1957 World Series Reggie Jackson International League October 4 in baseball Mariano Rivera Babe Ruth Satchel Paige Seattle Mariners October 21 in baseball Doyle Alexander Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Ty Cobb October 9 in baseball Eric Gagne Nolan Ryan Luis Tiant Major League Baseball Curt Schilling Cleveland Indians November 2 in baseball Pitcher Warren Spahn New York Yankees Grover Cleveland Alexander Andy Pettitte Starting pitcher Hal Newhouser Willie Mays Tris Speaker November 1 in baseball 1991 National League Championship Series Texas Rangers (baseball) Robin Ventura October 12 in baseball Pittsburgh Pirates Andr__s Galarraga Red Sox Nation Barry Bonds Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 1991 World Series October 28 in baseball 1987 World Series Randy Johnson Whitey Ford Tom Seaver 1988 World Series Win (baseball) Don Sutton Monte Ward Cy Young Phil Niekro Pete Rose Rick Aguilera The Sporting News Player of the Year Award John Wetteland Kansas City Royals Chicago White Sox
