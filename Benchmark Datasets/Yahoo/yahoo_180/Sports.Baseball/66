small market teams i answered a question about small market teams with a reference to the largest media markets in the country this challenges the notion that oakland part of the fifth biggest media market in the country and minnesota the th biggest are small market teams the smallest media markets with mlb teams are milwaukee cincinnati pittsburgh kansas city san diego baltimore and st louis thus i attempted to make the argument the cardinals are in fact a small market team that just happens to have tradition and a strong fan base going for them how exactly does mlb define a small market team and how should it and we as fans to me not having a strong regional television network does not by definition make you a small market team they are two different things i must be misinformed so can someone please rationally explain why the a's and twins should be considered small market teams in baseball thanks i don't think they look at the difference between a small market and a small fan base unfortunately and more so in hockey they look at the market to determine the feasibility of franchises and not the fan base if it was based on fan base no us city would get another nhl team same thing with baseball small fan base means a team really can't sell the property for much money which in turn doesn't give a lot of revenue for the team World Series Major League Baseball television contracts American Football League Oakland Athletics Detroit Tigers New York Yankees Major professional sports league Pittsburgh Pirates St. Louis Cardinals History of baseball in the United States AFL-NFL Merger Baltimore Orioles Atlanta Braves Milwaukee Brewers Pittsburgh Steelers Washington Nationals October 4 in baseball San Diego Padres Chicago Cubs Boston Red Sox Negro league baseball Minnesota Twins Houston Astros Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Minor league baseball Los Angeles Dodgers 2004-05 NHL lockout National Hockey League National Football League Salary cap Hubert H.
