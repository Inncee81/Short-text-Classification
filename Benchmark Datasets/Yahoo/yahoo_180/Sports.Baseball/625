in your opinion in mlb how valuable are most switch hitters do they really make a big difference for their teams or are they over rated in general i honestly believe that having a switch hitter doesn't make much difference most of the time a switch hitter will be good from only one side of the plate anyway the only benefit that i can think of with having switch hitters on your team is that it forces the opposing team to swap out pitchers more often to create better matchups in a three game series you can really wear out an opposing bullpen by bringing up a lot of switch hitters in the later innings Baseball statistics Designated hitter Baseball Batting average World Series Pete Rose 1957 World Series Switch hitter Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox Roger Clemens Chicago White Sox Interleague play Hank Aaron Major League Baseball All-Star Game Edgar Renter__a Houston Astros 1919 World Series Baseball Stars 2004 World Series Babe Ruth Manny Ram__rez Tris Speaker Barry Bonds Sammy Sosa St. Louis Cardinals Byung-Hyun Kim 2005 National League Championship Series Ty Cobb Sandy Koufax Stolen base 1986 World Series New York Yankees Red Sox Nation Earned run average October 20 in baseball Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Softball Box score (baseball) David Ortiz Pedro Mart__nez No-hitter Alex Rodriguez Oakland Athletics Andr__s Galarraga Satchel Paige Starting pitcher 2004 American League Championship Series October 21 in baseball Fenway Park 2005 World Series Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Home run Reggie Jackson 1977 American League Championship Series 2003 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates Al Leiter Baseball scorekeeping Playoff Luis Tiant San Diego Padres Major League Baseball Minnesota Twins History of baseball in the United States Firpo Marberry Angel Stadium of Anaheim Texas Rangers (baseball) Major League Baseball television contracts Curveball Casey Stengel Randy Johnson 2002 World Series Rudy York Ted Williams Bill Lee (MLB pitcher) Atlanta Braves November 1 in baseball New York Mets Florida Marlins Mariano Rivera 1981 World Series Edgar Martinez 1982 World Series Don Newcombe October 4 in baseball Dave Concepci__n Hal Trosky Japanese baseball Ozzie Smith Willie Mays Detroit Tigers 1987 World Series October 19 in baseball Robin Ventura Doug Mientkiewicz October 10 in baseball
