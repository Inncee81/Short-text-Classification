what makes baseball interesting to you for me it is that each stadium is unique in that some favor pitching some the batters and some depend on witch way the wind is blowing i like that fact that there is no uniform field so that it shows true skill by adapting to diffrent palying enverment everything you mentioned and more the fact that the elements play such a large part in the game that the mental game is so important and even the fact that you can see the player's expressions since it is slow enough to make them out baseball is a metaphor for life a lot of waiting around with a few moments of furious action and when it's all said and done we just want to be safe at home Baseball Softball St. Louis Cardinals Baseball statistics Pitcher Oakland Athletics Chicago White Sox Batting average Detroit Tigers Reggie Jackson Minor league baseball Texas Rangers (baseball) Seattle Mariners Lou Gehrig Final Fantasy magic New York Mets Wrigley Field Philadelphia Phillies 1919 World Series Boston Red Sox Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Babe Ruth Baseball scorekeeping Los Angeles Dodgers New York Yankees Interference (baseball) 1957 World Series Washington Nationals Cincinnati Reds Yankee Stadium Squeeze play (baseball) October 20 in baseball Cleveland Indians Houston Astros Bunt San Francisco Giants 2005 World Series Japanese baseball 1986 World Series Box score (baseball) Blackjack Ty Cobb Designated hitter Pedro Mart__nez 2004 American League Championship Series Manny Ram__rez Major League Baseball Baseball slang Montr__al Expos Chicago Cubs Atlanta Braves Jerry Coleman Home run 2004 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates Minnesota Twins Satchel Paige Carlton Fisk Willie Mays Umpire (baseball) Baseball Stars Origins of baseball San Diego Padres Andr__s Galarraga Nolan Ryan Stolen base Batting (cricket) Hank Aaron Topps Strikeout Hubert H.
