can you imagine if the guy who caught the home run threw it back in disgust imagine when bonds hit that hr and it was in some open location and this fan caught it relatively easy then he throws it back angrily i thought about this and i would think that fan would become an instant national hero he would get book deals talk show appearences making him more money than as if he was to keep the ball whats your thoughts on this if you did actually throw away the barry bonds' home run ball you'd probably be the most stupid person in the history of america which is pretty bad considering who america's most famous screwups are sure why should i hold the most valued piece of sports memorabilia in years why shouldn't i auction off the ball and make up to million dollars mcgwire's th in ' went for mil honestly if you did do that you wouldn't be a instant national hero it's not like every single person in america hates bonds did you see the footage of the guy who caught the ball did you see the scramble and you're telling me that there are people in there who's main purpose is to throw the ball back into the field sure you seriously think that the people around the guy who threw it back would be thrilled they'd be horrified that someone had the nerve to throw away the home run ball if they didn't want it why should the spoil it for the other people who want it he wouldn't become a national icon he'd become known as a complete moron and an a sure he'd go on talk shows but to talk about why he did it not that he is a great person who stood up for steriods he'd be the next jeffery maier if he wanted to be a national icon he should keep the ball auction it off and give the money to the investigation or to charity Barry Bonds Baseball Major League Baseball television contracts Home run Theory of conduct 1957 World Series Babe Ruth Shaggy dog story St. Louis Cardinals Hey Jude Satchel Paige History of baseball in the United States Mark McGwire World Series Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Eric Cartman Softball Chicago White Sox 1986 National League Championship Series Cricket Ty Cobb Derek Jeter National Football League Lore Autograph New York Yankees San Francisco Giants Hank Aaron Avenue Q Tris Speaker Garfield 2004 World Series Tag Married... with Children Andre Agassi American football Teen Girl Squad Interference (baseball) Reggie Jackson Lucille Ball Rickey Henderson ESPN25 Vin Scully New York Giants Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXVI Dodgeball Poker jargon Canadian football Glossary of American football Volleyball The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Marilyn Monroe Babe Ruth's Called Shot Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XIX Sammy Sosa Fast bowling The Ashlee Simpson Show Game show Cody Travers Super Bowl XIV Goldfinger Todd McFarlane Stewie Griffin Wyatt Earp Unreleased Madonna songs Baseball statistics The Shining (film) Philadelphia Phillies Intentional base on balls 2004 American League Championship Series October 4 in baseball Garth Brooks 1919 World Series Aerial (dance move) Red Sox Nation Friends $ale of the Century Big Brother (USA TV series) Nine Inch Nails Knots Landing Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Los Angeles Dodgers Indianapolis 500 Laws of cricket Humphrey Bogart Stolen base Wrigley Field Blood on the Tracks John Lennon Punisher Super Bowl XXI Kodocha Bond Pedro Mart__nez
