why do some still deny bonds was a heavy steroid user this is the part of the debate that i don't get there are still some who believe bonds is totally innocent lets look at he facts federal prosecutors finding doping calendars at balco with bond's name on it balco's chemist stating that bond's used steroids the leaked testimony of several federal prosecutors bond's hat size growing sizes in his late s the san fransisco chronicle reporters book canseco's book what your eyes tell you wow he never failed a drug test so he is innocent i did a whole bunch of bad stuff as a kid just because i didnt get caught does not mean i didnt do anything wrong i do not think it is a coincidence that in the late 's when all this was going on that his physical appearance changed his home runs syrocketed and since the steroid issue broke they have gone down towards his normal numbers his personal trainer is in jail for refusal to hand over evidence against him everything with balco to say there is no hard evidence is technically true but to say that there is not overwhelming circumstantial evidence is crazy Barry Bonds Jos__ Canseco Ben Johnson (athlete) Plame affair Doping (sport) Jason Giambi Major League Baseball Rafael Palmeiro Capital punishment Henry Lee Lucas Watergate scandal O.
