the yankees hate 'em or love 'em and why i was just at the toronto blue jays vs the new york yankees game in toronto i was curious to see so many yankee fans but what even intrigued me more was the turnout of fans wearing red sox and mets uniforms now i came to this game to root against the yankees being a red sox fan but i did not expect so many other fans in toronto to come just to root against the yankees and not for the blue jays i know that toronto is fairly close to new york so i guess the yankee fan turnout is understandable but what were so many yankee haters doing in the stadium today my real question is what is the reason for you yankee extremists to hate on or root for the yankees there was no way that all of the yankee fans came from new york and certainly all the yankee haters did not come a long way either i love the yankees they are my favorite team it boggles my mind to think that people who are not fans on the opposing team would still travel to root against the yankees i don't like the red sox but there's no way that i would go to an orioles red sox game to root against the red sox why would i want to i can't quite figure out the thought processes of mets and red sox fans described in your question so they hate the yankees is it worth it to waste your time and money coming to root against them even though your team is not playing i can't answer your question about yankee haters traveling to root against the yankees because i don't know why people would be so angry and full of hate after all it's just a game i can say that most of the yankee fans do come from new york in my area alone there are many buses that offer transportation to toronto every time the yankees play when combined with yankee fans who drive to toronto there are thousands right there many come from canada too the yankees are like the dallas cowboys they have fans everywhere along with people who hate them i'm a yankee fan because i'm from northern new york and was raised in a family of yankee fans though for some unknown reason i have a cousin who roots for the mets and it is in my blood yankee fans are always accused of jumping on the bandwagon or for being fairweather fans but that is not the case World Series New York Mets New York Yankees Reggie Jackson Interleague play October 4 in baseball Chicago White Sox Toronto Blue Jays Boston Red Sox Oakland Athletics Red Sox Nation Babe Ruth Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 2004 American League Championship Series St. Louis Cardinals Philadelphia Phillies Major League Baseball television contracts October 16 in baseball International League Cleveland Indians Cincinnati Reds Curse of the Bambino October 1 in baseball Houston Astros Detroit Tigers Alex Rodriguez Pedro Mart__nez No-hitter San Francisco Giants October 21 in baseball 2005 World Series September 2005 in sports Toronto Maple Leafs Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry American League Texas Rangers (baseball) Florida Marlins September 20 in baseball John Olerud October 13 in baseball New York Giants Baltimore Orioles Manny Ram__rez October 15 in baseball Chicago Cubs Who's your daddy?
