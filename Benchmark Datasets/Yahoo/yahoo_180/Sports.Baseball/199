what was the rude comments made by albert pujols about tom glavine in the playoffs this statement was made after glavine pitched shut out innings in which pujols did not have a hit pujols said of glavine he wasn't that good he wasn't good at all pujols is a great player but once in a while he opens his mouth when he's better off keeping it shut he did the same kind of stupid thing when ryan howard won the mvp award pujols said that howard shouldn't have won the award because his team didn't make the playoffs sounds to me like pujols is a bit of a sore loser Albert Pujols 2004 World Series Tom Glavine St. Louis Cardinals World Series Houston Astros 1957 World Series Atlanta Braves 1991 National League Championship Series John Smoltz October 10 in baseball 2004 National League Championship Series 2005 National League Championship Series October 17 in baseball Greg Maddux Roger Clemens Sandy Koufax Boston Red Sox October 16 in baseball Nolan Ryan Reggie Jackson October 2004 in sports Chicago Cubs October 5 in baseball Hank Aaron 1999 National League Championship Series Major League Baseball television contracts Alex Rodriguez 2005 World Series Cincinnati Reds Toronto Blue Jays Satchel Paige Detroit Tigers Randy Johnson Baseball statistics The Sporting News Player of the Year Award New York Yankees October 26 in baseball October 2005 in sports Milwaukee Brewers October 14 in baseball San Francisco Giants 1986 National League Championship Series Seattle Mariners Troy Glaus Super Bowl XXXI Texas Rangers (baseball) October 12 in baseball Robin Ventura 1987 World Series October 20 in baseball Pedro Mart__nez David Ortiz October 28 in baseball Pete Rose History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Chicago White Sox Derek Jeter Cleveland Browns October 4 in baseball Los Angeles Dodgers San Francisco 49ers 1991 World Series Andr__s Galarraga 1995 World Series 2004 American League Championship Series Sammy Sosa Samuel Goldwyn October 21 in baseball Wayne Gretzky Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Torii Hunter Baseball San Diego Padres 1981 baseball strike October 22 in baseball Red Sox Nation Michael Jordan National Basketball Association Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim 2005 American League Championship Series New York Mets MLB Most Valuable Player Award 1987 National League Championship Series Pitcher Mo Vaughn Super Bowl X NBA Finals September 20 in baseball St. Louis Rams Ty Cobb New England Patriots Minnesota Timberwolves New York Giants Brett Favre Oakland Athletics Felipe Alou Super Bowl XII October 3 in baseball
