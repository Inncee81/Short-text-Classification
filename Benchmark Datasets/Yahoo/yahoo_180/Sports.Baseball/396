steve garvey and the hall of fame i know this has been asked before but do you think steve garvey is not in the hall of fame primarily because of his off the field exploits or because his career ended rather sudden in and he didn't hang on for stats first i am not a garvey fan but from to he was the best first baseman in the game the dominant player of his era six out of seasons with hits one mvp and four other top ten finishes all star games including a write in selection player on good teams four gold gloves the national league all time consecutive games played streak nlcs mvp etc to me garvey is a perfect example of my opinion that being dominant in an era should trump guys as opposed to good players who simply hang on with mediocre seasons to build career numbers obviously enough hof voters disagree on some level or they disagree that garvey was dominant what do you think about garvey and what do you think about dominance in an era vs career longevity garvey is one of those guys on the borderline his overall numbers are quite good but there's no single thing about him that really stands out he had his mvp year but he was never one of those guys who led the league in a major category he led in total hits twice and that's about it if he had maintained his nice guy image after retirement i think he would have gotten more votes but still have fallen short i think he falls into the same area as al oliver dave parker and a few other players from that era they were excellent players but fell short of being the legendary sorts the hall of fame should demand Atlanta Braves Pete Rose Robin Ventura San Diego Padres Toronto Blue Jays Hank Aaron Steve Garvey St. Louis Cardinals Houston Astros Lou Gehrig Rickey Henderson Chicago White Sox New York Mets Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs International League Detroit Tigers Reggie Jackson World Series Los Angeles Dodgers Boston Red Sox Andr__s Galarraga 1981 World Series October 4 in baseball Ty Cobb Pittsburgh Pirates Seattle Mariners Nolan Ryan Cincinnati Bengals Babe Ruth Troy Glaus Oakland Athletics Tris Speaker Alex Rodriguez Sandy Koufax Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 NBA Finals Don Mattingly Kansas City Chiefs Willie Mays Barry Bonds Steve Nash New York Yankees Milwaukee Brewers National Football League Cleveland Indians Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Texas Rangers (baseball) Montr__al Expos Baseball Hall of Fame Vin Scully Florida Marlins New York Giants Hal Newhouser Michael Jordan 1981 baseball strike 2005 World Series Davey Lopes 2004 World Series Carolina Panthers Boston Bruins 2003 World Series Albert Pujols Billy Williams (baseball player) Minnesota Twins Randy Johnson Dave Concepci__n October 16 in baseball Chicago Bulls Baseball statistics Alan Trammell Joe Morgan San Francisco 49ers Tony Gwynn Cleveland Browns Yao Ming Tim McCarver November 1 in baseball November 3 in baseball Ken Boyer Bob Johnson (baseball) Major League Baseball All-Star Game Jim Palmer Eddie Murray Lou Boudreau Don Drysdale Los Angeles Kings Super Bowl XIV Larry Bird
