when did it become legal to take a pitcher out in the middle of an at bat anyone remember what year rule h and h determines who is credited with the walk or strike out dependant upon the count at the time a pitcher is relieved prior to finishing the official plate appearance of a batter conversly b states that if a batter is removed with two strikes and the pinch hitter is struck out the first batter is credited with being struck out any other result is 'awarded' to the pinch hitter so a batter can be lifted in the same manner has always been that way although you rarely see it the official scoring of said scenario was adopted in but managers have always been able to lift a pitcher or batter in the middle of a count i've seen it once this season when jim leyland lifted andrew miller on a count last month Baseball statistics Batting average 1957 World Series Sandy Koufax Designated hitter Perfect game Home run Hank Aaron Babe Ruth St. Louis Cardinals Strike zone Stolen base Softball Toronto Blue Jays Baseball scorekeeping Pedro Mart__nez Pitcher No-hitter 2004 World Series 2005 World Series Boston Red Sox Roger Clemens Bunt Firpo Marberry Detroit Tigers Randy Johnson Robin Ventura Chicago White Sox Intentional base on balls Box score (baseball) Baseball Stars Jeff Bagwell Switch hitter 1986 World Series Tris Speaker 1919 World Series Nolan Ryan Hit by pitch Pete Rose Chicago Cubs Seattle Mariners Oakland Athletics Lou Gehrig Greg Maddux Willie Mays Houston Astros Interference (baseball) San Diego Padres Ty Cobb Ted Williams New York Yankees Earned run average Volleyball Jimmie Foxx 2004 American League Championship Series Cincinnati Reds Byung-Hyun Kim Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Texas Rangers (baseball) Barry Bonds Pittsburgh Pirates Dead-ball era November 3 in baseball International League November 4 in baseball Andr__s Galarraga Knuckleball Alex Rodriguez October 19 in baseball Curveball Florida Marlins Batting order (baseball) 2003 World Series Los Angeles Dodgers 1977 American League Championship Series New York Mets September 28 in baseball Billy Wagner Ted Kluszewski Save (sport) Hideo Nomo Starting pitcher Carl Yastrzemski Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry October 4 in baseball Bob Friend Manny Ram__rez Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Kirk Gibson Reggie Jackson November 1 in baseball History of baseball in the United States Dave Kingman Hooks Dauss 1986 American League Championship Series
