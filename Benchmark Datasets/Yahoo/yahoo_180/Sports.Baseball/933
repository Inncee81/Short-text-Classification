what is it that barry bonds did wrong recently um didnt he do something else no hmm okay lol ah steroids that makes more sense lol in what way was he rude to the media he grew up with a dim view of the media from listening to his father complain about it all the time as a result barry doesn't trust anyone in the media and his bias view has led not surprisingly to a life long disrespect for them and what they do barry doomed the relationship from the start another aspect is barry's real personality he's never been a team player even in college at asu his own teammates when asked by the manager tried to vote him off the squad in the pros he quickly earned a bad rep as a whiner self centered arrogant and generally surly just like his father what other guy is gonna want to hang around with him then he coveted the attention other ball players were getting and decided to use drugs to turn himself into a hr hitter so add in the steroids he becomes an even better hitter and boosts his power hits most hr in a season and career he tells the manager when he plays and when he doesn't this makes the situation worse inflating his ego and minimizing the contributions of his teammates his team isn't even trying to win ball games any more barry knows deep down he used steroids and doesn't feel good about himself he ignores everything negative and hears only the applause he doesn't deal with reality in a meaningful way when the pressure is on and he needs to reach deep down to grab hold of himself there's only the heart of a hater and a cheat that's why he chokes why he has always choked under pressure his post season numbers are terrible he batted about during the last month of the hr chase and now that the pressure is off he is hitting again he has never won a world series ring and his chances are not good because it takes a team and other star players are not willing to be on the same club with him i know you specifically asked what he did wrong recently and the honest answer is that every day with bonds is a bad day it is tragic since the guy had some god given talent and chose to go through life bitter and angry then made it worse by taking drugs you've probably heard a thousand times how our lives are shaped by the choices we make it's true here are bonds' numbers before during and after steroids ba hr bb sb per season ba hr bb sb now ba hr bb sb the reason barry gets walked so often is not that pitchers fear him it is because it makes sense to pitch around him since his teammates are not good enough to score him from first base Babe Ruth Baseball Baseball statistics Ty Cobb Batting average 1957 World Series Sammy Sosa Reggie Jackson Hank Aaron World Series Tris Speaker Pete Rose Home run Major League Baseball Boston Red Sox Volleyball History of baseball in the United States Troy Glaus Satchel Paige 1919 World Series 2005 World Series Ted Williams Mark McGwire 2004 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates International League One Tree Hill (TV series) Lou Gehrig Rickey Henderson Softball Manny Ram__rez Ben Johnson (athlete) Baseball Stars Brian Close New York Yankees Gary Sheffield Hulk Hogan The Joker's Wild Pedro Mart__nez Laws of cricket Detroit Tigers October 4 in baseball Alex Ferguson Mike Schmidt History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Norway national football team San Francisco Giants Newcastle United F.C.
