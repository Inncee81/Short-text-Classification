jose reyes or derek jeter i have no idea both amazing shortstops but who would you rather have because both great but reyes is still younger personally i find this question to be a no brainer here's my comparison fielding jeter edges reyes out slightly in range but reyes has a much stronger and accurate arm it's a close tie here but give it a few more years and reyes will have the advantage over the older jeter hitting reyes is a premier lead off hitter i will say with full confidence that he is the best leadoff hitter in the game jeter is a good clutch hitter and can hit for a higher average again this is a close call and all depends on what type of team your building jeter is your contact man while reyes is your leadoff man base running no contest i shouldn't have to go into details about this but i will just because he is the most exciting player on the base paths yes i'm talking about jose reyes twice this season he has lured a pitcher into balking in a run while standing on third base he has steals which leads the mlb and his efforts are insurmountable by any other player his head is always in the game and has a natural knowledge of his surroundsing and whereabouts on the bases sorry jeter you may be a heads up base runner but reyes is the man you want on base intangibles derek jeter offers great team leadership if you need a club house player jeter definitely wins in that category as for reyes he supplies the energy his constant positive attitude in the club house is a great morale booster something every club needs in the intangibles these players are full of pros and little to no cons its a tie here overall i have to go with jose reyes i also forgot to mention his switch hitting capability he is truly a tool player who brings a whole new element to a baseball game he will be the top player in the nl for years to come and is on a path to become a future hall of famer 2004 American League Championship Series Alex Rodriguez Boston Red Sox 1919 World Series New York Yankees 1957 World Series Pittsburgh Pirates Pete Rose Manny Ram__rez Toronto Blue Jays World Series 2004 World Series Batting average 2003 World Series San Diego Padres Barry Bonds Shortstop November 1 in baseball Houston Astros Softball Reggie Jackson Los Angeles Dodgers Baseball statistics Tris Speaker Major League Baseball All-Star Game St. Louis Cardinals Hank Aaron Home run Oakland Athletics Lou Gehrig Red Sox Nation Major League Baseball San Francisco Giants Baseball scorekeeping Detroit Tigers Cincinnati Reds Babe Ruth Sandy Koufax New York Giants Stolen base Satchel Paige Seattle Mariners Dave Concepci__n Andr__s Galarraga 2001 World Series Atlanta Braves Edgar Renter__a Nolan Ryan Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry International League Ozzie Smith Robin Ventura Bernie Williams Florida Marlins Volleyball 2005 World Series Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Chicago Cubs Carlos Beltr__n October 4 in baseball New York Mets Ichiro Suzuki Luke Appling Jim Rice History of baseball in the United States Rickey Henderson Batting order (baseball) Baseball Stars Pittsburgh Steelers Designated hitter October 20 in baseball Ty Cobb Cleveland Indians Texas Rangers (baseball) David Ortiz No-hitter Willie Mays Negro league baseball Luis Aparicio Blackjack Troy Glaus Dave Kingman Professional wrestling throws Switch hitter Interference (baseball) Baltimore Orioles Jos__ Canseco Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945 Mike Schmidt September 20 in baseball Craig Biggio October 31 in baseball Montr__al Expos
