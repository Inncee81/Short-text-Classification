who is the best middle infielder in the hall of fame the question is mainly centered on middle infielders in the baseball hall of fame so that would mean that they are for a start retired and have played at least five years in the majors what i'm looking for is not offensive production but defensive the firld is pretty wide but i can tell you who has my vote on this one ryne sandberg played for the chicago cubs from and played a stretch of straight games without making an error of any kind that includes fielding and throwing during that stretsh sandberg's glove got the nickname among some of my friends as the place base hits go to die does anyone agree with me on this one in my opinion you have a really good case on ryne he was solid for many years and i would have to agree with you b c the numbers he put up was for a mediocre team but also the great cal ripkin jr played most of his career at shortstop so unless you're talking about people who played their whole career in the middle i have to say cal b c he was a solid player and the iron man playing in consecitive games or whatever it was but it was still by far a record that will never be touched but that's my opinion cal ripkin jr ryne sandberg craig biggio played whole career w astros quitely putting up good numbers year in year out Ryne Sandberg Baseball Chicago Cubs Softball 2005 World Series Boston Red Sox Lou Gehrig Pete Rose Chicago White Sox Seattle Mariners 2004 World Series San Francisco Giants Florida Marlins Cal Ripken, Jr. Pittsburgh Pirates Dallas Green October 4 in baseball New York Mets Robin Ventura Second baseman Cincinnati Bengals Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1946 St. Louis Cardinals Luis Aparicio October 27 in baseball Atlanta Braves Pittsburgh Steelers October 22 in baseball Detroit Tigers November 1 in baseball Toronto Blue Jays Nolan Ryan Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Ernie Banks Jackie Robinson Sandy Koufax September 20 in baseball Hank Aaron Alex Rodriguez Tris Speaker Baseball scorekeeping June 11 in baseball Baseball statistics First baseman Los Angeles Dodgers 1919 World Series June 13 in baseball Kansas City Chiefs Bill Mazeroski Miguel Tejada Cap Anson Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2005 Cincinnati Reds Carlton Fisk Miami Dolphins Joe Morgan Babe Ruth World Series Interference (baseball) Vin Scully Volleyball November 4 in baseball Philadelphia Phillies Baltimore Orioles No-hitter Tony Kubek Carolina Panthers New York Yankees Nellie Fox Texas Rangers (baseball) Third baseman November 2 in baseball Luke Appling Babe Ruth's Called Shot Roberto Alomar Reggie Jackson Ty Cobb Troy Glaus November 3 in baseball Negro league baseball Leo Durocher Satchel Paige Edgar Renter__a Lou Boudreau Oakland Athletics Andr__s Galarraga October 12 in baseball October 7 in baseball October 1 in baseball Scott Podsednik
