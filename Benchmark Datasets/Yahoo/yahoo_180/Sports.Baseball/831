what is the proof of barry bonds cheating and using steriods i just started following barry bonds as he neared the new homerun record about a month ago and heard about all this speculation of him cheating and using steriods information on this barry is currently under investigation so the evidence that has been collected to this point is being kept secret it won't be made public until charges are filed or mlb decides to take action he did appear before a grand jury and admitted to taking two products that were steroids but claimed others lied to him by saying he was told they were something else his testimony was supposed to be secret too but someone leaked it to sf chronicle reporters the two links from ummfada will pretty much get you up to speed on the issue especially if you read several of the other sfgate articles too balco the company developing and selling the products was busted and put out of business five or six other major league ballplayers testified they got their steroids through barry barry got them from life long friend greg anderson who pleaded guilty to drug dealing charges greg is now rotting in prison refusing to testify ps the analogy of the guy traveling across country is fair at this point we can see something is not right and someone if not telling the truth Barry Bonds Plame affair Plame affair timeline 2005 trial of Michael Jackson W.
