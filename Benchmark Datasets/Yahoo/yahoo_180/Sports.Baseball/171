how many years were left in randy johnson's contract when diamondback traded for him before the season randy johnson now needs back surgery and won't pitch for a long while what was the diamondbacks thinking when they traded for a fourty something years old pitcher with a history of back problem and the diamondback gave johnson a contract extension did anyone think that was a good deal at the time i believe randy johnson was signed through the season with the yankees basically all the d backs did was add another season guaranteed and he signed a year deal with the d backs for and worth million million per season was it a good deal for the d backs to make i would say on paper yes because that would've been and still could be the storybook ending to a great career to have him win his th game as a d back the team who randy pitched for from and won the world series with in everyone knew about his back problems but he did win games each season in and with the yankees so the d backs figured he was probably still good for wins per season and that would put him on pace to get to next season now he is out for the year and only started games this season going he is at career wins meaning he will have to win games next year coming off back surgery in my opinion he will come back in but only win games and will have to come back in at a much lower pay rate to finally get to wins at the age of he's now on sept th Randy Johnson Arizona Diamondbacks Curt Schilling Roger Clemens Boston Red Sox Toronto Blue Jays 2001 World Series New York Yankees World Series Alex Rodriguez 2003 World Series October 28 in baseball 2005 World Series Oakland Athletics David Wells International League Florida Marlins Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Byung-Hyun Kim Detroit Tigers October 5 in baseball Troy Glaus Major League Baseball television contracts Sandy Koufax No-hitter Cincinnati Reds New York Knicks Chicago White Sox New York Mets Pedro Mart__nez October 20 in baseball Barry Bonds Reggie Jackson San Francisco Giants Sammy Sosa October 27 in baseball John Smoltz November 3 in baseball October 16 in baseball Shawn Green Satchel Paige Babe Ruth Tris Speaker 2004 American League Championship Series New England Patriots Texas Rangers (baseball) November 4 in baseball Javier V__zquez Pittsburgh Pirates Bob Friend Jamie Moyer Andr__s Galarraga Tim McCarver Mario Lemieux Jerry Colangelo Houston Astros October 15 in baseball Atlanta Braves MLB on FOX October 30 in baseball October 4 in baseball Pitcher Jim Palmer 1986 World Series Ty Cobb Richie Sexson Cincinnati Bengals Tom Seaver History of baseball in the United States Indiana Pacers Minnesota Twins Mariano Rivera November 2 in baseball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 1987 World Series October 19 in baseball Cleveland Indians ESPN25 Minnesota Timberwolves Red Sox Nation Chicago Bulls Yankees-Red Sox Rivalry Denis Law Eric Gagne Los Angeles Dodgers Milt Pappas
