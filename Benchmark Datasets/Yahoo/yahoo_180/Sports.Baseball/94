if bonds did not do steroids whouldn't he have sued for defimation becasue of the book game of shadows i mean if he did not do steroids he would obviously not want the information about him out there saying he did however if he did do steroids he would not sue becasue some investigation would be done if he did and he would be found out yes if you put it in print and it's false it's libel and bonds would be the type of person that would persue that the trouble is that it's on the part of the plantiff to prove it and bonds couldn't prove that he didn't use steroids because they used his own testimony as basis for the claim so if he attempted to sue for libel it would be equivilent to saying he lied to the grand jury about taking steroids the way to avoid all of this is for him not to have done that in the first place Slander and libel 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Ben Johnson (athlete) Barry Bonds Plame affair George Galloway First Amendment to the United States Constitution Freedom of the press Tour de France Hustler Magazine v.
