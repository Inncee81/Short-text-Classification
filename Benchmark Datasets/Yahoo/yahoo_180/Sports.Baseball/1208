is barry bonds that big part of your life that your willing to spend talking about over and over again and i thought the red sox yankee fans were bad enough no offense i seriously thought everyone would stop talking about bonds the minute or day after he hit that but i was dead wrong i can't figure out who's worst bonds or the people who talk about him and post the same thing over and over again is that record rank in your life considering family and friends because for those people who keep complaining about what bonds did didn't do it seems to be so a rod will break his record in no time hopefully some people think bonds is the best some say he's a disgrace i'm also a big fan of baseball but beating a dead horse really sucks i really hate seeing bonds wished to be killed or hurt by numbers of people on y a enough of your thoughts on bonds what will it take to stop talking about him strip his title death hope not convertion proof negative positive few months just go get over no barry bonds is not the issue it does not matter who he is or what color he is or anything like that all that matters is the integrity of the record and the fact that our society is so obsessed with people that they find it acceptable to cheat these guys are cheating and every one is applauding and kissing his butt turning their heads like they did nothing wrong something is wrong with us EastEnders Ty Cobb Babe Ruth Boston Red Sox One Tree Hill (TV series) Knots Landing Days of our Lives Professional wrestling slang San Francisco Giants Chicago White Sox Tris Speaker St. Louis Cardinals Major League Baseball television contracts Moonraker New York Yankees Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Oakland Athletics Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) World Series Home run Satchel Paige Cincinnati Reds Bon Jovi Avenue Q Chicago Cubs Goldfinger Barry Bonds Lou Gehrig Piccolo Junior Saga Ted Williams History of baseball in the United States Eddie Guerrero Garfield Hip hop rivalries Friends Toronto Blue Jays Los Angeles Dodgers Kodocha Poker jargon Reggie Jackson Joe DiMaggio Ranma __ characters Detroit Tigers Jean Grey Minnesota Twins The Human Stain Kurt Angle Pittsburgh Steelers Marilyn Monroe The Fairly OddParents Negro league baseball Blood on the Tracks Social rule Pedro Mart__nez International League Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Troy Glaus The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Cultural Revolution The Smoking Room ESPN25 The Death Gate Cycle Rickey Henderson Seattle Mariners Shaggy dog story American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Theory of conduct Cheating in Counter-Strike Ten Commandments Pittsburgh Pirates Houston Astros Dead Like Me The Living Daylights Family Guy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Stewie Griffin Garth Brooks Shawn Michaels YuYu Hakusho Curse of the Bambino Jewish Messiah W.I.T.C.H. 1986 National League Championship Series 2004 World Series James Bond music The Jim Rome Show James Bond Sammy Sosa Rocko's Modern Life Slayers Kain (Legacy of Kain) History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Utilitarianism Eric Bischoff
