do you know who killed the dodos if yes who people did here is the wikipedia discription of why they are extinct as with many animals evolving in isolation from significant predators the dodo was entirely fearless of people and this in combination with its flightlessness made it easy prey but journals are full of reports regarding the bad taste and tough meat of the dodo while other local species such as the red rail were praised for their taste it is commonly believed that the malay sailors held the bird in high regard and killed them only to make head dressings used in religious ceremonies however when humans first arrived on mauritius they also brought with them other animals that had not existed on the island before including dogs pigs cats rats and crab eating macaques which plundered the dodo nests while humans destroyed the forests where the birds made their homes currently the impact these animals especially the pigs and macaques had on the dodo population is considered to have been more severe than that of hunting the expedition's finds are apparently of animals killed by a flash flood such mass mortalities would have further jeopardized an already extinction prone species although there are scattered reports of mass killings of dodos for provisioning of ships archaeological investigations have hitherto found scant evidence of human predation on these birds some bones of at least two dodos were found in caves at baie du cap which were used as shelters by fugitive slaves and convicts in the th century but due to their isolation in high broken terrain were not easily accessible to dodos naturally by cossigny reports that the number of refugees and settlers which cut down the inland forest was so high that the well flighted mauritius blue pigeon was rapidly declining all over the island citation needed there is some controversy surrounding the extinction date of the dodo roberts solow state that the extinction of the dodo is commonly dated to the last confirmed sighting in reported by shipwrecked mariner volkert evertsz evertszoon but many other sources suggest the more conjectural date roberts solow point out that because the sighting prior to was in the dodo was likely already very rare by the s and that thus a disputed report from cannot be dismissed off hand statistical analysis of the hunting records of issac johannes lamotius carried out by julian hume and coworkers citation needed give a new estimated extinction date of with a confidence interval of to considering more circumstantial evidence such as travellers' reports and the lack of good reports after it is likely that the dodo became extinct before thus the last dodo died barely more than a century after the species' discovery in http en wikipedia org wiki dodo extinction good luck Extinct birds Holocene extinction event Island restoration Seabird Kakapo Bird Fauna of Australia Mascarene Islands Whaling Gerald Durrell Extinction Cat Dinosaur Tiger Dog Oceania ecozone Easter Island Blue Whale Biodiversity of New Zealand Dromornithidae Introduced species Prehistoric Britain Stone Age Fox hunting Biodiversity Orca Tyrannosaurus rex Feral cat Tasmanian Devil Hunting Olduwan Brown Bear Red Deer Permian-Triassic extinction event Indigenous Australians Extinction event The Voyage of the Beagle Evidence of evolution Endangered species Albatross Peleliu Shark Europe Ivory-billed Woodpecker Flightless bird Archaeology and the Book of Mormon Vitamin C Guns, Germs, and Steel Flood geology Christmas Island Human Bigfoot Kiwi RuneScape quests Coconut crab Andaman Islands Shifting cultivation Meme Fishing Neanderthal Hern__n Cort__s Richard Owen Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Species Inuit The Origin of Species Population history of American indigenous peoples Meat Lion Ecoregions of Madagascar Southeast Asia Australasia ecozone Plesiosaur Animal testing Creatures in Bionicle Leopard The Skeptical Environmentalist New Zealand Mammal Paleocene Animal communication Yellowstone National Park Noah's Ark Francis Light Inaccessible Island Aquatic ape hypothesis Spider Leatherback Sea Turtle R__union Sacred Ibis Capercaillie Cannibalism
