do birds need regular vet check ups i know if they are you are supposed to take them to the vet but do they need like shots and regular vet visits i want to get my first pet bird i don't want nothing fancy though just a parakeet my mom is making me pay for everything so i do have a fairley low budget i'm only by the way also do they need like their nails cut and stuff like that basically do they need anything else besides there basic needs and attention is there anything else i need to pay for throughout its life besides the supplies and the bird no vet visits unless something is wrong if you plan on handling it it's a good idea to trim the nails and the wings if you are too afraid to do this it's easy i'm sure your local vet would probably do it for free just one thing don't use the sandpaper perches to keep their nails from being sharp they just irritate their feet good luck Garfield Pet skunk Hamster Knife Nine Inch Nails Pottery Falconry Milton H.
