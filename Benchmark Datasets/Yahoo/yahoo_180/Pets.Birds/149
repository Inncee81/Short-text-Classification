can i leave my parakeet's cage in a room with lots of windows i am a new parakeet owner my mom says that we need to keep the cage somewhere without carpet i found a great spot but it has giant windows in there is it ok to leave the parakeet in there or will the sunlight all day bother it or possilbbly hurt my parakeet i can close the windows so that there isn't as much light but i have read that birds need a little sunlight to help with vitamin d please help me with my cage confusion myra parakeets are very hardy birds but they are also fragile you should understand that they come from a desert climate but it should also be noted that they can suffer from heatstroke heat exhaustion what i do when i put my birds outside is a cover half the cage in shadows with a towel which gives them some relief from the heat it should also be noted that if you leave the windows often the keet will be exposed to drafts a draft can easily be led to a cold which they are very adept at concealing until they are dead if it is somewhere cold such as a basement they can also catch a fever there as well and will result in the keet's death keets also need daily socialization you should put the cage somewhere where people pass by daily and regularly where it can listen in on conversations also note that it should not be kept in a kitchen where fumes and gasses from cooking can also be lethal Solar power John Cage Hyperthermia Sun Basement Trapping Thermoregulation Hiking RuneScape quests Common cold Pittsburgh Steelers Welding Psoriasis Vitamin C Sunlight Desert Sento Renewable energy Guinea pig Fire fighting Canary Kitchen Climate change Portable stove Cannabis cultivation Autonomous building HVAC Lighting Tag RuneScape locations Fume hood Social rule The Amber Spyglass Chicken Lake The Ersatz Elevator New York Giants New England Patriots Firestorm Power station Domestic rabbit Ben Johnson (athlete) H5N1 Fancy rat Planetary habitability Environmental concerns with electricity generation Columbine High School massacre Ferret Mixed martial arts Hamster Chatsworth House Ultraviolet Directed-energy weapon The Dalek Invasion of Earth Magic (illusion) Enceladus (moon) Poker jargon Egg (food) Air conditioning Monk Parakeet Chinchilla Carburetor Ayyavazhi mythology Stove Kryptonite Microwave oven Jason Reso San Francisco 49ers The Champions Global climate model Steam engine StarCraft: Uprising Cold fusion Kurt Angle Solar variation Photography God Emperor of Dune Equine conformation Serial killer Sauna Signs Garfield Professional wrestling slang Effects of global warming Fan death Parrot Cleveland Browns Paintball Falconry Comet The Shining (film) New Orleans Mint Turbocharger Cyanide Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) World Trade Center Blood on the Tracks Xanadu House
