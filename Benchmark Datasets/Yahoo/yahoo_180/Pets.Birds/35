bleeding bird help i just got home from work and saw that my parakeet jasmine was bleeding near the left eye there are only two ways i could guess it could happen one is if my other parakeet jacob caused it in a fight jacob drew blood on me before so i know his bite is powerful enough the other possibility would be that she cut it on accident while scratching herself the cut still looks fresh so i guess the main question is if birds will naturally heal from a cut or if they need any kind of help their nails dont look long but i'm going to cut them this week just to be safe but if i see jacob hurt her again if he did hurt her in the first place he is gone into his natural habitat you can buy a sceptic stick from pet store that stops bleeding it will heal thoughnaturally unless bad then it needs to be stopped i would keep the birds separate when out of the house and let them loose when i was in to watch them check their toys and perches for sharp edges Hamster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Wound Episodes of Lost (Season 1) CPU cache Bleeding Monk Parakeet Blood (computer game) Budgerigar Parrot Stomach cancer Guinea pig Poker jargon First aid Password Milton H.
