how to transport my bird to a different location ok well my dad my sister and i and a bunch of other friends are taking a vacation for a week my mom said she'd watch my parakeet budgie i never traveled with my budgie until i got it and it was in a small box we don't have that box anymore and i just thought if it is ok to keep my budgie in her cage and just put a blanket over it i have heard people have done this before but i just wanted to make sure and there is no point in buying a traveling cage carrier because i never travel with my bird any suggestions on what i should do this is an easy one you are right there is no reason to get a travel cage if your cage is portable load the cage up into the car cover her with a towel or sheet after the air is started and off you go if you take a winter trip then cover her with a blanket when leaving the house putting her into a warm car covering her will help her not to be scared dump her water for the trip if its a short one or it will get all over everything if its a long trip make a few stops to let her drink or leave her some cut up grapes to munch on Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests The Amazing Race Budgerigar Public transport Fire fighting John Cage Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Hamster Knots Landing Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Back to the Future Treehouse of Horror V StarCraft: Uprising The Brady Bunch Sauna Professional wrestling match types Futurama (TV series - season 2) Viva La Bam Bird migration Surveillance Who Shot Mr. Burns?
