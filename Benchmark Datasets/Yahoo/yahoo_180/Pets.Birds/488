bird cages i noticed today my old cage has horizontal bars where as my new cage they are vertical which is better will my lovebird get its head caught in the vertical bars the sides of the cage are all vertical why don't they make some sides horizontal as a law horizontal are better as parrots love to climb generally cages have horizontal sides vertical edit vertical bars are usually for hanging stuff if your bird can climb the cage without any problems it's perfectly fine this horizontal vs vertical bars cages come with all horizontal bars all vertical bars and combinations of the two vertical bars provide strong support especially for the heavy tops of larger cages and are preferred for the front which should have a large door opening in it openings for feeder doors and breeder boxes are shorter if they are placed among horizontal bars in a cage they create less disturbance to the structure horizontal bars also make climbing and attaching dishes perches and toys easier when choosing a larger cage try to get one with at least some vertical bars for strength and stability a combination of both vertical and horizontal is a good choice many cages are made with vertical fronts and backs and horizontal sides Equine conformation Bicycle frame Trapping Door Wind turbine Seismic retrofit Glossary of climbing terms Fixed-wing aircraft Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Domestic rabbit Antenna (radio) Dog agility Fancy rat Sailing Window Batting (cricket) Aerial (dance move) Oscilloscope Mealy Parrot Stairway Strap-on dildo Golf club (equipment) Palatine bone Hangul Anamorphic widescreen Skateboarding trick Doom engine Textile manufacturing Maxilla Mixed martial arts Microeconomics Horizontal bar Cloud Knitting Ship Professional wrestling aerial techniques Helicopter Autogyro Suspension bridge 19-inch rack Imperial (automobile) Dentures Drawing Steel Cage Match Mountaineering Lung Chess strategy and tactics Table saw Gramophone record Fast bowling View camera Rugby union positions RuneScape quests Radar Electric motor Recumbent bicycle Professional wrestling throws Airport Drill bit Rib IMAX Breaststroke Gas metal arc welding Glider Light-frame construction Crane (machine) Xiangqi Ford Thunderbird Backstroke Barbed wire Professional wrestling match types M4 Sherman San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Egyptian language International Phonetic Alphabet Rapid transit Vowel Punt (boat) Car safety Ferret Piano NTSC Poker jargon Volleyball Polarization Flag of the People's Republic of China Jet engine Anchor Flag of the United States Arcade cabinet The Time Machine Cello Chinchilla Paragliding Lawn mower Amateur telescope making
