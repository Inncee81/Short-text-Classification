sulphur crested cockatoo biting my boyfriend recently bought home a sulphur crested cockatoo from a rescue sanctuary he had visited the bird on several occasions and built up a great relationship with it on our first meeting the bird though initially wary would 'step up' and take food until after about mins and for no apparent reason he bit my hand very hard since then the cockatoo has been very aggressive when i am alone with him reaching through the bars of the cage to grab me if i get too close hard to get to food and water bowls without injury and biting me when i try to encourage him to come out of the cage and onto his stand i don't want to leave him in the cage all day so wear or layers to protect my arms for the beak he also shakes as tho scared and clicks at me which i heed as a 'back off' warning he's so gentle with my boyfriend and i really want our bird to feel safe and protected and not lash out at me or others any suggestions as to how i can improve our relationship so today my bf left the bird alone on its stand and i kept my distance but still talked soothingly to him result he got curious flew to the floor walked up to me and put his beak on the floor and let me tickle the back of his neck for mins he did try to nip after that and was put back on his stand later at normal training time my bf suggested that i try to train him so i had him walking from one side of his stand to the other at my command but no luck with step up all of a sudden he flew at my head scratching my face and biting the back of my head very hard no serious injuries just shock and a few scratches and bruises my bf witnessed this and confirmed that the bird is attacking me not just trying to land i know it's a slow process gaining his trust but i can't understand why he was so uncharacteristically loving towards me but became so vicious when i was rewarding him is a good relationship with our bird totally unattainable for me he bird has bonded with your boyfriend and is trying to warn you away from his or her human the only remedy is lots of patience and work if you guys are really serious about having this bird fully accept you then your boyfriend need to stop spending time with the bird you must become the caregiver spend at least to hours a day speaking soothingly to the bird do not try to get it to step up or do anything special until it stops its aggressive behavior this can take weeks or even months after aggression stops then start offering special treats to it through the bars if the bird refuses them take the treat away you must show that aggression no treats eventually the bird should calm down and accept treat then you can try offering treats through the open door let the bird come to you again this will take time when the bird calmly accepts the treats you can try stroking its belly or chest a little when he gets used to this you can present your finger and say step up he will get the idea expect to get nipped a few times during training when that happens just say no bite close the cage and leave for at least several hours to show that this action was not acceptible the most important thing to remember is that this is a rescue bird which means it may have been abused sometimes if a bird is abused for instance by a woman the bird becomes hostile to all women this makes acceptance difficult but not impossible rescues take a lot more time and patience than gently handled birds but the reward's can be great good luck Aerial (dance move) RuneScape quests Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diving Social
