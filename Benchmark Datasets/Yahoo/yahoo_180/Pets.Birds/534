underweight quaker hi ok so this is an extension to my previous question i have an gram quaker parrot he is a male and and a half years old i do think he has a slightly low appetite and for one i was wondering if you really think he is underweight here is what he eats has access to previously he mainly ate seed treats occasional pasta sometimes rowdybush now he eats has access to peas rice chicken seed rowdybush bread vitaflight vitamin i have been concerned about this and his diet change has only taken place in the past few days i need to know if i should be very worried and what i should do what should i feed him to make him gain weight should i try giving him some formula i am currently in the process of sprouting foods for him but it will take a few days before they sprout what should i do i need an honest and prefferably experienced answer not just someone who read an article off of google best answers will be treated with ten points the average weight for quakers can range from to gr so he's only just under weight you can also get many birds around that are under the 'normal' weight range but are completley healthy take for instance my ekkie he's a lean machine underweight but very healthy just a littlie you should try offering him a little more variety of fruit veg these are always good for parrots although most love peas are ok to have peas you can easily over do it with giving peas they're high in sugar so add other rich grean red yellow orange fruit veg as well i personally do not agree that any parrot owner should ever give their parrot a vit sup unless their vet requests them to do so i see you have a vit sup plus pellets pellets the correct ones already contain the right amount of vit sups by adding to this extra vit sups you're only over doing it this can lead to health problems too did you weigh him before changing his diet what was his previous diet if this is a sudden change it is not always wise to do this parrots can react badly to sudden change diets it's always best to do the diet change over a period several weeks to months depending on the change taking place sprouting is alway excellent beleiev it or not yet another vit sup i would most def take away those vitaflight your quaker is gonna end up with a vit min overload for some ideas on foods types of fruit veg to use etc you can check this out it is an eclectus diet website but it has a great variety of the fruit veg you cna choose from plus nutritional info on nuts seeds plus what common garden flowers you can offer cooked foods etc plus an idea for sprouting too these aren't what i found on the net they're my websites Folic acid Atkins Nutritional Approach Food Vegetarianism Dieting Guinea pig Veganism Domestic rabbit Vitamin C Hamster Raw food diet Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Omega-3 fatty acid Stomach cancer Peanut Nutrition Tocopherol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obesity Hypoglycemia Bread Cuisine of Denmark Mealy Parrot Healthy eating Tomato Agriculture Milk Ramen Anorexia nervosa Food guide pyramid Chocolate Adjustable gastric band Dietary fiber Coeliac disease Acorn Vegetarian nutrition Coronary heart disease Potato Pasta German cuisine Farthing (coin) Famine Egg (food) Common bean Tofu Super Size Me Jewish cuisine Rice Organic food Cuisine of the Philippines Chicken Weight training South Beach diet Tooth Maize Soul food Cuisine of the Southern United States Flowering plant Fruit MyPyramid Bengali cuisine Pet skunk Breakfast British cuisine Food preservation Microeconomics Dairy Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir Consensus decision-making Nut (fruit) Explosive material Handloading Antioxidant Roman eating and drinking Equine conformation Childbirth CPU cache Pea Hamburger MRE Kashrut Glycemic index Body mass index Kakapo Cancer Apple Sprouting Miso
