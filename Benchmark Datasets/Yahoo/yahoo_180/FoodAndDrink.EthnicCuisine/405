i am preparing bobotie and the recipes call for minced meat is that like british mince meat or ground beef most of the recipes that look like they come from south africa call for minced meat some just call for ground beef all have dried apricots apple raisins etc which are all part of mince meat so my interpretation has been that they mean ground beef and it is just a difference between rsa english and usa english bobotie is just the south african version of the indonesian dish bobotok which is made with minced meat beef lamb mutton or pork in south africa it is not unheard of to add bananas or lemons to a bobotie in britain minced meat usually means minced beef hamburger and mincemeat usually means finely chopped dried fruit just to confuse the issue victorian mincemeat often contained minced meat hence the name as the source of fat to hold the fruit together in a pie yum Hamburger Cuisine of Africa Peruvian cuisine German cuisine Mince pie Polish cuisine Meatball Cajun cuisine Cuisine of Laos French cuisine D__ner kebab Japanese cuisine Tofu Cantonese cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Bengali cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Jewish cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Singapore French fries Kebab Food preservation British cuisine Soup Pie Fish and chips McDonald's Cuisine of the Southern United States MRE Russian cuisine Hot dog Haggis Apple pie Jiaozi Breakfast Rice pudding Bacon Chili con carne Wine Taboo food and drink Bolognese sauce Dolma Soul food Cuisine of Brazil Meatloaf Feijoada Domesticated turkey Beef Roman eating and drinking Pickling Ham Tamale Cuisine of Greece Ukrainian cuisine Culture of South Africa Couscous Ramen Beef noodle soup Agriculture in Australia Persian cuisine Gyros Cuisine of Vietnam Sandwich Dim sum Canadian Chinese cuisine Sauce Cuisine of Cambodia Curry Meat Cuisine of Canada Vegetarianism Pasta Empanada Domestic goat Cuisine of Puerto Rico Chicken soup Food storage Escherichia coli O157:H7 Veganism Burger Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Lamb (food) American Chinese cuisine Pork chop Cuisine of Austria Rum Sarma Surimi Recipe Korean cuisine
