question for comic book collectors i have just bought some copies of 'fantastic four' the white bar code box in the bottom corner gives the price in us and can and bears the words 'direct edition' can anyone tell me what 'direct edition' means and whether it has any significance from a collector's point of view thanks direct edition simply refers to the means in which the comics are distributed direct edition refers to comics that come directly from the publishers ie marvel and are typically sold only at comic book stores and other comic specialty places the non direct editions newsstand editions are found in retail stores drug stores toy stores and what not and come from newsstand distribution companies instead of the publishers themselves the difference between the two types affects the retailers more direct editions cannot be returned by the retailers if they are unable to sell all of their inventory while the newsstand editions can and direct editions can also be purchased by retailers at a bigger discount since the distributors do not have to worry about giving them credit for returned items direct editions and newsstand editions are printed at the exact same time and have nothing to do with being first or second prints like some of the other answerers think second prints and beyond are identified in the indicia the fine print stuff usually at the bottom of the first page of each comic and recently publishers like marvel started using variant covers to identify second printings and beyond collectors do prefer direct editions mainly because they are treated better by comic shops and what not than the newsstand editions direct editions are placed on shelves designed for comics and typically don't get manhandled and bent up by stockers and other people that don't know anything about them while newsstand editions are just the opposite the direct editions first came out in the s after the comic market at newsstands started to drop drastically compared to comic shops specialty stores so the publishers began to allow retailers to buy directly from them instead of their newsstand distribution companies the earlier direct editions can be identified by the pictures on the cover where a barcode would normally be and i believe even earlier editions could be identified by whether the issue number was printed inside of a diamond or just a plain square although i'm not sure about that check out the cover images for issues and to see the differences that i'm talking about in this link http comicspriceguide com p issues asp t id p i know that later diamond covers had the picture in the barcode area while square covers had barcodes so that is why i think that is an identifier check out the covers for issue and on the next page of the same link in fact some of the super serious comic collectors will collect both the diamond covers and square covers or only a specific one of the two American comic book Comic book Wal-Mart DVD Comics G.I.
