can anybody give me some cosplay guidelines please i'm pretty new at going to anime conventions but i'm really into it i see people in awsome cosplay and i want to join in on the fun but i'm not sure about basic cosplaying for instance is it only cool to make your own costume or is it ok to buy a costume that is already made i have no idea how to sew last time i tried to create something i ran for the glue and velcro it was pretty ugly i really want to be a part of the fun and dress as my favorite characters i just don't want to do it wrong i really want to cosplay but mostly i want to cosplay right any advice would be sweet dattebayo my advice to you is research research research check out the details for your costume such as weapons shoes and clothing details or the situtional occasional type of costume like kakashi anbu version oh yeah try as much to get a costume that fits your body type if you don't like to sew or don't know yet its better that you have your costume tailored if the tailor cannot do it give a simplified version of it and you sew on the detailings or ask a friend who's done cosplay to teach and help you sew it hair wise get a friend who knows where to get it cheap to help you if not you ll end up getting the expensive version which will just burn up your pocket if you are just a real beginner and don't know anybody from the cosplay community go forum ing lj should have some communities who's into costuming ask for advice and don't be disheartened with the people and tips if you're the kind who's parents don't allow you to cosplay have friends who think that cosplayers are wierd get new friends at the con as you've noticed cosplaying requires a lot of money so its better that if you have some saved up coz at the cons you're sure to want to buy some things i guess you're from the states so i can't give you links coz mine are only for my country sorry good luck and enjoy the con oh yeah developing a thick skin is good remember to go out of character ie smile when you're out in public eating is important too and in costume or you'll scare the kids and other people who think you're wierd Cosplay Clothing Little Britain Theory of conduct The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Characters of Naruto Irish dance Spidey Super Stories Kyle Broflovski Garfield The Fairly OddParents Kilt Joker (comics) Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Negima The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Naruto jutsu Comanche Kender Marilyn Monroe Teen Girl Squad RuneScape quests Characters in the Smurfs Gothic Lolita Shoe Social aspects of clothing Perl Sewing machine Pitaten The Amazing Race Python programming language Wan Chai Ed, Edd n Eddy Simplified Chinese character Eric Cartman Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Great Teacher Onizuka Genshiken Clown Saved by the Bell Inuit Comiket Embedded system Suit (clothes) Galaxy Angel RuneScape Hatake Kakashi My Life as a Teenage Robot Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Gross domestic product Objective-C Wedding Crashers Kodocha Akatsuki (Naruto) Homestar Runner Cro Cliff Richard Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
