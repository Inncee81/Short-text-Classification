why are there naruto shippuden episodes if the regular naruto isnt done yet im confused the shippuden naruto episodes are what happens after the two year jump after suaskue runs away the regular episodes is every thing that happens in between that two year jump in the naruto manga the original naruto they don't tell what happens in that two year jump as for why they decided to show what happened in between the two year jump i really don't know just know it is not necessary to know what happened or to even watch the regular episode on the account of it doesn't really involve itself with the naruto two years later the regular episode tell what how every body trained and the missions they went on to get a few secret moves that they use when trying to hunt down sauske short story you don't have to watch the regular naruto episodes to enjoy the greatness of naruto the regular naruto is like an extra or something Naruto (manga) Naruto geography Uzumaki Naruto Naruto ninja ranks Hyuga Hinata Akatsuki (Naruto) Hyuga Neji Rock Lee Uchiha Sasuke Naruto jutsu Jiraiya (Naruto) Characters of Naruto Naruto kekkei genkai Haruno Sakura Naruto the Movie Fanon (fiction) Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 2 VIZ Media Ninja Nara Shikamaru Friends Manga Gantz Whose Line Is It Anyway?
