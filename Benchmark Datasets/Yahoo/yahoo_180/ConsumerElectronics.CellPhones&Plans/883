i really need help my verizon razor phone fell in a pool for about seconds the water detection sticker turned red and everything works but the keys none of the keys work even theones on the sides just recently i changed it so you have to flip the phone open and press answer instead of just flipping it open to talk so now when someone calls i can't answer i feel helpless i really want my phone to work again any ideas on what to do that water detection sticker was probably red before you even dropped it in the pool a little ploy so verizon never has to pay for anything that goes wrong with a phone they will just claim it got wet but your phone actually did get wet my best suggestion would be to give it a day or two and let it dry out hopefully your buttons will work again i think it's a good sign that the phone is still working good luck Push to talk Vodafone Social rule Beatmania IIDX Verizon Wireless Poker jargon Phreaking Wheel of Fortune Ron and Fez The McGuire Sisters BlackBerry 2003 United States Grand Prix Telephone booth Cheating in Counter-Strike Aerial (dance move) Flood geology Laci Peterson Residual-current device Mouse (computing) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Downing Street memo 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Telephone numbering plan 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Big Brother UK series 6 Suplex The Inside GSM services Ocean's Twelve Blood Simple Photography Prank flash Powerbomb Donald Neilson Drowning Plame affair Danger Hiptop Edward R.
