i need serious help is the lg cherry chocolate old good or bad i know ive posted s already but i need help i want to make sure that the chocolate is the best phone for me i'll give you my personal experience with old lg chocolate phone i got the original chocolate phone for christmas at first i loved it but it had many flaws that made me hate it with in a few days the phone froze all the time no matter what you were doing the touch pad only worked when it wanted to sometimes it would some times it wouldn't sometime it barely would after weeks of having the phone my camera stopped working completely and my pictures wouldn't load i even took the battery out to fix it and it didn't work so i sent it back on january and decided not to get another chocolate my cousin got the new chocolate and she'd had problems with it already the screen goes white oddly right after she slides it open meaning she has to wait to do anything on it the phone still freezes constantly and the ipod scroller is the hardest freaking thing to control she's had problems with her camera already so i hope this helps you make your decision IPod IBM PC compatible Digital photography Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon The Contender (television series) Time Out of Mind Mobile phone Hey Jude 1957 World Series Ocean's Twelve Social rule Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Recurring South Park characters Apple Computer Bluetooth Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) The Catcher in the Rye Surveillance Ashton-Tate GSM services The Amazing Race Futurama (TV series - season 2) Blood on the Tracks Good Times Winning Streak All My Children Big Brother (USA TV series) Marilyn Monroe Philip J.
