cell phone sim card question i accidentally put my phone in the washing machine and am thinking of getting a new one via ebay the phone is an lg the ericsson im looking at is the w i but it needs a sim card to work there is no sim card in the battery spot do i have to open the phone up to find it or is there one at all if i don't have a sim card is it possible to still get the ericsson on my existing plan and i'm wondering if i can use an unlocked w i on bell mobile the description says it will work on any provider but im skeptical thanks there are two separate major cell technologies cdma and gsm they are not compatible with each other cdma phones do not use a sim card generally so they have to be registered to the user through the carrier gsm phones use sim cards so it's a simple task of taking it from one and putting it in another it looks like your lg was a cdma phone while the w i is a gsm phone Global System for Mobile Communications Mobile phone Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Code division multiple access Cellular network Bluetooth Verizon Wireless Telephone numbering plan Telephone tapping Time division multiple access CDMA2000 T-Mobile Emergency telephone number W-CDMA GSM services BlackBerry N-Gage Network Switching Subsystem Wireless Application Protocol Treo 650 Advanced Mobile Phone System Wireless network Virgin Mobile International Mobile Equipment Identity Turkcell Vodafone Short message service Push to talk Evolution Data Only General Packet Radio Service Smart card 3G Treo IS-95 The Sims Multimedia Messaging System Symbian OS Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution Voice over IP Qualcomm Telephone Nordic Mobile Telephone Mobile phone radiation and health Ericsson Cingular Wireless Surveillance Sprint Nextel Corporation Mobility management IPAQ Q-Telecom Research In Motion Secure Digital card Global Positioning System Computer network Skype IP Multimedia Subsystem IBM PC compatible Telecom New Zealand Nintendo DS North American Numbering Plan 9-1-1 GSM frequency ranges Radio clock Enterprise content management History of computer and video games NSA encryption systems Parlay Modem Linux Yamigo Sony Ericsson P900 Base Station Subsystem The Sims 2: University Computer Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB Musical Instrument Digital Interface Computer and video game genres Machinima Automatic teller machine Handheld game console Thiruvananthapuram Session Initiation Protocol Vodafone Japan Nokia Gmail RISC Telstra Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Microbrowser IPod International Mobile Subscriber Identity Danger Hiptop Octopus card Electronic commerce Billboard (advertising)
