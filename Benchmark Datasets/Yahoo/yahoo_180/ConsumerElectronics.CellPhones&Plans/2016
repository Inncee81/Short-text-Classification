are there any t mobile employees on here i need some important information i'm wanting to switch from my cell phone provider and go to t mobile i want to get a sidekick or sidekick id what do i need to know in advance how much would i have to pay upfront and what are the best plans for someone who talks alot but can manage to watch the minutes but i text all day also is the sidekick id smaller than the regular one what are the qualites about each phone i'm not a t mobile employee i do have the service though but i've been in the business for a couple years and learned a couple things i'm going to break down each question here what do you need to know in advance the best advice is to know how well you're covered in your area there is no point in switching service if the t mobile has horrible coverage in your area this coverage map from t mobile will give you a heads up but don't depend on it when you get t mobile you have days to decided if you want to keep the contract http www t mobile com coverage wt srch result inq inqsource tmo paying upfront really depends on how good your credit is if it's average you may not have any type of deposit if you have really bad credit you will have to get into something they call a smart access what that is that you are only allowed to have so much on your bill you may not be able to go over a month plus you will have to deposit for the plans that t mobile offer they are really good at least in my opinion if you have specific people that you talk to all day you can get into the myfaves that is where you can talk with any numbers you want even landlines unlimited they have myfaves plans that start for another perk is that if you want you can add mobile to mobile for so you don't have to add other t mobile customers as your myfaves and if you are getting a sidekick you will have to get a sidekick unlimited plan anyway with that you get unlimited text messages and im's and unlimited internet that will cost an extra the sidekick and sidekick id are the same size but the id doesn't have bluetooth camera or music player what are qualities about each phone wow there are a few phones that t mobiles offer jump over to t mobile com to see what they have to offer some phones are just phones other phones have things like bluetooth camera media players or email and then there are blackberries check out the phones then when you decide which one looks most appealing to you go to this website and read what other people have thought about the same phone http www phonescoop com i hope that helps a little with some of the questions that you had if you have any more you can im when i'm online Virgin Mobile BlackBerry Voice over IP Bluetooth Surveillance GSM services Global System for Mobile Communications Short message service Skype UK telephone numbering plan Telephone numbering plan Blog IP Multimedia Subsystem Mobile phone T-Mobile Cellular network Credit card Gmail Internet Opera (web browser) America Online Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Digital photography Danger Hiptop Sprint Nextel Corporation General Packet Radio Service EGovernment Phishing Octopus card Broadband Internet access Internet fraud Q-Telecom Live 8 Japanese mobile phone culture Wireless Application Protocol MSN Messenger Website The Amazing Race Network Switching Subsystem ITunes Music Store Electronic commerce Public transport Friends Insurance Telephone Data retention Online music store Secure Digital card MTR IPAQ Musical Instrument Digital Interface Katelyn Faber Windows Mobile CompuServe E-mail spam Social rule Integrated Services Digital Network Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Spam (electronic) Wi-Fi Enterprise content management Webmail World Wide Web Advance fee fraud Instant messaging Life insurance Multimedia Messaging System United States Postal Service Digital rights management Aggregator 7 July 2005 London bombings Taxicab Legal research Telephone tapping Private branch exchange The Sims Tesco Pretty Good Privacy Customer relationship management XML Advanced Mobile Phone System Floppy disk Smartphone NEC Corporation Outsourcing HyperText Transfer Protocol N-Gage Final Fantasy Student loan
