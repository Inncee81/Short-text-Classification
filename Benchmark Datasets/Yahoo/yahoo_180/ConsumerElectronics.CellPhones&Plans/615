cingular sim card phone question hi i was wandering i have two of the same phones i want to switch the sim card in them but when i did the phone numbers did not change is there a way to do this thnx sorry for not being overly clear i don't mean the contacts didn't change but the cell phone number itself when i changed the sim card and somebody called me on my old phone's number it didn't ring the new phone you did it correctly so i don't know why the new phone wouldn't have rung maybe there is a problem with the new phone or the sim card wasn't inserted properly into the new phone but really it should be as simple as taking the sim card out of one phone and putting it into another hope that helps Global System for Mobile Communications GSM services The Sims Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Network Switching Subsystem N-Gage Emergency telephone number Bluetooth Ocean's Twelve Vodafone Telephone numbering plan Mobile phone Payphone The Emancipation of Mimi Telephone exchange Smart card Vertical service code Speech recognition Surveillance Mobility management Cellular network Poker jargon Subscriber Identity Module United Airlines Flight 93 Punch card President (game) 9-1-1 T-Mobile The Inside Exponential distribution The Sims 2: Nightlife Shaggy dog story Japanese mobile phone culture UK telephone numbering plan Universal Serial Bus North American Numbering Plan Plame affair Eye Telephone number Digital photography Sheepshead Voice over IP Winning Streak Social rule Trapped in the Closet Plame affair timeline Ron and Fez Memory card Combinatorics 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Modem International Mobile Subscriber Identity Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Jack plug Electrophysiology Cerebus the Aardvark BlackBerry Telephone International Mobile Equipment Identity Mach kernel Secure Digital card Overlay plan Ethernet Predictive dialer The Sims 2: University Skype Verizon Wireless Normal distribution IBM PC compatible Machinima Phone fraud Card game Secure Terminal Equipment Photography Good Morning, Vietnam System/36 Quantification Wi-Fi Data retention Procrastination Friends Tokimeki Memorial EasyGroup Quiz Call Telephone card Computer and video game genres Major League Baseball television contracts Phreaking History of computer and video games Indian English Argentine telephone numbering plan Virgin Mobile Extreme Championship Wrestling Vince McMahon Slashdot subculture British national identity card
