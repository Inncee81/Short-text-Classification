i have a nokia but no matter what setting i choose it doesn't ring when called or msg received or alarm the only sound it makes is keypad beeps and it vibrates ok have tried it on all profiles including loud if anyone else has had this happen and got it sorted please could you let me know how thanks something might be wrong with your speakers even though keypad beeps work that's not the same kind of sound i would take it to wherever you got it and if they can't fix it they'll probably replace it Short message service Morse Code Sound Jeopardy!
