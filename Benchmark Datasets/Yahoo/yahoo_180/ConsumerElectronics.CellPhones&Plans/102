what the best cell phone provider the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence this applies to cell phones too sometimes i love my service other times i want to throw my phone out of my car mobile companies share common problems too many customers for too few towers or have their own problems the best bet is to ask your friends that live in the local area the quality of the service can change dramatically for each provider depending on the location i've lived in a lot of places and travel a lot for work so i know sometimes my provider sprint is best while other times another provider is better or mine doesn't work at all it also depends on your desires some providers have exclusive agreements think apple iphone and at t or gsm traveling the world i know i didn't really answer your question but it's best to evaluate your needs do you travel and what your friends in the local area think of their service if you live in a major city and don't travel much then it's best to go with the one that has the lowest monthly charge in december when my contract runs out i'm transferring my service to a gsm provider most likely at t or t mobile why because i like being able to go anywhere almost in the world and still use my phone even if the roaming charge is inflated also because the domestic monthly charge is about cheaper for my cellular plan and additions finally because the variety of equipment and the discount associated with transferring service makes it enticing i've been with sprint for years now and the customer service is lousy so they've given me no reason to stay loyal even if the other providers are equally lousy Global System for Mobile Communications Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Verizon Wireless GSM services Telephone numbering plan Cellular network Virgin Mobile Mobile phone Turkcell Sprint Nextel Corporation T-Mobile North American Numbering Plan Vodafone IP Multimedia Subsystem Bluetooth Emergency telephone number 9-1-1 Telephone tapping Nordic Mobile Telephone Voice over IP Microeconomics Q-Telecom AT&T Telephone Toll-free telephone number GSM frequency ranges Network Switching Subsystem Public transport Broadband Internet access Private branch exchange Advanced Mobile Phone System UK telephone numbering plan Octopus card General Packet Radio Service Insurance Cingular Wireless Surveillance WiMAX Inflation Auto insurance Telephone number portability Computer Cable television Iridium (satellite) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wi-Fi GPRS Core Network Speech recognition Time division multiple access Telephone booth TransUnion Filling station U.S. Cellular Code division multiple access MTR W-CDMA EasyGroup Bay Area Rapid Transit Digital Subscriber Line Outsourcing Vodafone Japan NTT DoCoMo Economy of Nigeria Euro Poker jargon ALLTEL Wireless Application Protocol Amateur radio Digital photography ITunes Music Store Electrophysiology Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Eircom TiVo Telecom New Zealand Price discrimination Health insurance Publicly funded medicine The Amazing Race Telstra Mobile Virtual Network Operator Connex-Vodafone C__ile Ferate Rom__ne Action potential N-Gage United States Postal Service Monopoly IS-95 International Mobile Subscriber Identity Radiolocation Mutual fund Stock Telephone number Enterprise content management Caltrain
