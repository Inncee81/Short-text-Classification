how to be patient i lost my cell phone and i just won a new one on ebay on friday and the shipping says business days but i cant wait i need the phone now how can i be patient and what are some things i can do to pass the time i am in the same situation you are i'm getting a new phone from ebay and i won it on friday too however i have no idea when it is coming because the shipping says standard flat rate shipping service the shipping was so i'm hoping it's quick to get here plus the seller lives in the same state that i do i will wait about a week for them to notify me when they shipped it i wish these sellers would communicate to us buyers and tell us when they ship the item so we don't just sit around and wonder but they're not obligated to i like sellers who ship the item on the next business day but again sellers differ in what they do sometimes it takes them a couple of days to give me a tracking number and sometimes there's none at all the best way to get something quickly is to e mail the seller before you bid to try and arrange a different method of shipping of course this different method of shipping may cost more well here i am impatiently waiting for my phone and it's only been business days i'm just so used to getting things quickly but summer days move slowly don't they i even looked up why am i impatient for things to ship on yahoo answers just because i was bored and i found someone in the same situation as me so i was forced to sign up to answer your question here are some suggestions to keep you busy without wasting your time on the computer take a class i'm taking one right now and it takes up a lot of hours enjoy the outdoors go play a sport or walk exercise walk the dog play a video game read a book watch t v cook something learn how to cook clean your house clean up your computer go shopping listen to music watch a movie get some rest spend time with friends and family i find that the more i'm on my computer waiting for a shipping update or waiting for the mail man to come the longer it feels i'm waiting for my package to arrive it's best to enjoy the billions of other things you could be doing rather than simply waiting and waiting and waiting there are always billions of choices to pick and to do go out there have some fun forget about the cellphone and it will arrive before you know it Social rule Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Apprentice 2 Shaggy dog story Microeconomics Internet fraud Ben Johnson (athlete) Gmail Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Amazon.com Ocean's Twelve Wheel of Fortune Little Britain Auction Daylight saving time Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma United States Postal Service Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Wal-Mart Verizon Wireless Poker jargon Contemporary culture of South Korea Titanic (1997 film) Milton H.
