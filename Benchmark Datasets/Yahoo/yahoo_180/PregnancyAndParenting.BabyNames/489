baby girl karisa eve what does everyone think of this name my fiance put alot of time thought into this name it means embrace life i was just curious what everyone thinks first of all thanks for everyone comments greatly appreciated but i have something special to say to attorney in florida i wasn't aware that karisa was an odd name nor hard to pronouce as far as him choosing that actual spelling it's because each spelling has it's own meaning for instance carissa means caress not embrace it's both the names that we like not just karisa also i personally think have a longer middle name with more syllables would be more complicated this name was not picked because it is cute we did out research this me we went through websites looking one site claimed to have over names we appreciate the meaning mostly because it took our precious one over years to come it was definatly a miracle for us her daddy spent over hrs alone one night while i slept and this is what he choose out of the or so names we liked which i am sure our daughter will appreciate as well the only nickname that can be used for karisa is kari yes we have considered it and no we don't have a problem with it by that time it will be her choice is she wants that nickname of not frankly i don't think any name should be based off whether or not it's professional a name should be based on the little on at hand why didn't i put her last name up there hmm i am sure tons of people on here know the common sense reason for that being left out regardless you can't choose what your last name is but i will say we have also considered the flow of it and don't think it will be a problem to miss riley loved the comment about the golf course most of all thanks for your comment congrats on your precious son however i am sorry to hear about your loss good luck on completing your family i hope you have all the little ones you deserve to have i love the name and i think a big congrats is in order for both you daddy i know what its like to wait years and years until finally you are preggy it took my hubby i a bit longer than you but finally we have a beautiful month ld little boy to love i just had a miscarriage in may and we are trying so hard for baby i just posted a question about baby names and the lovely attorney was rude in his comment to me too i wonder if the golf course is shut down for the day or something i seem to think he should have something better to do than tell us how to 'professionally spell' our childrens names geez anyways congrats lyn Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theodicy AFI 100 Years series EastEnders Social rule Shaggy dog story Ron and Fez Knots Landing Sean Combs Theory of conduct Infantilism Cliff Richard Love and Theft Paul Is Dead Friends Humphrey Bogart Oasis (band) Hip hop collaborations Billboard Hot 100 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Poker jargon Charmed Japanese name Sharon Tate Craps Family name Miscarriage of justice The Jazz Singer Avenue Q Characters in the Smurfs Plame affair Hangul John the Baptist Empire Burlesque World Championship Wrestling Norway national football team 1957 World Series Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Summa Theologiae Religious conversion Leo Wyatt Slow Train Coming Tenchi Muyo!
