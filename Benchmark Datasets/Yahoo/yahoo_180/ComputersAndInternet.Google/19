why has yahoo released my real name from my profile to the internet at large via google i googled my name and it showed my yahoo profile confidential information including my real name now that i have asked about this i expect it will show up on google too i don't see it didn't work for myself but someone with the same name came up on a yahoo search but not a google search the page is a public profile page yahoo directory did you ever sign up for a directory or people search through yahoo in the past maybe or put your name on the public profile page on yahoo com maybe go and edit your public profile page on yahoo so no information is public anything you put on the public profile is for the public to see and says so on the top so maybe go undo all that stuff especially your name if that's what happened lady d is a book sold on amazon can i have your autograph Search engine Website Web traffic Gmail Google Search engine optimization Mozilla Firefox Autograph Google search Amazon.com Telephone directory Google bomb Open Directory Project Yahoo!
