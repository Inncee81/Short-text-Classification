question for people who had bb live feeds in the past seasons were the house guests in the big brother house on other seasons as awful as the house guests this year has there ever been as much fighting between the house guests as there is now this is the first year i've had access to any live shows and the way cbs edits the show is very misleading as a matter of fact this is nothing new there is always animosity at theis point one of the reasons they did not tell kail about eric was the possibility that they may need to put her back in the house this week if tensions get to violence or as dick and daniele have threatened one of them quits james threatened to quit at this point in a season and they learned from the experience if it ends in a tie either no one wins or more judges are needed and people will stop watching the show the problem is america's player the concept builds anger and distrust and eventually america turns on the player and the player turns on america eric has been told to turn on dustin and he will no doubt turn on america choosing to fail the task as is cbs lies to america making it look like eric gets his vote on thursday when he knows about it on wednesday at midnight after the votes are in from tuesday they also tell the players through diary questions who to vote for that is why eric is still in the house but look at what eric does and they have talked in house about it he gets people to fight with one another by doing things and blaming them on other houseguests who in turn get in fights with the people he was speaking with sure dick is pistol but people would not be as agitated by him if they were not looking for the snitch the back stabber and the vandal all of who were eric he is th snake in the cartoons slithering up to the king to get him to attack someone last night he threatened to dig a hole and bury dick and daniele alive he told people to make sure daniele ended up on slop from now on he told jessica to turn on her alliance he has told everyone to do that sure those are things that happen in the game but now they are being orchestrated by cbs and the reality is gone from the show Big Brother (USA TV series) Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Saturday Night Live Big Brother UK series 6 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ty Cobb Wheel of Fortune Survivor (TV series) The Joker's Wild Sin City The Amazing Race The Ashlee Simpson Show Major League Baseball television contracts Shawn Michaels American Idol RuneScape quests Survivor: Palau Cindy Sheehan Theory of conduct Alex Ferguson Whose Line Is It Anyway?
