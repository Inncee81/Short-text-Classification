bb uk so amy has gone another big character bites the dust why do the public do this well you know i have no faith in the british public and think that the guy that said that its mainly jealous and insecure girls is right lets face it if men voted anywhere near as much as women she'd probably still be in but i also agree with liya a really big character like charley would have confronted carole if she said those kind of things about her and for not having the guts or brains the size of her boobs to she deserved what she got in the end as i have been saying i think for entertainments sake that evicting should be taken out of the public's hands as in us the public gets too wound up and consumed with hatred and just jumps on the lastest bandwagon and just ruins the show dr bad and it is just a show Big Brother (USA TV series) Sin City Friends EastEnders Toilet humour Bad Wolf Guilty Gear Paranoia Agent Humphrey Bogart Stewie Griffin Bandwagon effect Recurring South Park characters Breast Futurama (TV series - season 3) Static Shock Solar Element Saga Philip J.
