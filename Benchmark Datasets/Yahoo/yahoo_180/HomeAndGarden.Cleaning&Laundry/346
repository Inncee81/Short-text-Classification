how do i keep flannel from fading i have these really cute p j 's and they're flannel and i don't want them to fade when i wash them so i was wondering if there is a secret to washing them you can set the dye in the fabric by washing them in warm water with a cup of regular salt dissolved in it let them soak for at least a half hour then continue the cycle as normal the thing with flannel and fading is that if the yarns aren't dyed prior to their being woven into fabric they are then surface dyed and because flannel is fuzzy or brushed textured they will inevitably fade no matter what is done you can tell which flannel you have by looking at the inside of the fabric if it is exactly the same as the outside it was dyed prior to being woven and therefore the yarns have been saturated if it is lighter than the outside or if the outside has a printed pattern it is the latter and i'm sorry it will fade at least with the salt soaking it may prolong the fading from happening i hope this helped Textile manufacturing terminology Weaving Upholstery Knitting Cloth Yarn Leather Ink Ammonia Menstrual cycle Textile Technicolor Jute Dry cleaning Cashmere wool Kimono Tofu Alpaca Casting Dye Indigo dye Clothing World Series Batik Silk Calotype Tire Soap Tattoo Tooth Undergarment Coir Collodion process Bong Laundry detergent Dog Opportunity rover Linen Wallpaper Soil Nuclear fallout Decompression sickness Edible salt Anodising Washing machine Screen-printing Charles Goodyear Acetic acid Dairy Menstrual cup Crochet Laserdisc Idli Towel Korean art Fuzzy logic Pottery Denim Rice Mattress Tie-dye Cheese Felt Mars Exploration Rover Kosher foods Sodium hydroxide Manicure Cochineal Ion exchange resin Solar cell Inkjet printer Water Tanning Water (molecule) Xiaolin Showdown Alum Thermal power station Grunge music Ikat Industrial wastewater treatment Motorcycle Turquoise Water purification Sari Compact disc Domesticated turkey Electrophysiology Carbon dioxide Sodium sulfate Car wash Horse Milton H.
