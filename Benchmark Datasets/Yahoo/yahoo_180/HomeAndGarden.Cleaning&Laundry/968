can bed bugs jump off a mattress and into carpet and stay there for weeks then jump on someone elses matress i have a situation where somebody has moved out of a house and there was absolutely no furniture in the house and there is only carpet in the bedrooms then a new person has moved in they claim that bed bugs were in the house from the first day they went in i am asking is it possible for the bed mites to stay in the house or did the bitch bring them in her mattress please help court cases are a comin' it is more likely that she brought them if the house was empty however although they are called bed bugs they are actually dust mites dust mites live off dead skin which is why they love being in beds every night they can have a good feed they don't harm us they actually do us good by removing the dead skin and allowing new skin to breath they help us to have healthy skin however i have a funny feeling that what this person is calling bed bugs are not bed bugs but body lice if it is body lice then she would most certainly have carried the lice herself the lice cannot survive in carpets etc for too long they need the body for feeding and breeding they are not like fleas fleas will have a feed lay eggs and then jump off the carrier they will then wait for a different host to come along and have a feed breed and lay eggs on that host etc etc body lice can't jump the only way they spread is from either close contact between people or through coming off the host and waiting for the host to return in other words if you carried the lice you would have to brush against her for any of the lice to cross over to her if she lays in a bed and the louse come off her body they will wait until she returns to that bed one other highly likely explanation is that it is highly likely that she has slept with somebody that was carrying body lice if she only has them in a certain area of the body they may even be pubic lice crabs and therefore if they are pubic lice she would have had to sleep with you if you gave them to her lol as it appears that this person is possibly suing you you need to get more information as to exactly what these bugs are once you know exactly what they are you can get your defence btw bed bugs dust mites are microscopic so she would not be able to see them only feel them if she could see them then they are lice you need to find ourt which type as there are three common ones head lice but they do only stay on the head pubic lice crabs which only live in the pubic hair and body lice which can live on any part of the body but do prefer the hottest parts i hope this info helps Crab louse Bedbug House dust mite Diseases of the honeybee Mattress Guinea pig Fancy rat Pediculosis Flea Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pubic hair Minor Harry Potter Beasts Tick Hair Mosquito Honeybee Beetle Anopheles Poker jargon Louse Scabies Depilation Professional wrestling holds Prostate cancer Dog Androgen insensitivity syndrome EastEnders Phoebe Buffay's songs Social rule Crab Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Waterbed Cat Clothing Puberty Hematophagy Dog agility Black Death Breastfeeding Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fugu Kakapo Theory of conduct Insect Equine conformation The Subtle Knife Rocky Mountain spotted fever Lou Gehrig Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Bat Platypus Aerial (dance move) Sexually-transmitted infection Darwin from Orchids to Variation Muslim ibn Aqeel Donald Neilson Snake Hamster Out-of-body experience Hazing Professional wrestling throws Plagues of Egypt Thermal power station Malaria Body piercing Allergy The Cure Mange Schistosomiasis Arthropod Funeral Gypsy moth Computer virus Micronauts Heartworm Professional wrestling attacks Tsetse fly Mario Breath of Fire III Albatross 613 mitzvot Pok__mon Abilities Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Customs and etiquette of Japan Meat Loaf Skin The Legend of Zelda series enemies
