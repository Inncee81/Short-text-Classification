how can i revive my clothing my cleaner put my new clothes whites and colors in the washing machine and then dryer now they are all tan color and have shrunk what can i do they are brand new baby items and i am very very upset gosh i imagine i'd be really angry you'll need to look at each individual item and see if it can be saved some cotton items can be soaked in bleach if you'd like them to be white as for those shrunken items heavy sigh if they are knit it's possible they will stretch back out if you are able to wet them and lay them horizontally on some towels try pulling them into shape this can work on sweaters if they are just too small now then i'd suggest donating them to a homeless shelter or a woman's center maybe someone with a tiny baby can get some use from them train your cleaner or do your own wash at least leave the laundry in batches you've already sorted out with tags indicating how hot the water should be Textile manufacturing Washing machine Menstrual cup Upholstery Knitting Diaper Laundry detergent Dry cleaning Mattress Casting Laundry Textile manufacturing terminology Tanning Weaving Tattoo Car washing techniques Sento Menstrual cycle Towel Ironing Strap-on dildo Clothing Manicure Mario Dishwasher Kilt Japanese toilet Japanese tea ceremony Swimming pool Traffic light Sugar beet Sauna Canadian Armed Forces Paper Genericized trademark Tampon Pottery Felt Linen Mario Kart: Double Dash!!
