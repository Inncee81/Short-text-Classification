how do i clean mold out of a mattress my family and i moved to a humid area about six months ago and our stuff has been in storage until today when i got my mattresses out they were covered in mold they are fairly new and extremely expensive so i don't want to get rid of them does anyone know a way to clean the mold out that won't ruin the mattresses and will completely get rid of the mold so that it won't regrow toss the mattresses no matter how expensive the mattresses are they are ruined mold can be extremely dangerous especially for people with allergies or immune system problems it's not worth your health to hang onto moldy mattresses mold is a plant and the roots will have penetrated to the inside bleach will not work contrary to what most people think as evidenced by the answer above me because of the chemical make up of bleach the active bleach ingredient will not penetrate a surface only the water part of the solution will and the water is what the mold needs to thrive and grow so when you use bleach on mold you are actually giving it what it wants the water true the mold plants on the surface may be killed the spores probably will not be killed by bleach and the mold stains may disappear but you have not killed the root of the problem when people see the mold stains disappear they mistakenly think they have killed the mold with is simply not true what will work for of all mold types is vinegar but you would really have to dump gallons on the mattresses and soak them all the way through also tea tree oil will kill virtually all mold but this is expensive and to get enough to do the job a new mattress would be cheaper don't gamble on this throw the mattresses out Mattress Plastic Strap-on dildo Toxic mold Water purification Menstrual cup Vinegar Sodium hypochlorite Cheese Disinfection Coir Tooth enamel Hydrogen peroxide Sake Solar power Bacteria Ozone Allergy Coffee Bong Pollution Hamster Sterilization (microbiology) Naval mine Flowering plant Acorn Dishwashing Water Theory of conduct Coral reef Ecology Wheat RuneScape skills Explosive material Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Dog Myxobolus cerebralis Fungus Hard disk Alcohol fuel Hydrogen economy Illegal drug trade Root Peanut Energy development Weed control Tattoo Mosquito Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Chocolate Hemp Wind power Autonomous building Floppy disk Mushroom hunting Houseplant Carbon dioxide Environmental concerns with electricity generation Sorghum Irrigation Immune system Carnivorous plant Ice cream Rooibos Hair coloring American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Renewable energy Thermal power station Casting Xenomorph Plant Mach kernel Textile manufacturing Japanese tea ceremony Saved by the Bell Arguments for and against drug prohibition Tea Sulfuric acid Natural gas Laundry detergent Sodium percarbonate Dishwasher Piccolo Junior Saga Tiberium Air-raid shelter Wood pulp Soil pH Fire extinguisher Polyurethane Biodiesel Psoriasis Fuel cell Nuclear power Birth control Hydrochloric acid Diaper
