do you put the detergent on top of the clothes i put the clothes in first then i add the blue liquid detergent its my first time i havent done it yet but is that okay then i turn the water on i am just afraid the blue liquid will do something to the clothes i used to do it that way for a real long time and it really didn't seem like it did anything except one time i was at a place with blacklights and there was this weird stain thing on my shirt turns out that's the detergent so unless you're going to be under a blacklight don't worry about it Laundry detergent Washing machine Detergent Textile manufacturing Soap Laundry Hydrogen peroxide Dry cleaning Plastic Fluorescent lamp Staining (biology) Dishwasher Tide Soap bubble Shirt Brewery Urticaria Sodium sulfate Hat Highway 61 Revisited Upholstery Sulfuric acid Sodium percarbonate Ultraviolet Motor oil Snoop Dogg Ecco the Dolphin Lake Ontario Mattress Sulfur Paul Is Dead Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Glossary of firefighting equipment Piccolo Junior Saga Jennifer Lopez Billiards Chromatography Sterilization (microbiology) Aerial (dance move) Glycerin Sampling (music) Kim Possible Starch Gaia Online Car washing techniques Shaggy dog story Western blot Sodium hydroxide Social aspects of clothing Mario Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wok The Fairly OddParents Dishwashing The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Undergarment Comanche Sodium chloride Time Out of Mind Kingdom Hearts II Characters in the Smurfs Sewage treatment Tallit SDS-PAGE Scrubs Night (book) Grammy Awards of 1989 Geyser Steven Wright Arsenal F.C.
