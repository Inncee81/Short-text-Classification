chemical free way to clean my stove hoping for the best chemical like easy off free way to clean my stove i've soaked my racks in amonia and now i am wanting to get the rest of my oven clean please help place a pot full of boiling water and some lemon juice into your oven and close the door for about minutes don't turn the oven on the steam from the pot should loosen the grease and soot from the oven's surfaces so you can sponge it off if that doesn't work try making a paste with baking soda and water and use a sponge to scrub at the dirt it will be more work to clean up than the steam method but not more than using those chemical cleaners i hate them too my last resort when all else fails is to use steel wool soap pads followed by a damp sponge to get the residue off Wok Cookware and bakeware Kitchen Textile manufacturing Soap Stove Dishwasher Sterilization (microbiology) Idli Coffee Microwave oven Mattress Agar plate Menstrual cup Dishwashing Fire fighting Fossil fuel power plant Town gas Brewery Portable stove Dry cleaning Vinegar Vacuum Barbecue Risotto Brazing Internal ballistics Soldering Hydrochloric acid Upholstery Laundry detergent Beverage can stove Heat Snooker Printed circuit board Hebburn Tattoo Poker jargon Jewish cuisine Bong Water purification Car washing techniques Shampoo Dairy Vacuum cleaner Sodium Hydroponics Japanese tea ceremony Sento Solar power Yoghurt Frog The Coca-Cola Company Bagel Tea Sodium hydroxide Ice cream Carbon dioxide Energy development Plastic Hemp Washing machine Cake Basic English Eight ball Toilet paper Slow cooker Iron Thermal power station Titanium Haloalkane Citric acid Vulcanization Detergent Pancake Roast beef Cuisine of the Philippines Hydrogen chloride Steam engine Houseplant Violin Manicure Tooth Weaving Haggis Industrial wastewater treatment Fishing Boat building Alkane Cast iron Kraft Dinner Sodium hypochlorite Pottery Pasta Illegal drug trade Rum Aluminium
