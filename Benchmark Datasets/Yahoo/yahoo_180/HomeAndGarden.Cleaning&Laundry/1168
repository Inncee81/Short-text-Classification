why do my bath towels smell burnt after washing ever time i wash my towels they have an unusual smell to them it isn't exactly mildew but more like a burnt or electrical smell i can buy new towels and after awhile it does the same thing the only towels that don't do this is our beach towels i don't leave them sit in the washer they are put into the dryer right away and then they are taken out as soon as they are dry i thought maybe i was drying them to long so i shorten the dry time and still the same thing does anyone know why this is happening and if so please let me know do they smell that way after washing or after drying if it's after drying your dryer may have a clogged vent and might be running too hot but not hot enough to trip the high temp limit switch go outside while it's running and see if the vent is working it should blow about as much warm air as a good sized hair dryer if it's appreciably less than that there may be a clog Sauna Upholstery Towel Sento Menstrual cup Washing machine Customs and etiquette of Japan Japanese toilet Paper towel Cruising (maritime) Diving suit Manicure Carburetor Common cold Casting Tattoo Social rule Drag racing Blood Simple Thermal power station Cannabis cultivation Swimming pool Plumbing fixture Collecting fossils Sulfur Toilet Textile manufacturing Urticaria Carbon dioxide The Star Wars Holiday Special Billboard Hot 100 Residual-current device Electrophysiology Diaper Towelie Rocket fuel Hyperthermia Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Home repair Time Out of Mind Dry cleaning Fire fighting Car washing techniques Tank Wok Syphon Filter Fujian tea ceremony The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Solar power Weather lore Bong Hiberno-English Hand washing Water Dishwasher Sugarcane Ammonia Paragliding Teen Girl Squad Campfire Phoebe Buffay's songs Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Polyethylene terephthalate Baby bottle Spontaneous human combustion Swamp cooler Hot air balloon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nuclear fallout Explosive material Climate of the United Kingdom Hydrogen peroxide Spark plug Menstrual cycle K__ppen climate classification Geography of Bolivia Feet washing Furnace AFI 100 Years series Atomism Instant coffee Pet Sounds Pittsburgh Steelers The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases The Suffering (game) Automobile emissions control Humphrey Bogart Full Metal Panic?
