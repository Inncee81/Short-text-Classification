does smoking in the shower absorb the smell no i am sorry to say but this does not have this affect on cigarette smoke and for this problem i recommend this get rid of smoke odor if you've recently burned a steak or if your chain smoking aunt recently paid you a surprise visit remove the lingering smoky odor by placing a shallow bowl about three quarters full of white or cider vinegar in the room where the scent is strongest use several bowls if the smell permeates your entire home the odor should be gone in less than a day you can also quickly dispense of the smell of fresh cigarette smoke inside a room by moistening a cloth with vinegar and waving it around a bit good luck Bong Fish and chips Vinegar Skunk Tobacco Odor Sauna Sulfur Tobacco smoking Smoking pipe Cigar Tofu Cuisine of the Philippines Barbecue V.F.D.
