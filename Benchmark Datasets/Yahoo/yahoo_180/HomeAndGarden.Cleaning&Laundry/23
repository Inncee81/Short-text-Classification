how to preserve a shirt w sharpie writing on it hi i have this batik t shirt that we made at camp with sharpie autographs from everyone there i really don't want the colors or the sharpie writing to run how can i wash the shirt without having the writing or colors run is there anything i can do to set the color thanks for all your help i would put some vinegar in a spray bottle and spritz some on the shirt to see if the ink runs if not soak the shirt in a mixture of water and vinegar for several hours sometimes a salt water solution will do the trick i soak my new jeans in vinegar to keep them blue and it helps good luck Vinegar Sharpie (marker) Acetic acid Invisible ink Pickling Starch Salt Tofu Sushi Ketchup Tanning Otitis externa Laundry detergent Idli Sulfuric acid Cheese Haggis Mayonnaise Leather Softball Water Ink Sodium hydroxide Denim Jewish cuisine Chromatography Food preservation Silver Tattoo CMYK color model Soy milk Wallpaper Robert Palmer (British singer) Gilding Textile manufacturing White phosphorus incendiary Fire extinguisher Dishwasher Soy protein Chowder Batik Manicure Drawing Coffee Urban beach Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington Hydroponics Kosher foods Opportunity rover Textile manufacturing terminology Concentration Single malt Scotch Heracles The Warriors Ham Solvent Roman eating and drinking Tallit Beer Food additive Scotch whisky Tempeh Bong Water purification Dishwashing Sodium chloride Champagne (beverage) Sheryl Crow Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Common bean Citric acid Technicolor Beachwear Barbecue Paul Is Dead Ammonia Leo Frank Inkjet printer Printmaking Plastic Color theory Collodion process Cuisine of the Philippines Menstrual cup Suit (cards) Carl Barks Oplan Bojinka Rum Sea-Monkey Australian Sharpie Suit (clothes) Suspension (chemistry) Fish sauce Hangi Fountain pen Paint Pysanka Iron-gall nut ink
