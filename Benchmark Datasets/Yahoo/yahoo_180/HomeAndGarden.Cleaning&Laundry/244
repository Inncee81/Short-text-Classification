my shirts keep turning orange here's my problem for some reason all of my shirts are turning orange in the washing machine my mom does the laundry yet she can't explain why it happens i do not own a single orange shirt nor does anyone else in the house yet my shirts continually come out with orange patches around the collar nobody else's shirts just mine this has been an on going problem for the past or years one shirt after another falls victim to the orange patch at first we thought it was just clothes from old navy even some of my pants from there grey ones began to show orange spots now we have found that it happens to any and all of my clothes what could be the problem does anyone know why this affects only my clothes and no others in the wash since it is happening only to your clothes and not everyone else's in the house then i would hazard a guess that it is something you are coming in contact with find whatever it is that you are using or coming in contact with that no one else in the house uses and you'll probably have your culprit some of these items could be acne medicine tanning lotion sunblock or a chemical you may be exposed to outside of the home oil etc you'd be surprised at how much of an item can transfer from you to your clothing or how little of it can be a problem hehehe i know of a story of one car manufacturer they had a big problem with paint peeling on their cars when they finally chased the problem down it was the antipersperant some of their paint employees were wearing and they were fully suited in protective clothing but enough was transferred through their sweat to their hands and then to the car surface that it caused the paint to peel heheheh one other source to consider prescription medicine some medicines have some strange side effects for example if you use certain antibiotics you need to stay out of direct sunlight because you will burn easier some meds cause you to create more 'oil' on your skin etc again find whatever it is that you are using or coming in contact with that no one else in the house is and you will most likely have your source have fun Psoriasis Acne Eczema Sunscreen Sunburn Skin Plastic Leather Canadian Armed Forces Common cold Social aspects of clothing Urticaria Undergarment Shirt Car handling Characters in the Smurfs Fire fighting Electrophysiology Hydrogen peroxide Casting Spidey Super Stories Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Magical thinking Cowboy Essential oil Renewable energy Ultraviolet Textile manufacturing Comanche Manual transmission Tattoo Procter & Gamble Soap Jute Scar Mesothelioma Chemise Dioxin The Family from One End Street Doctor (Doctor Who) Energy development Gaia Online Sento Protective clothing The Amazing Race Methamphetamine Spontaneous human combustion Hay fever Manicure Upholstery Patent medicine Dairy Pneumonia Scabies Tag The Inside Pottery Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chaos Emerald Rosacea Tire Hiking Sun The Warriors Puberty Motor oil Solar power Doraemon Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Items in the Metroid series Laundry Single bullet theory Jesuit College Preparatory School Suit (clothes) GunBound The Dalek Invasion of Earth Mercury (element) Operation Petticoat Androgen insensitivity syndrome Quake III Arena Softball Carbon dioxide Scenes from a Memory Ozone depletion Medicine Hazing The Invisibles Hemp Fast bowling The Caves of Androzani Fecal incontinence White-collar worker War of the Worlds (2005 film) Animal Crossing Waste management
