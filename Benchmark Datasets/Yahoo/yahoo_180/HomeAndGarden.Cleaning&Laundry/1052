any organization tips please okay school starts in exactly two weeks and my office and bedroom are both complete disasters i'm usually an organized person but with all the new text books and clothes everything's beginning to cram i've already gotten rid of some stuff i don't need and sold it on ebay any other ideas on how to organize it all i'd like to start the new year fresh what i have been dying to do in my house is take it one room at a time completely empty everything in the room except large furnature items that you know will be staying in there put it all in another room and pick through the stuff only put back the stuff in the room that is necessary in there what you have left over decide if it can go somewhere else in your house if not then pitch it sell it give it away whatever that's if you actually have time to do that it could take a few days but it would be worth it in the end as far as school organization i bought a cubbie hole furniture piece from walmart for only like i use it for my kids toys but it would be great to organize backpacks books school supplies etc my cubbie unit comes with cubes in it depending on how many kids you have give them a certain number of cubes to put their things in they also sell great closet organizers that have the days of the week marked on them i am thinking of getting one for my daughter this year when she starts school this way on sunday i can put each day's outfit in the slot and cut down on time in the mornings by picking out clothes if your kids are old enough to pick out their own clothes to put in the slots that works even better if you start with a clean house it's easier to keep it organized so give your house a good cleaning and encourage your kids to put the things in appropriate places so they know where it is for the next day Blankets (graphic novel) Animal Crossing Aerial (dance move) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hamster Japanese tea ceremony 1957 World Series The Apprentice 2 Hilary Duff Wal-Mart Cube (film) RuneScape quests Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Columbine High School massacre Strap-on dildo Topps Upholstery Social rule The Inside Textile manufacturing Wilton House Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog training Harrow School Fischer Random Chess Amazon.com 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ocean's Twelve Winning Streak Laura Schlessinger About a Boy Cruising (maritime) Drill bit The Dalek Invasion of Earth Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Star Wars Holiday Special Kitchen Clothing Hey Jude MapleStory Soap opera The Marriage of Figaro Magic (illusion) USS Vestal (AR-4) Extreme Programming Getting Things Done Vegeta KTVK Small Soldiers The Brady Bunch Bulk vending GED The Amazing Race The Catcher in the Rye Fancy rat Emergency preparedness Neopets RuneScape locations Cleveland Browns Floppy disk Trapped in the Closet EastEnders The Adventures of Pete & Pete Fecal incontinence The Ashlee Simpson Show Empire Burlesque Changeroom Beavis and Butt-head James Hanratty Planet Waves Tofu The Apprentice 3 Internet fraud Kodocha Silent Night, Deadly Night Lionel Corporation $ale of the Century Theory of conduct USS Waters (DD-115) Bong Billy the Kid Chess strategy and tactics Anderson Cooper Shaggy dog story Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Chopsticks Hash table Philip J.
