should i use hot or cold water to wash a shirt with a rather large red wine stain hiya you've gotten some good answers above about water temperature but i thought that i'd add a tip about oxyclean i'm a winemaker by trade and i have had many many clothes stained with red wine oxyclean almost always gets the stains for the worst stains or the largest i'll put the item of clothing in the washing machine with a couple scoops of oxyclean and let it fill then agitate for a few minutes to mix the oxyclean in i then stop the machine and let the clothes sit in the oxyclean y water for a couple hours or overnight the next day i just turn the washing machine back on and let the cycle finish i sometimes have to repeat that process once more but that gets rid of nearly all my wine stains good luck Washing machine Upholstery Japanese tea ceremony Dry cleaning Textile manufacturing Wine Tea Sento Wine making Sauna Western blot Bong Laundry detergent Coffee Laundry Animal Crossing Champagne (beverage) Brewery Dishwashing Dishwasher Tofu Dairy Staining (biology) Casting Carbon dioxide Fossil fuel power plant Gram staining Sterilization (microbiology) Bread Thermal power station Tattoo Plastic Gilding Temperature Glass STS-59 Fire fighting Ironing Red Hot Chili Peppers Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Espresso The Amazing Race Wind turbine Polymerase chain reaction Kosher foods Hydrogen peroxide Shroud of Turin The Human Stain Water purification Good Morning, Vietnam Textile manufacturing terminology Water Swimming Filling station Menstrual cycle Soldering First aid Vinegar Idli Blood Simple Weaving Cocoa Sake Portland cement Eastern Orthodox Church Niddah Jewish cuisine Social aspects of clothing Babe Ruth Campfire Big Brother UK series 6 Mattress Immortality Girls Aloud Electrophysiology Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Topps Solar power Ziehl-Neelsen stain Luck Leo Frank 2000 Australian Grand Prix Japanese funeral Sea-Monkey Madeira wine Water (molecule) The Time Machine Frog Marathon (sport) Billiards Brewing Customs and etiquette of Japan Gaia Online Springfield (The Simpsons) Car washing techniques Dialysis Global warming $ale of the Century Season Menstrual cup
