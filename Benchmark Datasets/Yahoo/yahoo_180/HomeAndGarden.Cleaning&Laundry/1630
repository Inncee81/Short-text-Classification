how you do get dog pee out of the carpet help most doggie and cat stains that seep into a carpet go directly into the pad below if you pour anything on the stain it too goes directly to the pad below which yes in the case of nature's miracle will help eliminate the odor from the carpet but then you have a different worry mold and or mildew from the wet pad underneath that doesn't get quite dry from blotting a towel down on the carpet to bring up the moisture also putting more liquid on a rug that seeps into the pad below also seeps into the floor below that and can destroy maybe a beautiful hard wood floor under all that carpet and padding and if you rent this could be an expensive repair before you move out if you don't think the landlord will check all the rugs pads and underneath don't kid yourself i'd say go ahead and do the spot cleaning with nature's miracle but try to put something under the padding so more liquid won't get onto the hard floor underneath if you can't do that because it's wall to wall carpeting you may be stuck putting down a replacement patch cutting out the spot in the rug and padding and laying down an exact rug match and padding patch in it's place or just call a professional rug cleaning company but once you get it wet if you don't dry it totally right away you do run the risk of mold and or mildew or ruining a big spot on the under floor Upholstery Carpet Fecal incontinence Mattress Wound Casting Plastic Strap-on dildo Hamster Fire fighting Basement Pottery Tag Chair Stairway Urinary incontinence Seismic retrofit Campfire Professional wrestling match types Polyurethane Wheat Wood Boxing Paper Priestly Code Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Hazing Woodworking Cheese Snoop Dogg Psoriasis Tooth enamel Sento Aerial (dance move) Glossary of partner dance terms Textile manufacturing Jute Toilet humour Mark Guglielmo Soldering Bicycle brake systems Japanese toilet Home repair Vacuum cleaner Professional wrestling holds Manual transmission Chatsworth House Naruto jutsu Bacon GunZ The Duel Shoe RuneScape quests Playoff Sauna Glossary of wildland fire terms Genericized trademark Snooker Surveillance Chocolate Ice hockey Roomba Towel Amateur telescope making Baptism Hard disk Violin Fire extinguisher Ayrton Senna Air pollution Comfrey Equine conformation Plaster Royal Rumble Treehouse of Horror V Hemp Mixed martial arts Water Cat Laws of cricket Concrete Electrophysiology Tofu Paint Xanadu House Garden Strawberry Drill bit Flea Elevator Diseases of the honeybee Menstrual cup Miracle Volleyball Tlingit Poker jargon Primer (paint) Syphon Filter Valles Marineris Polyethylene terephthalate Livestock
