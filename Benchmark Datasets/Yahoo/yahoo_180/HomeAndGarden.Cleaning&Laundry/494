making a rope from bedsheets and a pillowcase i need to make a rope from single sized bedsheets and a pillowcase the rope must be strong enough for a person to safely decend from a story window to the ground how many pieces should each bedsheet be torn into in order to make a rope strong enough to hold a lb person that is decending the rope i have no room for trial and error this has to be correct on my first attempt or else the rope will break because it's not strong enough or the rope will be too short to reach the ground this should be easy i'm guessing we're talking bout forty feet max depending on the structure and i think if your lbs that your at least six feet tall or you probably shouldn't be trying so if you raise your hands over your head thats roughly eight feet we'll give you a nice cozy six foot drop to the ground shouldn't be to hard so we deduct fourteen feet from the asking price that leaves us with the need for twenty six feet of rope i'm guessing the sheets are seven feet long all told so divide one in half thats fourteen feet times two is twenty eight feet so we got two feet to spare plus one pillowcase well deduct two feet for knots square knots left over right then right over left add a half hitch on either side of the knot that brings us to our twenty six feet add in the pillowcase at the lowest point on the rope near the ground maybe that adds three feet plus the fact that the window is probabley only half the height of the fourth floor o k we got twenty nine feet plus some leeway to work with so you got bout four to six feet to anchor to something that will hold and double check knots and out you go when you land just in case it's higher than anticipated as usual don't lock your knees and keep your feet and knees together just relax and look at your horizon then roll with the ground away from the structure the five places your body should hit the ground in order will be your feet calf thigh rear and the area of your back just below the shoulder blade make sure your not swinging around or you will be pulling gravel out of your teeth try not to grunt when you hit the ground it'll ruin the whole stunt Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Glossary of climbing terms Professional wrestling aerial techniques Equine conformation Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Mixed martial arts Swingout Archery Horizontal bar Volleyball Fast bowling Suplex Casualty lifting Drill bit Double bass Sailing Anchor Textile manufacturing Glossary of nautical terms Softball Powerbomb Baseball Mattress Knife Table tennis Neckbreaker Boxing Skateboarding trick Diving Badminton Rigging Piledriver (professional wrestling) Horse Breaststroke Rope PRIDE In The Groove (game) Wood Glossary of partner dance terms Professional wrestling match types Textile manufacturing terminology Contredanse Shawn Michaels RuneScape quests Glossary of American football Shaggy dog story The Dalek Invasion of Earth Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Seismic retrofit EastEnders Backstroke Knots Landing Four square Professional wrestling Golf Escapology The Shining (film) Rugby union Harp Hogtie bondage Trapping Sin City Canal lock DDT (professional wrestling) Anatomical terms of location Pump It Up Violin Redundant array of independent disks Syphon Filter Helicopter Dog agility Password Stairway GunZ The Duel Chair Knot Stunt Floppy disk Mars Exploration Rover Tenshinhan View camera Betting (poker) Combine (Half-Life 2) Revolver 1957 World Series Pole vault Sling (weapon)
