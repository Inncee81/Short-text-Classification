tie dye with bleach question could i get a plain white shirt write in a white obviously bleach pen then tie dye over it so i would have a tie dye shirt but white lettering that stands out wont have tie dye colors does this make sense th eest way to write on it first would be to write on the shirt with wax either a candle or melt some wax then use a brush either way the dye would not dye the wax then when finished putthe shirt between brown paper sheets then with hot iron you will be able to remove the wax onto the paper Wax play Batik Technicolor Paper Candle Surrealist techniques Ink Pysanka Paint Photographic film Indigo dye Christmas tree Weaving Dye Ski wax Textile manufacturing Leather Seal (device) Paper towel C-41 process Wax Mimeograph machine Gilding Jade Coir Bleach White bread Pencil Beeswax Rubber stamp Manicure Upholstery Mnemonic Hair coloring Tzitzit Textile Pottery M&M's World Series Skinhead Typewriter Staining (biology) Cosmetics Everton F.C.
