how various pronunciations of pretty before an adjective indicates differnt meanings i read this in a book for instance i'm pretty hungry could be pronounce in two ways hence two different meanings of 'pretty' it was written in american headway a book used in language institutes i think there is some confusion about your question people think you are asking about below i assume you mean the confusion may be because you speak about different pronunciation to most people that means that you use different sounds or accent different syllables but these things do not change no matter how you are using the word what does change is how much you emphasize the word in a sentence pretty can be used as an adjective meaning attractive beautiful as when someone says she's a pretty girl it can also be used as an adverb in combination with an adjective in this case it means fairly moderately to a reasonable degree it does not mean the same thing as very and example would be i'm pretty hungry meaning i am fairly hungry this is not the same as saying i am pretty and hungry in this sentence pretty and hungry would both be adjectives but the example you give is of the adverb not the adjective use and the adverb and adjective are pronounced exactly the same way so perhaps the book is referring to how putting a special emphasis on the adverb when you speak can change the meaning of the sentence slightly normally when you use pretty as an adverb the main emphasis is on the adjective that follows so ifsomeone says it was a pretty good day they are being positive the idea is that they are satisfied with how good it was perhaps even surprised at how it was better than they expected but sometimes a person will strongly emphasize the word pretty saying well it was pretty good day in that case the person is emphasizing that it was only fairly good instead of very good they are suggesting that the day could have been better and maybe they are complaining suggesting that they think it should have been better so this emphasized use of pretty makes what you are saying with the adjective weaker not stronger Lynbrook High School Exercise Ra (board game) Football Leisure Conker Go (board game) Scottish highland dance First-class cricket Football (soccer) Aerobic exercise IBM PC compatible Computer and video game genres Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Surreal number Beatmania IIDX GED Ceroc Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Physical education International Olympic Committee Education in Germany Game Polymorphism (computer science) Game design Backgammon Conway's Game of Life Happy Tree Friends Dominoes Mahjong Marching band ELO rating system Final Fantasy magic $ale of the Century President (game) Closure (computer science) Contract bridge Social rule Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition Phantasy Star Online Puyo Pop Fever W.
