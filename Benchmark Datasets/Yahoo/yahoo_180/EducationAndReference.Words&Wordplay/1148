what does wholesale value mean whats the difference if someone were to sell you something at wholesale value retail value thanks for your time wholesale is how retailers stores buy something retail is how customers buy it for example for one purse the store buys it from the makers of the purse like purses for each they then sell it to the customers for each making a profit the makers also make profit because it may only take them to make each purse so they make on every purse sold to a retailer so if someone sells you something at wholesale value it's usually a very good deal and cheaper than you would get anywhere else even when stores have sales they usually don't go down to the wholesale price because they would make no profit it's sort of like buying food products in bulk a small pack of chicken is a pound but a big pack is a pound but generally a better deal Press Your Luck The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Shit The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Pinky and the Brain Amulet Countdown (game show) Theory of conduct Aphasia Belief Political correctness Autostereogram Big Brother (Australian TV series) Psychology Biblical inerrancy Nicomachean Ethics Singlish Bernard Williams CSS Teaser The Da Vinci Code Magical thinking Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas The End of the World (Doctor Who) General intelligence factor Consciousness Fortuna (luck) EastEnders Social rule Evil Luck Kingdom Hearts Song Numerology Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Spatial disorientation Donald Davidson (philosopher) Jeopardy! in culture Game show Crossword Memory Asperger syndrome Philosophy of perception Phantasms (TNG episode) $ale of the Century Quiz show scandals Meme Homunculus Amblyopia Grace Cossington Smith The A-Team Learning disability Irony Black Quizbowl Adult attention-deficit disorder Opinion poll Indian English Tetration Francis Crick G__del's incompleteness theorem 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Parting of the Ways Cars (film) Cylon (Battlestar Galactica) Stroke Joke Lisa the Simpson Hollywood Squares The nature of God in Western theology Teaser trailer Team America: World Police Human You Don't Know Jack Blindness Borderline personality disorder Motorcycle helmet Witchcraft Hypoglycemia Annuity Handedness Narcissism Simplified Chinese character Goodness and value theory Norse saga Cognitive science Battle Frontier The Far Pavilions Threshold (TV series) The Joker's Wild Traumatic brain injury Pixar Spanish pronouns Jumpstart 3rd Grade Stuttering Brain of Britain Anchor Rose (Doctor Who) Economy of Russia Confidence trick Charles Bukowski
