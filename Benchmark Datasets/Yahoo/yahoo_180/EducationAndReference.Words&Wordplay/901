what does the sentence a near miss really mean does it suggest a lucky hit it does not make sense it was a near miss but it worked out bad in the end it hit bang on target wouldnt a near hit be more appropriate if a disaster was averted by the skin of its teeth i think its kind of a relief phrase like wow glad you avoided that bad situation kind of feeling
