what does 'how do you do' mean what exactly does 'how do you do' mean i know it sounds dumb but i'm so very tired and i can't remember unfortunately all but one of the answers so far are seriously mistaken it is likely that when first used this expression was a literal inquiry about how well someone was doing in that case you could give a full answer or simply respond politely with something like very well thank you for asking but that is not what the expression now means nor has it been for quite a long time now it is simply a polite greeting no longer a question and so you would not likely answer very well or the like the proper response is usually to saw exactly the same thing back that is if someone says how do you do the answer is how do you do also this form is now generally used only as a response to meeting someone for the first time you would not use it when you are greeting a friend of acquaintance it usually works something like this another person is introduced to you by name it may involve a third party introducing the two of you telling each the other's name etc following this each of you in turn says how do you do in other words it is not a question any longer but a polite acknowledgment essentially the equivalent of it's nice an honor etc to meet you what's interesting is that this change from a genuine question to a polite greeting has happened more than once though in all the following examples they can be used anytime you see someone not just when you first meet them consider the greeting howdy or howdy do these are simply simplifications the second more obviously of how do you do and you would never respond to howdy with an explanation of how things are going for you in the northeast nowadays the greeting is how ya doin this too is a greeting not a question to answer the appropriate respond again is to say the same in return how ya doin' there's a hilarious beer commercial involving a texan who comes into a bar and responds to this greeting with a long winded detailing of his travels having no clue what is meant by the expression one problematic example how are you and how are you doing are often used in the way just described but they also are used as literal questions expecting an answer it may at times be difficult to tell which of these someone has in mind which may produce an awkward response it is best if you do intend to question to modify or add to the question in someone to make that clear e g how's your day week going so john how are you doing today Alphabet Indulgence English spelling Abbreviation Latin alphabet Greek language Cedilla Phoneme __ H Diacritic Pinyin Silent letter Hangul Old English language Cyrillic alphabet Tetragrammaton Thorn (letter) W Spelling reform Minuscule Spelling bee Capitalization Writing system of Spanish Circumflex Acute accent Acrostic Persian language Letter case Y German language NATO phonetic alphabet Scrabble (game show) Shavian alphabet Danish language Writing system Thai alphabet French language Tsar Reforms of Russian orthography Cursive Italian language X Umlaut G Russian language International Phonetic Alphabet Caron Alternative political spellings Grave accent Apostrophe (mark) Wylie transliteration R__maji Revised Romanization of Korean Crossword History of the Arabic alphabet Dutch language Slovak language Wolof language Jehovah Afrikaans Finnish language Phonics Leet Latin spelling and pronunciation Indonesian language Swedish language German alphabet English words with uncommon properties Spelling pronunciation Lingo (game show) Fuck Bible code Masoretic Text German spelling reform of 1996 Phonology Voiceless velar plosive Voiced bilabial plosive Dictionary Zapatista Army of National Liberation Oxford English Dictionary Voiced alveolar plosive Jubilee (Christian) Welsh language Heavy metal umlaut Portuguese alphabet Latvian language Scottish Gaelic language Spanish language Lojban Brussels Tibetan script Old Irish language New Zealand English Writing Magick Tetum language Plenary Councils of Baltimore Countdown (game show) Ichthys
