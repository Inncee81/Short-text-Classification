why is the letter y sometimes classed as a vowel this is something ive never quite got my head around when i was at school we got taught that the vowels were a e i o u y but we never actually got the reasoning behind it and i would really like to know why sorry for those who weren't taught this or forgot it but the sometimes y version of the rule is correct just check the definition of vowel in a dictionary and you'll have the basic answer for example a speech sound created by the relatively free passage of breath through the larynx and oral cavity usually forming the most prominent and central sound of a syllable a letter such as a e i o u and sometimes y in the english alphabet that represents a vowel http www thefreedictionary com vowel note those two uses of the word vowel refers first of all to a type of sound one in which there is minimal blockage of the airflow with a consonant on the other hand there is significant blockage sometimes even stopping the airflow completely as with stops b p t d k g the usage of vowel for a letter is secondary based on this first meaning things are simple for a e i o and u because they are always used to indicate vowel sounds but y confuses people because in english it is sometimes used for vowel sounds sometimes for consonant sounds in fact when you start looking at it you discover that it is much more often a vowel making the same sound indicated by i or e does elsewhere if it helps our letter y is originally borrowed from the greek letter upsilon which is a vowel so when is y a vowel when a consonant the basic rule is this y at the beginning of a syllable marks a consonant sound and so may be called a consonant examples yak yellow y elsewhere in a syllable middle or end represents a vowel sound and so is called a vowel examples the many words with a y ending suffix happy funny this all may be easier to see if you put some words side by side with i words in which it represents exactly the same sound cry cries sky skies fly flies rhyme time lay lei soy soil note that i is more often used in the middle of a syllable y at the end consider all the words that change from y to i when adding an ending fly flies happy happier Arab Semitic languages Allah Arabic language United Arab Emirates cricket team Arabic name Malay language Voiceless bilabial plosive United Arab Emirates Hebrew name Hebrew language Arabic grammar Arabic poetry Palestinian exodus Islamic religious leaders Salah Indonesian language Egyptian language Anti-Zionism Arab League Basmala 0 (number) Patronymic Wilayah Copt Arabic numerals Ney Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Swahili language Jihad UN Security Council Resolution 242 Sahrawi Zakat Economy of the United Arab Emirates Tawh__d Tel Aviv Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon Arab League and the Arab-Israeli conflict Writing system Asterisk 3 (number) Alcohol United Arab Republic Hindustani language The Stranger (novel) Letters of the Living Arabic alphabet Betelgeuse Dual (grammatical number) Arab world Javanese language Arab Revolt Arab nationalism Voiced velar fricative Translation of the Qur'an Haram Arabian Peninsula Roots of Religion Palestinian immigration (Israel) Kazakhs Gum arabic Right-wing politics Hashshashin Voiceless dental fricative Sistan and Baluchistan Trigonometric function Israeli Arab Imam Tetragrammaton Syriac language Sharia Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic Cain Classical Arabic Infinitive False cognate Adam and Eve Pita Names of the Levant Makam Mujahideen Nikah Mut'ah Malik Jacob Syrian Arab Airlines Philip the Arab Glottal stop Sunnah Arab music Jizya Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi Mary Poetry Libyan Arab Airlines Dead Sea Arab Air Carriers Organization Egyptian Arabic Palmach Names of God in Judaism Grammatical number
