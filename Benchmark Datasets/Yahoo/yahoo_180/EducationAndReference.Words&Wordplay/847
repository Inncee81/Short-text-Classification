where have all the hyphens gone as i go about my day to day business i notice fewer examples of correct hyphenation is it dying out i still hyphenate to day for example for which illiterates have the temerity to tell me off snnyaura i don't mean to be picky but thanks should be thank you actormyk well said do not these people realise that omitting hyphens can alter meaning an american football game is a game of american football but an american football game could be construed as meaning a game of soccer that just happens to played in america i thinhk as with most usage what starts out as out of the ordinary and hence hyphenated becomes more common and less hyphenated i too have noticed the lack of hyphens in words such as self conscious co ordinate and back to back but then i've also noticed fewer final f's changed to ves when making a plural more split infinitives especially with not no sense of when the subjunctive case is to be used and how or what passive voice is and i've noticed very little concern from people over these faults when i taught college composition i required a rough draft along with the final draft but more and more i noticed that they were identical because people compose at the keyboard i considered changing the requirement to a handwritten rough draft just to re acquaint my students with the feel of a pencil in their hands and don't get me started with the atrocious spelling in questions on this site if you are too busy to write you are and have to save time by writing u r then you're just plain too busy Wonderland (McFly album) Red Hot Chili Peppers Spice Girls TLC Jon Secada The Jazz Singer The Isley Brothers Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ramones Ichigo 100% Elvis and Me Max Martin The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Decibel Atomic Kitten The Parting of the Ways Hey Jude Bleed American (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction R.
