can you write a good story using these phrases just for fun not h w suddenly the lights went out don't tempt me twice if that's the truth what exactly happened here next time if there is a next time i'll i hope that's not what i think it is one day in new york if that's the truth then we're going to have no choice but to sell our shares timmy i muttered into the cell phone normally i'd never bring my phone out in the subway car but my day was going to hell in a handbasket so i was beyond caring what the other commuters thought of my breach of etiquette the snob in front of me had already made deep huffing noises twice and the hobo behind me was eyeing the phone like a future investment well i don't care timmy call our broker get it taken care of i hung up and glared at the snob as if i could force all the wretchedness i felt on her i could almost envision her drab blouse catching fire and suddenly the lights went out as i was positive my day could not get worse that's exactly what it did one minute i'm casting smouldering glances at this witch in front of me and the next i'm blind in the dark a collective groan rose from the subway car i dropped the cell phone back in my pocket and hoisted my umbrella defensively i hope that's not what i think it is a haughty female voice said from in front of me oh dream on i hissed as i shifted the umbrella again to keep from poking her to truly top matters i noticed that the subway car had come to a complete stop as power apparently had shorted in the rails as well great now i would be late for work on top of everything else hey buddy a gravelly voice whispered behind me that wassa nice phone you had there fella like you prolly has some spare change too give it a rest huh corky i said i mean these people would panhandle in the middle of nuclear fallout i felt the hobo's hand paw at the back of my shirt andi half turned poking the snob with my umbrella again by accident watch it jerk she growled you're gonna run that thing through my skull if you keep it up don't tempt me twice lousy witch why don't you move forward in the car a ways and give me some breathing room eh i was starting to shake as agitation surrounded me on all sides well next time if there is a next time i'm gonna stick your umbrella and your cell phone in your poop chute smoke on that you smarta c'mon pal just a buck or two ya gotta have at least that both of you stifle it i screamed why the hell did i ever pick this city you bunch of morons could drive the pope crazy a chorus of commentary reached me from all over the subway car shaddap close it then move away jerkoff yadda yadda yadda the hobo's hand closed over my wrist this time and i snapped the true new yorker in me came to the fore and i started swing my umbrella and yelling at the top of my lungs in the dark i have no idea who i hit or even the things i said i just kept screaming and swinging swinging and screaming more hands grabbed me and i grew all the more frenzied and that's all i remember two hours later the power came back on the subway car started moving and the lights popped back on inside at the fifth street station the doors opened and a police officer came in to check on the wellbeing of the formerly trapped passengers officer gentry who retired one week later will never forget what he discovered inside of car number on that day the visions will haunt him for what remains of his life and the media can only speculate as to what vision greeted him he will not talk about it so don't ask him and me what exactly happened here they all asked me what went on in there for two hours but i'm not talking haven't said a word since that day in fact it's been four years of silence and i don't think i'd have it any other way i have diarrhea of the story sorry
