cd burning i'm trying to either burn my play disc for unreal tournament or download the play disc onto my computer so i dont have to keep putting the cd or leaving it in my computer can someone help me with this thanks dze is correct it may not be easy to find but there may be a 'patch' or 'fix' in which the game will initialize without the cd in the drive some games do not put all information on your hard drive even with a full install if the game has cut scenes for instance that is only stored on cd then it will crash without it another way around is to use a back up copy the copy protection may 'see' that it's a copy and will not install the game but may still play off the copy use the original for installation then try playing off the copy otherwise a decent programmer can probably find the line of code to check the cd and remove modify it Copy protection Computer virus Windows XP Modchip Steam (content delivery) ITunes Digital rights management Patch (computing) Compact disc Unreal Tournament PlayStation 2 DVD Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Windows 2000 Commodore 64 ZX Spectrum System 7 (Macintosh) CPU cache Floppy disk MDAC Resident Evil (video game) MAME Virtual memory Blue screen of death Pretty Good Privacy Apple II family PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Linux Mach kernel Apollo Guidance Computer PlayStation 3 Computer Disk image Rootkit Quantum computer Pointer Video game crash of 1983 Mod (computer gaming) Half-Life 2 IBM PC compatible Debugging Redundant array of independent disks Hot Coffee mod OpenBSD LiveCD Brainfuck Visual Basic Hard disk The Sims 2 Poker jargon Unreal Tournament 2004 Malware Booting Copyleft Xbox Snooker Software bug Starsiege: Tribes Copyright infringement of software IPod Cheating in Counter-Strike Emacs Nintendo 64 Final Fantasy VI Forth programming language Betting (poker) Warez MiniDisc Spyware Knoppix Doom WAD USB flash drive History of Microsoft Windows Fischer Random Chess Covermount Video game music Game programming Software cracking Microsoft Windows Sega Dreamcast Manifold Game programmer Atari 8-bit family World of Warcraft Cache Need for Speed StarCraft Game development STS-61 Texas hold 'em Quake III Arena MSN Messenger Open-source software Censorship in Australia Tribes 2 Nintendo Revolution In The Groove (game) Minesweeper (computer game) Windows Vista
