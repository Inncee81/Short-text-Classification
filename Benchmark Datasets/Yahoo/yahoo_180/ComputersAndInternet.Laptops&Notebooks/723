what is wrong with my laptop battery ac input loose i have a compaq presario v it is about years old my ac adapter stoped working or so i thought because it was a generic one and i had to wiggle it around for it to work i bought a new generic one the last one worked fine i only had the original for months until my cat ate it i plugged it in the light went on and i thought i was good i look at it min later and the light isnt on and i can't get it to come back on when i press the start button the charging light will flicker about times and then nothing i took out the battery to see if it would turn on just plugged in and no battery nope i didnt even get a light i am not sure what is wrong with it and i really dont want to throw down a lot of money to figure it out what do you think it is the battery charger i haven't used it in like a month or because it hasn't worked just got the charger and it didnt work maybe i got a faulty charger on ebay ok so you had to wiggle it in the jack to get it to work most likely the ac plug is shattered inside the laptop this is a very common issue with laptops ideally the plug should fit into the jack securely and not have any wiggle room the only way to fix it is to bring it to a repair shop and have them solder a new ac plug to the motherboard this is not a guaranteed fix and the problem will eventually resurface the ac plug is very fragile all it takes is one bump to break it that is most likely what happened expect to spend upwards of us to get it repaired Laptop Universal Serial Bus IBM PC compatible Toyota Prius Game Boy Advance SP Poker jargon Battery (electricity) Windows XP PowerBook Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Oscilloscope Capacitor plague Strap-on dildo Second Battle of the Atlantic Personal computer Pittsburgh Steelers IBM PC Canon T90 Tire Jack plug Mouse (computing) Ford Ranger EV Debugging John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Telephone exchange Hubble Space Telescope MOS Technology San Diego Chargers Cyrix Enigma machine Atari 8-bit family Bob and George Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Battery electric vehicle Roomba Piccolo Junior Saga Cruising (maritime) Characters of Lost Computer bus Electric boat Dodge Charger Atari ST Embedded system Knife The Shining (film) ATI Technologies Welding Switch Lithium ion battery USS Vestal (AR-4) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sin City Shaggy dog story New York Giants Apple Newton Microeconomics Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Year 2000 problem Wheel of Fortune Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory GED Short selling Characters in the Smurfs Pump It Up IBook Game Boy EastEnders 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines PlayStation Portable Solar power Reading spark plugs for racing Bicycle lighting Xbox Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Nickel metal hydride Sumo Mercury Atlas 6 Light-emitting diode AmigaOS Cincinnati Bengals Carburetor Bond Advanced Technology Attachment Nickel-cadmium battery Enron Corporation Hiberno-English GunZ The Duel USS S-35 (SS-140) Bad Wolf Neon Genesis Evangelion glossary AMD Wi-Fi USB flash drive Professional wrestling throws Semiconductor device The Smoking Room Hearing aid
