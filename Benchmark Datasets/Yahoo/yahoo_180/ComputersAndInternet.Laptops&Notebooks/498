my hp notebook starts up very strange frustrating read on i have a new hp notebook computer running windows vista home premium here is exatly what it does shows the hp bios screen seconds shows the vista start up screen seconds shows the log in screen i enter password everything is going fine untill i log in between the log in and the showing of the desktop the screen stays black with the mouse for about minutes then finally it continues and the desktop pops up very quickly while it's black the hard drive activity indicator light on the notebook is off no hd activity the mouse moves but the screen stays black for about minutes what would cause this note yesterday while it was in that frozen mode i got a real quick message saying rundll has stopped working but after all the trouble everything works okay what would cause this by the way this computer is about month old and i did try the system recovery origonal factory state and it still happens everything here sounds normal actually for most of this process there are windows controls that have their own agenda not a problem it's not unusual to see an error like the rundll has stopped working you'll usually see it during your shutdown routine if you got that error message and it was real quick as you say rather than the one you know where you have to click end now that's fine it's as if the system is looking around for orphans and widows and stragglers and if it finds them it sends them home when it doesn't find a home it freezes up most of the time a complete shut down and cold boot will take care of this if you see the error often and maybe even if you don't you might want the run a registry checker to clear up loose ends also if you've been used to watching windowsxp load on a system with the same processor vista will seem to have issues in more ways than one it's just different that's all anyway if it makes you feel better nothing you've said indicates you have any cause for concern Windows XP Windows 2000 Mouse (computing) IBM PC compatible Booting Blue screen of death History of Microsoft Windows Apple Macintosh Embedded system Windows Vista Personal computer Microsoft Windows AmigaOS History of the graphical user interface IMac Computer virus System/36 Hard disk Laptop Screenshot X Window System System/34 Floppy disk Atari ST Mach kernel Password Partition (computing) Commodore 64 Apple Computer RISC Domain Name System Computer forensics Doom 3 Prank flash Gmail Desktop computer Windows 3.x Opera (web browser) Apple IIGS E-mail spam RuneScape cheats Minesweeper (computer game) Architecture of Windows 2000 Debugging Power-On Self Test Common Unix Printing System Surveillance ZX Spectrum Master Control Program 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Linux Microsoft Steam (content delivery) Btrieve Windows 95 Windows Server 2003 GunZ The Duel MDAC Virtual memory Diablo II: Lord of Destruction USB flash drive Atari 8-bit family Redundant array of independent disks CPU design Windows Me Toyota Prius OpenBSD Computer ThinkPad OpenGL MS-DOS Hello world program Federal Standard 1037C BIOS Ecco the Dolphin Computer multitasking NeXT Knoppix Spyware X86 assembly language Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Stardock Windows registry PDP-11 Crash (computing) Modem Vostok 1 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Mercury Atlas 6 Control-Alt-Delete Public-key cryptography Oscilloscope OS/2 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis
