apple and pc question what i have now is the basic pc i am thinking about getting an apple next laptop and heard that the new apples have windows programs is that true do you find it to work well will you be able to change it to the newest upgrades as needed computer newbie here please not very technical if possible thank you i have a dell and an apple and my girlfriend has an apple that uses the intel chip she has separated her laptop into a mac portion and a windows portion so it's very cool but if you're not very computer literate you probably don't want to do that here are the pros and cons pros of apple i believe they are faster and once you get used to how they work you will probably find them easier to use there are no viruses to screw them up unless you install windows on them there are lots of cool programs like dashboard and garage band that are not yet available for pcs cons of apples there are some programs that you will need pc technology to use for example some videos that your friends may send you by email especially wmv formats will require a program not readily available on apples there are also other programs and formats that do not have an exact conversion you will be able to open and read word on text edit programs on an apple but if you try to edit the document it will not appear the way you want back on a pc there may be better conversion programs in the future but they will also probably be costly some other commercial and free programs have an apple equivalent but they may not work as well for example skype or other programs there is also the issue of itunes the itunes program on an apple is different than on a pc and you need to format your ipod for one or the other you cannot go back and forth Mac OS X Apple Macintosh IPod Apple Computer IBM PC compatible ITunes Apple II family ITunes Music Store QuickTime Microsoft Windows Mac OS X v10.4 Laptop Podcasting Digital rights management Apple Intel transition MP3 X Window System Unicode Windows Vista WordPerfect RISC Microprocessor 64-bit Personal computer Microsoft PowerPC Computer Mouse (computing) Pretty Good Privacy Floppy disk Computer virus Visual Basic History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Office Linux USB flash drive Vorbis Skype ATI Technologies Bluetooth Timeline of computing 1990-forward Commodore 64 Portable Document Format AppleScript IBook High-definition television Atari 8-bit family TRS-80 Radeon HyperCard History of computing hardware (1960s-present) FireWire Operating system History of the graphical user interface Digital audio workstation Hard disk Macromedia Flash OpenGL OpenDocument Digital audio player AmigaOS OS/2 File format Amiga NeXT Universal Serial Bus Voice over IP E-mail Steve Jobs Spyware CPU cache PowerBook Linux kernel BASIC programming language Apple IIGS PostScript Online music store Apple typography CPU design Microsoft Word IBM PC Apple Newton Wintel Common Unix Printing System Computer workstation Trusted computing Common criticisms of Microsoft Mac OS CP/M Ajax (programming) Lisp programming language
