what should i do or not do the couple of times i've tried to play a dvd movie on my lap top it skips jerks the lap top is a inspiron i've had it since december it could possibly be because of the following reasons there is something wrong with your dvd drive your processor is slow you do not have enough ram you do not have a good enough graphics card how to fix you could buy a new dvd drive made specificly for laptops i would suggest if you're not tech savvy to get someone to install it for you if you have a processor that is slower than ghz then i would just suggest to buy a new computer but if you have a processor greater than ghz then your processor is not the problem if you have less than mb ram in your computer i would suggest upgrading or if you have any programs running in the background to exit out of them to make sure that the media player that your using will be able to have enough ram to run i'm not sure how bad a graphics card has to be to not be able to run a dvd but since you bought it not too long ago it should be able to have a good enough graphics card to run it IBM PC compatible Windows XP Apple Macintosh Personal computer The Sims 2 Mac mini PowerBook Nintendo Revolution IBook Atari ST Windows Vista PlayStation 3 Pentium 4 History of Microsoft Windows IBM PC PlayStation 2 EMac Hard disk Cell (microprocessor) Xbox Overclocking Mac OS X MAME Computer and video games Knoppix Sinclair ZX81 TRS-80 Color Computer Atari 8-bit family Desktop computer Commodore 64 Supercomputer Commodore 128 IPod Apple IIGS AMD ZX Spectrum USB flash drive TRS-80 Apple II family PowerBook G4 Microsoft Windows CPU design ATI Technologies Linux CPU cache Graphics processing unit High-definition television Central processing unit X86 Power Mac G5 64-bit RISC Cyrix TurboGrafx 16 DVD BBC Micro Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Screenshot Windows 3.x Sega Dreamcast Virtual memory IA-32 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Game programming Doom 3 Celeron Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows 2000 In The Groove (game) Acorn Electron Timeline of computing Computer bus AmigaOS Mach kernel Computer virus OS/2 Original Amiga chipset The Sims 2: University Nintendo GameCube PaX Apple Newton Moore's law Jet engine Nintendo 64 PC motherboard History of operating systems System/34 MIM-23 Hawk Pentium M
