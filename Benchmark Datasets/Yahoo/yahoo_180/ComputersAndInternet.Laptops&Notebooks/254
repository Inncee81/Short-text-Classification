ps to usb adapter for a wireless mouse not working i purchased a ps to usb adapter for my wireless mouse to use on my ibm thinkpad because i needed the one usb port on my laptop for a printer that i just purchased the system says the device is installed but there is no connection through the adpater is it a bad adapter or do i have to configure the settings usb and ps are vastly different connections early on some mouse manufacturers built their mice to be able to detect whether they were connected to ps or usb and the adapter was just a mechanical adapter that converted the usb plug on the mouse to fit a ps port then the logic in the mouse would figure out what it was connected to and operate accordingly lately though to save cost mouse and keyboard manufacturers have been eliminating the ps logic and shipping usb only mice even though the plug fits into your adapter your mouse does not speak ps flip it over and look at the label if it speaks ps the label will probably state usb and ps compatible or some such as to the device appearing in the device manager the built in devices in laptops are almost always ps so they will also show up in the device manager as such n Laptop Desktop computer IMac Apple Macintosh Mouse (computing) Personal computer RS-232 IPod Atari ST Hard disk Floppy disk Musical Instrument Digital Interface Secure Digital card Computer bus PlayStation 2 Common Unix Printing System Computer PlayStation 3 ThinkPad Windows XP AirPort IBM PC compatible IBook Commodore International Xbox 360 Xbox FireWire IBM PC Commodore 64 Game Boy Atari 8-bit family History of Microsoft Windows SCSI PowerPC Nintendo Revolution Embedded system Computer hardware Wi-Fi Television Sound card Architecture of Windows 2000 Serial port Apple Desktop Bus Mac mini Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Adapter IBM Device driver X Window System Microsoft Windows CPU design Modem AmigaOS CompactFlash Port (computing) PC card Btrieve Serial ATA Digital Equipment Corporation MicroATX AlphaSmart Booting Linux PCI Express Power Macintosh G3 ZX Spectrum Mac OS X ReactOS Flash memory Game controller Digital circuit Game Boy Advance IBM Personal System/2 Hot swap OS/2 Hotspot (wifi) TRS-80 Color Computer Sega Dreamcast System/34 Security token BIOS FreeDOS Enigma machine IEEE 1284 System/36 Ethernet
