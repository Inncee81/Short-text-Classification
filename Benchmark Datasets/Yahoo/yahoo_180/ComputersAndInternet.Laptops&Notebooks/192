what makes windows vista shut itself down and is there a solution i bought a new laptop months ago and have not loaded anything onto it except avg virus control but it shuts itself down very frequently especially when i am working with pictures i have been unable to contact the laptop maker or the store where i bought it but do plan to talk with the store people as soon as possible it is so frustrating to have this thing shutting down so often sometimes as often as times in an hour since i do internet selling i need to be able to work with pictures working with pictures everytime like photoshop editing if it didnt come with decent graphics the computer may be overheating to keep up with the photo editing process and shutting itself down as a failsafe if its a custom built machine from a sole trader business march in there and butt heads with them especially if you told them you needed it for photo manipulation viruses are always the last suspect on my list granted i have little data worms on my machine from time to time but its been over years since i last encountered a malicious virus and ive never heard of one doing what you are describing Windows XP Computer virus Microsoft Windows IBM PC compatible Hard disk Apple Macintosh E-mail spam IPod Computer Computer forensics Rootkit Laptop Windows Vista Spyware Commodore International Anti-virus software PNG Floppy disk Windows 2000 Common criticisms of Microsoft Microsoft Enterprise content management USB flash drive Blue screen of death Surveillance Pornography Melissa worm X Window System Timeline of hacker history History of Microsoft Windows Operating system Virus Atari 8-bit family Personal computer Domain Name System SAS System Stopping e-mail abuse MAME Machinima RISC Buffer overflow Atari ST Apple Computer Extreme Programming Steam (content delivery) Digital photography Java programming language Computer worm Outlook Express Spam (electronic) PowerPC Digital image editing Mac OS X Goatse.cx Amiga File system PLATO 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines IMac AmigaOS CDC 6600 Something Awful Computer security Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans OS/2 Radeon PC Engine PowerBook Sun Microsystems The Inside Apollo 8 Copy protection TRS-80 XML ATI Technologies Warez Trojan horse (computing) Computer bus Library (computer science) Booting Hewlett-Packard Software bug Dairy Burroughs B5000 Emacs HyperCard Timeline of computing 1990-forward LiveJournal 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Wal-Mart Master Control Program AOL Instant Messenger Commodore 64 HAL 9000 Fritz-chip Windows registry IBM The Star Wars Holiday Special Syphon Filter
