i need help concerning laptop memory they say that a comp needs at least gb of memory but is it still efficent as a gb does having a gb means that'll go faster or is it unncessary until you get a program that needs at least gb for memory also if the computers memory can only hold gb does that mean that under any circumstances you cannot expand it is it better to just get a pc that will hold mb but is expandable to mb or get a mb that doesnt expand or so the website says sorry if these questions are rather juvenile but i overheard a best buy worker say getting a mb comp is good even though the minimum for vista is mb but i wasn't aware that you could expand it and all tha jazz thanks last i heard the minimum for vista basic is mb gb is what our vista comp has and it's well enough for simple stuff all my parents use on their comp is internet office and email and digital photos and printer my ubuntu linux laptop has mb ram and it's plenty good for browsing the internet email youtube iming and music and my xp desktop had mb which ran pretty good but i upgraded to gb and it didn't boost performance a whole lot just it exits from memory intensive programs a lot faster IBM PC compatible Apple Macintosh Laptop Windows XP Computer Microprocessor Windows Vista Mac OS X Personal computer Radeon Atari ST Microsoft Windows PowerPC Thread (computer science) Linux Embedded system ZX Spectrum Bluetooth Timeline of computing 1990-forward Linux kernel Mach kernel Microsoft Atari 8-bit family Desktop computer History of Microsoft Windows TRS-80 USB flash drive Apple II family INMOS Transputer PowerBook Random access memory CPU design Hewlett-Packard PaX Mac OS Flash memory System/36 64-bit Sun Microsystems IA-32 IBM PC Emacs Java programming language Ubuntu Linux TRS-80 Color Computer Commodore 64 Google Forth programming language Computer hardware Windows 2000 AmigaOS Commodore 128 Apollo Guidance Computer ATI Technologies Opera (web browser) Data General Nova Supercomputer Acorn Electron Computer forensics Common Unix Printing System Pretty Good Privacy Macintosh Finder Pentium 4 Novell NetWare Read-only memory Digital audio player Central processing unit Microsoft Office Wi-Fi Overclocking Motorola 68000 Acorn Archimedes NeXT Modem Digital photography Windows Server 2003 Universal Serial Bus Portable Document Format WordStar OpenDocument Upper Memory Area Perl Fortran TOPS-20 Assembly language Emulator Computer science Computer bus Television X Window System Sampling (music) Web design
