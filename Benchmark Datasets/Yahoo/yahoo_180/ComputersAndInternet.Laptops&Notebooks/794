my cd dvd drive on my ibm on my x does not work i recently reinstalled from clean windows on this ibm everything works but my cd dvd drive i can install programs via the cd drive but when i drive any music cds or anything else it does not work or read when i goto my computer the cd drive does not even register i have a matshita dvd rom sr i understand that i don't need to have a driver for the cd drive to work what is wrong this computer has two parts the actual laptop and then the media slice docking station with the floppy drive and cd drive who can help me please i haven't heard of anything quite like that before did it only work when you were installing windows perhaps the bios detects the drive by windows doesn't for some reason it's very rare to have a cd dvd that needs drivers i would check your device manager and see if windows thinks there is something wrong with your drive you mentioned that your music cds don't work perhaps cds are working but dvds aren't i have see this happen on two computers but it was the other way around i would recommend seeing if there are any firmware updates i'm not sure what else to try Windows XP BIOS Floppy disk Apple Macintosh Booting USB flash drive File Allocation Table Hard disk Linux Knoppix Copy protection IBM PC compatible Read-only memory IBM PC AmigaOS DVD DOS Laptop IPod Commodore 128 64-bit Microsoft Windows Compact disc Blue screen of death Embedded system Windows 2000 CD-ROM Computer hardware Windows Vista OS/2 Flash memory SUSE Linux Atari ST BASIC programming language Debugging Rootkit Surveillance MAME Mac OS X History of Microsoft Windows FreeDOS Digital rights management IA-64 Virtual memory Desktop computer Extensible Firmware Interface Blu-ray Disc History of operating systems Computer forensics Digital audio player Warez Apple II family Windows 3.x Commodore International Commodore 64 Modchip PlayStation Portable X Window System Microprogram Power-On Self Test ATI Technologies Binary prefix PowerBook Power Macintosh G3 LiveCD CPU cache Computer bus IBM Windows registry Drive letter assignment Bluetooth Windows Me Perl Apple Intel transition CP/M DVD-RAM PDP-11 Microsoft Fritz-chip Universal Serial Bus NeXT Wardriving NTFS Theory of conduct Apple IIGS Easter egg (virtual) Device driver Upper Memory Area Xerox Star IMac Microprocessor PowerPC
