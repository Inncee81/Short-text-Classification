i have a yellow dog my old ibook is runnig yellowdog but the program is not seeing the wireless card can anyone sugest a better lenux than yellowdog hugs pennyann depending on how old your ibook is this makes no sense in getting linux for the ibook if your system is at least a ghz g w mb ram bought in the last two years apple's macos x is a posix unix operating system linux is itself another posix minix based operating system in fact if you have learned how to use the apple macos unix terminal on your ibook the commands in any linux terminal are excatly the same in several cases with only minor tweaking macos can actually run several of the freeware apps originally created on linux if you have a desktop pc ie dell ibm gateway hp that is where i would install linux if you are a first time linux user then i would look to ubuntu linux with the gnome desktop fiesty fawn ubuntu linux is not the most advanced linux out there but it is nearly as easy to use as both windowsxp and macosx and is very stable and idiot resistant even its installation from dvd is graphical and friendly as i said i would not overwrite your macos x install on your ibook this would be like replacing a mustang from one dealership with mustang from another dealership just because being from a different dealership makes the car different ubuntu linux and macos x are both unix linux distro operating systems i would look at any desktop that you have around you and run ubuntu linux on that system the official website for ubuntu linux is www ubuntu com ubuntu is distributed by canonical inc when at the ubuntu website select download and the most popular version of their linux is the one running the gnome desktop this is usually the first distro available for download and the one with the most support this is also the distro that dell is currently factory installing with their systems the os is free for download but you will need to use an iso dvd disc image expander the one i used personally was my ibook's macos x disk utilities this app comes as a part of os x on your ibook to find this app on your ibook go to spotlight in the top right corner on the os x file bar and click on the magnifying glass icon then type disk utility the top hit on the appearing list should be the app disk utility click on this launching disk utility while making sure that you have a compatible dvd r or cd r disc in your ibook's dvd drive select the saved ubuntu linux disc iso image on your systems hard drive as the image you want burned to disc this process will take several minutes after the disc is burned find an x desktop pc or x intel based imac and you can run the installation of ubuntu linux on either of those machines the powerpc g based ibook cannot run ubuntu linux right now although there are some linux's on the net designed for powerpc macs most are fairly complicated to run and install and many lack basic productivity apps the process i just explained is how to download and burn the ubuntu linux installation cd dvd using your ibook Personal computer Timeline of computing 1990-forward PowerBook Apple II family X Window System FreeBSD Commodore 64 System 7 (Macintosh) 64-bit Bluetooth Computer virus Macintosh Finder Windows Vista Atari ST Mandriva Linux Microprocessor OpenOffice.org History of Microsoft Windows SUSE Linux Laptop Berkeley Software Distribution BASIC programming language Common Unix Printing System Embedded system DOS GNU File system Supercomputer MAME Mach kernel Unix-like OS/2 Xbox PlayStation 3 Amiga Macromedia Flash Hard disk OpenBSD Computer workstation File Allocation Table Redundant array of independent disks Sun Microsystems Java programming language Partition (computing) Plan 9 (operating system) Disk image Screenshot Apple IIGS Mac OS history Power Macintosh G3 WordPerfect Yellow Dog Linux Desktop computer Timeline of computing Emacs Windows 3.x PlayStation 2 Mac mini AIX operating system Mac OS 8 History of computing hardware (1960s-present) GIMP Mac OS X v10.4 Object Desktop ITunes Nintendo Revolution Wget Modchip
