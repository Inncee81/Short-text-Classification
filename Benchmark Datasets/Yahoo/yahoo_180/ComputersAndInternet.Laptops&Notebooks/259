wondering if this is possible i am looking for a way to connect my current laptop up to multiple monitors the problem is that the one video out plug vga on my video card is already used is it possible to use my old laptop as an extra monitor i would like to extend my desktop onto the old laptop and then have that laptop's primary monitor be a tv thanks i really hope this is possible and not just a pipe dream p s the new laptop runs vista and the old one runs xp as an engineer i don't consider any technological hurdles impossible however what you're talking about is impractical or cost prohibitive depending on your income time and skill level they make pcmcia adapters or special vga splitters that handle this to name two i found but is not the only two http www digitaltigers com sidecar shtml http peripherals about com od drawingtabletspens gr vtbook htm looking at their prices you can see this is not cheap since multiple monitors was never meant to be a portable solution it would just make more sense to purchase a desktop with multi monitor support at that point as far as modifying an existing notebook monitor as a secondary display that's very impractical to do it would involve some hardware modification in your notebook that's beyond basic soldering skills some notebooks support multi display your notebook display one additional display depending on manufacturer this may or may not be possible most new notebooks support this and it's a matter of looking in the manual to see how to enable it it might be default Laptop IBM PC compatible Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Computer Universal Serial Bus ATI Technologies Windows XP Bluetooth Apple Macintosh Hard disk Atari ST Commodore 64 PowerBook Computer bus Wi-Fi Radeon IMac History of Microsoft Windows Copy protection Windows Vista Mac OS X TRS-80 Color Computer Apple II family Television IPod Nintendo GameCube Sega Dreamcast Redundant array of independent disks Mouse (computing) AmigaOS IBook 3dfx Atari 8-bit family Musical Instrument Digital Interface Windows 2000 Liquid crystal display Consensus decision-making OpenGL IBM PC Computer display standard DVD Graphics card Xbox Amiga CPU design PlayStation 3 Computer and video games Sega Saturn C plus plus Wireless LAN PlayStation 2 Mach kernel ThinkPad PCI Express TurboGrafx 16 Carburetor Amstrad CPC Computer display Pentium M Ajax (programming) Texas Instruments TI-99/4A TRS-80 Digital photography Java programming language Spyware X Window System Internet In The Groove (game) Computer forensics Commodore International MDAC PC card Serial ATA Burroughs B5000 Ethernet Sun Microsystems Oscilloscope Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Blackjack History of computer and video games Apple Computer CompactFlash Solar cell Slot machine Celeron Lotus Notes Multimedia Card
