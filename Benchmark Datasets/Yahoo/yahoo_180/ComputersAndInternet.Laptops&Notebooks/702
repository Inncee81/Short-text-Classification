why doesnt my macbook pro play dvds it says wrong region settings idk what that is but it just says it cant play it if you haven't set your macbook pro for the correct region it won't play any dvds this is from teh mac website many dvds use a region code a number that corresponds to a geographic area in order to play a dvd from australia for example the code on the dvd has to match the code on the device playing the dvd the first time you play a dvd with a region code your dvd drive is set to match that code this restricts dvd player to playing only discs with the same region code or with no region code generally the region code of your dvd drive matches the region code of the dvds available in the region where you live important you can change the region code of your dvd drive only five times this includes the original setting the fifth setting of the region code is permanent when you insert a disc with a different region code a dialog allows you to choose a new region code setting for your dvd drive don't change the region code of your dvd drive unless you expect to play only dvds that match the new region code in the future DVD Regional lockout Modchip High-definition television Knoppix ZIP Code H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Copy protection AmigaOS Telephone numbering plan Blu-ray Disc Disk image DVD region code CD-ROM UK telephone numbering plan DVD Copy Control Association Slot machine MAME QuickTime Hamming code Online DVD rental Postcode Video codec Internet Group Management Protocol MAC address ITunes John McEnroe North American Numbering Plan Fischer Random Chess Laserdisc Laws of cricket Expert system Easter egg (virtual) Error correction and detection Rugby league Football (soccer) Floppy disk Mach kernel Anamorphic widescreen PlayStation 2 CPU cache International cricket in 2005 C plus plus Test cricket Redundant array of independent disks MP3 Back to the Future trilogy Golf Yu-Gi-Oh!
