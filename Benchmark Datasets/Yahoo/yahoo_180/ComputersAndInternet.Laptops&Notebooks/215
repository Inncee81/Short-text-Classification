can i expand my ram on a dell inspiron my laptop already has a mb ddr sdram mhz dimm and another empty slot can i add a mb ddr mhz sodimm ram also can i add a gb ram if i have a mb ram currently installed would it be better to just to buy same mb rams at mhz you can do either however the total ram will only act as fast as the slowest component so mhz dont get unless you are going to replace the altogether the inspiron should support what is called dual channel memory meaning that if you have identical ram cards they will perform much better than any other configuration you can add the gb and then have mb ram but again it will only act as slow as mhz and you will not have dual channel functionality also if the other computer parts like the processor dont have a bus speed faster than mhz there is little to no point in taking the ram up any higher than this however if the processeor has a mhz bus it may be worth looking at there is no guarantee that sodimm will work on your machine however we already know that regualar dimm will check with dell my suggestions buy a nd identical card mb dimm for gb dual channel memory or buy new gb check the processor dimm for dual channel gb memory also before deciding on the gb option make sure with dell that your system will recognise cards that are gb in size alternatively try x mb cards DDR SDRAM PowerPC Radeon Dynamic random access memory PlayStation 2 IBM PC DDR2 SDRAM Power Macintosh G3 Atari 8-bit family Pentium 4 Apple II family Opteron Central processing unit PC Engine Computer bus Rambus Apple Macintosh IBook CPU cache Overclocking Xeon Athlon VIA Technologies PowerBook IBM Personal System/2 Dell Axim CPU design ATI Technologies Risc PC Windows XP Front side bus Sound Blaster System/36 Windows 2000 GeForce 6 Series Universal Serial Bus Nintendo GameCube Sharp Zaurus Apple IIGS Atari ST RISC PlayStation 3 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Celeron Data General Nova 64-bit IPAQ Oscilloscope MIPS architecture Acorn Electron Xbox 360 Redundant array of independent disks EMac USB flash drive Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Power Mac G4 System/34 Texas Instruments TI-99/4A CDC 6600 Athlon 64 Acorn Computers INMOS Transputer Cray-1 Super Nintendo Entertainment System 3dfx Sega Saturn Sequent Computer Systems NVIDIA Commodore International Commodore 64 Northbridge (computing) Motorola 68000 Mac OS X MOS Technology 6502 BBC Micro SGI Octane Ethernet HyperTransport AMD Xserve Hard disk Neo-Geo Microprocessor Dance Dance Revolution AmigaOS Radeon X Series Microprogram
