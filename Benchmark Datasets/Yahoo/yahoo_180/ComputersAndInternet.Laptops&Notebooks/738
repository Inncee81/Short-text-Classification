which new mac ok so i have the mac ibook but i am starting law school and really need the new one with intel i was thinking about getting the macbook pro but is it really worth the more than the regular macbook also the it guy at school said i should wait until the os comes out he thinks october does anyone know anything about it i couldn't find anything on apple's web site will it be the new macbook or will they still have those and this be totally different thanks i would say that you should wait till october to get any new mac's if not you will be stuck with tiger and not be able to upgrade to leapord leapord is made for a bit processor while tiger is bit what this means is that you will not be able to get leapord on your mac if you get it now apple will not mention about it on their website because if they do so no one will buy a mac during this time and they definitely dont want to show a sales chart of sales also i appologise for my lack of knowledge but do law students have to do a lot of computer work i mean people buy macbook pro because they are usually into graphics some kind of design work or into film editing this is basically the main use of a mac and if you do none of these no high end computer stuff other than using word excel and those softwares buying a mac book pro is of no real use sure it is fast but you will not be tapping into the power of a mac pro but its your choice good luck and wait for leapord Mac OS X Apple Computer Microsoft Office Mac OS X v10.4 Mac OS IBook IMac NeXT History of Microsoft Windows IBM PC compatible Apple typography Microsoft Windows CPU design Timeline of computing 1990-forward CPU cache Mouse (computing) Central processing unit Windows Vista Operating system Power Macintosh G3 RISC 64-bit Computer virus HyperCard System 7 (Macintosh) Radeon Laptop MacWrite PowerPC Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Apple II family Microprocessor AppleScript Apple Intel transition IPod MP3 Ashton-Tate Power Macintosh Atari ST Mac OS history MAME Computer Mac OS X Server QuickTime Sun Microsystems TRS-80 Sound Blaster Java programming language Personal computer Mach kernel Emacs Computer workstation Steve Jobs Motorola 68000 Mac OS 9 Windows 2000 Apple Newton Mac OS X v10.0 Timeline of computing Commodore 64 Computer and video games WordPerfect Microsoft Word Ethernet OpenOffice.org Stardock Wintel Graphical user interface Burroughs B5000 Power Mac G5 X Window System H.264/MPEG-4 AVC ITunes Music Store Embedded system Copland Digital audio workstation Xcode History of the graphical user interface Pentium 4 History of computing hardware (1960s-present) FullWrite Professional Thread (computer science) Opera (web browser) Mac OS X v10.1 Apple Open Collaboration Environment Pretty Good Privacy
