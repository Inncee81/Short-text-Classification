i want to transfer about gb of itunes music to my laptop from my old one i have purchased and non purchased music on there how do i get it straight to my itunes on my new laptop i am going to buy a usb cord to connect between the comps and i am running vista on both i want to do this for windows media player also i also want to do this for some other files but i think i can figure that out thanks in advance just drag and drop the files from their file location in lap a to their corresponding and otherwise identical location in lap b windows media should detect automatically that there are new files there if it is already told to monitor the folder if not go to wmp options and select the library tab monitoring options for folders is there for itunes do roughly the same but also be sure to authorise lap b to play your protected music no experience doing a direct usb transfer but vista will definitely support it if thats the way you wanna go ITunes Windows Vista Windows XP Floppy disk Mouse (computing) Universal Serial Bus Apple Macintosh ITunes Music Store Macintosh Finder Bluetooth Mac OS X Digital audio player IMac History of Microsoft Windows Windows 2000 USB flash drive Laptop Object Desktop SonicStage USB mass storage device class ILife Digital rights management FairPlay History of the graphical user interface PlayStation Portable Secure Digital card Macromedia Flash Online music store Windows Media Player Btrieve File system Windows Explorer Mozilla Firefox IBM PC compatible NTFS Xbox 360 Stardock Windows Me Closed-circuit television Screenshot Apple typography Hard disk System 6 Apple Computer AirPort Timeline of computing 1990-forward QuickTime XMPlay Microsoft Windows Mozilla Thunderbird System 7 (Macintosh) Common Unix Printing System File Allocation Table Enterprise content management System/36 Comparison of media players HTTP cookie Mac OS X v10.4 Konqueror Windows Media Audio Walkman Computer virus Windows API Virtual memory Windows Server 2003 Rhythmbox Knoppix Jon Lech Johansen Web browser Vorbis ZIP (file format) Cheating in Counter-Strike Creative Zen Blue screen of death Blackjack Creative Nomad Redundant array of independent disks Master Control Program Digital photography WordPerfect Architecture of Windows 2000 Advanced Audio Coding AlphaSmart MapleStory Steam (content delivery) Television Resource fork Rootkit Memory Stick DVD AmigaOS Marching band Google Desktop PlayStation 3 Skype Linux PowerBook
