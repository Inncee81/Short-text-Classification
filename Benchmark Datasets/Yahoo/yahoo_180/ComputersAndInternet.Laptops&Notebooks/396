what is the differ in amd turion x and intel pentium dual core processor first off it would not be fair to generalize the amd turin x v s intel pentium dual core processor as far as performance the turin x start from the lowly tl goes up to the pretty decent tl i presume we are talking of mobile or laptop processors not desktop processors turin x is a bit processor intel pentium dual core processor is a bit processor most installations by far are bit so that should not be an issue the intel pentium dual core processors occupy the lower rungs just a notch above the celeron m so best would be you provide some processor numbers to get exact comparisons edit st answer was a lethal knockout punch nd answer was rant too but then he was still reeling from the knockout punch from first answer lol rd answer ' bit allendale processors' are the e e which are desktop not mobile processors th answer bit chiplets that was lethal too th answer was rant too oops that was me lol i am still reeling and rambling http www circuitcity com ssm laptop computers sem rpsm catoid n link ref rpem ccd categorylist do here you will find the first deal much better than the targetted second superior processor and gb ram at a lower price AMD Laptop Celeron Athlon AMD64 Pentium 64-bit CPU cache Pentium D Xeon CPU design Pentium II Windows XP Athlon 64 IA-32 Central processing unit Apple Intel transition X86 History of Microsoft Windows IBM PC compatible NX bit RISC Dual-core X86 assembly language Cyrix NVIDIA Transmeta Computer workstation ATI Technologies Intel Sun Microsystems Apple Macintosh PC motherboard Conroe Wintel Pentium Pro Opteron PowerPC PR rating Timeline of computing 1990-forward Mac OS X AMD K6-2 Microsoft Windows Symmetric multiprocessing MIPS architecture Radeon Windows Vista Intel P8 Sempron VIA Technologies VIA C3 Windows 2000 ThinkPad Northbridge (computing) NForce4 Centrino HyperTransport Google Clock rate AMD K6-III IBook Personal computer Computer Branch predictor Linux kernel Mandriva Linux IBM PC Windows Server 2003 AltiVec Intel XScale Athlon 64 X2 Front side bus Duron Simultaneous multithreading Intel i960 Word (computer science) Hyper-threading Overclocking Mac OS Digital Equipment Corporation AMD 5x86 PowerPC G4 Apple Computer Embedded system Intel i860 Cell (microprocessor) IA-64 PDP-11 IPAQ AMD K5 68k
