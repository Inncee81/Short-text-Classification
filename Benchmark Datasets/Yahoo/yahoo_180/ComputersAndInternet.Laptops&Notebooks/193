a macbook pro or a macbook i like the looks of macbook pro but it's to munch money and might be to munch for what i need so should i just get a macbook typing this from a macbook pro i'd say its well worth the money the macbook pro is a lot faster in having a faster processor at ghz my computer is lightspeed and i have well over songs and garbage on it i got the newer macbook with the core duo intel and gb of memory and its a lot better performance wise than the older models because all my friends have them with the macbook pro you also get the better videocard if your into things like videogames watching movies on your comp etc it really all depends what you're into but in my opinion the macbook pro is worth the money Athlon PowerPC Pentium M Xeon ATI Technologies Celeron Apple Macintosh Central processing unit RISC 64-bit Opteron Symmetric multiprocessing CPU cache Northbridge (computing) AMD Microprocessor Pentium Pro IMac Mac OS X PC motherboard Radeon VIA C3 PowerBook GeForce 6 Series CPU design Pentium III Memory Stick Mac OS Zilog Z80 MIPS architecture Radeon X Series PowerPC G4 Computer Thread (computer science) Cyrix Personal computer Pentium D Athlon 64 Clock rate Cell (microprocessor) Drag racing IBM PC compatible Computer and video games IA-32 Dual-core Windows XP ARM architecture Apple Computer ThinkPad IBM PC Linux kernel Pentium II NX bit AMD64 Moore's law Front side bus C programming language Java programming language PlayStation 2 PR rating PlayStation 3 Overclocking Intel i960 3dfx Burroughs B5000 Energy development Power Macintosh G3 Intel iAPX 432 Virtual memory PlayStation Portable Windows 2000 Embedded system Timeline of computing 1990-forward MOS Technology 6502 The Sims 2: Nightlife PDP-11 Pentium GeForce 4 History of Microsoft Windows Supercomputer Sound Blaster Stream processing X86 assembly language IA-64 Power Mac G5 Out-of-order execution DEC Alpha PC Engine Xserve GeForce 2 Field-programmable gate array FireWire NVIDIA Microprogram CDC 6600 Speed of light X86 Itanium 2 EMac
