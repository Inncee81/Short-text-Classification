an artist called ritter my parents have given me an old oil painting on wood that they had in their attic it is of a young serving girl in wooden clogs holding a jug and looks very old similar to a th century dutch artist the signature looks like ritter or ritte but i cannot find anyone by that name has anyone heard of this name hi i've been looking and i think this is bigger than both of us ha i've found caspar ritter http www askart com askart artist aspx artist eduard ritter http www askart com askart artist aspx artist louis ritter http www artres com c htm csearchz aspx o total fp e sijmypw p x sid jmgejntbam gc pic sube untwa h ja wilhelm georges ritter laszlo ritter just for starters and at least more in reference books but nothing with ritte and we are still assuming it is in fact ritter rather than something else so what i would suggest if none of these knocks you off your chair is to take some good photos of it one of the signature the reverse etc and contact one of the major auction houses sotheby's christies bonham's etc or a fine arts appraiser from one of the reputable organizations appraisers association of america etc and ask for advice the fact that it is on panel would lead one to believe it may be of some value i would love to help you more but as this is lacking a first name i could not presume to guess which of these artists it could possibly be darn wish that i could i wish you so much good luck Auction World Wide Web Baseball L.
