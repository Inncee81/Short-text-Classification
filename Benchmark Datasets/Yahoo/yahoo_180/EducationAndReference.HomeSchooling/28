how do you deal with science i actually had some pretty strong opinions about home schooling but reading some of the questions and answers here have made me feel somewhat less hostile to home schooling but i cannot shake one of the few experiences i have had with a woman who was home schooled she actually tried to convince me that mudras hand positions in yoga can stop a heart attack now whether she was fed this nonsense as religious dogma or she came to believe it as an adult this woman was either never taught proper science never taught critical thinking or never taught either how to you both assure that your children are getting a proper science education i've seen a number of people say that their children are self taught in this department and make sure your children can think critically i'm home educated i don't do anything like chemistry or physics they're not needed for the uni course i'm going to do but my brother was able to do both subjects successfully right up to the hsc year using what he could find at home or easily get from the pharmacy local store etc i have done various critical thinking courses since i was years old though there's no reason why home educated kids should feel deprived of the opportunity to learn how to think critically for themselves ps i was told by a cardiologist a while ago that coughing can help if you reckon you're having a heart attack so while the idea of yoga might not be the whole answer if it relaxes you and therefore your heart muscles i guess it may help the flow of blood to the heart muscle thus reducing the amount of pain and possibly limiting the potential damage hannah Religion Abortion debate Asthma Myocardial infarction Education in the United States Meditation Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Education Medicine Education in Hong Kong Francis Crick Atkins Nutritional Approach Urinary incontinence Orgasm Tai Chi Chuan Homeschooling Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Breastfeeding GED Drowning Past teachings of Prem Rawat Education in the People's Republic of China Consciousness Atherosclerosis Jewish philosophy Philosophy of education Human Falsifiability Milton H.
