hi i have a project about the home education i want c ur opinions as soon as possible me i prefer the schools but it seems that marie curie didn't so i will b happy c ur oppinions and what do u think about the advantages disadvantages of the home school education for where i live and the society i'm in i definitely prefer homeschooling if we had half day one room schoolhouses where the children were with a mix of ages and could work at their own pace i might choose that over homeschooling but that doesn't exist anywhere around here advantages of home education students can work at their own pace they're never behind the class and feeling bad or ahead of the class and getting an ego or feeling bored parents can include subjects and content they feel important that the schools may not work on students usually have time to work on things they find interesting kids have more time to be kids since they don't need to take as much time in class to get their work done plus other things that fill up their school day kids usually have better role models at home than in school having same age peers as the primary social models doesn't exactly help kids mature well kids are in a training ground for adulthood not perpetual childhood less chance of suffering under things like bullying being outcast for not wearing the right clothes less chance of being focused on all the material things in our schools here nintendo ds's psp's ipods cell phones even at the elementary level and more less chance of growing up in an environment in which there are negative attitudes towards learning and doing well where sex is encouraged at a young age where others are partying on weekends doing drugs and alcohol i recently heard a story from a mom who decided she had to pull her child out of the only nearby school they're in a rural area the gr elementary girls were prostituting themselves often making deals on the school bus rides if parents make social outlets an important aspect the kids usually interact with a variety of ages get used to meeting strangers etc there's so much more of course all potential advantages depend a lot on how parents go about homeschooling it's like being a parent it's not enough to simply have the kids how you parent them makes a difference disadvantages people who are ignorant about homeschooling and make nasty or stupid remarks people who are actually prejudiced to the point that they'll have a great time hanging out regularly with a homeschooler but as soon as they find out the homeschooler is homeschooled then they shun the homeschooler because s he is a social retard happened to a girl i know public school advantages great for parents who are not willing or not able to homeschool their children great for ultra social kids might outweigh home education's advantages if there is something you really want for your child's education and there's no way for you to provide it through homeschooling for example immersion or bilingual language programs public school disadvantages many are the flip side of the home education advantages i wrote above other things kids don't have to ask permission to go to the bathroom they can get help fairly quickly instead of having to wait through other held up hands assuming their parents are relatively good they won't undergo some of the abuses that occur under teachers some are mildly verbally abusive and not enough to really be caught or canned others are more abusive and administration for whatever reason doesn't explore it further i know a young woman who had the same teacher for a subject two years in a row the teacher spent a lot of time telling the students how stupid they were and that they were the stupidest bunch he'd ever taught another girl i know had a teacher throw a book at her undoubtedly other things what it all really boils down to is which one is the right fit homeschooling isn't for everybody public school isn't for everybody private schools aren't for everybody parents need to find what's right for their family Theory of conduct Hikikomori Second language acquisition GED Beavis and Butt-head Education in the People's Republic of China Infantilism Waldorf Education EastEnders Boston Public Extreme Programming Education A.
