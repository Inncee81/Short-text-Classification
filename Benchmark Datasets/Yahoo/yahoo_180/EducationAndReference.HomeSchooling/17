is there a way to be self homeschooled is there some sort of way of being self homeschooled ive heard of kids in private schools taking something called paces where the read book then do the work in another and get graded for it and it can be done in any subject but is it possible for this to be done for a person who went to public school i live in florida i dunno if location would make a difference but i just need to know if there is any way for a high school student to be homeschooled who doesnt have a parent who doesnt work to teach them and who cant afford a tutor thankyou the paces you have heard about are in the a c e curriculum i have worked with former a c e students in the private school where i taught for years i found that they were generally behind the average private school student you must be a real self motivator and they really don't prepare you for college as well as some other home school curriculum i would recommend that you see if there is a home school group in your area often they have cooperatives of parents and teachers who provide extension courses there may be someone there who can assist you in your educational endeavors ps if you are really interested in a quality education email me and i will tell you about a boarding school option that is great and affordable Homeschooling Education in the United States GED High school Graduate school Waldorf Education Education in Portugal Education in Australia Education in the People's Republic of China Independent school (UK) No Child Left Behind Act Education in Hong Kong Education in Germany Teacher Education in Malaysia Education in Japan College Education in England Private school Charter school School choice Education in Romania Secondary education in Japan Education in Taiwan Intelligent design movement Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology A-level Standardized testing Experiential education Middle school Education in Scotland Education in Singapore Public education Juris Doctor Advanced Placement Program SAT Medical school Student loan Secondary education in the United States Education in South Korea Grade (education) Caulfield Grammar School PLATO Public high school General Certificate of Secondary Education Physician Kitzmiller v.
