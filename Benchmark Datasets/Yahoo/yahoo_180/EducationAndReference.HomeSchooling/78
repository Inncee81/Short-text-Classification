what do you think about high school home school well i have been home schooled ever since my parents got divorsed wich was in th grade now i am going to high school my mom says i have the choice of being home schooled or going to public school everyone says i should go but my family says i should stay home school so i can focus on school work and get good grades to get into college and so i was just wondering what other peoples opions are yes this is a personal question but i was just wondering it will depend a lot on the schools in your area if you have top quality schools with programs that you'd really like to get into and you're comfortable with the idea of going back to school it might be worth a shot if it's either a toss up either way or the schools near you are lower than what you could do at home i would definitely stay at home there are so many self driven curricula out there for all levels of science math lit history worldview foreign languages etc that you really shouldn't have a problem with that there are several curricula that are well supplemented by dvd lessons cdroms and online resources that you should be able to find whatever you need as a homeschooler you can also have access to a number of co op classes taught by degreed teachers so you can take the classes you need personal instruction with in co op and work on the rest at your own pace you may also be eligible for concurrent enrollment at a community college near you to take upper level classes and get college credit at the same time my advice to you whatever you do base it on the academics a lot of people will tell you to go for the socialization factor but that's not a good reason for choosing your educational track i have a feeling you don't live in a cave so you can have a social life either way choose it based on what you really want to do what you feel is best for you rather than on your social life good luck Homeschooling Education in the United States Education Education in Romania No Child Left Behind Act Education in Taiwan Graduate school GED Education in Hong Kong Secondary education in Japan Education in Singapore Education in Portugal Grade (education) Education in Malaysia Intelligent design movement Secondary education in France Education in France Community college SAT IB Diploma Programme Education in South Korea Charter school Secondary education in the United States Education in Australia College Experiential education Education in Austria Medical school Master's degree High school Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Hunter College High School Franklin W.
