i wonder by kellie pickler does this song remind you af anybody it reminds me kind of me and my mothers relationship i was just wondering who does it remind you of and what part of the song reminds you of them pretty much the whole song seems to be how my life is going so far sometimes i think about you wonder if you re out there somewhere thinkin' 'bout me and would you even recognize the woman that your little girl has grown up to be cause i look in the mirror and all i see are your brown eyes lookin' back at me they re the only thing you ever gave to me at all this song is one of my favs bc it tells my story im and well my mother wasnt in my life during childhood so i grew up to quick she doesnt know who's age im supposed to be i mean she missed all my birthdays from the best part is about all i see are your brown eyes etc R.
