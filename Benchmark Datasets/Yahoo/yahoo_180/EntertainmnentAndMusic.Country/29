country song ok i don't know who wrote it but the lyrics go something like this i miss the good old days sittin on the porch drinkin ice cold cherry coke and everything was black and white oo ooo oooo thanks very much tam i love country music and heard that song n the radio once thanks for helping people rascal flatts mayberry written by arlos smith sometimes it feels like this world is spinning faster than it did in the old days so naturally we have more natural disasters from the strain of a fast pace sunday was a day of rest now it's one more day for progress and we can't slow down 'cause more is best it's all an endless process well i miss mayberry sitting on the porch drinking ice cold cherry coke where everything is black and white picking on a six string where people pass by and you call them by their first name watching the clouds roll by bye bye sometimes i can hear this old earth shouting through the trees as the wind blows that's when i climb up here on this mountain to look through god's window now i can't fly but i got two feet that get me high up here above the noise and city streets my worries disappear well i miss mayberry sitting on the porch drinking ice cold cherry coke where everything is black and white picking on a six string where people pass by and you call them by their first name watching the clouds roll by bye bye sometimes i dream i'm driving down an old dirt road not even listed on a map i pass a dad and son carrying a fishing pole but i always wake up every time i try to turn back well i miss mayberry sitting on the porch drinking ice cold cherry coke where everything is black and white picking on a six string where people pass by and you call them by their first name watching the clouds roll by bye bye bye bye i miss mayberry i miss mayberry The Amber Spyglass Aerial (dance move) The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Paul Is Dead B-47 Stratojet Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drag racing The Dukes of Hazzard Jo Dee Messina Indianapolis 500 Philadelphia Eagles Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lightning The Beatles bootlegs Textile manufacturing Cloud One Piece minor characters The Time Machine Polygon Records New York Giants Mercury 4 American Idol Season Four songs Surveillance Paragliding Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February The Beach Boys Frankie Laine Cliff Richard The Shining (film) Deluge (mythology) USS Trigger (SS-237) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Jon Secada Dizzee Rascal Moon The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Country music A Day in the Life Weather lore Quarashi Miss Saigon Into the West (miniseries) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind STS-59 Time Out of Mind Recumbent bicycle Gliding Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ozone depletion Year of the Spider Jackass: The Movie Equine conformation Blues 2000 Australian Grand Prix Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Skateboarding trick Cleveland Browns Climate of the United Kingdom Mary Poppins I Want to Hold Your Hand Mercury Atlas 6 Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Mary Wells U2 (band) Hey Jude House music Sly & the Family Stone Sampling (music) Noah National Football League Lore Industrial Revolution Water (molecule) Highway 61 Revisited Naruto jutsu Vanilla Ozone hole Glider The Beatles Ice 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Pittsburgh Steelers Apollo 8 Fast bowling The Wildhearts Double bass Fog Nation of Islam Prince (artist) Wind turbine Appalachian Mountain Club Solar system
