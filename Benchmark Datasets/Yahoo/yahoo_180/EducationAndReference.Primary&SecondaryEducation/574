homeschoolage is it right to homeschool a child if you think you can be good enough to teach them all the material you need to know the trouble with that thinking is you will eventually get to a point where you won't be able to teach a child everything he needs to know think about it most teachers teach only one two classes since they have multiple sections of the same class they know a ton about the subject that they are teaching you get stuck teaching your child like subjects so if you want to make sure your child is getting a good education you have to make lesson plans also it's hard for a parent to be knowledged in all of the middle school and high school math science english history and foreign language information that his child needs to know this is true even if the parent is exceptionally bright so the quality of the child's education will suffer if you home school especially in the higher levels it's better just to let your child have multiple teachers you might be able to pull off doing home school on the elementary level particularly with the math and english areas but it will hurt your child in the end if you continue to home school him her but even in the elementary school level the kid might miss out on socialization skills if you home school him her there might be a few exceptions like perhaps if your child is getting beaten up in school or if the school district is failing miserably but generally you shoudln't home school a child Education in the United States Education in South Korea Education in Taiwan Education Waldorf Education Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Danish Folkeskole Education Education in Romania Education in Singapore SAT Education in Hong Kong Primary education Education in India GED Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Multilingual Grade (education) Secondary education in Japan Education in Austria Glen Ridge, New Jersey Gymnasium (Denmark) Boston Public Education in England IB Diploma Programme High school Montessori method College Intelligent design movement Magnet school Literacy Dyslexia Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Experiential education Gifted A.
