school supply list for my school i am going to be a freshman at lewis palmer high school in monument colorado and i need the supply list their website it www lewispalmer org thanks i actually just graduated from lewis palmer i found it helpful to have a subject notebook and assign each section to a different class it usually worked out perfectly since not all classes needed a section it's also best not to buy a whole bunch of stuff before the first day of school as your teachers usually have specific lists for their individual classes i suggest waiting until that first weekend after school starts when you'll have a better idea of what you'll need and you won't be stuck with a bunch of extra stuff that's just my advice your link leaders are always a good resource too GED Yearbook Community emergency response team World Wide Web Supply and demand Student Economics Education in the United States Carson Palmer Education in Japan Grade (education) Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Teachers (film) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Homeschooling Domain Name System Education Pennsylvania State University The Citadel (Military College) Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Teacher United States Army Texas A&M University Washington State University Microeconomics Boy Scouts of America PHP Expert system The Amazing Race Plame affair Extreme Programming Uniform Resource Locator Reggie Jackson Franklin W.
