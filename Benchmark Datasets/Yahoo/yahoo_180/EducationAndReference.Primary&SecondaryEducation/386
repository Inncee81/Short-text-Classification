im going to th grade im kind of nervous about my first year at high school and my older siblings just tease me about it all day long is it going to be scary but the thing is i missed orientation everyone is nervous on there first day of high school its just like when you started at middle school you just have to relax and talk to some people when you first get there and pretty soon you will start to feel at ease it is a lot different than middle but not in a bad way for me when i went to high school i found it to be a lot more mature in a lot of ways than middle school ever was i was pretty nervous on my first day but because it was a nice community and all the faculty and staff were nice it helped me to feel better also if a lot of your friends will be there with then you will have a much better time there is really nothing to worry about in a couple of weeks you will be so used to how things are going that you won't notice anymore it will only be scary if you let be that way and don't take any crap from your only siblings a lot of the things that you hear people talking about high school is mostly not true i would recommend taking an extra curricular activity so that you can make lots of friends and have fun doing something that you enjoy for me it was band my friends and i built so many memories that i consider the last four years of life in high to be the best don't worry about what people say and if they are just trying to scare you just remember high school is only as scary as you let it be good luck and i'm sure that you will build a lot of happy memories with your friends as well Social rule Pitaten Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show Cliff Richard Philosophical skepticism Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind The Fairly OddParents Blood on the Tracks Year of the Spider Kodocha Elijah Wood Craps Mid-levels 2000 Australian Grand Prix About a Boy Rich Mullins Sigmund Freud The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Care Bears EastEnders Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Norway national football team Humphrey Bogart Baby Blues The Emancipation of Mimi The Lovely Bones Real Love (song) Okashina Okashi Arianne Child sexuality Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Shit RuneScape quests Kender Sampling (music) Great Teacher Onizuka Singlish Phoebe Buffay's songs Milton H.
