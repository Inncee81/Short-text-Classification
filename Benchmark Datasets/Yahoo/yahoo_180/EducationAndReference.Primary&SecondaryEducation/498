high school nerves im a little scared about going to orientation and the first day of course im going to talk to ppl i dont know on the bus when i get on im just worried about not having anyone to walk into the school with any tips first don't fear orientation this is your time to learn about your school and figure out your schedule don't be afraid to ask questions no one is going to laugh at you for it chances are other kids have the same questions well if you will be talking to people on the bus ride in you can certainly walk into school with them you can even try to meet people at orientation then i would say join a club or sport team this will make your year so much more enjoyable and will greatly help you to meet new people and make friends everyone's first day is a bit awkward everyone is just as nervous as you are so never think you're going to be the only freshman walking in alone or lost in the hallways best of luck Social rule Shaggy dog story Milton H.
