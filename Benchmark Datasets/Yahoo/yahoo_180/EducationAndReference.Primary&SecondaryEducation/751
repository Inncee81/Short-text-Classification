high school chem and physics i was wondering if anyone out there took chem and physics honors before and if it was really tough my family is pushing me to do this but idk if i can because in freshman year i got a b in bio and bio is supposed to be easy so im not sure i can handle both chem and physics which are supposed to be really hard thanks i'm sure you can handle honors physics and chemistry getting a b in bio isn't a bad thing i did worse when i had it freshman year personally i thought bio was the hardest of the three i took all of them in high school as long as you have good teachers you'll be fine if you're still hestitant maybe you could take for instance chemistry your sophmore year then take physics your junior so you won't be overwhelmed by two science classes your sophmore year i assume you'll be a sophmore good luck Student IBM PC compatible Clements High School Knife Secondary education in the United States Education in the United States Debugging Stuyvesant High School Piccolo Junior Saga Floppy disk The Citadel (Military College) Luck University of Connecticut W.
