why are they so hyped up my daughter can't wait to go to school and get supplies but after she's there for a long time she wishes it was summer why are kids always so hyped up to go back to school haha i'm like that aswell she's excited to see all of her friends that she hasn't seen over the summer or possibly the boys she's had crushes on she might even be excited to find out what teacher s she'll get or who will be in her class es it's also exciting to see how everyone's changed new hairstyles grown no braces no glasses anymore etc this soon changes after the first week as you get into the whole routine again it gets old seeing the same faces each day the same teachers and textbooks then summer comes again Kodocha The Fairly OddParents Cliff Richard Shaggy dog story Boston Public Teacher's Pet (Disney) Quarashi Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide The Lovely Bones The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Montreal Screwjob 2005 Ashes series The Adventures of Pete & Pete Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Vegeta FoxTrot Code: Lyoko Textbook The Bash Street Kids Bart chalkboard gags One Tree Hill (TV series) Baby Blues Social rule Kenny McCormick Recurring South Park characters Alan Arnett McLeod Skinhead Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Teacher Avenue Q Britpop Hulk Hogan Hey Arnold!
