why don't people take school seriously i was reading another question where someone was doing a debate against why kids shouldn't have homework some of the answers were so bizarre like one lady felt that her kids should automatically pass with c's because they go to class everyday her kids don't do their homework on time or at all so they're all failing another person said that only a bad teacher would need to assign homework how come you hear about kids in other countries who walk for miles and miles to go to school and actually have some respect for their teachers should we just make education optional in america and let people figure things out are kids just narcissistic and distracted with gadgets why do parents always blame teachers if i remember correctly from my high school it was the kids who were stubborn little assholes why has school become a hour holding cell for kids to just text and socialize they're just wasting time for those that actually want to learn so optional or mandatory absolutely mandatory if i have to suffer you've got to suffer too damnit besides even if they don't learn much at least they've learned the basics so that they can be somewhat productive in society seriously though a lot of kids in the us nowadays truly don't like school because they take everything they get for granted they either don't know or don't care that other kids across the world in third world countries find it a luxury to even have running water it's complete bs but that's just human nature we're selfish and we're self serving as far as the parents go parents always want to think that their children are little angels and can do no wrong of course that's just crap but as parents they feel they're obligated to help their children succeed and if that means that they've got to annoy the living daylights out of a teacher to get their children a passing grade then so be it plus the fact of the matter is that our educational expectations have taken a steep plummet and this is why asian countries like taiwan china japan etc are inching closer and closer to becoming true rivals of the us asian parents typically push their children much more than the average caucasian parents i should know since i'm taiwan asian living in cali ever heard of asian failing it's just a little joke but it's typically true amongst the asian population whereas most other races consider an f to be failing we usually consider a c to be failing but since the asian population is only large around the west and east coasts of the us and comprise only a small percentage of the entire population of this country it doesn't seem like the us is doing so hot actually most kids can do well in school but because of peer pressure and a yearning for popularity most kids forsake good grades for their public image studies have shown that the desire of a teenager to excel in school is surpassed by the desire to look cool in front of his her friends when isolated though kids typically do well and or better than what they usually do if they were in a class full of people in fact most kids aren't really stupid or dumb they're just afraid to really try hard lest they be made fun of for being a geek or a nerd which is total bs to me but that's just how it is Education in the United States Social rule Education Pitaten Asperger syndrome Saved by the Bell Grade (education) Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Shaggy dog story GED Boston Public Singlish Codename: Kids Next Door Philosophical skepticism Kindergarten Graduate school The Fairly OddParents Goodness and value theory Homeschooling Education in Taiwan The Adventures of Pete & Pete Japanese tea ceremony No Child Left Behind Act Economic inequality Columbine High School massacre The Marshall Mathers LP Theodicy Abortion debate Calvin and Hobbes Teachers (film) Martial art Friends Confucianism Nerd Gifted Milton H.
