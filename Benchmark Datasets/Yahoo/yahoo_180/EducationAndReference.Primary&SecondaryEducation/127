enroll more students than any other segment of private schools admissions public schools admit all children by law public schools must educate all children including students with special needs to enroll in a public school you simply register your child by filling out the necessary paperwork private schools are selective they are not obligated to accept every child and in many private schools admission is very competitive governance public schools must follow all federal state and local laws in educating children such laws usually include specifics about funding program development and curriculum private schools are not subject to as many state and federal regulations as public schools since private schools are funded independently they are not subject to the limitations of state education budgets and have more freedom in designing curriculum and instruction curriculum public schools offer a general program designed for all children which usually includes math english reading writing science history and physical education in addition to these key subjects many public schools offer programs in music and art in a public school the substance of what children learn is mandated by the state and learning is measured through state standardized tests note the charter school movement is picking up momentum in many states these schools are public but many offer specialized programs and smaller classes private schools have the flexibility to create a specialized program for students for example private schools may use art or science in all classes or take children on extended outdoor trips that blend lessons across the curriculum private schools can create their own curriculum and assessment systems although many also choose to use standardized tests teachers public schools all teachers in a public school are usually state certified or at a minimum working toward certification certification ensures that a teacher has gone through the training required by the state which includes student teaching and coursework private schools teachers in private schools may not be required to have certification and instead often have subject area expertise and an undergraduate or graduate degree in the subject they teach students public schools the children at most public schools usually reflect the community students may be split up based on ability or interests but in many public schools there is a diversity of student backgrounds note in many states if you are not satisfied with your assigned school you may be able to send your child to another public school in the area start here to learn more information about these options private schools the student population at a private school is determined through a selection process all students must apply and be accepted in order to attend although students may be from different neighborhoods they will probably have similar goals and interests this tends to create a fairly homogenous student body special needs public schools due to special education laws public schools must educate all children and provide the necessary programs to meet their special needs this means that most public schools have special education programs and teachers who are trained to work with students who have particular needs private schools private schools do not have to accept children with special needs and many choose not to although there are a small number of private schools specifically designed for special needs children as a result most private schools do not have special education programs or teachers trained to work with students with severe special needs private schools will try to help all the students they admit but extra resources may also come at an additional cost class size public schools many states recognize the value of small classes and have provided funding to keep class sizes small in grades k as students become older class size tends to get bigger in public schools especially in large school districts and urban schools private schools private schools are generally committed to providing small classes and individual attention to students many parents choose private schools for this reason the bottom line there are a few fundamental differences between public and private schools but here's the bottom line there are great private schools and there are great public schools the trick is finding the school that best fits your child's needs you may also want to consider public charter schools or homeschooling it's a good idea to research the schools
