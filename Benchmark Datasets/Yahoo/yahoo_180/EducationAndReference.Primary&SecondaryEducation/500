i'm a freshman should i bring a backpack the first day of hs i dont think we're getting a supply list except what the teacher's give out the first week b c i never got one and they dont have one at any of the office stores should i bring a backpack and is a messenger bag ok for the th grade or will it break the first day is basically the chill day or the get acquainted day you just find out where your classes are and then listen to the teachers talk for an hour it's common to be given a syllabus you might need to take some notes about the class or fill out some cards about yourself you don't get much stuff on the first day so i recommend taking a small backpack or just taking a binder with some paper and maybe a folder a messenger bag is a great alternative too they don't work wonders for me though because they feel too big and heavy you could possibly get a medium sized tote i find them quite useful and they come in handy they aren't as bulky as a backpack and aren't as small as a purse don't worry about carrying school supplies or books on the first day it'll be over before you know it have fun meet some new people get on the teacher's good side lol and enjoy yourself RuneScape quests Social rule Ocean's Twelve Backpacking (wilderness) Cruising (maritime) Columbine High School massacre Backpack Fecal incontinence Japanese tea ceremony The Amazing Race Graduate school Shaggy dog story Great Teacher Onizuka The Catcher in the Rye Frogman Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Laptop Extreme Programming Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Education in the United States Kodocha Ammunition Equine conformation The Sims 2: University Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina 21 July 2005 London bombings Floppy disk Secondary education in France Illegal drug trade Windows XP Philmont Scout Ranch Hogwarts Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Teachers (film) AFI 100 Years series Education in Romania Breastfeeding Lynbrook High School Education in the People's Republic of China Hash table Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Surveillance Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Grade (education) Mattress Rush Limbaugh Francis Crick The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie USB flash drive The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Philosophical skepticism Ben Johnson (athlete) Backpacker murders Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Richard Feynman Teacher Sheepshead Russian joke Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Emergency preparedness Scuba set Mercury Atlas 6 Getting Things Done Hiberno-English Community emergency response team Jennifer Lopez Avenue Q Secondary education in the United States Trail Sleeping bag United States Postal Service W.
