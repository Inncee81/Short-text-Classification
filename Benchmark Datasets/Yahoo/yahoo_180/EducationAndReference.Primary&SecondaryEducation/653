high school diploma ok to start off i didn't graduate high school but i was able to walk on the stage and recieve only a certificate i had a gpa i took classes throughout my whole years of high school because i went to an art school i had extra classes that were my majors i passed all of my profiency but not my math math is my weakest subject i have tooked it over times but i don't want to use as an excuse i had a difficult time in my life and i had no motive my mother had to go through operation and my dad was a complete let down one day my dad cross the line and told me i'm not good at anything and i should just die so i ran away moved in with my sis little did i know her fiance was a complete pervert i hate to say it coz it hurts but he molested me from there i ran away again at the moment i am just working i was able to find a gd job w o diploma coz of my charisma so its been years and i really want to go to college is it too late to take the proficiency iam not sure if i get what you are asking because i never went to hs but i can recommend getting a ged the ged itself is bs and most retarded hamsters could pass it but you need one to get into a junior college or a regular college without a hs diploma and don't listen to people that say it can't be done it's done every day i personally got into a small second tier year school with just my ged i wrote a good essay did a good interview and jumped through some hoops but even if that doesn't work out for you you can trudge through a community juco do two years there and transfer up to a bachelors granting school to finish your undergrad most small lib arts school struggle with enrollment if you are bit older you instantly win some points they worry about young people they won't graduate and they know statistically older people will last the years if they make it through their first i'd only do all this if you are interested in academics and enjoy learning college can be a big waste of time if you aren't motivated by your own ability to discover if you aren't internally academically motivated might be another way to put it a college degree opens doors but they are meager doors it's nothing a highly motivated person can't open for themselves if they are dynamic and skilled no one learns any practical skills as an undergrad except science students i left a decent job to go to school and the truth is i know that i won't get that much better of a job when i get out in my old job i had no experience i worked my way up to the point where three different departments wanted me anybody can do that anybody you just have to want it this country and its employers are so used to lame people that if you show the least bit of initiative you immediately distinguish yourself if you want it if you have good common sense and if you give it everything you have you can still make it in this country for people like that a college degree is totally optional Education in the United States Community college College admissions Graduate school Education in Portugal Education in Australia Education in Germany High school Medical school College Physician Social rule Master's degree IB Diploma Programme Homeschooling Intelligence quotient Teacher Grade (education) Associate's degree Education in Hong Kong Education in the People's Republic of China City and Guilds of London Institute No Child Left Behind Act Education in Singapore Education in Taiwan Law school Nurse Academic degree Education in Romania Chinese University of Hong Kong Lawyer Education in the Republic of Ireland Kwantlen University College Athabasca University Shaggy dog story Paralegal Tai Chi Chuan Education in France Smith College University of Central Florida Multilingual One Tree Hill (TV series) Affirmative action Australian Qualifications Framework Professor Seneca College Memorial University of Newfoundland Theory of conduct Quizbowl Education in Japan Columbia University University of Michigan Second language acquisition Johns Hopkins University University of Houston Academia Cornell University Electrical engineering Unemployment General practitioner Trinity College, Dublin Middle Tennessee State University UCAS Apprenticeship University of Alabama New York Giants Education in Malaysia Emerson College A-level The Citadel (Military College) Honey and Clover University of Idaho Marilyn Monroe Virginia Military Institute Education in Finland Merrimack College Anglo-Chinese School Florida Institute of Technology Graduation Test (student assessment) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Georgetown University Secondary education in the United States Hunter College High School Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Kodocha University of Notre Dame Numerus clausus Tianjin University Open University
