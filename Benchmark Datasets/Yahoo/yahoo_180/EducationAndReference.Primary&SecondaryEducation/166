what supples shouldii bring to the th grade on the first day of scholl i am going to school the th of augtest but my teachers did not give me a supple list for next year what shold i bring to the first day of school go to your local wal mart shopko target or k mart any one of those stores should have school supplies lists for various school districts in your area find the paper s with your school district and look for th grade on the paper the supplies written on the paper is what your school district wants th graders to have it will likely say something like grades on top of the list ime different school districts have a slightly different list for kids in the same grade as another nearby district would have so be sure to grab your local district's supply list i personally prefer buying from wal mart because they have the best prices from what i've seen this is what i've been doing every year since my kids started kindergarten in my school district th graders and all other middle school students can't carry backpacks from class to class backpacks have to stay in lockers instead i bought my kids a five star zip up binder to put all their supplies in as they moved from class to class it has some big pockets in it so you can keep all the looser school supplies coloring pencils pens pencils gluestick protractor ruler etc inside without worrying about anything falling out and that may happen with a regular looseleaf binder loose leaf paper may tear where the holes are over time and possibly fall out of the binder also that's another reason why i prefer the zip up binder when my kids were in middle school my oldest is in high school and he gets a regular loose leaf binder because high schools allow them to carry a backpack from class to class ace rock had a good school supply list for th graders but my local district wants even more but they're greedy like that Education in the United States Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Murdock-Portal Elementary School Kindergarten MS-06 Zaku II Poker jargon E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
