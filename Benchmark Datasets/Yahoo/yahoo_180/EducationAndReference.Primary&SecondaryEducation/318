school is starting soon and im scared p well everytime i think about it my stomach feels weird lol im going back to th cuz i failed x x but i kno most of the people there but i havent seen hardly anyone over the summer how can i feel more confident about going back thanks i failed th grade too and i was nervous to because i thought i was going to be with millions of th graders and that wasn't the case i only had one th grade class then the others were mixed with kids i've known since freshman year and the th grade kids i was with weren't that bad at all some of them i knew from my japanese class even though i didn't really make any new friends because i'm the shy quiet type they seemed cool once you get back to school you will be so happy the first thing your going to do with your friends more than likely is exchange schedules and see what classes you got together and then after that you guys will be just like you were the previous year only ready to make more memories i would also set a goal to make you look more forward to starting school seeing that you failed th grade maybe you can make a plan to get at least all c's this year that way its not like tons of pressure on you but its something to look forward to and accomplish E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
