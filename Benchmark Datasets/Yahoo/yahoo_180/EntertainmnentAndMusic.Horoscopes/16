why i never doubt on trusting scorpios but i am afraid to trust virgos i've virgo friends lately and i am afraid to trust them because i feel something is wrong i've scorpio friends they are trustworth the paradox is a virgo never lied to me while scorpio did in the past one scorpio girl was a great back stabber and our friendship turned to war nowadays when i hear someone is a scorpio i am ready to trust without worry maybe cuz the scorpio friends i've now are so loyal and trust worth and i like them a lot while when i hear someone is a virgo i feel so afraid and i feel like telling them they could not keep it i am a taurus and i usually trust people for some small matters to check their ability to keep a secret but i really do not have approach to the virgos not that i do not like them i just feel insecure around them wow you are that one girl who always takes the time to write really caring words about scorpios i've seen alot of postings on here of such by you you remind me of my best friend who is a taurus i love that girl w all my heart i think the reason why you would trust a scorpio more so than a virgo is that your relationship w a scorpio is so not surface it's beyond that where maybe the virgo will set you aside and treat you more business your scorpio friend regards you as family your problem is their problem and they will not bare to know that you are in need your scorpio friends are very lucky to have you as their friend i have always got on the best w all my taurus' buddies i appreciate their minds and views Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost W.I.T.C.H.
