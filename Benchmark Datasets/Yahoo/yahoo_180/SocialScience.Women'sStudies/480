aren't there two sides to domestic violence women make it sound like men go around hitting and beating women just to be mean like we get a kick out of abusing women this is not true i want to ask the women here if they have ever been so angry at someone that they just hit them or punched them or really wanted to the first time i got arrested for beating my wife she had hit me in the head with a flash light the second time she threated to have porn delivered to my mothers house there are two sides to every story i think my physicaly strength is irrelevent considering the fact that its and she can easily pick up a gun and blow my head off while i believe that some women take advantage of laws to get men in trouble i also believe men have a decision to make whether to cooperate and put themselves in jail or walk away nobody forces you to become violent you make that decision on your own if your response to a verbal threat is beating then you're simply not taking responsibility for your own temper i in addition why did you stay with a woman who tried to unfairly put you in jail the first time EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City Women in Islam Shaggy dog story Fred Phelps Fathers' rights Divorce Leon White YuYu Hakusho Social rule Knots Landing Rape Jam (TV series) Wyatt Earp Montreal Screwjob Pornography Tenshinhan Professional wrestling attacks The Marshall Mathers LP The Inside Tag Gun politics Humphrey Bogart Big Brother (USA TV series) One Tree Hill (TV series) Rock, Paper, Scissors International law Boxing Softball Professional wrestling match types Animal Liberation Front James Bulger New anti-Semitism Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Eric Cartman Beavis and Butt-head Daredevil Punisher Mike Tyson Marriage Professional wrestling slang The Contender (television series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair John McEnroe Babe Ruth Temperance movement Avenue Q Tupac Shakur Tom Leykis Sly Cooper Abortion debate The Time Machine Forty-seven Ronin Akuma (Street Fighter) Queen (band) The Misfits Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Sharia Wang Mang Vegeta Sonic the Hedgehog Hip hop music American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq British National Party Abu Musab al-Zarqawi Wing Chun Leo Frank Battle of Jutland The O.C.
