do you think that if we had a 'men's studies' section that it would be overrun with man haters as this section is overrun with woman haters just a little curious question so i have something to read right when i get out of bed good night something i want to add before i shut my computer down and just go to sleep another way you could say this question is 'are there more people who despise women or men ' and 'are men more likely to troll or are women ' yes every controversial section is over run with trolls the non controversial ones are too but not to the extent of the former edit thank you i luve you ok i think hating men is more acceptable female on male violence is seen as funny and acceptable in society's view example ''oh yeah just kick him in the nuts if he's says something mean to you'' it's always women who seem to think crap like that is ok i don't go around upper cutting women because i don't like them i've seen plenty of questions here somewhat like that and all the women seemed to think it's ok to hit people just because they're ''a holes'' as for trolling it's definitely males while i'm sure not every troll here with a male avatar really is a male i'm almost positive trolling is more of a male thing Troll Gender-neutral language EastEnders Nigger Social rule Troll (Discworld) Porgy and Bess Races in the Warcraft universe Homophobia Joke The Hobbit Billboard Hot 100 Goatse.cx Phoebe Buffay's songs 2channel Little Britain Have I Got News For You Nation of Islam Late Night with Conan O'Brien The Young Ones (TV series) Internet troll Discworld gods Abortion debate Dilbert Slashdot subculture The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Mojave people Discworld Shaggy dog story Hyksos Socrates Westboro Baptist Church (Topeka) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Angry Beavers Slashdot trolling phenomena The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Homosexuality and Christianity Trolls (Warcraft) Nudity Salic law Can't Hardly Wait Shit Berkeley Software Distribution Gender role Gary Gygax Women in Islam A Tale of a Tub Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Chappelle's Show Orgasm Cult GameFAQs Eric Cartman Britney Spears Jennifer Lopez Jackass: The Movie Homosexuality in China Sexual orientation Domestic violence Locations in the Warcraft Universe Book of Isaiah The Human Stain Gay rights John Lennon Illuga saga Gr____arf__stra The 10th Kingdom Dwarfs (Discworld) Blog SpongeBob SquarePants Hate Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Anal sex Cliff Richard Origin belief Grandview, U.S.A.
