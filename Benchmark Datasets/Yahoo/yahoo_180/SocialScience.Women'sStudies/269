feminists why shouldn't i be a homemaker i'm a mom wife and a homemaker i'm very proud to say i am a homemaker i know some women are forced to work when they don't want to so i exclude them but i believe that the declining values in this country are caused by women feeling forced by feminism to go to work children need mothers women have a special innate capability to be gentle and nurturing that men don't have though men who are forced into the situation by divorce or becoming a widower can develop those traits children need the nurturing and love of a mother and men need the nurturing and love of a wife there is nothing demeaning or oppressive in saying that a woman's place is in the home yes women deserve the right to be treated equally as men i'm not saying that women are less than men and can't make it in the workforce i'm saying that feminism demeans the true character of women saying that they aren't real women unless they deny their roles as mother and wife and try to do the traditional men's roles no odette i don't have to work and it's really nice but everyone has their own problems my own mom did have to work when she would rather be a stay at home mom i made sure i chose to marry someone who could provide for me but i also made sure i got a degree so if i need to work i can i'm sorry if you do have to work but like i said originally i exclude those who have to work and not by choice whoa kimberly don t attack me if that s your opinion fine but i ve told mine too no i don t think men are incapable of raising children i wouldn t marry someone who wasn t planning on being a very involved father secondly being a mother and wife does in no way equate to being a uterus and a maid only mothers and wives are much more important than that and being a wife and mother is not stifling any sort of dreams or talents and i never said that working is strictly a man s role it is traditionally a man s role but not strictly and how can you say that being a mother and wife is not contributing to society why do you even want to be a mother if you feel that way you do not have to be in the workforce to contribute to society and that is the bottom line thanks aph k kimberly kimberly kimberly i think i can safely say that we are not disagreeing i don t look down on women who choose to work if that s what you want fine and if you can be a good mother while you do it fine just so you know i was only responding to someone else s post with the have to work thing i wasn t being arrogant i m glad you don t feel forced to work that s how it should be but it pains me that a lot of women feel that they have to go to work to prove themselves as though they aren t worth anything unless they pay half the bills in a marriage it really saddens me and i only ask questions like this to push women to look at their reasoning for going to work feminism has evolved quite a bit from the 's when some radicals were pushing women to do more than work in the home at the time it was not womanly to work outside the home unless absolutely required like you were poor widowed or divorced since the majority of feminists and majority of women become mothers mainstream feminists thought the radicals were a bit nuts and decided they wanted a lot more options so ever since mainstream feminists have supported women to be stay at home mothers supported women to work part time outside and inside the home supported women who wanted to work full time outside the home and work inside the home and as the years went by supported men who wanted to do any of the above as well you're misinformed about what the majority of feminists want for women feminists want choices for men and women so they can pick the best parent to caretake their children personally i disagree that women should be the primary caretaker of children i've met quite a few women who should never be parents and met quite a few men that are incredible caretakers of their children but that is my personal opinion feminists have many different views on motherhood and fatherhood if you're interested in the work a feminist organization is doing for and with mothers i suggest you check out
