gentlemen what are the reasons and mindsets behind men not reporting abuse by women against them today young girls are taught to defend themselves and take the physical aggression to the next level i dont need to mention the self defense classes are boys still taught not to defend themselves if there is unprovoked physical harm caused by a girl because men dont hot women what do parents and schools teach these young boys is this one of the reasons why the abuse of men by women and the very less number of reported cases is this a grey area left unexplored and ignored deliberatley when these boys grow up do they develop a mindset which leads to this edit the fact is if boys are not fed idiotic ideas of chivalry and start defending themselves aginst girls the stuation becomes a challenge for the legal system males are taught from a very early age not to hit a woman as a whole we are physically bigger and stronger we are taught to tolerate a slap punch verbal abuse and physical abuse for a male to report a woman as being physically abusive goes against everything they are taught from birth stripping them of their manhood and subjecting them to ridicule from their peers men have been the guilty party for hundreds of years simply because of our strenght and sex yet there has always been a or at least split in who instigated the problem women females are coming into their own they have decided to become physical and unfortunately the prison system directly reflects this new found power it has taken years to curb a males instinct to lash out at any threat i can remember years ago being severely punished for inadvertently stepping on a girl's fingers during recess while playing a game of tag yet we are now in an age when girls brandish weapons guns commit assaults murders and every other crime know to man sadly for society and our children this will continue to escalate destroying families and all we once held sacred i am neither an anti woman's lib nor am i in favor of abuse of any kind but i do long for the times when our roles were more defined and children family were the most important thing in ones life a woman is one of the most precious things in any man's life she brings softness nurturing calm harmony and love into a relationship unfortunately women are more and more bring violence into it Domestic violence Rape Infantilism Transsexuality Divorce Simone Weil Corporal punishment EastEnders Abortion debate Murder Sex Pedophilia Human sexual behavior Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Spanking Martial art Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Aikido Zoophilia Anti-aircraft warfare Drug abuse Fathers' rights Age of consent Coercion Androgen insensitivity syndrome 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Capital punishment Childlove movement Al-Aqsa Intifada Human Sexual orientation Hikikomori Gender role Religion and sexuality The Inside French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Trafficking in human beings Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Left-handed Serial killer Bully Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Romulus and Remus Mumia Abu-Jamal One Tree Hill (TV series) Sex and the City Confucianism Stoicism Punishment Alcoholics Anonymous Plame affair History of intersex surgery Homosexuality and Christianity Defense (justification) Education Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Addiction Urinary incontinence Dog Masculism Slander and libel Gun safety Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an W.I.T.C.H.
