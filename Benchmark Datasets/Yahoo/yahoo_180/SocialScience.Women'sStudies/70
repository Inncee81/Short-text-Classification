how can feminism rid itself of female sex supremacists what is a good checklist to tell a feminist from a female sex supremacist since iam a feminist i wouldnt want to get rid of myself well what we would have to do is make a distinction i personally don't like to think of myself as a feminist despite having a number of feminist ideals because of the female sex supremacists trying to reverse sexism onto men it's a horrible thing they've taken the original problem and are trying to push it from women to men which defeats the whole purpose of the movement if more women got together and tried to make a distinction between crazy psycho supremacy bi atches and actual feminists it would go a long way toward helping the issue but you always get the radicals in a movement and it's generally the radicals that wind up defining it because they're so much more outspoken and controversial it's just keeping checks and balances and making your voice heard Feminism Gender-neutral language Feminist movement Gender role Masculism Homophobia Civil rights Sexism White separatism White supremacy Sex-positive feminism Domestic violence Pornography Thealogy Neofascism and religion History of women in the United States Radical feminism Woman Ethics Gender Transgender Orgasm History of feminism Same-sex marriage Homosexuality and transgender White nationalism History of intersex surgery God and gender Andrea Dworkin Robin Morgan Racism Abortion debate Sex Transsexuality Gender-specific pronoun Political correctness National Organization for Women Lesbian Anal sex Anti-racism Scientology beliefs and practices American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Sigmund Freud Deconstruction Intersex surgery Black supremacy Prostitution Condom Androgen insensitivity syndrome Queer American Conservatism American Psycho Oz (TV series) Heteronormativity Intelligent design Human sexual behavior Puritan D.
