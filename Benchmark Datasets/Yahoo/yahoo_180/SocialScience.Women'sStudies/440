how many of you would honestly have a house husband i had to break it off with one of my ex girlfriends once because she had no peace in her life and had to be in control of everything she was a lovely person but nothing in the world would make her happy she was constantly stressed given that the financial side of things wasn't a problem i suggested that she become a housewife at which point she responded what am i your slave i promptly suggested that i become her house husband to which she responded what are you a bum glad she's your ex girlfriend i'd be totally cool with a househusband i've supported my husband girlfriend or boyfriend at different times and vice versa if i had had children i would have wanted to be with a partner that would have stayed home more than me since i would go nuts at various times i have easily supported myself and my household and i'd love it if my boyfriend didn't work and just took care of the house he loves doing it and i don't and it's work that should be paid for he's going to start his own business and i'm totally cool with being the primary breadwinner i don't care what he does as long as he's happy but he likes to work outside the home which i understand but hopefully he'll cut back on it to focus on his business if you're a feminist you believe in choices not restrictions in what each partner can do with their lives Homemaker Gender role Kodocha Pitaten Knots Landing Polyamory EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q The Contender (television series) For Better or For Worse Cool (song) Marilyn Monroe Unemployment The Smoking Room Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Boston Public Domestic violence George Costanza Divorce Rent (musical) Hillary Rodham Clinton Saved by the Bell Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jennifer Lopez Socrates Extreme Programming The Emancipation of Mimi Mina Mongoose Moral Politics Happy Days Dead Like Me Mary Jane Watson Rich Mullins History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Sex and the City Moral objectivism Women in Islam St. Elmo's Fire (film) Blankets (graphic novel) Humphrey Bogart Little Britain Infinite Ryvius Yoko Ono Characters in the Smurfs Utilitarianism Abortion debate Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion The O.C.
