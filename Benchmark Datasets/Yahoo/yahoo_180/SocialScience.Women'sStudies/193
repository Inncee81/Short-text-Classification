why are so many husbands like this im always reading questions on here from men who have a problem with their wife's weight how come these men dont love them unconditionally yea i know when these men marry their wife she is thin but vows say for better or worse im sure these men arent perfect my husband and i have been happily married yrs and i am about but he met me this way married me this way and it has never bothered him bit cause he loves me more then anything and is still very attracted to me when we married i was over and have lost and gained over the yrs but i am trying to lose again for me not for him if you really and truly love someone then a little bit of weight gain shouldnt matter so what is up with these men the only reason he would want me to lose is for my health otherwise it doesnt bother him hey mad i didnt tell my husband he had to love me unconditionally so fuck you i wish you all the success in the world with your weight loss this will be very beneficial for you health and i glad to hear that you are married to a man who sees past the nonsense that determines women must be thin you are obviously a very attractive person to him inside and out but as you have said health issues are a problem with excess weight this will cut down your chances of diabetes high cholesterol joint problems heart disease etc it is refreshing to hear a woman who loves herself unconditionally and is losing some weight only for herself i imagine you will be successful and i wish you all the best you found a wonderful mate and i wish you many more happy years Anorexia nervosa Atkins Nutritional Approach Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dieting Obesity Diabetes mellitus Marriage Atherosclerosis Adjustable gastric band Milk Stroke Hearing impairment The Shining (film) Theodicy Avenue Q Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eastern Orthodox Church Melanie Wilkes Atomic Kitten Oral contraceptive Jam (TV series) Alzheimer's disease Schizophrenia Phoebe Halliwell Simone Weil The Marriage of Figaro Polygamy Binge eating disorder Cardiovascular disease Human Exercise Aspartame Incest W.I.T.C.H.
