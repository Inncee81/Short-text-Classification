feminists do you think it would be unfair of me to do this details i have employers bob and joe joe asks me for weeks app months of paid leave for him to travel around the world since he is a valuable employee i grant him his wish at the same time bob asks me for weeks of paid paternity leave i'm in a good day and i accept upon bob's return he asks me for a raise i deny him and tell him that if he works constantly for weeks double the time he took off and put in extra hour everyday for weeks and weeks only to help make up for his weeks of paid paternity leave i'll give him a year raise a couple months later joe returns from his world travels he also asks me for a raise i deny him and tell him that if he works constantly for weeks again double the time and puts in extra hours a day for those weeks and only that time period to help compensate for his leave i'll give him a raise am i being unfair to one of my employers here after the time period weeks and weeks alternatively is up is up they do not have to work extra hour a day any more i don't care if it's harsh or not the extra hour a day is with pay ok here is the question am i being unfair of one employer over another am i giving joe a better deal than bob or vise versa weeks is a lot of time it is the equivalent of around months i don't work at mcdonald's but this is a hypothetical situation and yes i have the right to refuse an employer p maternity leave my parents own a small business i would know first of all i am unsure about why this is a question addressed to feminists i can only guess that you are comparing the leave you give to bob to maternity leave federal law mandates that an employee with certain restrictions on the employer and employee must be given weeks of unpaid leave under certain situations with the birth of a child being one of them that is generally referred to as maternity leave for women and paternity leave for men it is up to the employer's discretion if they want to make that paid leave or keep it as it is mandated by law which is unpaid since in your scenario you choose to give both employees paid leave and since you demand exactly the same thing from both of them for them to get a raise i e working twice the amount of time they were gone with one extra hour a day then no i don't think it is unfair it does seem a bit harsh as that extra hour really adds up but it is not fundamentally unfair as both are being treated in exactly the same manner i would think it unfair if you gave bob unpaid leave and then demanded he work the extra time in order to get a raise simply because then you would not be holding all of your employees to the same standard if working extra hours is how you intend to judge an employee's worthiness to receive a pay raise then that is your privilege i would simply add that bob does not need to catch you on a good day to get his leave you have to give it to him by law what does depend on your mood is whether or not he is paid during that time i would also add that if you give joe paid leave but give bob unpaid leave you are opening yourself up for a lawsuit for discriminating against bob as i stated before if you treat all your employees in exactly the same manner meaning everyone either gets paid leave or everyone gets unpaid leave and if you give everyone their jobs back and you demand the same thing from everyone in order for them to earn a raise then that does not seem unfair to me harsh yes unfair no i don't see that you are favoring one above the other in any way since your demands are in exchange for their previous request to negotiate a new salary Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Labor theory of value Social rule Economic inequality Poker jargon Microeconomics Unemployment Conscription Same-sex marriage Social Security (United States) Divorce Article One of the United States Constitution Labor-power Theory of conduct Insurance Child support Contract Appeal Member of the European Parliament Working time Unemployment benefit Civil rights Minimum wage Fathers' rights Compensation of employees Estoppel Betting (poker) Wheel of Fortune Extreme Programming Transsexuality Breastfeeding Plame affair Winter of Discontent Family name SCO-Linux controversies CPU cache Affirmative action Roe v.
