does this successfully debunk the myths perpetrated by some feminists http www fathers bc ca feminist myths htm myth women earn xx per man's for the same work the xx claimed varies wildly false this myth refuses to take into account important considerations such as actual hours worked training job commitment etc myth men control more money than women false men work for and earn more money but women control more than of us personal wealth and spend consumer dollars for every consumer dollar that men spend myth women's standard of living falls after divorce while men's rises false this myth is based on an advocacy study by lenore weitzmann that has been long debunked for use of unrepresentative samples misleading arithmetic insistence on counting payments from the ex husband to the ex wife as if he still possessed the money and so forth weitzmann openly broke the american sociological association's code of ethics but has yet to be disciplined for it myth choice for men is about men trying to evade parental responsibilities false and sexist in the us choice for men would give men only the rights women have had since roe v wade nothing more it would not let the man compel the woman to abort see http www nas com c m trick people who oppose feminists are threatened by strong women it is manipulative and arrogant to imply that the only flaw feminists could possibly have is to be too strong trick feminists just want equality feminism is about people the anti male nature of feminists is so obvious so huge so outrageous that to discuss this myth would only dignify it undeservedly and we've all noticed that purveyors of this trick don't object when the why should feminism do anything for men trick is used trick why should feminism do anything for men why don't men form their own groups instead of demanding that feminism behave itself we do and obviously we lack the political clout of feminism but given feminism's constant use of appeal to pity it is enormously hypocritical to now say who cares about you we got ours and we've all noticed that purveyors of this trick don't object when the feminism is about people trick is used myth differences in the skills and behaviour of men and women are all caused by socialisation thus in principle all women can do most jobs as well as all men there is an enormous middle ground between biological determinism and cultural determinism both extremes are ridiculous we should not accept the socialization causes it all theory as the alternative to biological determinism trick women have it worse because violence against women is increasing at a faster rate than violence against men this is the fallacy of confounding the derivative with the function men have it much worse as evinced by the two major u s department of justice crime measures the actual victimization rates for women are still much lower than those of men trick you can't criticize feminism because no statement you make is true of all feminists this trick tries to block discussion by making it impossible to express your thought the writer simply specifies that by feminism he means mainstream feminism misandry another approach is to qualify the term gender feminism biofeminism or radical feminism and if feminism really was so random by the same token you wouldn't be able say anything positive about it trick well i don't approve of some particular feminist evil only some rare radical feminists do maybe if you genuinely don't then we weren't criticizing you but generally the statement is part of the old good cop bad cop routine do you ever actually criticize the misandrists ever advance new arguments against feminist policies or actions ever spread the word about the latest feminist outrage or do you just tell us to stop holding feminism accountable trick there is no feminist agenda sarcasm i must have been away when the agenda was handed out sarcasm that tactic has become a favorite one to deflect criticism about the activities being conducted on their behalf movements don't exist without agendas nor can they be effective without a fairly high degree of uniformity among their supporters trick i don't speak for feminism just for myself i'm not accountable for feminism feminism is not accountable for me fair enough if it came from a real non feminist but if you have argued in defense or support of feminism you have shown your colors and we won't forget it for your convenience it's also fair to hold feminism accountable for you if other feminists refrain from significantly criticizing you trick why is so important to you to argue about some particular gender issue you should be asking this of feminists not of antifeminists the feminists invented the which sex has it worse issue with all its variations and invented countless lies about it it was only when the lies were thrown in our face over and over that we realized we had to defend men why attack antifeminists for defending men and say nothing to feminists for attacking men in the first place trick men are responsible for wars this justifies many sorts of manbashing including the all male draft you mean men are sent to war surely sending a birth group to their deaths does not justify further discrimination against that group trick you're not a woman so you could never understand and when's the last time you told a female feminist she could never hope to understand because she's not a man and so the only people who can comment on gender issues are people who have had sex change operations to fraxinus the link works and even if it doesn't you can still read the additional details and didn't you have a question that focused on recognizing and eradicating trolls surely the dust you sprinkled is by you yourself if you want to post spam to my questions i'm afraid i just have to block you dracorim so the indescrepancy in the first issue makes me question the validity of the remainder great way to ignore the rest of the points i suppose we should all take up that line of reasoning and dismiss everything based on one point alone to super ruper true indeed http answers yahoo com question index ylt agwahxpb a
