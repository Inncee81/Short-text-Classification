do you think a guys privates seem a bit abnormal kinda like nature threw them on as a last mintue attachment some men have very perfect hot smooth looking bodies however the flimsy sack in between looks ugly and out of place does anyone else agree umm jou mcgrew of course women are prettier or gay men may even feel that way because well pretty is associated with things with softer features or appear more delicate so especially in this sense i doubt gay men find men s bodies not as good looking or attractive but just find the female form more feminine which should be obvious are men more attractive because they are more handsome no because handsome is a type of good looks just like pretty and they typically are associated with each sex pretty for women handsome for men apples and oranges which i didn t think u should or could compare i have seen lesbians find the male form more nicer to them does that mean they are more attractice no they obviously find the female form better looking and attractive since it turns them on and not men but they just so happen to have more of an interest in drawing the male form that s all which is probably meant wiht what these gay men said also and the women are talking in this way or part of this being social condtioning with this feeling yes women are amazing and very beautiful but don t u think the male form should get some respect too don't u think both were designed in attractive forms and pleasing forms i mean after all men and women are attracted to each other right so it goes both ways the male form is actually multi dimensional in my eyese and not just a machine unlike what u think or just to lift and do stuff for women even thought some ignorant selfish people might think that maybe just maybe it might have the muscles that can do all this but at the same time look good alos which cut muscles do or cut muscles that look good but just so happen to give strength and allow work and lifitng thus two in one built there is much more than that as the male form is very versatile even though that might be hard for u to comprehend i feel sorry for your men do not have such full appreciation or love of the way the male physique looks not because of what it can do for u i also must say this regarding the male genitialia especially the balls yes balls are wrinkly little thigs lol but i don t know what is gross about them or ugly them are sex parts they aren t supposed to look like flowers and shit lol or hearts lol they should be nice or exciting as they are or were made to be there are as they are i don t know what some women expect or something well all i know is that there are plenty of women who aren t prudish aren t brainwashed by society and actually have a sex drive and aren t selfish and my lovely woman is one of them she's sitting here right now told me to tell you theyre yummy and gorgeous Theory of conduct Social rule Physical attractiveness Sexual orientation Gender role Strap-on dildo Shaggy dog story Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Gay Gay slang Little Britain Sexual attraction Transgender Sex Friends Biology and sexual orientation W.
