why are so many women always raging against generalizations isnt it far more silly to cite the exception to the rule as a reaction i mean seriously i spoke about how women are reluctand to be the provider for a man and got accused of generalizing because somone knew somebody who but what are the chances for a man who has the intention to become a houseman to find a wife that can and will provide for him in maybe in is still too generous so do as all a favour and quit using the white flies to speak out against the mainstream actually i aint looking for that kind of woman and iam pretty sure men who are have pretty slim chances actually it was more how about some people try to topple the rule by citing an exception to the rule and of course screaming like a banshee about generalizations not so much about the example at hand there's no way of knowing the answer to your question without doing actual research into the subject and i'd be very hesitant to agree with your assumption about people's working lives today without actual proof people go through many changes in their lives and thanks to the gains feminism made in changing the way people work men can now access paternity leave and other 'family friendly' work practices and spend time at home with their children while their partners work and women can do the same people choose to work or not work at different times in their lives in discussion with their partners if you are not having luck in finding a partner who will support you in this way you might be looking in the wrong place try giving some attention to well educated independently minded women you'll have a better chance finding someone to share the load if you consider your partner as just that and not just someone to 'keep' you cheers Domestic violence Gender role Divorce Theory of conduct Marriage Polygamy Abortion debate Sexual orientation Social rule Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Fathers' rights Plame affair Romulus and Remus Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Homophobia Women in Islam Gender-neutral language Asperger syndrome Biology and sexual orientation Baseball Stars Feminism Democracy Theodicy Epistemology Mojave people Same-sex marriage in Canada W.I.T.C.H.
