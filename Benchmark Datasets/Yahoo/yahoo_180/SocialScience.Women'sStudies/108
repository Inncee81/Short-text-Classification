why are most of the questions in this section attacks on women misogynists or anti feminists are constantly complaining about man haters on this forum but the majority of hateful questions answers are coming from them really why do you feel the need to do that why can't we just have a discussion seriously is anyone capable of answering this question honestly and logically i am not saying that no feminist has ever attacked a man on this forum or anywhere else i realize nobody's perfect and that everybody is mean sometimes ok i am talking about the discussion here at y a gender women's studies section not about how people treat other people in real life most of the so called misogynists here are actually young boys who confuse mating issues with feminism feminism is about democracy and equal rights not courtship rituals young boys who are in their pre sexual explorations of male female relationships which includes confrontational behaviors frequently experience frustration in learning effective courtship rituals and then out of immaturity and or ignorance they label their misadventures and social failures with girls and women under the catch all name of feminism as i wrote earlier today i may date a black man and bicker with him about how he doesn't listen to me as an example but because we might bicker in our courtship behaviors i would not deviate the issue to wishing a return to slavery boys who fail in mating courtship relationships though oftentimes wish a return to second class citizenship for women in retaliation Feminism Civil rights Courtship Human sexual behavior Gender role Homophobia Transgender Masculism Sexual orientation Feminist movement Domestic violence Homosexuality Same-sex marriage Homosexuality and Christianity Philosophy of language Infantilism Internet troll God and gender Andrea Dworkin Incest Sexual attraction Sigmund Freud Sex History of intersex surgery Heteronormativity Gender identity Abortion debate Zoophilia Gender-neutral language Economic inequality History of sex Bisexuality Girl God Emperor of Dune Motivation Age of consent Narcissism Misogyny Susan McClary Aesthetic Realism Sex-positive feminism Religion and sexuality The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Homosexuality and transgender Biology and sexual orientation Germaine Greer Democracy Mary Wollstonecraft Woman The Handmaid's Tale Generation X Reparative therapy Polygamy Psychology Rape Calvin and Hobbes Asian fetish Radical feminism Pedophilia Female genital cutting Feminists for Life Adolescence Friendship SAT Androgen insensitivity syndrome Animal rights Power (sociology) Goodness and value theory LaVeyan Satanism Sadism and masochism Cross-dressing Child sexual abuse Simone Weil Mojave people Political correctness Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Child sexuality Scientology beliefs and practices Anne Boleyn Ruth Bader Ginsburg Atheism Mary Jane Watson Eric Cartman Karen Horney Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Asperger syndrome Grimke Sisters African American literature Affirmative action Culture Demographics of sexual orientation
