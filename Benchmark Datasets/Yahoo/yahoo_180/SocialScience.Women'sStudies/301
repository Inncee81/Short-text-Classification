is it hard to determine where s ex ends and gender begins men have extremely delicate testicles a biological fact thus it is sex however because society expects men to dominate women and other men it ascribes great strength to that fragile part of the anatomy when people says stop being a wimp and show some real balls they re doing gender likewise for women the clitoris is a part of the female anatomy a biological fact the sole purpose of the clitoris is sexual pleasure another biological fact but because society expects women to be subordinate to men it will either do gender by performing female genital mutilation as practiced in many muslim countries or it will act like the clitoris doesn t generate real orgasms as believed in the progressive western nations obviously issues of sex and gender can get quite complex sometimes it s hard to determine where sex ends and gender begins nevertheless it s a useful tool for understanding how society constructs masculinity and femininity complete article at http web airmail net ktrig out of cave mf html title masculinity femininity society's difference dividend you are right laura which is the question lol what i mean is that i was reading this article and this paragraph attracted my attention because i had never thought it in this way but it makes sense so i am curious about what other people think about the paragraph i mean flying okay i'll bite i'll admit that i got through reading a tiny bit of all that 'psycho babble' before i had to quit so far as what i thought of this one paragraph in particular okay i have used on a few occasions the bit about 'growing some balls' to motivate men however male dominance over females had nothing to do with it it did have everything to do with showing a bit of courage in situations where the guy s were expected to 'stand up' and do the right thing something that people regardless of sex hold in high regard so far as the testes being fragile yeah i'll give you that however i know from first hand accounts that you kick someone of either sex square between the legs the result is similar the issue of fgm fgm is actually most prevalent in sub saharan african countries and islam has very little to do with it this backward practice continues to this day and is most often performed by female 'medicine women' using a piece of glass or a sharpened metal object why a woman would be so adamant about inflicting such pain unto other females as young as five or six in some countries is beyond me using the practice of fgm as a parallel to how society expects women to be subordinate to men doesn't quite wash with me sub saharan african countries have their own culture and that shapes their society it has nothing to do with the society that i am a part of during my military tenure and subsequently i've had more female supervisors than male my society accepts that women can earn merit and move up was i their subordinate yes did i act like i was totally without power not in the least and might i say that my supervisors never deferred to their higher ups because they happened to be male they always fought the good fight and that's one of the reasons i worked well with some of them i did not do well with those without backbones sex notwithstanding back to answering your question as a whole i found the entire site you listed boring and tiresome to read the paragraph in question was weak in the way the author justified conclusions Sexual orientation Intersexuality Gender-neutral language Feminism Orgasm History of intersex surgery Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual differentiation God and gender Human sexual behavior Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Intersex surgery Gender identity Nicomachean Ethics Sharia Zoophilia Sex assignment Transgender Clitoris Sex Feminist movement Anal sex Sex organ Bulgarian language Biology and sexual orientation Theory of conduct Puberty Transsexuality German grammar Religion and sexuality Abortion debate Rape Human Grammatical gender Circumcision A Course In Miracles Gay slang Sex toy Effeminacy Medical analysis of circumcision Homosexuality Property (ownership right) Man Bisexuality Appeal Goodness and value theory Paraphilia Child sexuality BDSM Theodicy Nudity Serial killer Utilitarianism Human nature Philo Narcissism Political correctness David Hume Legal aspects of transsexualism Spanish pronouns The nature of God in Western theology Woman Women in Islam Economic inequality Varieties of Arabic Science Social rule History of feminism Fundamentalism Margaret Mead Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Homosexuality and Christianity Merit High-heeled shoe Sexual attraction Physical attractiveness Deconstruction English grammar Bondage (BDSM) Liberalism Meaning of life Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Determinism Sexual intercourse Condom
