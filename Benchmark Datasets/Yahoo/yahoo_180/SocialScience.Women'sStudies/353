how can a girl prevent herself from being kidnapped or murdered ive seen alot of news stories on this happening and im scared to like go out alone recently a girl went to like target get her bf something his b day then she was kidnapped and police found her dead so i need tips as to how to prevent this sort of thing what are you supposed to do like if your alone and then approached by a kidnapper rapist murder or such should i carry something ive heard that screaming doesnt even help any advice please tip from tae kwon do the elbow is the strongest point on your body if you are close enough to use it do learned this from a tourist guide in new orleans if a robber asks for your wallet and or purse do not hand it to him toss it away from you chances are that he is more interested in your wallet and or purse than you and he will go for the wallet purse run like mad in the other direction if you are ever thrown into the trunk of a car kick out the back tail lights and stick your arm out the hole and start waving like crazy the driver won't see you but everybody else will this has saved lives women have a tendency to get into their cars after shopping eating working etc and just sit doing their checkbook or making a list etc don't do this the predator will be watching you and this is the perfect opportunity for him to get in on the passenger side put a gun to your head and tell you where to go as soon as you get into your car lock the doors and leave a if someone is in the car with a gun to your head do not drive off repeat do not drive off instead gun the engine and speed into anything wrecking the car your air bag will save you if the person is in the back seat they will get the worst of it as soon as the car crashes bail out and run it is better than having them find your body in a remote location a few notes about getting into your car in a parking lot or parking garage a be aware look around you look into your car at the passenger side floor and in the back seat b if you are parked next to a big van enter your car from the passenger door most serial killers attack their victims by pulling them into their vans while the women are attempting to get into their cars c look at the car parked on the driver's side of your vehicle and the passenger side if a male is sitting alone in the seat nearest your car you may want to walk back into the mall or work and get a guard policeman to walk you back out it is always better to be safe than sorry and better paranoid than dead always take the elevator instead of the stairs stairwells are horrible places to be alone and the perfect crime spot this is especially true at night if the predator has a gun and you are not under his control always run the predator will only hit you a running target in times and even then it most likely will not be a vital organ run preferably in a zig zag pattern as women we are always trying to be sympathetic stop it may get you raped or killed ted bundy the serial killer was a good looking well educated man who always played on the sympathies of unsuspecting women he walked with a cane or a limp and often asked for help into his vehicle or with his vehicle which is when he abducted his next victim here it is another safety point someone just told me that her friend heard a crying baby on her porch the night before last and she called the police because it was late and she thought it was weird the police told her whatever you do do not open the door the lady then said that it sounded like the baby had crawled near a window and she was worried that it would crawl to the street and get run over the policeman said we already have a unit on the way whatever you do do not open the door he told her that they think a serial killer has a baby's cry recorded and uses it to coax women out of their homes thinking that someone dropped off a baby he said they have not verified it but have had several calls by women saying that they hear baby's cries outside their doors when they're home alone at night Shaggy dog story Scream (film) Donald Neilson The Lovely Bones Knots Landing The Silence of the Lambs Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ted Bundy Tag Jam (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Beltway sniper attacks The X-Files (season 1) James Hanratty The Shining (film) Serial killer Silent Night, Deadly Night Reservoir Dogs Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Rais massacre Spidey Super Stories The Dalek Invasion of Earth Humphrey Bogart What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
