can you not be a masculist but still respect and be fair to both men and women i asked a similar question regarding feminism and the majority albeit some with hesitation said you did not need to be a feminist to believe in fairness and respect for both sexes now the reverse question can you decline to align yourself with or refer to yourself as a movement e g feminism or masculism and still be a decent person who does not discriminate or give unfair treatment to people based on their sex masculism is similar to feminism except from the male perspective from dictionary com masculism is viewed by its proponents as having an egalitarian view of gender issues even though it focuses on men's experience egalitarian asserting resulting from or characterized by belief in the equality of all people esp in political economic or social life i should mention that a few feminists insist that by definition it is impossible for a person to not want women to be treated fairly if one is not a feminist i hope that they also answer this question carrie i am assuming t franxius try www dictionary com and let's not bring in what people think of masculism or feminism in that case we would assume they were both hate groups neither have reputations that match their defintions carrie sorry sent the above from my pda and didn't even think it would go through anyway by definition masculism and feminism seem to have similar same goals from different angles and in general neither has a reputation as being fair and reasonable and seeking to respect the other sex so for the sake of this question let's base our conclusions on the the actual definitions rather than the reputations yes you can just like when you're a feminist carrie was koreaguy a right winger he called himself a masculist and was supportive of feminist he seemed like a really fair and mature guy to me chuckwalla is also pretty smart girly is also a feminist and a masculist heck for this question this question only i'll label myself as a masculist and i'm a center syncretic w tt center syncretic right or left d warren farrel used to be on the board of now gotta be a smart left winger for that right Feminist movement Sexual orientation Gender role Abortion debate Transsexuality Fathers' rights Same-sex marriage Homosexuality and transgender Civil rights Goodness and value theory Transgender Homophobia Political correctness Anarchism Anti-racism Postmodernism Same-sex marriage in Canada Reparative therapy Left-wing politics Libertarianism Transfeminism Domestic violence Sex Biology and sexual orientation Conscription Sex-positive feminism Androgen insensitivity syndrome Animal rights American individualist anarchism History of women in the United States Radical feminism Warren Farrell Woman Theory of conduct Conscription in the United States Affirmative action Orgasm Sigmund Freud Left-Right politics Andrea Dworkin Ethics Economic inequality Religious pluralism Religious Society of Friends Religion Conservatism Human sexual behavior History of intersex surgery Girl Pedophilia Liberalism Trinity Homosexuality and Christianity Bisexuality Human Cult A Course In Miracles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Islam as a political movement Legal aspects of transsexualism Homemaker Misandry Liberal Christianity Lesbian Multiculturalism Economics Animism Bernard Williams Who is a Jew?
