is america brainwashed by feminism i think this from ask men com as most men know women generally have an advantage in relationships especially in this era where men have been brainwashed by feminism into believing that any show of assertiveness on their part equals injury to the woman ironically even though many feminists complain about assertive men they often choose assertive men as their lovers this kind of female hypocrisy is rampant in many areas for example women will say that men are cheaters even though women are cheating in record numbers if caught cheating they will say that men do it too they will complain that men have double standards about promiscuity when in fact they themselves hold that double standard they view promiscuous men as threats to their relationships yet are attracted to a man who can bed large numbers of women since it implies that he must be doing something pretty special to get all those partners i was wondering if you could write a column describing the phenomenon of attention shifting by females in order to help men who are being manipulated by it i gather from your question that you don't believe in equality which is what feminism advocates feminism is a diverse collection of social theories political movements and moral philosophies largely motivated by or concerning the experiences of women especially in terms of their social political and economic situation as a social movement feminism largely focuses on limiting or eradicating gender inequality and promoting women's rights interests and issues in society some feminists take a holistic approach to politics believing the saying of martin luther king jr a threat to justice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere in that belief some self identified feminists support other movements such as the civil rights movement and the gay rights movement at the same time many black feminists such as bell hooks criticize the movement for being dominated by white women feminist claims about the alleged disadvantages women face in western society are often less relevant to the lives of black women this idea is the key in postcolonial feminism many black feminist women prefer the term womanism for their views Feminist movement Civil rights Postmodernism Gender role Affirmative action Masculism Ethics Libertarianism Liberalism Domestic violence Conservatism Sexual orientation Fathers' rights Social justice Same-sex marriage Left-wing politics Islam as a political movement Objectivist philosophy Nonviolence Goodness and value theory History of women in the United States Deconstruction Cultural relativism Transsexuality Animal rights American Conservatism Democracy Liberal movements within Islam Coercion Political views of Lyndon LaRouche Homosexuality Mind control Religion Anarcho-primitivism Human sexual behavior Asian fetish Abortion debate New Testament Causality Philosophy of mathematics Communitarianism State Gender-neutral language Economic inequality Brainwashing Capitalism Liberal Christianity Political philosophy Social democracy Pedophilia American liberalism Political correctness Marriage Philosophy of language Bisexuality Multiculturalism Globalization Anarcho-capitalism Intelligent design Altruism Human nature Philosophy of science Reparative therapy Racism Louis Althusser Human rights Roe v.
