what do you think of a man with aids sleeping around not disclosing his condition what do you think of a year old gay man having unprotected sex or purposely sabbotaging the condom with anyone and not disclosing that he is hiv positive this man is really angry hurt and admitted that he wants others to suffer like he is also is this true he tells me that he is not required by law to disclose wtf isn't this pre meditated murder my relationship with this person was counsellor client so i was bound by confidentiality it was in australia where the law is clear regarding some aspects like once diagnosed the clinic will inform previous partners if you can remember or even know who they are but in regards to post diagnosis behaviour there doesn't seem to be a law even so by the time someone found out they had contracted aids i doubt they'd be able to identify him booze one night stand syndrome with his current behaviour no i don't know who his partners are neither does he he's just bar hopping to see how many he'l l get in one night also even though he's gay he's sleeps with women as well technically there is not law stating someone has to disclose their condition to their partner so in a technically aspect hes right and in a sense it is premeditated murder i'm not sure if he contacted hiv the same way hes passing it on but i personally believe its a very selfish thing to do my brother died in a car accident do to someones elses carlessness but i don't go around causing accidents to hurt someone else from a revenge stand point if your hurting the one to hurt you i don't justify it but its understandable but when you bring other people innocent people into it its a selfish and unhumarity thing to do i don't know if you know this peson personally or what the story is but i believe you should report him to the local authorities so action can be taken AIDS Domestic violence AIDS pandemic Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Plame affair Crystal methamphetamine and sex Gay slang Theory of conduct Anal sex Sin City Herpes simplex virus Social rule EastEnders Rape Ex-gay Memento (film) Clinical depression HIV test Asperger syndrome Lawrence v.
