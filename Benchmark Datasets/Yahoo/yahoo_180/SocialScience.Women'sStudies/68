what are problems faced by the working women in their work places well i am a teacher which very much caters to women's needs i don't think that my problems like holding pee for hours are quite the same as those of many other women however i was surprised to learn that where i teach does not offer paid maternity leave most schools now do this however i work in a small district that and about that's of the staff either had children last year or announced they were pregnant yes there were many jokes about dont drink the water so this would be a huge expence for the district being a small district they get many young teachers who have children where as many bigger districts get more experenced older teachers who are less likely to have children as for personal issues its hard to put women in a building and tell them all to get along i have never personally had issues with anyone but i have been there when others did and was there for the venting i have found that a oh really she did or i see keeps me out of a lot of the hoopla Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Humphrey Bogart Social rule Charter school Boston Public Current teachings of Prem Rawat Education Melanie Wilkes Shaggy dog story Roe v.
