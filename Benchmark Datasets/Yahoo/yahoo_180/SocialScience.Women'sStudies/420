reproductive rights and the battle of the sexes many argue that reproductive rights are swayed in favor of women when it boils down the fact is that numerically women have more choices then men in case of preg obviously both have the option of contraception prior to fertilization but post conception men have none and women still have options such as abortion men's rights activists argue that this uneven choice has impeded men in that while one party has the final decision both parties must accept the outcome should the woman choose to carry the pregnancy full term she makes the decision for not only her to become a parent financially and otherwise but also the man should she choose to abort the fetus the man is chosen out of parenthood should equal rights efforts address biological matters and why what would be some possible solutions for this unevenness both in the event of full term pregnancy and abortion to even the playing field for men or should it be even pros cons of solutions as you point out prior to pregnancy both men and woman have equal choice as to engage or refrain from sex and the right to practice contraception after pregnancy occurs the current idea of reproduction seems to boil down to one thing her body her choice his responsibility logically if only one person has a choice about any matter the whole responsibility for that choice should fall solely on the shoulders of the only person who has the choice if the choices are shared equally by one or more each person having equal choice should share equal responsibility men have no choice once pregnancy is established while women have several options abortion adopting the child out legal abandonment or keeping the child and demanding payment from the father although to adopt the baby out the pregnancy and birth must be hidden from the father in most cases single mothers are automatically considered as a parent with all rights of a parent while single fathers are not unless the mother approves married mothers are considered the primary parent even when the father does more of the hands on care in cases of divorce and custody battles if men have any responsibility in regard to reproduction they must also be given choices in the matter relative to the amount of responsibility as it is men are given the amount of responsibility the mother chooses without any choice whatsoever solutions end abortion on demand and legislate equal responsibility for the pregnancy birth and cost of children in addition to equality in parenthood regardless the sex of the parent legislate the ability for fathers to deny parenthood legally paper or legal abortion to equal that of mothers to deny it physically actual abortion this would result in mothers still having the other choices abortion adoption abandonment or keeping it but also require they accept the sole responsibility for their sole choice this would require the man s decision to be made prior to the cutoff for abortion in either case all parents should share equal rights and responsibilities in regard to born children Pro-choice Adoption Roe v.
