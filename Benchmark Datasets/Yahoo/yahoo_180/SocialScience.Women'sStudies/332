what is a bimbo is it a ditzy woman is it an immoral woman can it be a man i never liked the term dumb blond because it's really a rude term i have three daughters two who are blond and have better intelligence then most 'smart' men i've come ac cross my one daughter who's a blond has an iq of and good common sense to go with it although i also hate the term bimbo i've known more men who try to have sex with anything that's female then women who sleep around i've known more then one woman that you men might call a bimbo but were highly intelligent but had no common sense it has to do more with that i think then being unintelligent at least according today's definition of the slang word though many people think that they are of low intelligence as well i agree that they are in all probability naive men i've met who sleep around are generally not called 'dumb' nor are they naive take the movie character james bond which most people don't realize is based on a real person we'd hardly call him 'dumb ' but he had a tremendous appetite for sex most men are not naive either they know exactly what they're doing and can be very devious about it too the husband and boyfriend stealer's who enjoy stealing a husband from his wife or a boyfriend from his girl are anything but dumb and think it's a great game to play at some other woman's expense have no morals and aren't naive either i've known a few of them as well what it boils down to is that you can't profile every woman into any one catagory Bimbo Married... with Children Naive set theory Woman Great Teacher Onizuka Joke Knots Landing The Fairly OddParents Valley girl Humphrey Bogart Marilyn Monroe Blond Daria Dumb blonde Totally Spies!
