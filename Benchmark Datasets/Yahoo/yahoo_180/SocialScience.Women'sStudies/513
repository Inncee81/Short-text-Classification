were you brought up in a sexist household i was brought up in a sexist household and i hated it my step dad was the most sexist man i have ever met he believed women are naive and can not be independent whenever he saw a female that was strong and independent he would call them whores he believed women should clean up after men and submit to them he made my mother quit her job and when she did she had to ask for an allowance like a little kid it broke my heart to see it he made my teenage years a living hell he owns several businesses and wanted me to work with him i refused and found other jobs he would also pick fights with me and then tell my mother i was the cause of it because of him i had a real problem trusting men in fact i had a me against the world type of attitude i despised the idea of marriage because my step father told me that the only way i would leave home is with a husband i proved him wrong and i moved out on my own i met a wonderful man that treats me like his equal i also went to therapy which helped alot my mom is still married to him i try not to visit when he is there my younger brother now has the same warped thinking as my step dad i have a year old little sister and she is my heart i hope she won't go through the hell i went through because she is so smart he is already trying to break her down if it were up to me i would have her to live with me thanks wendy g their type of ignorance is sad i'm and my brother is kendrickflorida read this carefully my step father believed men ruled over women he believed women should bow down to men he tried to his force his beliefs on me my step father basically wanted me to bow down to men which doesn't sit well with me i decided to take myself to therapy so i wouldn't go through life with a chip on my shoulder i now have a b a in psychology and my own place i'm at peace with myself now that i do not live with my step dad anymore i wanted to know if other people have experienced a similar environment perhaps you see nothing wrong with my step dad because you all may have the same mentality kendrickflorida read this carefully my step father believed men ruled over women he believed women should bow down to men he tried to his force his beliefs on me my step father basically wanted me to bow down to men which doesn't sit well with me i decided to take myself to therapy so i wouldn't go through life with a chip on my shoulder i now have a b a in psychology and my own place i'm at peace with myself now that i do not live with my step dad anymore i wanted to know if other people have experienced a similar environment perhaps you see nothing wrong with my step dad because you all may have the same mentality equal meaning he doesn't treat me as inferior to him my mother complained about this the men who are criticizing should really look at documentaries on this effects families today a young teen girl when through worse than what i went through her father totally ignored her because she was girl yet he did not physically or verbally abuse her instead he just stated that her brothers were better than her because she was a woman so rc before you judge someone you need to look at the full picture i never said i hated men this was just my experience and i see that the men answering my question have the same mentality as my step dad my boyfriend has other qualities than that if you must know so rc yes i have went to therapy for it so what what i went through with living my step dad made me stronger to say its normal normal for who you you really should reread my post i posted this question because someone else had posted this question months ago and yes drownezze that's what i mean by equality and for the people who didn't understand you could've just asked than judge thanks kendrickflorida for asking for more clarification rather than judge wow that's really sad for all of you your mom you kids and your story is not uncommon unfortunately i'm so glad you posted this and i really do hope that some of the men that write in sexist comments to this forum read what you have written here often enough and it amazes me there are men who are regulars in this forum who write in and say that women already have equality that there is no problem that exists in society today regarding that issue and it's so not true i think you are amazing in that you were brought up in a sexist environment and even at a young age you knew it was wrong you knew it hurt people and you had the presence of mind to resist falling into that same way of thinking i admire you for that often times the story goes the way you told it of your brother what children learn when they are young so often gets repeated when they grow up i'm very happy for you that you found someone to be with who treats you as an equal i'm glad that you didn't end up with someone who is just like your father pat yourself on the back for breaking the chain it's not easy to
