love is more than making the partner happy at the end of the day he she makes you happy there's gotta be more to it than that in love right i mean soo many couples today in relationships marriages make each other laugh and have a good time if so why are there are soo many breakups and divorces in love there's more to it than making the significant other happy satisfied right i don't think that love requires anything more than a positive feeling for another relationships are what take commitment patience etc because whether or not you are compatible with someone is much different than whether or not you love them i disagree that love makes you accept annoying habits i love my boyfriend very much but i still hate his annoying habits love does not make everything perfect Marriage Polyamory Divorce Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Knots Landing Friends Jennifer Lopez EastEnders Janet Jackson Interpersonal relationship Polygamy Anna Karenina Homosexuality Sex and the City Harry Potter (character) Laura Schlessinger Eastern Orthodox Church The Smoking Room Marilyn Monroe Swinging The Ashlee Simpson Show Religion and sexuality Mary Jane Watson Same-sex marriage One Tree Hill (TV series) Happiness Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Emancipation of Mimi The Merchant of Venice Economics Mail-order bride John Lennon Badly Drawn Kitties Max Martin Same-sex marriage in Canada Homosexuality and Christianity Civil unions in the United Kingdom Don't Speak David Niven Original sin Dead Like Me Pitaten Human sexual behavior Liam Gallagher Dawson's Creek Cool (song) Sharon Tate Care Bears Gay rights Patience (operetta) Earth Girl Arjuna Luke and Laura Spencer Christian view of marriage Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief English grammar Domestic violence Theodicy Fathers' rights Cliff Richard Yoko Ono The Adventures of Pete & Pete Kodocha Viva Hate Ten Commandments Fruits Basket The Beatles Anne Boleyn Sexual orientation Crossing Jordan Charmed Angel (vampire) Humphrey Bogart Happy Days Human George Burns Blur Culture of the United States Zoophilia The Beatles discography Grief Tiberius W.I.T.C.H.
