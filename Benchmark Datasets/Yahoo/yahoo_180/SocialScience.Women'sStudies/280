how can women dress the way they do and act the way they do and dare cry sexual harassment what are you talking about when women dress up or play up their personal sexuality it's not a come hither it's an expression of themselves when men or other people choose to violate personal rights it's their own decision not the fault of the victim i hope in the future you learn that women should be able to express themselves in any way they want without being attacked for it men need to learn that women need to be treated equally in this society men are more powerful and as is usual in sexual harassment cases use it to harm others to maintain their own status i suggest you research the other side and or put yourself in a woman's shoes Transsexuality Rape Gay rights Human sexual behavior Sexual harassment Divorce Civil rights Abortion debate Lawrence v.
