guys do blondes have more attitude than any other female species only technical non controversial answers please this is not only my opinion but i would put it as a general consensus that those blondes are more difficult to score compared to all other women for the simple statistical fact that more guys are attracted to them on average put yourself in a mixed room and chances are more guys will be drawn towards hot young smokin' blonde than any other woman as a direct result they have more opportunities to play hardball and ditch you any moment it's simply the blonde attitude here's an answer that would quite summarize it http answers yahoo com question index qid aayf r now i know it all boils down to individual personalities there are attractive brunettes chinese women and latins who would give you as hard a time but it's about a mathematical probability question do blondes win over them hands down mainly due to the media popularity has the media projected them to be the ideal for male sexuality this is not to deny another fact about their sluttiness quotient i'm not saying blondes are not approachable but brunettes and others just can't get even a fraction of the popularity that blondes do blondes are rarely ignored right all i ever hear about now is how guys prefer brunettes and blondes are overrated see your first answer i think the media popularity is starting to hurt blonde's appeal the media shows blonde women non stop and women become convinced this is the ideal so we have millions of women dying their hair blonde which is another major point the vast majority of blondes are not natural and as a natural blonde i believe that the bleached blondes are the ones that keep these stereotypes alive not real blondes i'm just generalizing of course but women grow up believing blonde is best and when they achieve this hair color it's a whole new world to them and they want to take full advantage of it blonde's original appeal was the novelty only about or of the world population is naturally blonde when women started copying what they saw on tv and what was perceived as the ideal blonde lost some of it's appeal i guess dying the hair blonde can be seen as a cry for attention and men pick up on this and see easy prey hence the stereotype of blondes being easy but to answer the question i don't think blondes necessarily have more attitude the answerer in the question you posted sounds like she's years old so don't take it too seriously blondes are assumed to act a certain way and some women act the part out without even realizing it in the end though hair color is irrelevant people are individuals and we really shouldn't generalize people by how they look even though we just did Gender role Blonde on Blonde Blond Aristasia Species Sexual attraction Sexual orientation Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Theory of conduct Physical attractiveness The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Joke Hair Doomsday argument The Ashlee Simpson Show The Inside Abortion debate Scientific method Fischer Random Chess Gender-neutral language Aerial (dance move) Theodicy Bayesian inference Ontological argument IP (complexity) Reservoir Dogs Normal distribution Fast bowling Reality Epistemology White (people) Sudoku Avenue Q CPU cache ELO rating system Kasparov versus The World Expert system Friends Serial killer Butch and femme Villain Kylie Minogue Many-worlds interpretation Biology and sexual orientation Homosexuality and Christianity Economic inequality Social rule Homophobia Plame affair Violin Human Cultural relativism Sub-Zero Ra (board game) Skinhead Monty Python Saved by the Bell Extreme Programming Volleyball Altruism Internet troll Esperanto as an international language Table tennis Simone Weil Postmodernism Homestar Runner Infantilism The Origin of Species Philosophy of language Halting problem The nature of God in Western theology Black (people) Tic-Tac-Dough Prices of production Madonna (entertainer) Creation-evolution controversy U.S. Electoral College A Course In Miracles Phaedo Goodness and value theory Hair color Franz Boas Plurality electoral system Colonial mentality Bisexuality Pedophilia Advertising Psychology Equal Protection Clause Turing test
