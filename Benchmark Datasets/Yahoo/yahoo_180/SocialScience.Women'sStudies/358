love security deficiency drive critical analasys love and marriage main topic is it the other person you love or is it the love of security that made you want to get got married there is no right or wrong answer here sometimes it's just fun thought provoking to look at things in a different way have you ever wanted to get married but had nobody in mind to marry do you need the title of 'married' to prove your love if so to who do you think you and your partner would grow apart if you weren't married why do you feel your bond with your partner will get stronger if you get married or for those who are married did it get stronger when you got married do you think it's possible that for many people a big reason they seek marriage is due to a deficiency of security within themselves especially non religious have you ever really thought about it in depth or just gone with the flow when that's just what you're supposed to do when you love someone like that get married oh this isn't for a paper or anything just throwing out some qs and see what other people think i wanted to get married and have a family since i was a little girl took a little while to find him no you don't need the title to prove you love your spouse in fact you should have to prove your love to anyone they should either just accept it or not getting married for me was a great way to pledge my love to my husband and give him of me for always i don't think so i married my soul mate so either way i think we would have been bound by fate the bond w my husband got stronger as more time was spent together as anything else does being married definitely helps becuase we're together every day but i don't see how that relationship growth would be any different for couples who never marry but who live together for a long time yes and no i think that in today's society a lot of people get married for the wrong reasons and its too easy to get out of it look at the statistics it's something crazy like of marriages do not last i thought in depth because if when i got married i wanted it to be the one and only time i wanted to marry the right man and i believe i did to go with the flow in making such a life altering decsion isn't fair to yourself or the person your marrying interesting topic paper by the way i just hope you don't turn too many heads with your analysis remember to be subjective Polyamory Same-sex marriage Human sexual behavior Divorce Theory of conduct Sexual orientation Polygamy Social rule Eastern Orthodox Church One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Jon Secada Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Friedrich Schleiermacher Love Time Out of Mind Friends Married... with Children Days of our Lives Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Sexual abstinence Same-sex marriage in Canada Philosophical skepticism Incest Age disparity in sexual relationships Another World (TV series) Bondage (BDSM) Civil unions in the United Kingdom S__ren Kierkegaard Jean Grey Meaning of life Shaggy dog story W.
