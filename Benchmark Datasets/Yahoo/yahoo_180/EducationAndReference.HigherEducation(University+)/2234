getting into med school so basically i started of being a bio major in hopes of going into pharmacy after realizing my chemistry is not strong and did horribly in the class i'm switching to public health policy in pursuit of going into medical administration ever since i was little i always wanted to be a pediatrician and lately i'm pondering about medical school i know it's not something you can change your mind about back and forth but basically my question is if i finish my bachelor's degree in public health then do the required course work i e chem physics stuff that i have taken not taken and recieved bad grades and take the mcat along with volunteering and so on is it possible for me to get into med school you can major in basket weaving and go to medical school as long as you take the required basic sciences you can't avoid the chemistry biology etc however it will be difficult to get into medical school without acceptable grades also volunteering isn't a requirement i'm a physician and i got my undergraduate degree in psychology Medical school Doctorate Master's degree Physician Chinese University of Hong Kong Education in the United States Pharmacist Medicine Chiropractic Graduate school Science University of Connecticut University of Maryland Baltimore County Physical therapy Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences Georgetown University Northeastern University, Boston Medical College Admission Test Far Eastern University Pharmacy Columbia University Florida State University Education in Australia Transsexuality University of Michigan Oregon State University University of Coimbra Traditional Chinese medicine Education in Taiwan British degree abbreviations Education in Germany Advanced Placement Program Bachelor of Arts University of Central Florida University of Santo Tomas Graduate Record Examination Education in Japan Australian National University Medical University of South Carolina University of California, Irvine Virginia Commonwealth University Stevens Institute of Technology SAT Homeopathy Education in the People's Republic of China Software engineering Open access Furman University Drug abuse Tufts University Degrees of Oxford University Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Abortion Psychology University of Tennessee University of Indonesia Western Kentucky University Publicly funded medicine Clinical depression Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Law school Cornell University College admissions Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Intelligent design movement Brown University University of M__nster Emergency Medical Services Health insurance Temple University Rutgers College Dublin City University Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Physics Education Alternative medicine __cole Polytechnique Numerus clausus Ethics University of California, Los Angeles W.
