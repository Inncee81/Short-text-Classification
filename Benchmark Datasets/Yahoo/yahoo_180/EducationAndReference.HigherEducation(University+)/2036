help understanding college semester in college are the classes that you take the second semester the same as the classes that you take the first semester like in high school that you take the a part in the fall and the b part in the spring or do you take different classes the second semester thanks for your help in a way yes in college many of the courses you take will build upon courses you've already taken that said each course is also a stand alone course of its own too they almost always are considered separate courses an example you'll likely be required to take two semesters of english in one you'll learn all about writing academic papers and in the other you'll learn all about interpreting what you read and some literature they follow onto each other and may even be taught by the same professor but they are different classes you can't take the second one until you pass the first you can't take higher english courses until you've passed both another example might be history if you were to take two freshman level american history courses one will be from or so and the other would be from or so to present you don't even really have to take them in order sciences same deal you might take biology i in the fall and follow it with biology ii in the spring they'll probably have different professors but one follows the other and in this case you'd have to take them in order all of that said you don't have to take things back to back like this all of the time you could take american history ii in your first fall and take american history i three years later personally i like to take sequenced courses close together it keeps the related information fresh other people like to switch up and have some change because they get bored with four straight semesters of history when they aren't a history major one of the great things about college is that you get to make those decisions just make sure that you get your lower level classes out of the way early so that you will have met prerequisites for upper levels before you need to take them have fun go learn cool stuff Graduate school Education in the United States Juris Doctor Professor Education in Germany Massachusetts Institute of Technology Academic term Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania College Advanced Placement Program University of Houston Education in Portugal Hopkins School American University Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Hunter College High School Brown University A-level Education in Taiwan American and British English differences Education in Hong Kong University of Massachusetts Amherst United States Air Force Academy Columbia College of Columbia University Intelligent design movement Northeastern University, Boston Secondary education in the United States Community college Dublin City University Medical school Physician Education in Australia Connecticut College Law school University of Maryland Baltimore County NUS High School of Mathematics and Science High school University of Central Florida Master's degree Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in Sweden Cornell University Experiential education Jewish studies Lawyer Pitzer College University of Tennessee Franklin W.
