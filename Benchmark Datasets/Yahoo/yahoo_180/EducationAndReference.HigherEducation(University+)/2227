the graduate from suny albany with a bio premed degree how will this look is suny albany well regarded new york is odd in the sense it does not have a flagship university like many states do flordia georgia alabama etc this is why many have not heard about it however anyone familar with the suny program knows that suny schools are good quality not the toughest standards but ny has alot of schools being from new york i've been sunyified i toured albany i thought it was great binghamton was my favorite because of proximity to home so i may be a little biased towards it sry if i am new york also only has big univ buf bing albany and stony brook so albany is one of the better schools in ny especially for their bio program my younger borther seriously considering going there for biology ironic enough albany is not the best univ new york has binghamton has tougher admissions requirements see i couldnt resist but i believe its requirements are the second hardest out of the univ as having to retour everything with my borther and seeing the admission requirements so as far as the suny program you picked one of the best schools so if anyone doubts the univ you went to as good that could be why but also as long as your gpa was good and maybe some pre med tests i was genetics so i know little about medical stuff you should be fine Stony Brook University State university University at Albany Medical school Binghamton University University at Buffalo State University of New York at Cortland State University of New York Maritime College Purchase College Upstate New York Middle Tennessee State University Binghamton, New York Education in the United States Statutory college Graduate school Affirmative action University of Alabama College admissions Associate's degree Law school Sigma Nu Juris Doctor Alpha Epsilon Pi Cortland County, New York Master's degree Physician College rivalry Georgetown University SAT Brooklyn Technical High School University of Connecticut Cornell University Albany, New York University of the State of New York Law School Admissions Test Syracuse University Alpha Phi Sea grant colleges Medicine Education in Hong Kong University of California, San Diego College town New York Stuyvesant High School University of Southern California Georgia Institute of Technology Education in Romania University of California, Riverside Test (student assessment) Long Island Education in Germany Education in the People's Republic of China University of Mississippi University of Michigan Georgia Public Broadcasting Monroe Community College Software engineering Education in Portugal Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Education in Australia Laura Schlessinger Leo Strauss University of Tennessee United States Air Force Academy American Broadcasting Company University of California, Irvine New York State College of Human Ecology Graduate Record Examination Broome County, New York Albany County, New York University of Massachusetts Amherst Pennsylvania State University Intelligent design movement University of Maryland Baltimore County College football American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) United States Naval Academy Stevens Institute of Technology International League University of Georgia Bilkent University Hudson River Johns Hopkins University Chinese University of Hong Kong James S.
