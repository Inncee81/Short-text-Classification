drafting degree i need to get work in the us but most jobs in my area ask for a 'drafting degree' being a uk designer i followed city guilds as there's no such thing as a uk drafting degree am i going to be redundant in the us due to this different perspective i cant answer as to your job prospects in the us but if by 'drafting' you mean 'draughting' ie the technical drawings of designs then the ucas website lists all higher education courses in the uk and they have draughting courses listed under computer aided draughting http search ucas co uk cgi bin hsrun search search stateid rag ygqxwecexljbte n yzxrxsvg tjz hahtpage search hskeywordsuggestion wherenext query word computing aided draughting single n also i'm studying for a product design degree now and we've been taught how to draw up the technical drawings for our designs so that may be another option if you want to spend years studying however and i'm only supposing if you are already working as a designer you may still have plenty of experience to offer a company in the us and it therefore may be worthwhile to apply to positiions esp as i've been told i may never actually need to do the technical drawings for my designs myself in the future that may be the case in at least some companies in the us good luck UCAS City and Guilds of London Institute Education in Portugal Graduate school Software engineering College admissions Master's degree Uniform Resource Locator Education in the People's Republic of China College Education in Germany Attorney at Law IB Diploma Programme Leaving Certificate Statistics HTTP cookie Juris Doctor Game programmer Outsourcing Apprenticeship Professor Common Unix Printing System Computer-aided design XML Conscription Capitalism Economic inequality Education in the United States Intelligent design Draught beer Education in Hong Kong Education in Australia Engineering BASIC programming language Expert system PLATO Species Technical drawing Doctorate Associate's degree Old Dominion University Higher (Scottish) Logic Database University of Maryland Baltimore County Academia Law school Education in Sweden Harvey Mudd College Advanced Placement Program Massachusetts Institute of Technology Google Working animal Domain Name System Electronic commerce PE ratio Electrical engineering Uniting Church in Australia Bernard Williams Bass guitar Junior Certificate Student loan System administrator Seneca College Psychology Whois Bachelor of Arts Copy protection Microeconomics Patent Ebook Open University Medicine Bologna process Trinity College, Dublin Little Britain High school Medical school Contract Inflation Perl Unemployment California Polytechnic State University Scholarship Computer science Computer-supported collaboration Reiki Transport Layer Security Database management system Computer animation Dublin City University Graphics Science Community college Savannah College of Art and Design Central processing unit Search engine Education
