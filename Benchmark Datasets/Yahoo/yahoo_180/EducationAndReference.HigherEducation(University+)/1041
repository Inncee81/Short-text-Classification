how are the universities in austin i want to finish my undergraduate degree in austin i know u of texas is a great school in austin but i am not positive i have the grades to get it are any of the other universities in austin good can you tell me anything you know about them thanks i live in austin so between my various friends have found out how good bad some of the schools are ut very brand namish i e if you state you went to ut there's instant recognizability but it comes with the price of becoming just a number within the students and having to pay really high tuition costs i have two friends that went there one is really enjoying her time there but then again she's more of a party girl the other is a guy who said that if he could start it all over her would've gone elsewhere since he felt so impersonal there those are the two biggest pro's con's that i've heard from there st edwards well known liberal arts school with a class size usually in the or less but it comes with an enormous tuition cost per full semester i knew somebody that went there but ended up having to transfer because of the high costs if you're major is in liberal arts it would be a great school to attend is what i remember them mentioning concordia a private lutheran school that has all the qualifies of a small university and unlike other church schools you do not have to live there as a requirement i know somebody that's going there right now and they love their business program there only thing is the courses are in an accelerated mode meaning each class lasts only one month and the most you can take is one class per month plus it's per class but the price comes with the textbook the class sizes are also or less and you are with the same students throughout your entire degree hope this helps p s i went to txstate in san marcos which is a great school imo all the best benefits of a major university without the high cost or ridiculous number of students Graduate school Education in the United States Education in Germany Education in Australia Education in Taiwan Tuition Student loan Kwantlen University College Education in the People's Republic of China California Polytechnic State University Lawyer Brigham Young University Grade (education) Concordia University Middle Tennessee State University Juris Doctor Brown University Community college College Washington University in St. Louis Affirmative action University of Houston Education in Portugal Law school Education in Hong Kong University of Michigan No Child Left Behind Act Intelligent design movement Education in Japan Culture of the United States University of Toronto GED __cole Polytechnique University of Texas at Austin Temple University Education in Romania Education in France Pennsylvania State University Professor University of Notre Dame Price discrimination Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Franklin W.
