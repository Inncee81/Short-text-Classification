community college so i waited to long and changed my mind so many times that im stuck going to a small commuity college for at least a year i hated high school i was really shy and i hated being called on is community college gonna be any different from highschool i strongly recommend community college it is different from high school don't consider yourself stuck you may find that you like the classes more and are more motivated to participate in class after graduating from a community college i am thinking about taking a few more classes there i am familliar with the lay out of the campus and the cost of classes might not be as much as a year school community college is a good way to get your feet wet i wish you the best of luck it took me a long time to get my associates degree but am glad that i have it i know that you weren't asking that but stick with it Community college College Education in the United States Graduate school High school Sydney Riot of 1879 Carnegie Mellon University Secondary education University of Central Florida University of Alabama Miami Dade College University of Houston Jennifer Lopez University of Maryland, College Park GED Education in Australia Education in Romania Salt Lake Community College Dartmouth College Can't Hardly Wait Education in Germany Cornell University Georgetown University Middle Tennessee State University College of William and Mary Massachusetts Institute of Technology Georgia Institute of Technology Western Kentucky University Brown University Mapua Institute of Technology Law school The Citadel (Military College) Christian Brothers University University of North Texas Medical school University of California, Santa Cruz Secondary education in France Baruch College Seneca College Franklin W.
