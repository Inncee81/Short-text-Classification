stay at baruch college or go to indiana university what should i do i can either stay at baruch college and graduate on time with a gpa which is ok or i can graduate from indiana university a year to a year and a half later be a couple of thousand in debt but i would automatically have more opportunity in getting into a top mba program when i'm older what should i do thanks indiana university is top nationally ranked for business undergrad i get to restart my gpa at and eventually get a over there if i stay at baruch i'll graduate with a i messed up freshman year and indiana is going to be mostly free my mom reported k last year the only pitfall really is that i would graduate about a year late worst case scenario a year and a half late baruch is ok but i think graduating with a at indiana university would give me immediate clout in getting a really good job to start which would naturally lead to a much better oppourtunity to get into nyu columbia for my mba thoughts comments suggestions appreciated it is really up to you but you are right to think that someone with a degree from indiana has a better shot at getting into a top mba program than someone from cuny but if you have the right work experience the baruch degree won't hurt you that much indiana is a much better school but only you can decide if that difference is worth an extra year as for getting to start your gpa over that is a myth any b school you apply to will want your transcript from baruch as well as indiana the good news is that your gpa will be fine at any school gpa is less important for getting into an mba program than in getting into an academic program a or better is all you need as long as everything else is high quality Grade (education) Master of Business Administration Baruch College Graduate school Stern School of Business Babson College Education in Germany Washington University in St. Louis University of Notre Dame City University of New York Education in the United States University of Southern California Ross School of Business Columbia University University of Central Florida Purdue University University of Michigan University of Tennessee Queen's School of Business College admissions Master's degree University of Connecticut Law school Middle Tennessee State University New York University Pennsylvania State University National Certificate of Educational Achievement Florida State University Affirmative action Medical school State university Chinese University of Hong Kong The Citadel (Military College) Athabasca University Belmont Abbey College Arizona State University University of Houston Alfred Kinsey Georgetown University DePaul University Quizbowl University of California, Santa Barbara University of Georgia University of California, San Diego Rollins College Caldwell College Student loan Bretton Woods system Ivy League New Trier High School University of California, Riverside Regent University Intelligence quotient Emory University University of Maryland, College Park University of California, Berkeley Leiden University Indiana University Bloomington Johns Hopkins University Saint Joseph's University College and university rankings Cornell University Rice University Harvard Business School Texas A&M University University of Florida Tianjin University Western Michigan University Juris Doctor Auburn University Education in Romania Temple University University of Idaho Software engineering MIT Sloan School of Management Georgia Institute of Technology University of California, Los Angeles Indiana State University The College of New Jersey Academic degree Marshall School of Business Florida Institute of Technology Florida International University Education in Australia Professor Education in Japan Wilfrid Laurier University Education in the People's Republic of China Law School Admissions Test Bilkent University Strategic management Bowl Championship Series Bobby Knight University of Alabama Northwestern University Stevens Institute of Technology
