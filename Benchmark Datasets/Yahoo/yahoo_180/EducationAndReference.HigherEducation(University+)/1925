online college vs traditional classroom college i just earn credits in months at an online college i was just curious how many you can earn at a traditional college in months i didn't know if earning these many credits was normal or can you get more credits in months at a regular classroom college i'm trying to get my teaching degree by taking classes online how do you feel about online classes vs traditional college what are the advantages and disadvantages when it comes to credits and obtaining your degree has anyone had any problems with online classes or anything to add to what the others have posted it's up to you how many hours you earn in a semester or a quarter i attended schools with both semester and quarter hours in quarter hours quarters yr i always took classes a quarter quarter hours in semesters semesters yr i would take classes a semester to semester hours online courses are not easy in spite of how easy it seems as the other person posted you have to be self motivated it's all too easy to blow off a regular schedule when working in an online environment because there's nothing no one to push you to sit down on a regular basis and do your work like any higher ed course work you fall behind you're doomed in a traditional setting you have to answer for your lack of work when you meet for classes but not so in online that's the biggest issue with online classes pushing yourself if you are highly motivated and disciplined you'll fly through classes the only thing holding you back will be the number of classes you can take per term if the school is accredited there is no difference in online and traditional good luck Education in the United States Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Community college Chiropractic Education in Taiwan Professor Franklin W.
