do biochemistry majors make more then biology majors i considering both majors and am premed however given the strong possibility that i won't get into med school off the bat and might not want to go on to graduate school to get a masters or phd which of those majors is more marketable or commands a higher starting salary what kinds of jobs can biology or biochemistry get with just a bachelors degree i have a biochemistry degree and currently work as a chemist some of my coworkers have biology degrees if you are a biology major with an emphasis in biochemistry you will take a lot of the same classes as a biochemistry major so will be pretty much equal for applying for jobs for me i had to take physical chemistry and bio majors didn't have to so that is probably the only area where i would have an advantage over a bio major Chinese University of Hong Kong Graduate school Biochemistry Education in Portugal Education in the United States Physician Master's degree Chemistry Degrees of Oxford University University of Santo Tomas Medical school Pharmacist British degree abbreviations Novosibirsk State University Memorial University of Newfoundland Education in Australia Georgetown University Doctorate University of Connecticut Soil science California Institute of Technology Education in Germany University of Notre Dame Bachelor of Arts Biology Oregon State University Stevens Institute of Technology Science __cole Polytechnique Chiropractic Florida Institute of Technology Medicine Biophysics Education in Taiwan Cornell University Graduate School Doctor of Philosophy Australian National University Harvey Mudd College University of Coimbra University of M__nster Software engineering Theoretical chemistry Linus Pauling University of Pennsylvania Drew University Smith College University of Central Florida University of Victoria Education in Hong Kong Hartwick College Johns Hopkins University Homeopathy Carlos Bustamante Rudolf Steiner Education in the People's Republic of China University of Maryland Baltimore County Atomic mass unit Florida State University Physical therapy Simon Fraser University Ball State University Denison University Massachusetts Institute of Technology University of S__o Paulo Academic degree Professor Artificial life Heidelberg College Economic inequality Pharmacy Carleton University Rutgers College Protein Computational chemistry Molecular biology Fachhochschule Lomonosov Gold Medal Far Eastern University Seneca College Max-Planck-Gesellschaft IB Group 4 subjects The College of New Jersey Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences Tufts University School of Medicine and Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences Alternative biochemistry Education in Japan Nuclear magnetic resonance Tianjin University History of chemistry Labor theory of value W.
