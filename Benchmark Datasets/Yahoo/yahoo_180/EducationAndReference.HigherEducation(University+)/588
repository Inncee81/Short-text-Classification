university help basically my freshmen year in highschool was bad i got c's b's and d now im gonna be a sophmore im gonna try my hardest because i used to get a's n b's and im gonna do that again so what im sayin is if i got a's anf b's the next years of high school could i still get a scholarship to a university because my mom said i cant and no college will except me is this true will i have no future you know many college admissions people understand that the first year of any school high school or college can be stressful and because you are so overwhelmed by so many things it's plausible for grades to suffer they are looking to see that your grades go up if in your next years especially your grades shoot up and stay up they will know that you had a minor blip the first year and will not give as much weight to it as your other years' grades so don't give up as for the scholarships note that not all are based on academics you should research them and see ones that pertain specifically to you i e financial need etc finally if you are serious about getting into college then prove your mom wrong study hard stay focused and it helps to develop a good rapport with a teacher in case you need his her letter of recommendation for college scholarships etc good luck and study hard Graduate school Grade (education) Education in Romania Education in the United States Law school College admissions Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany College High school A-level Student Trinity College, Dublin Advanced Placement Program The Sims 2: University Education in Japan Scholarship SAT Boston Public University of California, San Diego GED University of Central Florida Brown University Education in Portugal Doctor of Philosophy Education Bernard Williams Education in Hong Kong Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology College and university rankings Medical school Massachusetts Institute of Technology Harvard University Secondary education in France Education in Finland Juris Doctor Secondary education in Japan Community college Education in Singapore Franklin W.
