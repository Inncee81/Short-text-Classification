how do we integrate new faculty members into our department due to circumstances beyond our control my department has been spread out over three buildings on campus in the past few years in particular most of the new hires have ended up physically isolated from the rest of the department the result of this has been the development of a strong clique among this group mostly young phds but a few ms level instructors they vote in block on most issues and often feed off of one another's insecurities we've had numerous cases of unfounded fears escalating to ridiculous levels on the positive side they do support one another well when needed my concern is how do we make them part of the whole department rather than the sub departmental unit they're becoming they'll all be coming up for tenure over the next several years i think the first ones are in ' ' and i have some concern that their alliances won't work in their favor at that time i'm with the other poster in that you should try having them over for dinner and being friendly with them on an individual basis outside of work first and encourage other department members to do so as well this can help cut out the feeding off of one another's insecurities and promote friendships or at least civility between members rather than cliques what about meeting every week or month for coffee take a little out of the department budget for coffee and snacks and free food rarely fails as an incentive don't turn this into an extra department meeting though then people won't want to come and it will change the atmosphere maybe occasionally invite departmental majors students then it could become a social bonding event for the entire department not just the faculty plan events together talk to the new comers about what they're interested in and support them in maybe creating an event class or something along those lines you know how to work the system that is getting anything done at a university better than they do by supporting them once or twice in various endeavors you are not only helping them integrate into the department but the university as well by lending your time tested legitimacy to any of their projects another problem is simply thinking of the situation as alliances and subdivisions while it may seem that way when it comes down to it you are all one department with the similar goals of teaching researching if people think and talk of the department in such terms it can splinter the department further there will always be differing points of view and drama within departments focus on the individual one on one relationships and the department as a whole and it might at least ease whatever tension and lack of community is present Graduate school Professor Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in the People's Republic of China Franz Boas Single Transferable Vote Education in the United States Hillary Rodham Clinton American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Cyprus dispute Consensus decision-making Intelligent design movement A Course In Miracles Carnegie Mellon University Trinity College, Dublin Martial art Stuttering Alcoholics Anonymous Experiential education Chinese University of Hong Kong Democratic Party (United States) Strategic management Supply-side economics Rice University Students' union Aikido Doctor of Philosophy Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Franklin W.
