can anyone answer my questions i am an a level student about to get my a level results in a few days time i had to get bcc to get into the course of my choice but for various reasons i had to drop a subject meaning to get into the course of my choice i would have to get straight a's this is not possible for me due to my as results i am expected to get grades c and d what i want to know is is there any hope that the university of my choice will take me or are these grades just too far below expected i know deep down i've been unlucky these last two years and if i had chosen different subjects would have gained higher grades also i want to do a teacher training degree and was wondering if there will be any teacher training degree available through clearing i'd phone the uni now and explain the situation to the admissions tutor with mitigating circumstances they may take you and will probably respond with a bit more understanding if you take the initiative and warn them before results day can your school write a letter of support teacher training courses will be available through clearing get a copy of the times on results day and make a list of unis to call and their numbers from the ucas handbook call the the uni you applied to first then your reserve choice then down through the list of the other you applied unis are more to keen to take people through clearing if they have at least applied to the uni in the past because they have a lower drop out rate above all try not to worry it is actually easier to get into your first choice of uni than your school tells you i think all of my friends in school got into their first choice of uni and i don't think any of us achieved our predicted grades or even the entry requirements UCAS A-level Education in Portugal SAT Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in the United States College admissions Secondary education in France Leaving Certificate College Standardized testing Education in Malaysia Sexual orientation Microeconomics Economics High school No Child Left Behind Act Teacher Unemployment Social rule Education in Romania Scientology beliefs and practices CPU cache Education in Germany Education in Sweden Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Charles William Eliot Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Professor Education in Austria ELO rating system Species Education in Taiwan Affirmative action Alexander Technique Education in Japan Theory of conduct Higher (Scottish) Test (student assessment) Secondary education in Japan Charter school Independent school (UK) Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Advanced Placement Program Higher education in Japan Prostate cancer Education in Singapore University of Bristol Goodness and value theory Past teachings of Prem Rawat Medical school Lawyer Education in Scotland Expert system Physician Password Tai Chi Chuan Graduate Record Examination MP3 Massachusetts Institute of Technology Doctor of Philosophy Coercion City and Guilds of London Institute Aikido The Sims 2: University Jacobo Arenas Bayesian inference Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination Tertiary education fees in Australia Normal distribution Appeal Milton H.
