is it good to bring a computer to art school i'm going into my senior year of high school and i'm very set on going to an art college and studying graphic design i need a new computer anyway so i'm switching to the mac to both familiarize myself with it and hopefully bring it to college so i want to know is it even practical to bring my computer to art school i've looked up computer requirements at some of the schools i'm looking at and they mostly say that students aren't required to bring one because they already have them there but is it a good idea to have my own anyway and if so is it better to have a laptop or desktop please no don'tswitch teh mac apple sux because that has nothing to do with my question they'll have computers in the labs classrooms and libraries that doesn't take care of your need in the hallway last minute assignment finishing the dorm emailing friends and ims or mcdonalds can't stop working on homework to eat because the assignment is due at tomorrow morning for graphic design the power on a desktop is a lot of help but the portability of a laptop may outweigh that the mac will be essential for many of your courses the artist standard machine is a mac and that's the software you're going to have to use i'd say the laptop will get more use than a desktop and provide better support for you education the real expense isn't the computer though be prepared to drop some bucks on software this is why many people use the labs a full version set of adobe cs is some major money as are most high end cad applications without that software on your machine the homework angle is moot Apple Macintosh Computer Laptop Windows XP IBM PC compatible OpenGL AmigaOS Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows Floppy disk Apple typography Mouse (computing) GED Microprocessor History of the graphical user interface Apple Intel transition Atari ST X Window System Apple IIGS Mach kernel Linux IPod Pretty Good Privacy Apple Computer Theory of conduct Desktop publishing Mac OS University of Massachusetts Amherst PowerPC Personal computer PostScript Wi-Fi Supercomputer PNG Hard disk Computer virus Opera (web browser) Universal Serial Bus Operating system IMac Atari 8-bit family WebObjects Java programming language Bluetooth Screenshot Timeline of computing 1990-forward Education in the United States Musical Instrument Digital Interface Sun Microsystems OpenOffice.org Acorn Computers FireWire System 7 (Macintosh) NeXT Mac OS X v10.4 Graphic design Macintosh Finder Perl Microsoft Mac OS history Stardock Franklin W.
