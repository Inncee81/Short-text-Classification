am i shooting too high college wise i'm the average student who when it comes to math and science is mostly a b c student history english and all my other major classes is where i get the a's all my classes next year senior year are pretty tough classes including ap human geography it's been my dream since i was and knew what college was to go to yale or brown honestly i know it's stupid to think i can get in but is it worth it to try anyway or should i give up now i should mention that the reason i did bad in math was because my teacher treated the class like it was review not like we were just learning it which we were and she didn't leave time for extra help for science it was just because i can't learn something in a day and have a quiz on it the next don't fret too much college admissions at a top university is more than just good grades sat's essays extracirriculars community service etc are just as important as grades and gpa seeing that you're just an average student set on yale or brown i'd say you're shooting a bit high but don't let that get you down work your butt off for it and you never know you could really get in and just so you know it's not the end of the world if you don't get accepted for freshman year just go to another college make good grades and apply to transfer to yale brown next fall i've always heard that it's easier to get into a top university as a transfer student than applying as a new student for freshman year i wish you the best of luck don't give up on your dreams Grade (education) Education in the United States SAT Education in Taiwan Graduate school College admissions Student Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Education in Romania University of Central Florida GED College Advanced Placement Program Harvard University Test (student assessment) High school California Polytechnic State University Quizbowl Middle Tennessee State University Brown University Education in Germany Secondary education in the United States Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Belmont Abbey College Trinity College, Dublin Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lynbrook High School A-level University of Connecticut The Citadel (Military College) Education in Hong Kong Stuyvesant High School Law school Bowdoin College Education in Singapore New Trier High School Princeton University Education in the People's Republic of China National Certificate of Educational Achievement Johns Hopkins University Hunter College High School Numerus clausus Yale Law School University of Michigan The Sims 2: University Education in Malaysia Theory of conduct UCAS Franklin W.
