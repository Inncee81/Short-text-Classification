does it look bttr to go to a year university or art school im majoring in graphic design does it look bttr to go to a year university or a specialized art school like the art institute my mom wants me to go to a reg university b c she thinks it will look bttr the art institute is the only school i've ever really wanted to attend right now im community college i have one more year to decide plz help for graphic design a specialized art and design is more appropriate i went to school for interior design and before i left for college i knew someone who was going to cornell to be a vet they said how i was just going to art school blah blah blah well i'm the one laughing now each year design intelligence magazine among other places ranks interior design architecture and industrial design schools they put out a book about the top ten schools in each of these categories annually and it is a very competitive among the schools anyway last year the year i graduated while the university of cincinnati came in first my school came in second and cornell came in third and that isn't the only year my school has beaten out most of the universities it is a very well known and revered school in art and design because that is the reason for the existence of the school and they work very hard to remain on the cutting edge of art and design and have a reputation for doing so so my point is universities and ivy leagues aren't always all they're cracked up to be schools like r i s d pratt institute f i t end up being the better schools in this case because that is what they exist for to teach art and design and the reason they have been around so long is because they consistently turn out talented educated artists and designers they were the schools who invented many of these programs and degrees which the universities have since adopted just do some research on school rankings and history of their programs schools you'll find enough proof in those facts which should help your mother understand Cornell University University of Michigan Education in the United States Ivy League Columbia University Harvard University Education in Portugal Education in Australia University of Pennsylvania Johns Hopkins University College and university rankings University of Central Florida Graduate school University of Alabama Florida State University High school University of Southern California Trinity College, Dublin The College of New Jersey Juris Doctor University of Virginia Duke University Boston College Oregon State University University of Cincinnati Pennsylvania State University American University University of Washington York University Architect University of Connecticut Yale University Education in the People's Republic of China Tianjin University Statutory college Carnegie Mellon University Education in Taiwan Brown University University of Wisconsin Temple University Grade (education) Education in Singapore University of California, Los Angeles Vanderbilt University Public Ivies University Physician Chinese University of Hong Kong University of Notre Dame Rice University Cooperative education Education in Romania Intelligent design movement University of Chicago Oxbridge rivalry Big East Conference University of North Carolina at Charlotte University of Florida University of Toronto Art school University of California, San Diego Iggy Pop North Carolina State University Christian Brothers University Texas A&M University Tai Chi Chuan California Polytechnic State University Tulane University Stanford University GED Affirmative action Northeastern University, Boston Kansas State University Georgia Institute of Technology University of Oregon Phillip E.
