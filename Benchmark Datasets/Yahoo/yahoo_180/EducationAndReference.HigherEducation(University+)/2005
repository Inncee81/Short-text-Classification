i am starting a pharm d program in weeks does anyone have any advice the program is an accelerated year year round curriculum and i would like to do well in school but still spend some time with my spouse i think he is worried that i will spend all of my time and energy on the program does anyone have any helpful hints or suggestions on either the schooling part or spending quality time with family thanks for the help my wife did a yr program in ca we were together at the time no big deal if both parties are mature and realistic we still went out on dates and stuff if she needed to study than she told me and that was fine you don't spend your time studying it shouldn't be all that different from college other than you'll be attending school in the summer as well you'll see each other at nite and on the weekends just budget time to go out with your husband as for studying tips make friends you likely won't be good at every subject so if you have a study group of friends you can help each other out exchange notes etc also making friends with older classmates is very helpful as they may pass along better study material or even old exams Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Physician Education in Portugal Homeschooling Education in Hong Kong Education in Australia Education in the United States Juris Doctor Advanced Placement Program Green Day Education in Taiwan High school Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in Germany Graduate school Education in Japan Social rule Education in Sweden Charles Darwin's education Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Charles Haughey Friends Good Times Avenue Q Lawyer The Lovely Bones Stellvia of the Universe Education Victorian Certificate of Education Girls Aloud Stomach cancer Whitney Houston The Family from One End Street Junior Certificate Oasis (band) Caulfield Grammar School Grade (education) Education in England Secondary education in France Education in Singapore Hikikomori Divorce Shaggy dog story Roxette Pennsylvania State University A-level College admissions Prostate cancer Brown University Education in Malaysia Logic Harrow School Sex education Alcoholics Anonymous Hunter College High School Hermione Granger My Parents are Aliens Jumpstart 3rd Grade Connecticut College IB Diploma Programme Education in Austria Garret FitzGerald Affirmative action The Ashlee Simpson Show Hilary Duff For Better or For Worse University of Connecticut History of SNL:1980-1985 SAT Read my lips: no new taxes Martin J.
