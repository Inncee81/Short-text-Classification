when should i buy my books for college i will start college in a few weeks i took courses and i don't know exactly what books and materials i should get well i browsed the college website and found names of textbooks and other related materials for the courses but i'm confused whether i should buy them now or wait until the st class if you don't know the material then you should wait some colleges differ greatly through professors because some professors will post reading material that you need months before school start so you can discuss it when you first start class in this case since you don't know then you should wait and generally the professor will give you a 'green sheet' yes i know its redundant on what items you need my only suggestion is after you know what you need buy them immediately as often they are sold out especially to popular classes or high pact classes you should try looking online for cheaper book prices as online prices are much cheaper but make sure that you will recieve the matierals on time for your first assignment good luck Textbook Legal research RuneScape economy Education in Australia GED Book Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Graduate school College Professor St. John's College, U.
