would it be wise to transfer in my current school i don't have many friends i have a few but i'm not really sure they don't really offer my major and the weather is pretty bad in the school i want to transfer i don't know anyone they don't offer my major and the weather is not as bad but also pretty bad as well should i transfer to a new school just so i can have a new start or should i go back to my old school a lot of questions but i will do my best to me the only good reason to transfer would be for academic reasons a better school or one school has your major and another doesn't to me but to each their own so i am not criticizing the weather is not a good reason to make such an important life decision it seems like you have some friends and every year is different transferring won't magically bring new friends to your door though sometimes we think it will realize that if you transfer you will probably lose some credits and maybe even an entire semester's worth though it is ridiculously late to be thinking of such a decision i am a professor so this is what i would tell you if you were in my office do it if the other college has your major it does not appear they do if you are trying to convince yourself you have not convinced me stay where you are at least until you figure things out to transfer to a school without your major so then you have to transfer again to a school that does admissions offices are going to wonder what is wrong with you good luck Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Education in Germany Social rule Pitaten Time Out of Mind It's Walky! 2000 Australian Grand Prix Luck Nicomachean Ethics Education in the United States Saved by the Bell Philosophical skepticism Goodness and value theory Avenue Q Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Fairly OddParents Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blood on the Tracks Phoebe Halliwell Kender Samuel Goldwyn Intelligent design movement Community college Juris Doctor Good Morning, Vietnam Education in Romania Theodicy Brown University Microeconomics Incarnations of Immortality Friends Breath of Fire III Aladdin (1992 film) Education in Portugal The Ashlee Simpson Show The Amazing Race GED Academic term Daredevil Economics The Apprentice 2 The Bill U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Monty Hall problem Appeal Cornell University Academia Bernard Williams Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Graduate school Tulane University Appeasement The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Discordianism Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Education in the People's Republic of China Socrates Phillip E.
