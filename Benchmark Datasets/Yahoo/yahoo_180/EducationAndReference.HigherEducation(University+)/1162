information technology tell me about it in engineering it in terms of engineering can mean many things it could mean the cad programs you'd be using or the programs which do theoretical testings for stresses or it could be something as simple as integrating networks and computers systems into structures Computer science Computer-aided design Product Lifecycle Management Engineering Database Computer program Computer Management information system Computer security Application-specific integrated circuit Software engineering Computer virus Digital circuit Computer-supported collaboration Embedded system IBM PC compatible Software testing Database management system Integrated circuit Complex system Electronics Forth programming language Computer-aided manufacturing Central processing unit PHP Reverse engineering Expert system Reliability engineering Air Force Research Laboratory Ontology (computer science) Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Computer insecurity Computational chemistry BRL-CAD Stevens Institute of Technology Extreme Programming Field-programmable gate array Revision control Bioinformatics Game engine Speech recognition Spacecraft propulsion Scramjet Computer software CAD data exchange Web crawler Science Cryptography Computer chess Programming language Mathematics Simulation Kernel (computer science) X Window System Calculator Modem Mapua Institute of Technology Acorn Computers Geographic information system Integrated development environment History of computing hardware Systems engineering Genetic algorithm Tier One Ajax (programming) Dynamical system OpenGL Computer bus Information warfare Lisp programming language Space Shuttle program MDAC Xerox Star GNOME Airbus A380 Enterprise content management Debugging Texas Instruments Chinese University of Hong Kong Ada programming language Stress (physics) Digital audio broadcasting Gerald Jay Sussman Regular expression Simple Network Management Protocol ATI Technologies Configuration management Quality control Strogg Pi-calculus Structural engineering Windows 2000 Minicomputer Self-replication Information theory Voice over IP Numerical analysis Analog computer University of Maryland Baltimore County Cheating in Counter-Strike
