admission rejection i just applied to brandeis for masters program and received a rejection letter for admission in can i appeal for admission reconsideration and how should i approach them any suggestions actually they haven't even received all my recommendations yet sorry but appealing is a bad idea that sets up an adversarial relationship and if you win people remember that and if you lose you will no longer have any chance of getting in i was an assoc dean of a grad school and this is a touchy topic with admissions committees you would be better served to ask the fine folks at brandeis how you can improve your chances for next year what you can do to make yourself more 'admissable' Graduate school Louis Brandeis Regents of the University of California v.
