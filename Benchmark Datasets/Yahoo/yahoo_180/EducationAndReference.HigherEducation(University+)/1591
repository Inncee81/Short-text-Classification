having my high school friend as a rommate for college i'm about to go to college and my friend and i got into the same school we're pretty close and we've always hung out we had the same classes in high school and almost all our extra curricular activities were the same we decided to be roommates for college and at first it seemed like an awesome idea it still is but i'd like to know what some people who have gone through the same thing have to say my other friends tell us we'll end up hating each other and all this stuff but i really get along with her and our parents thought it was a great idea when we decided to become roommates what do you think i think that depends on how good of friends you are college will change the both of you a lot it will also be a time when you both discover the little quirks about each other that you didn't know some of them will get on your nerves it's one thing to be friends with someone when you each have another home to go to it's quite another thing when you both live together and have to deal with each other's lives every single day even if your friendship is very strong it might not be strong enough to endure that suggestion try living together in the same room for a week you at her house or she at yours separate the room into two halves and each of you come and go as you like but you both have to sleep in the same room everyday and you both have to share a phone a bathroom the lights etc if this works out then maybe you'll be able to live together if you notice that some of her behavior does get on your nerves or some of yours gets on hers then you're not going to like living together good luck hope this helps Friends Avenue Q EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Rent (musical) Kitchen The Star Wars Holiday Special Columbine High School massacre The Catcher in the Rye Full Metal Panic?
