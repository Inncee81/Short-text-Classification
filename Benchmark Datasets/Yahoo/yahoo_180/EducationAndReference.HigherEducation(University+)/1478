can one get out of devry i'm tryign to help out my friend who for some reaosn chose devry over community college the program he chose is going to cost a shitload of money i'm going to community college and its only costing me a fraction of his tuition now he wants to get out and do what i'm doing he doesn't have a yahoo account so thats why i'm asking for him i wanna help him out and he told me he doesn't know if he can get out of devry his classes started on july th and hes hasn't paid anything yet and is on financial aid or something this guys family is broke and hes working at some damn toy store he can't support his education at devry so would he be able to get out hes still got a few weeks until registration ends for our local community college he should talk to the financial aid office and he should do so immediately since every day can make a difference he needs to find out if there are consequences for dropping out and he shouldn't say anything about going elsewhere remember that unlike the community college devry is a for profit company and they will be more agressive than most about trying to collect whatever money they can whether from him or from the government Student loan Tuition Education in the United States Credit card Mutual fund Education in the People's Republic of China Taxation in the United States Graduate school Enron Corporation The Ashlee Simpson Show Economics Divorce 2003 California recall Price discrimination Privatization Microeconomics Asian financial crisis Avenue Q Value added tax Corporation Elections in the United States Bond James T.
