a close family member told me i should think about it before i spend more in college a close member said i should think about it before i spent any more time in school because i am getting older why would this person say this i am and hopefully i will graduate before i am i have more years to work i think working years is plenty of time to work after i graduate from college she got her associate degree in social work can she be jealous or want to be the first one to get a bachelors in our family nobody has ever went to college in our family maybe she is afraid i will be above her if i have a degree and she doesn't have one she has a weird way of thinking and set double standards she told me i should go to a technical school because i have only credit hours in years another words she called me a dumb ass she talks about going back to college but then she tries to get me to quit what the fuck my family members do not support me so college has been hard for me plus i have a child too any good advice that might cheer me up first off there is no such thing as an associates degree in social work so if that is what she told you she does not know much the lowest level social work degree is a bachelors she may have an associates in human service studies now as for taking time to go through college this is increasingly the norm especially for part time students units in three years sounds like you are averaging units per semester which would be the semesters per year taking no courses in the summers now units is considered part time go over this and you may actually have to pay full time tuition the most units you could have in three years if you went in the summers as well is x semesters however this is a full load if you are working and raising a family so i'd say you can actually feel good if you stay on your present course you will have your aa done in more years if you decide to go on for your ba you might decide to go a bit faster for the next units and plan on finishing in yrs whether your sister is jealous scared or some other underlying emotion is probably true she may know how hard it has been for her and is worried for you your best strategy is to say won't it be great if we can both finish college won't it be great for our kids and our family take the high road da Graduate school Juris Doctor Education in Germany Education in the United States Avenue Q Kwantlen University College Lawyer Education in the People's Republic of China College Education in Australia Tulane University Community college Bologna process One Tree Hill (TV series) Student loan Professor Medical school Physician Grade (education) Education in Romania Bachelor of Arts Social rule Education in Taiwan Master's degree Tuition University of Houston University of Pittsburgh Education in Hong Kong The Citadel (Military College) Economics Chiropractic Academic term High school Students' union Brown University Georgetown University University of Alabama Hey Jude The Catcher in the Rye Social work Associate's degree Nurse Franklin W.
