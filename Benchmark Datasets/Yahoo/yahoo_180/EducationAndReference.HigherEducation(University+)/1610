is there a big difference in law schools long term i'd like to go to a tier school my parents are weary to send me to one and right fully so financially it's a biggggg commitment but the state schools in ny are tier ugh anyone have any facts about going to a tier over a tier that could sway them my mom just doesn't seem to get that you make a ton more going to a better school my lsats are in the range it really depends on what you want to do after law school if you want to work for a large powerful law firm in nyc washington or any other large city then going to a top ranked law school makes a huge difference maybe it shouldn't but it does harvard yale penn nyu columbia stanford and a few others simply dominate the big firms and if you don't go to one of them you won't be offered a job there on the other hand if you want to practice everyday law in a small firm or by yourself it hardly matters at all in fact there is a lot to be said for going to a locally focused law school in new york you will learn a lot more about practicing new york law at brooklyn law school or buffalo than you will at columbia or nyu the national law schools pride themselves in not teaching the nuts and bolts of practice but the so called lesser schools make that their bread and butter finally if you see yourself as a straight litigator especially in something like criminal defense or prosecution well people like that are born more than made your personality your oratorical skills your organizational ability and so forth will count more than the law school you attend but if you might be a litigator practicing anti trust law say which is usually handled at medium to large law firms then you are back in the loop of needing to go to a name school i've had almost years of practice and i am occasionally approached about changing jobs at this point i either have proven myself or i haven't but i still get asked what law school i attended fortunately it is one of the ivy league schools that make certain people feel comfortable kind of stupid at this point but that's the reality whatever you decide i wish you very good luck Ivy League Education in the United States Theory of conduct New York University Attorney at Law Lawyer Yale University Law school Law School Admissions Test Columbia University Plame affair Ruth Bader Ginsburg Law of the People's Republic of China Juris Doctor University of Pennsylvania Extreme Programming Adversarial system Wall Street Slander and libel Affirmative action Stanford University Education in Australia Charter school Strategic management The Apprentice 2 Culture of the United States American Parliamentary Debating Association Exploitation Education in Germany Mediation New York University School of Law Athenian democracy Education in the People's Republic of China College American Football League Buffalo Bills Epistemology Graduate school Unlawful combatant Hillary Rodham Clinton Lincoln-Douglas Debate Social rule Contract Craps Political subdivisions of New York State French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Floppy disk LiveJournal Friends Lawsuit Stern School of Business Philosophical skepticism Shaggy dog story Atheism Milton H.
