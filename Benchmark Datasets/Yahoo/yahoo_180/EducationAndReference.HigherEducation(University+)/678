college applications ok so how do college applications approach extra curricular activities do they just say list activities you have done or do they have a bunch and you fill in bubbles if you did them how do extra curricular activities affect college admission it will depend on the application if they have you fill in buttons then they will have options listed and then you list what years you did them in etc if not they want an attached list but i'll tell you a dirty little secret of college admissions your extra curriculars very rarely influence your admission into the school sure we tell you it does that we want a well rounded student and that it tells us who you are as a person but in reality we might not even look at that page of your application if you don't meet minimal admissions requirements grade wise sat act wise class requirement wise no amount of choir or habitat for humanity is going to get you into the school what we're doing is looking first and foremost is to make sure that you can handle the academic rigors of the institution and your performance in english or calculus tells us that much more effectively than how many years you were secretary of the french club we know that most kids nowadays join clubs to list them on their college applications and the lost list of things you've done impresses no one so don't fret if you've only been active in one or two things and people are telling you that you just don't have enough it's bull and don't assume that your list of outside activities can make up for poor grades because we'll think that you're well rounded if you've created an organization from scratch or did something out of the ordinary with your volunteer work feel free to write about it in your personal statement those are interesting to read otherwise don't fret concentrate on doing well in your academics because that's what really matters Education in the United States Graduate school Juris Doctor Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in Romania Grade (education) Education Secondary education in the United States Brown University High school SAT Law school Advanced Placement Program Franklin W.
