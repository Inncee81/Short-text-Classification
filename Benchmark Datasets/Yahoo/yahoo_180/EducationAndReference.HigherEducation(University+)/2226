fronties in biotechnology what are the key areas in biotech for future developments hello firstly this is not a homework question that i am being lazy about i am organising a seminar at my university on the frontiers of biotechnology this is the up and coming areas that are new and exciting in biotech does anyone have any ideas i was thinking stem cells but they have been around for years now maybe dna methylation i don't need many details i will do the research myself just looking for some interesting topics if you are in research you will know how it is easy to forget what is happening in the world if it is not in your area thanks biotech will definitely be used for environmental remeditation speaking of junk dna i just went to a seminar today about how introns and junk rna is actually not junk at all we need it interesting opens up of our genome just looking at job posting the trend in biology is towards more of a pharmcutical basis maybe a topic about how biotech is making our drugs i remember one of my textbooks even mentioned how they made the drug viagra the idea of weather peoples genomes should be released to insurance angencies biotech is also key in cancer research maybe adult stem cells i havent heard much about them aids research those are all i can think of ohh junk dna how coding this is showing links to our ancestors Gene Stem cell DNA Bioinformatics Human Genome Project Junk DNA Biology HIV Francis Crick Virus Antiviral drug Origin of life Evolution Gene therapy Cell (biology) Genetic engineering RNA interference Apoptosis DNA microarray Central dogma of molecular biology HIV structure and genome Genetically modified food Genomics Human genome Molecular biology Genetics DNA repair Genome Genetic code Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids James D.
