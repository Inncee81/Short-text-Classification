b a or b s for medical school can you still apply for med school with a b a or do you need a b s you don't need a bs you just need to have taken a med school's required list of courses you should check each med school for their specific list but most are very similar to each other here's harvard's list as an example general comments regarding course requirements the committee on admissions considers the level of courses when evaluating academic performance and determining a candidates suitability for medicine we require a strong preparation in the sciences and mathematics basic to medical school studies candidates should take courses that are comparable to courses taken by students majoring in these subjects in the final analysis however it is not the number of years in college or hours in a course but the quality of education and the maturity of the student which determine readiness for medical school at least three years of college work and a baccalaureate degree are required prior to matriculation in medical school required course biology one year with laboratory experience courses taken should deal with the cellular and molecular aspects as well as the structure and function of living organisms advanced placement credits cannot be used to satisfy this requirement upper level courses should be taken if granted advanced placement credits chemistry two years with laboratory experience full year courses in general or inorganic and organic chemistry generally meet this requirement a one semester course in organic chemistry which covers the relevant material supplemented by a semester course in biochemistry may substitute for the traditional year of organic chemistry we will consider other options that adequately prepare students for the study of biochemistry and molecular biology in medical school advanced placement credits which enable a student to take an upper level course may be used to meet one semester of this requirement physics one year advanced placement credits which enable a student to take an upper level course may be used to meet one semester of this requirement mathematics one year of calculus advanced placement credits may satisfy this requirement calculus ab semester calculus bc semesters a course in statistics does not meet this requirement expository writing one year writing skills are important for the study and practice of medicine this requirement may be met with any non science courses that involve substantial experience in expository writing advanced placement credits cannot be used to satisfy this requirement additional requirements for the hst program requirements are the same as above except that calculus including differential equations and one year of calculus based physics in college are required a course in biochemistry is strongly encouraged before matriculation we will consider other course formats or combinations that are sponsored by the undergraduate institution attended and provide equivalent preparation when advanced placement credits used to satisfy portions of the chemistry physics or mathematics requirements noted above scores from the ap examination must be submitted prior to matriculation if these credits are not shown on the college transcript either the scores from the placement examination or a letter from the chairperson of the respective department certifying that the student has met the requirement in question must be submitted if there is doubt about the suitability of advanced placement credits you should contact the faculty associate dean for admissions for approval before final admissions decisions are made in february recommended courses we encourage candidates to complete at least hours in literature languages the arts humanities and the social sciences and become familiar with computers we also recommend honors courses and independent study or research as they offer in depth exploration of an area of knowledge Education Johns
