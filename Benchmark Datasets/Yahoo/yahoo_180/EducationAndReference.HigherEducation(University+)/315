what school supplies am i going to need for college as in notebooks pencils binders etc i've got all the dorm stuff but i'm having trouble figuring out what sorts of stuff i'll actually need for class i'm a physics major so idk if that influences anything or not thanks i have taught from primary school to university when i was younger i greatly enjoyed working with kids especially third graders it is a magical age in primary school the teachers teach study habits and a few tricks like how to have an orderly notebook in jr and sr high more in junior than sr high i checked notebooks telling students they were worth a few points just to make sure they kept notes and had something to study from in university i don't check notebooks i just assume students know what they are doing and do what they feel is best for their style of learning yes with students doing poorly when i give them out of class help i'll ask to see their notebooks and sometimes give them tips on how to take notes so to answer your question get a notebook or section in a binder for every class you take type of notebook the way you feel most comfortable with recycle half used ones that you may have a bunch of pens of different colors and markers scissors a scientific calculator and remembering a little sister of one of my undergraduate friends she was a freshman in university and she had crayolas and a coloring book to get rid of stress Education in the United States Graduate school A Course In Miracles Ludwig Wittgenstein GED Student Education in Romania Quizbowl Franklin W.
