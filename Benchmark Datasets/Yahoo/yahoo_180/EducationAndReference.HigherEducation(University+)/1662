help should i transfer to a different college recently i was accepted to a southern ivy as an undergraduate business major with a dual concentration i'm to make matters worse this will be my th transfer since and i've taken years off from school at my current lesser known university i'll be a senior next year with a gpa not that stellar however i truly believe that a more prestigious degree will help me get better opportunities in business as well as greatly help my chances of acceptance to a prestigious mba program and i'd really like to go to a college that is more nationally known so i can find better jobs in larger cities on the east coast though i believe i'll graduate in years from this school i believe the wait will be worth it as well as the debt am i being foolish or would going to a better school truly make a difference i don't think you are being foolish and congratulations on being admitted i think your thought processes are appropriate your gpa was strong enough to get you admitted and you would then have a degree from a stronger school since you have taken two years off you really haven't lost more than a couple of years so far you still may have trouble getting into the most prestigious mba programs with your gpa but you can get into a decent school and the job search would definitely be easier Graduate school University of Pennsylvania Master of Business Administration Education in the United States Grade (education) Stern School of Business Medical school University of Arizona Education in Portugal University of Central Florida Master's degree Quizbowl Saint Joseph's University University of Michigan College admissions University of Notre Dame Culture of the United States Education in Germany SAT Columbia University Brown University University of Chicago Ross School of Business California Polytechnic State University University of Tennessee Coeducation Education in Australia Emory University Georgetown University Education in Taiwan University of Southern California Associate's degree Juris Doctor Law school Pennsylvania State University Northeastern University, Boston University of California, San Diego Queen's School of Business Academia University of Houston Western Michigan University Chinese University of Hong Kong Miami University Baruch College Doctor of Philosophy College of William and Mary Leiden University University of Maryland, College Park University of Connecticut Seattle University Belmont Abbey College Florida State University University of Alabama Education in the People's Republic of China Stevens Institute of Technology Trinity College, Dublin Duke University University of Cambridge Education in Hong Kong Athabasca University King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals Trinity University (Washington, DC) University of California, Riverside University of Florida Association of MBAs Harvard Business School Degrees of Oxford University Cooper Union College and university rankings Montgomery Blair High School Arizona State University S.C.
