college roomate ok here goes it im going away to college starting in the fall i've never gone away to college before and i just want everything to go as smoothly as possible altho thats not exactly possible i know but i got my roomate assignments the other day im living in a person apartment so i have other roomates and they all seem pretty normal so i was happy about that b c i was really nervous about getting weird roomates now today i get an email from one of them saying that they requested to be roomates with this other guy but it didn't work out and they asked if i could switch with this kid into antoher apartment so he can be with them now im new to this school so i don't want to start any problems and if i say no i feel like they may cause problems for me b c of it but on the other hand i just want to have normal roomates and im afraid i may make the wrong choice if i switch i have a hard time saying no i don't know what to do what does everyone else think they apparently already asked admissions and they said it was ok and on the sheet that tells us our roomates we have there contacts phone email etc so thats how we contacted each other i would be annoyed with admissions for putting you into an awkward position i agree that you might be in a bad position either way if the three others are all friends you would almost certainly be left out especially if you blocked their rooming with the person they wanted to room with so i think i would level with them tell them that you were looking forward to rooming with them because they seemed like good people and you would be happy to help them out if it doesn't mean that you would be moving into the suite from hell tell them that you need information on the other roommates before you can make such a decision if the other people seem okay then you would be better off not rooming with this close knit group who probably all went to high school together and have a history you don't share but if the others seem odd then you just have to say that you can't do that you were willing to make the effort but not to subject yourself to a painful year if they are at all reasonable that is being as fair as you can be Social rule Friends Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Poker jargon Humphrey Bogart The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Milton H.
