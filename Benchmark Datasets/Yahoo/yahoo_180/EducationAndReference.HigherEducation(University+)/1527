college major question do you think that it is better to go to college undecided or to have your major picked out if you know what you want to do declare it you can easily change it later if you want to change anyways try to get some generals out of your way because you may find something that you really like i started out as a physics major with biology music minors now i'm double majoring in biochemistry and political science emphasis on foreign affairs with a german minor those generals sure taught me but it is good to kind of have an idea of what area you're interested in because then you can pick your classes accordingly and toss in a couple of those generals i think that if an older person asks you what you're majoring in and you say that you're undecided you may get some funny or painful looks and a lecture about how it's a waste of money i don't think it is though you'll figure it out eventually Biochemistry Milton H.
