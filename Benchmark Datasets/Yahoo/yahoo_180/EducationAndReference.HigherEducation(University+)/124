how does college orientation go i have been to two college orientation the first one was not too bad because it's one of the top orientation programs in the country but not the school itself but the nd orientation sucked but the school itself i have yet to find out this fall in all honestly i paid more than bucks altogether to find out how boring these were if your parents attend with you it's been told by other students and parents that it was pretty boring as well and that they might as well have just called for answers if they just wanted to see the dorms their kids were to live in they could have called to set up a time for a tour and so forth instead of spending about eight hours of complete boredom and crappy food though some orientation programs are exceptionally good it's highly recommended that you talk to other students from that school if you need to find another student from that school you can find them usually from www facebook com best of luck but either way you're required to attend but you're better off wandering off on your own after setting up your schedule Graduate school Education in the United States Phillips Exeter Academy Education in Germany Education in Australia Georgia Institute of Technology No Child Left Behind Act Education in Portugal Student loan Walt Disney World College Program The Catcher in the Rye Education in the People's Republic of China University of Massachusetts Amherst Education in Sweden Poker jargon Theory of conduct College College admissions GED Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Sims 2: University The Young Ones (TV series) High school School choice Freed-Hardeman University Education in Romania Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education Program for the Exceptionally Gifted SAT Facebook (website) One Tree Hill (TV series) Physician Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Avenue Q Affirmative action Advanced Placement Program Law school Community college Our Gang Education in Japan Juris Doctor Franklin W.
