locked out of college i've been living in my home for about years and have wanted to finish my degree i was accepted at the only college for about miles but they refuse to grant residency even though i can prove it by the document they gave me and the state legislature approved for residency i feel like they'rer just trying to rip me off there's a dollar per semester difference who do i complain to it is a partially publicly funded community college partially publicly funded what kind of half horse half alligator system does your state have well ok first contact the college and ask them for the procedure you should follow to appeal their residency decision then do it if the appeals process at the college doesn't work in your favor then try contacting the state office that coordinates higher education community colleges that will be a different title and a different entity in each system your last option will be to retain an attorney and sue their greedy butts good luck with it remember to remain professional and courteous at each step of the process even when you're dealing with a grinning idiot who thinks that explaining their misinterpretation of a policy is going to make you go away if the first person you deal with is not helpful at some point you get to say this is not getting us anywhere i need to talk to someone with more authority if you keep climbing the ladder of command and sitting patiently through hearing the same stuff at each level eventually you'll find someone who is willing to be reasonable and helpful well almost always Juris Doctor Appeal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Court system of Canada Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Scientology beliefs and practices Volleyball Attorney at Law Separation of powers under the United States Constitution Social rule Paralegal Trust (Law) USA Supreme Court of the United States Involuntary commitment Contract Prostate cancer Same-sex marriage in the United States Education in Germany Slander and libel Publicly funded medicine Head of state Independent Media Center Transsexuality Town meeting Lawyer College Chiropractic Classified information Corporate governance Constitution of Ireland Poker jargon Tax protester Chen Shui-bian Supply and demand Education in the People's Republic of China Student loan Elections in the United States Past teachings of Prem Rawat Health care in the United States Graduate school Pretty Good Privacy Government involvement in the Terri Schiavo case Mother Teresa California government and politics Economic inequality Information Technology Infrastructure Library Monarchy in Canada Insurance Fathers' rights Article One of the United States Constitution Canadian and American health care systems compared Scots law University of Central Florida Education in Portugal Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Politics of Hong Kong Expert system Political subdivisions of New York State European Union Intelligent design movement Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Blood on the Tracks Charter school State American University GNU General Public License Blackjack Same-sex marriage in Canada Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Professor Stare decisis Judicial review Mental Health Act 1983 W.
