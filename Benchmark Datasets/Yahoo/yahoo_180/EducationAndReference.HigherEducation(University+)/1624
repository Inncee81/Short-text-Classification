what to expect once i graduate hi i am currently an undergrad student going into rd year i just got this part time job in rbc dominion securities as computer operator working for investment advisor updating clients info using crm software i will try to continue this job with my school atleast for an year if i can manage it since its only hrs day i still have two more years in university doing double major in math and econ i know the question is very vague but what can i expect to earn with double major in math econ and little bit of expereince with rbc dominion securities thanks you are off to the right start by holding a part time job to get some experience the decision you will have to make to really answer this question is what kind of job are you going to be looking for a math and economics degree is a good basis to go into actuarial science investment analysis financial sales or a related field actuaries make the most money of that group you could reasonably expect to make around coming out of school and i have heard of others making closer to sixty without a degree in actuarial science you will be on the lower end of the payscale but employers take into account your entire academic record such as if your gpa is above a and how active you were at your school investment analyst positions are competitive and you can expect to run into companies that are leaning towards those with an mba however insurance companies investment banks and other financial institutions do hire a lot of undergraduates and offer competitive pay at the low end of the payscale is the high s but that can run up as well it would be reasonable to expect an investment analyst position to start at about financial sales often target economics degrees and then try to sell you on the idea that you could have unlimited income potential unfortunately it is an almost impossible task for someone in their early s to do very few succeed at a young age although the job does often pay very well for more experienced and older professionals my advice is to stay away from these sales positions until you are in your thirties the exception is of course you happen to have some wealthy friends and relatives that are willing to trust someone without experience to investing all salary information is going to depend on what job you are seeking and where you are seeking it london new york los angeles pay more than other cities their are also tax issues to consider as each country state and county have different rates the best advice i could give you is to not worry about starting pay because most companies will be competitive in the thirties and forties for most positions the trick is to realize that when you graduate you are selling yourself as a person that people will want to work with as somebody who is capable of learning from others from experience and can succeed at the company they are interviewing at a double major is a great start and a little experience never hurts you although it probably won't affect your starting pay good luck and god bless Mutual fund Graduate school Insurance Education in the United States Software engineering Microeconomics Education in the People's Republic of China Inflation Management information system Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bond Financial analyst Actuary Economic inequality Taxation in the United States Personal finance Risk Social Security (United States) Warren Buffett Ponzi scheme Tax Lawyer Model (economics) The Apprentice 2 candidates Ross School of Business Chinese University of Hong Kong Student loan Stern School of Business Customer relationship management Plame affair Cass Business School, London United Kingdom corporation tax Game programmer Government debt Capital accumulation Free trade Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Privatization Education in Germany Mergers and acquisitions Flat tax Strategic management Microcredit 401(k) Monetary policy Academia Economy of Russia Supply and demand Great Depression Social Security debate (United States) Toronto-Dominion Bank Master's degree Corporate governance Technical analysis Affirmative action Keynesian economics Freeters Bank SAT Finance Gross domestic product Eliot Spitzer PE ratio FairTax Hedge fund Mathematics Credit card Supply-side economics Electronic commerce Corporation Economics Contract Short selling Health insurance Deflation (economics) Pension Celtic Tiger Quizbowl SCO-Linux controversies Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Corporate finance Financial services Unemployment benefit Economy of India Call centre College admissions
