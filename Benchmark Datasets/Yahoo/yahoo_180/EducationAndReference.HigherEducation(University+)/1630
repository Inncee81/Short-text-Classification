what classes does a pre med student take i was just wondering if anyone recently started or took part in a pre med program at a university what classes have you taken so far will take the first answer is a great answer i'm a psychology major but i'm making sure to take the required classes to get in which are year of biology year of chemistry year of organic chemistry year of physics and labs with all of those classes calculus and english these requirements are to help you when you take the mcat you'll see questions from all of those classes except english you'll have an essay at the end and that's where the english class comes in my pre med adviser recommended that i take an anatomy class and biochemistry to help prepare me for the rigors of medical school keep in mind that for the first cut of medical school admissions usually only look at your science gpa and your mcat score if that meets their standards then they'll send you a secondary application so make sure to keep up your grades in your science classes less than of people who apply get in because there just aren't enough places make sure to have a back up plan and good luck Medical school Advanced Placement Program SAT Graduate school Medicine Graduate Record Examination Physician Education in Taiwan Education in Hong Kong College admissions Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Science Chiropractic Education in the People's Republic of China Regents of the University of California v.
