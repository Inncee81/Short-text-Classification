question about my classes i take to go university what is the standard requirement of math level for most good universitys if everything goes well i would be graduating high school with alg is that acceptable for universities if not would i be able to go to a community college and get the math level i need the really top schools would expect you to have taken calculus however it just wasn't available to you then they might accept you as long as you've taken enough years of math for what they want if that's the case they usually make you take math as a general education requirement the math is typically calculus level i went to a top school i only went up to alg or trig whichever is higher altho i think in my high school it went alg then trig then alg then calc for my math requirement in college i took logic instead i was really trying to worm my way out of taking calculus i justified it by telling myself logic would be useful in law school and the lsat holy smokes was i wrong the logic class was hard it was like geometry proofs on steroids i only passed because halfway through the final it all clicked and i was able to answer the questions i really had no clue what was going on even up to the first part of the final i shoulda took calc instead least i could have asked friends for help SAT Education in Romania Quizbowl Advanced Placement Program Education in the United States GED Calculus Natural deduction Grade (education) Propositional calculus Graduate Record Examination Education in Taiwan Law School Admissions Test Algebraic geometry Jaime Escalante Law school G__del's incompleteness theorem Graduate school Troy High School Philosophy of mathematics Sheaf (mathematics) Test (student assessment) Secondary education in the United States Manifold Halting problem Jumpstart 3rd Grade General relativity Complexity classes P and NP Clements High School Education in Australia Lambda calculus Second-order logic No Child Left Behind Act Education in France Utilitarianism Lebesgue integration Mathematics education Theory of conduct Stuyvesant High School Causality Curry-Howard Logic programming Logic College High school Sequent calculus Physics Juris Doctor Computation Geometry Hunter College High School Homeschooling Trigonometric function Nicolas Bourbaki The Princeton Review Zeno's paradoxes Education in the People's Republic of China Lincoln-Douglas Debate Affirmative action Paradox Adjoint functors Scientific method Willard Van Orman Quine Infant baptism Probability Mathematician Academia Extreme Programming Simone Weil Medical school Intuitionistic logic The Sims 2: University Hilbert's problems College admissions Junior Certificate Cooper Union Community college Non-standard analysis Education Education in the Republic of Ireland Peter Singer Ordinary differential equation Alexander Grothendieck University of Alabama Economics Multi-valued logic Reach for the Top Equal Protection Clause Gottfried Leibniz Vacuous truth Democracy __l__ments de g__om__trie alg__brique Number theory Pi Physician Grothendieck's S__minaire de g__om__trie alg__brique
