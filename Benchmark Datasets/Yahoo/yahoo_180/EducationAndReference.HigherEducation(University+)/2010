confused about transfer programs at community college the liberal arts course that i am looking at taking says that it is a transfer program i understand that this means it is to prepare you to transfer over to a four year program at a university but what if i am just looking to get an associates in liberal arts and don't want to make the switch to an expensive university the transfer program only includes courses that can be transferred to a senior college community colleges also offer a lot of classes that are vocational technical in nature that won't generally transfer up such as basic carpentry or auto mechanics and these aren't included in the aa curriculum very often you can enroll in an aas liberal studies program that will let you take those types of classes in your associates degree program and is often more generous in degree requirements it might be called occupational studies or something similar the requirements for an aa are more than just to qualify for transfer the implied consideration is that an aa holder has taken a solid liberal arts core of courses at the same level as the first two years of a four year program an associate of arts is usually not a terminal degree like an aas in hvac might be if there are courses you want to take that aren't included in the aa curriculum you can just take those as excess if there are aa required courses that you don't want to take not much can be done about that unless they offer alternatives have fun go learn cool stuff Associate's degree Education in Portugal Master's degree Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Juris Doctor City and Guilds of London Institute Education in Taiwan Education in Australia College Education in Hong Kong Education in Sweden High school Education in the Republic of Ireland Seneca College Medical school Nurse California Polytechnic State University Professor Physician Graduate school Education in Germany Doctorate Secondary education in the United States Higher education in Japan Bachelor of Arts Australian Qualifications Framework Kwantlen University College Bologna process University of Houston Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Advanced Placement Program St. John's College, U.
