would you rather go to college at a small school or a large school i teach some classes at a fairly large university in oregon i don't mind teaching but i know that i would have hated to be a student in a large approx students class like the one i teach i received my undergrad from a small school it was great that all of the professors knowing your first name and taking a genuine interest in your education i had personally been invited to professors' houses for dinner quite often but there are disadvantages to going to a small school there are fewer options for classes and majors minors the school i went to was in a very small town which didn't have much to do on campus or off campus so what do you think and if you're going to college for the first time this fall why did you choose the size of school you chose i think most people would consider students a small school would probably be midsized my school was just under students but i get your point erendis also vanessa i was talking about universities colleges not k education i'm going off to school for the first time this fall i chose to go to a medium size university population i like the fact that i get smaller classes as i don't think i would have been able to stay awake in a huge lecture hall i liked the size of my high school classes very well i'm not sure if i could have adapted to big classes that are students large because i already have a hearing problem even though it is well corrected with hearing aids i don't think my corrected hearing is as good as the average person's is also i'll be able to get help from a professor without too much difficulty if i ever need it since my university is small enough due to my hearing problem i am feeling a little overwhelmed that some of my classes are going to be students after all i did choose a medium size university not a small one but i am pretty sure that the class sizes will get smaller as i get into upper level classes i'm not too upset that i don't have a ton of major options my school still has an accounting program as well as majors in business administration economics and math since i want one of those majors i am perfectly happy with my options i am at school to learn a lot not spend the whole time socializing so i should be fine with the fact that there are not a million activities to do there are enough to keep me busy when i am not studying at my mid size university if it had been up to me i would have chosen to go to a smaller university of course i didn't receive enough financial aid at any of the private schools since i ultimately received a year scholarship at my public in state medium sized university i was able to afford it better than i would have if i had been going elsewhere but i think everything will turn out alright regardless of the size Education in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China University of Michigan Chinese University of Hong Kong York University Columbia University Community college Education in Romania Cornell University University of Houston College GED Education in Germany Education in France Education in Japan Graduate school University of Massachusetts Amherst Affirmative action University of Central Florida University of Maryland Baltimore County Brown University Johns Hopkins University Education in Portugal Boston Public Education in Australia University of Tennessee Pennsylvania State University Trinity College, Dublin Law school Dublin City University American University University of Toronto Far Eastern University Theory of conduct Ohio Wesleyan University Secondary education in Japan University of Szeged Indiana University Bloomington Oregon State University Princeton University Students' union College and university rankings University of Notre Dame SAT Warsaw University Big Brother UK series 6 New York University University of Virginia Student loan Hogwarts subjects College admissions University of Southern California U.S. Electoral College University of Chicago Hunter College High School California Polytechnic State University Education in India Carnegie Mellon University University of Alabama High school University of Rochester University of Edinburgh University at Albany Duke University Caulfield Grammar School Georgetown University Master's degree Emerson College Middle Tennessee State University Vanderbilt University Medical school Babson College Alpha Phi Grand Valley State University University of Connecticut Tuition Education in Malaysia Boston College University of Canterbury Northeastern University, Boston University of Cape Town Florida Institute of Technology University of Minnesota University of Victoria Jaime Escalante Portland State University Smith College University of San Diego Education in Taiwan University of Idaho Florida International University University of Hong Kong Juris Doctor
