how competitive is it to get into a doctoral program i will be completing my masters of education english language in april and i'm really keen to get into the ioe institute of education university of london for the october intake i wonder how many people apply and how i can improve my chances of getting in i love research getting into the doctoral program is all that i ever want for the next three years i'm not sure about your exact program but i can just give you my advice from my personal experience i'm going london school of economics in october and i feel like i worried for nothing i would definately look on the program's site and see what the professors research interests are and when you write your admissions essay try to include at least so when they begin to decide thay can have advisors in mind also if you haven't already do research in those areas in some way alot of research is always good i did my undergrad honors thesis on bisexual women and psychosocial issues when i saw on lse site they didn't have much research into bisexuality but they were interested in sexuality studies try to do something similar find what they generally research and then find a neglected population within it also gpa is huge so keep it as high as possible other than that just have a really good admissions essay and i wish you the best of luck maybe i'll see you in Graduate school Juris Doctor Medical school Education in the United States Education in Portugal Law school Education in Australia Lawyer Columbia University Grade (education) University of Central Florida London School of Economics Sex education Chinese University of Hong Kong GED Education in Germany Education in Hong Kong Physician IB Diploma Programme Affirmative action Middle East Technical University Professor Education in the People's Republic of China University of Connecticut College Human sexual behavior Demographics of sexual orientation Wesleyan University Education in France Johns Hopkins University Thesis Physical therapy SAT Homophobia Chiropractic Middle Tennessee State University Bernard Williams Gifted Education Programme (Singapore) Alfred Kinsey Infantilism Stevens Institute of Technology Academic term University of Michigan City and Guilds of London Institute University of Houston Rudolf Steiner Yale University Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Trinity College, Dublin Government agencies in Sweden Higher education in Japan Master of Business Administration Biology and sexual orientation Autism Cornell University Homosexuality Bologna process Education in Malaysia Education in Romania University of Texas at San Antonio University of Pennsylvania Apprenticeship Education in Austria College and university rankings Carl Jung Hillary Rodham Clinton Ohio Wesleyan University Academia NHH Social psychology Asexuality Sex Sex-positive feminism __cole Polytechnique York University Education in the Republic of Ireland Psychology Goodness and value theory Georgetown University Reparative therapy Transsexuality Economics University of Ottawa Psychoanalysis Education Cult Brigham Young University A New Kind of Science High school One Tree Hill (TV series) University of San Francisco
