i want to get my b s in mortuary science but i have no idea where to start i'm really sure that this is the career i want but there are a few things standing in my way the most major at this time is that i have to get my diplomia ged in order to be able to go to any collage or university i'm not sure what to do or where to start but i know that i want to do this my question is what do i need to do to get my diploma ged after i get that what do i have to do next after you get your ged diploma you go to different universities that offer mortuary science degrees and apply for entrance to those universities if they turn you down and you get rejection letters then you go to a local community college and take general basic courses and make very good grades and then apply again to the university you want to go to as a transfer student it is really so much easier to be admitted as a transfer student if your grades at your community college are good grades that is i don't know why more people don't try this then once you are admitted to a school you go to the financial aid department of that school and ask to apply for any grants or scholarships that could help you pay for school if you go to a community college make sure you get information from the university you intend to transfer to later about what credits would work toward that degree explain you want to transfer later and want to make sure you are taking the right courses they will be helpful chances are there are a bunch of run of the mill classes like english and math and biology that are very standard early on in the study program all of which could be taken at a community college and transferred to your university later also when you sign up for classes you talk to someone called an advisor who will talk to you about this GED Education in the United States Community college Graduate school Education in Germany Education in Hong Kong Education in Portugal Master's degree Education in the People's Republic of China College admissions High school College Education in Australia Seneca College Education in Taiwan Kwantlen University College Education in Sweden Medical school IB Diploma Programme Education in Romania Associate's degree SAT Law school Johns Hopkins University A-level UCAS University of Alabama Education in Malaysia Massachusetts Institute of Technology Chinese University of Hong Kong Student loan University of Central Florida Brown University Numerus clausus Juris Doctor Athabasca University Ontario Academic Credit Scholarship Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Mapua Institute of Technology University of Maryland Baltimore County Physician City and Guilds of London Institute Middle Tennessee State University Economics Education in Canada Education Doctor of Philosophy Secondary education in the United States Distance education University of Toronto California Polytechnic State University Institute of technology Bologna process Northeastern University, Boston New York State Department of Education University of Cambridge Cornell University Cooper Union York University Homeschooling Christian Brothers University Stuyvesant High School Education in Japan No Child Left Behind Act Australian Qualifications Framework Bilkent University Professor Lawyer Junior Certificate Pennsylvania State University The Sims 2: University North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Novosibirsk State University Stevens Institute of Technology Academic degree Oregon State University Education in the Republic of Ireland Bachelor of Arts Hunter College High School Education in France Memorial University of Newfoundland Baccalaur__at University of Scranton American University University of Notre Dame University of Bristol
