going to college i'm headed to college at the end of this month and i don't know if i have everything i'll need if someone could tell from experience what some valuable things to have in a dorm are would they please let me know ok so make sure to have some flip flops that you can wear in the shower i know i needed them in my dorm and a robe to get from the bathroom to your room without any problems try to get lots of storage devices especially some that will fit under your bed or in your closet those rooms seem big when they are empty but they fill up super fast i would also bring either a small vacuum or a dust buster because a real vacuum takes up too much room i also had a wooden bunk bed frame that my roommate and i used every year to help save some room too you might want to think about an area rug or some sort because most dorm rooms are not carpeted a towel rack or shoe rack that can hang from your door might be convenient too unless you get a full length mirror to hang from your door also a good idea as far as food appliances you might want to check with your school because my school would not allow you to have microwaves or other food appliances in your room other than a mini fridge which is totally needed i did have a toaster that i smuggled into my dorm room and a mini crock pot which came in handy for all sorts of things i also got a new pair of slippers each year so i could roam from room to room without actually putting on shoes other than that i think that might be it besides clothes bedding toiletries and pictures and picture frames oh make sure to get some sort of shower caddy mine was a cute blue basket that i carried my shampoo and whatnot in to the shower with me it makes things easier i hope this helps Dormitory Sento Kitchen Japanese tea ceremony Sin City Refrigerator Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Shoe Customs and etiquette of Japan Glossary of firefighting equipment Poker jargon Closet RuneScape quests Toilet Cruising (maritime) RuneScape locations Vacuum cleaner Carpet Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Upholstery Equine conformation Vacuum Rigging Comanche The Catcher in the Rye Bubble Bobble The Class Menagerie Laserdisc Characters in the Smurfs Mattress Franklin W.
