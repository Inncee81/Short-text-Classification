what's college like i'm starting my freshman year in less than weeks i'd like to hear your thoughts on college life college is amazing i was a shy nerdy kid in high school then came college and i realized that i was surrounded by people with brains and ambition some colleges are more academically intense while others leave more time for beer pong and sleeping in you'll be responsible for your own laundry cleaning possibly cooking studying signing up for classes and clubs basically everything but paying the bills unless your parents are making you pay in which case i'm sorry you have that too it is really great you'll meet lots of new friends and get to know your living mates really well you'll be exposed to a lot of different cultures and see what other people's traditions are like i don't even know how to put into words how amazing college is when you go home for the summer if you do you'll be happy to see old friends but sad to be away from your new ones also colleges usually have big class sizes the first couple years don't sit way in the front if your profs use a projector but if you sit in the back you might fall asleep i think college in one word is exciting you will hopefully have the time of your life i know i am ps i looooooove college woooohoo Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Undergrads Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Out-of-body experience Education in the United States Boston Public The Family from One End Street Philosophical skepticism Psychosis The Catcher in the Rye Education in Romania Franklin W.
