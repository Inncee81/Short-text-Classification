tips on getting what i need from my high school counselor i went to counselor in june because something had gone wrong with my schedule and she promised i'd be the first one to see her on the first day of school i don't expect to be the first one and don't mind but experience with my counselor tells me that it'll be october before i finally have a chance to meet with her she tends to get off track easily and has a short attention span so sessions are longer than they need to be lines in front of her office are long does anyone have tips on how to approach her with a request for help i'd like to be friendly and chatty with her but this is an urgent matter i'm not sure how i'd feel if she never attempted to help resolve it how can i get right down to it without being rude there's no need to be friendly about it you are seeking her help more than that she already promised that she would help you as soon as you see her remind her of her promise emphasize that the matter is urgent and that you must see her this week ask her for a definite appointment if she seems the slightest bit reluctant tell her you have no one else to turn to this should get results Psychoanalysis Milton H.
