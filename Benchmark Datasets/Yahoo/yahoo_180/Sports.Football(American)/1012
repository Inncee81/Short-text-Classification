should big ten wait to start season you think they should start weeks after they do currently its my belief that this is a major issue of why they dont do well in bowl games big ten is down with their season by nov ish when the pac isnt done till beginning of dec the sec isnt done till end of nov and if they go to the championship game dec same with big for those of you who think it doesnt matter trust me it does the more weeks you are away from your last game played the more inefficient your going to become the polls isnt the big issue here they can make the bcs games its just that whoever they played has played alot more recently then they have thats the issue as for more games they already play some conferences play so they are maxing out and the playoff thing i have heard nothing of but i hope it is true a bye week or two during the season would be a better idea they get the rest when they need it the most and still don't finish too early chicago fan is way off they won't have a playoff if they added another team they would have a championship game Bowl Championship Series Playoff Playoff format Pittsburgh Steelers BCS title game Cleveland Browns Baltimore Ravens Miami Dolphins Buffalo Bills College basketball NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 New York Knicks Super Bowl Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XXVII Atlantic Coast Conference Super Bowl XXXVI Texas Longhorn Athletics College football Mack Brown New England Patriots Indianapolis Colts Jacksonville Jaguars New York Jets National Football League Lore NFL playoffs Super Bowl XXXIV Stanley Cup Minnesota Vikings NBA Finals Rose Bowl (game) Philadelphia 76ers International League Carolina Panthers San Francisco 49ers Boston Red Sox Super Bowl XIV 2005 World Series St. Louis Rams Oakland Athletics American Football League Donovan McNabb Baseball Stars Philadelphia Eagles Mario Lemieux Kansas City Chiefs USC Trojans Football Fiesta Bowl Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.
