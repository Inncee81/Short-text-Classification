who will make the playoffs with what seed and why i want at some sleeper darkhorse picks too picking last years playoffs teams are too easy and unrealistic afc colts offence will carry them in enough games to be the seed but they won't win the suberbowl nor the conference patriots defence is always solid and they picked up some receivers in the off season that will make offence scary to play against ravens they lost some players but overall its hard not to think they will be a really good team broncos the chargers lost all of there coaches and as talented as the chargers are the coaching staff will cost them some games and denver will take the division dolphins no one thinks they will do anything but they brought in an offence minded coach who help create the dangerous team that the chargers had bengals they are only one year removed from the playoffs and a divisional title so if they can put it together they should be able to do it again nfc saints great offence and now they have two people who will be one year more experienced head coach and bush the rb bears weak division will have them cruising ers past couple of years they have gotten better and better this will be there year to really start putting it all together giants dallas new coaching staff and i'm not convinced of there qb the eagles are old and wasington is not very good this division will play out as if no one wants to win it and in the end the giants will take it rams the offence will be great and the defence will be a lot better than last year buccaneers garcia took the eagles to the playoffs last season and he will help a lot of young players live up to there potential this is how i see the playoffs turning out and you can take it to vegas and clean up New York Jets National Football League Lore Buffalo Bills Tampa Bay Buccaneers Professional American football championship games Indianapolis Colts Baltimore Ravens Carolina Panthers Kansas City Chiefs Denver Broncos San Diego Chargers National Football League American Football League Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XXVII Philadelphia Eagles Atlanta Falcons Dallas Cowboys Minnesota Vikings NFL playoffs Super Bowl XXXI New York Knicks Joe Gibbs December 2004 in sports New Orleans Saints NFL playoffs, 2004-05 January 2005 in sports NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Tennessee Titans Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XII NFL playoffs, 2000-01 Washington Redskins Cris Carter October 2005 in sports Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXXV NFL playoffs, 1981-82 NFL playoffs, 1990-91 Playoff Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XIV NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Orlando Magic Super Bowl XXV Monday Night Football Utah Jazz Running back Super Bowl V Houston Rockets Brett Favre Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XXXIII San Antonio Spurs Indiana Pacers National Football League championships Super Bowl VII Super Bowl XXVIII New Jersey Nets Super Bowl XXIII Jim Finks Seattle Seahawks NFL playoffs, 1979-80 Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXXII NFL playoffs, 1982-83 National Basketball Association Los Angeles Kings 2004 NFL season Marty Schottenheimer NFL playoffs, 1996-97 1978 NFL season NFL playoffs, 1989-90 Doug Flutie Super Bowl VI New York Rangers NFL playoffs, 1978-79 Jim Harbaugh NFL playoffs, 1997-98 International League
