if i play saftey what are my responsibilitys i have played there before but just breifly can you explain to me what i have to do now not to knock you or anything but how exactly did you play the safety spot before yet somehow not remeber what your job is i used to play line backer years ago and i still know my job and yours yet never played safety if you really want to do your job well you need to know what everyone elses job is in addition to what yours is a safety in general is the last line of defense against the offese so they need to be better tacklers than a cb needs to be often times fs and ss are known for being big hitters ed reed roy williams ronnie lott ken houston larry wilson etc as far as what your job is it depends on the play calling and formations you could be double covering a wr with your cb the whole game if the te shifts to your side and your in man you may have to cover him if your expecting a run you might cheat up some to help with run cover support etc sometimes instead of the safeties dividing up their jobs in terms of run support and pass support the safeties will divide up the field into a left half and a right half and each will be responsible for anything that comes into his half of the field we call that a cover as far as a free safety is concerned his job tends to be to stay back a bit watch the play unfold and follow the ball and not get caught cheating up the number one reason yard pass plays happen is because the fs got caught cheating up or too much to one side a good qb will read this real quick and torch you for on pass plays the free safety is supposed to close near the receiver by the time the ball gets to him offenses tend to call play action passes specifically to draw the free safety closer to the line to stop a long run if the offense puts a receiver in the slot then the free safety may be called upon to cover that receiver as far as a strong safety is concerned he is tasked to handle the strong side of the offense the side where the tight end lines up the strong safety tends to play closer to the line and assist in stopping the run he may also be responsible for covering a player such as a running back or fullback or h back who goes in motion in the backfield and then out for a pass strong safeties occasionally blitz as well so the cliffs notes know how to hit wrap and tackle dont get caught cheating up or to one side too much because a good qb will spot it and use it know everyone elses job it makes yours easier Rugby union positions Volleyball Pittsburgh Steelers Running back Offensive team Defensive team Baseball New York Giants Super Bowl X Super Bowl XXVII Super Bowl IX Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XVI National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXVI Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XIV Football (soccer) positions Quarterback Wide receiver San Francisco 49ers Lineman (football) Super Bowl I Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXIII Rugby league positions Snooker New England Patriots Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XIX Softball Poker jargon Fast bowling Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XII Rugby union Super Bowl III Super Bowl XVIII Field hockey Football (soccer) Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXXIII Cricket Buffalo Bills 1957 World Series Rugby league Fielding (cricket) Batting (cricket) Glossary of partner dance terms National Football League Super Bowl XXXVIII Table tennis Paintball Tris Speaker Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Fullback Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XXXII Super Bowl VIII New York Jets Iron Bowl Super Bowl VII NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Ultimate (sport) History of Test cricket (to 1883) Swingout Baseball scorekeeping Tight end 2005 World Series Cleveland Browns Super Bowl XXVIII GunBound Arena football Chess terminology Laws of cricket Contract bridge Official (American football) Boston Red Sox Snap (American football) World Series Super Bowl II
