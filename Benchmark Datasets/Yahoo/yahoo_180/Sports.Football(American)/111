do you think michael vick should lose his career in football and spend some time in jail if you support him pleeeease explain why dog fighting is the most cruelist thing you can do to an animal i personally believe he should be put in a dog fighting ring with a couple of these fighting dogs and let him see how it feels to be ripped apart by a dog i mean he actually killed some of his dogs when they didn't perform well how could you support him and if it was like peyton manning or cullpepper that got busted would you support them as well yes kd i think michael vick should lose his career in football i for one never want to look upon his face again i don't believe if by some bizarre miracle oj jury if he is found innocent any nfl team will sign him the outcry of the fans would be disastrous for any team who attempted to associate their franchise with the monster i do hope he does serve jail time but as with oj it's hard to predict what the outcome of the trial will be the evidence i have seen and read is enough for me i am capable of forming an opinion on my own one of his team mates ray buchanan has even said that michael vick is involved in dogfigting heavily and has been for a very long time ray said that vick tried to get his other team mates involved in it as well there are witnesses plus a co defendent willing to testify against him and i don't believe we know about all of the evidence they have against him i believe it is very likely that they have visual evidence as well i e cell phone pictures of him at a dog fight i agree with you anybody who could do this to an animal has to be a sadistic despicable human being dogs only want to love and please their owners how michael vick and his posse could betray this love by starving abusing torturing and murdering these poor dogs is beyond belief i am sure you have heard this but in case you haven't these guys didn't only abuse their own animals it is the practice of training pitbulls for fighting that they steal dogs out of neighborhoods out of back yards from 'free to a good home' ads to use as 'bait' for the training of the dogs they will throw a domesticated loved animal into a cage with the pitbull and let him tear the pet to shreds all of this is much too much for most of us to fathom it sickens me as michael vick at this juncture sickens me nike reebok the sports cards companies rawlings and sports authority here in atlanta have lawyers that work for them why do you think these companies decided to drop michael vick obviously because their attorneys have read the indictment and looked into the charges and feel that is it likely that michael vick will be convicted even the sclc who had announced that they would be 'honoring' vick at their next convention to show their support has changed their stance within one day of the announcement they cancelled the 'honor' event for him yes if peyton manning or cullpepper was busted for animal abuse i would condemn them as well contrary to what one of the posters said here white people do not generally determine a person's guilt or innocence due to skin color i was a fan of michael vick before this happened i am still a falcons fan i don't care if michael vick was purple if i didn't think the evidence against him was overwhelming i would have continued to support him anyone who doesn't see how the evidence has stacked up against him to determine his guilt is obviously delusional Plame affair Michael Vick Mumia Abu-Jamal New York Giants Glen Jacobs 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Atlanta Falcons Dog O.
