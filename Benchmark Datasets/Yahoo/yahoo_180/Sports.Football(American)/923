i dont get it louisville cardinals in football or a great team true or false me true im a die hard cards fan so i dnt get y west virginia is ahead oh us in rankings sitting at like number and we r well at least in the coaches poll anywho we stoped their undefeated streak and they lost games we lost one they won their bowl game this year and so did we so that made us look great so who thinks louisville is a way better team and will have a good chance for a bcs national championship this year i guess the ncaa re values all the teams every year based on their current rosters wv still has pat smith and heisman hopeful steve slaton and most of the offense is back your cards lost their coach which can break a team s morale but you still have next year top qb in the draft brian brohm so i wouldn t worry too much the big east has shown they can compete with the bigger conferences and if they can repeat what they did last year and louisville goes at least they have a shot at the title good luck Bowl Championship Series USC Trojans Football Big East Conference New York Giants NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers New England Patriots Carolina Panthers College basketball San Francisco 49ers Kansas City Chiefs Buffalo Bills Cincinnati Bengals Georgia Institute of Technology Boston College Athletics Texas Longhorn Athletics Mack Brown Iron Bowl National Football League Joe Paterno Syracuse University Orange St. Louis Cardinals Washington Redskins Michigan Wolverines New York Knicks International League BCS title game Miami Dolphins Minnesota Vikings Cincinnati Reds University of Texas at Austin Indianapolis Colts Arkansas Razorbacks New York Jets NCAA Division I-A national football champions Steve Nash Orlando Magic Sam Barry NBA Finals Super Bowl National Football League Lore Oakland Athletics Auburn University Baltimore Orioles Jacksonville Jaguars Arizona Cardinals National Basketball Association Oakland Raiders Southeastern Conference Tennessee Titans Toronto Blue Jays Pete Rose Kurt Angle Baltimore Ravens 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament St. Louis Rams John Calipari Denver Broncos Atlanta Braves Super Bowl XXVII Norway national football team Super Bowl XXVI Barry Switzer Atlantic Coast Conference Chicago Bulls October 2005 in sports Los Angeles Clippers December 2004 in sports Houston Rockets University of Louisville Playoff Bobby Knight Houston Nutt University of Connecticut Philadelphia 76ers Ken Jennings Indiana Pacers Philadelphia Eagles Florida Marlins University of Florida Oklahoma Sooners University of Houston Tampa Bay Buccaneers Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Nick Saban Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XIV West Bromwich Albion F.C.
