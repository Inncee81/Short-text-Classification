if you live somewhere without a pro football team who do you root for i wonder about the people that live out west or in the smaller southern states do they root for who's closest or whatever their parents do i would venture to guess that whatever team is shown on your local television stations would be the team you root for so it may be closest in the vicinity this way you get exposure and a chance to learn about the team it would be tough to follow a team on a different coast if you dont get to see much of their play assuming you dont have the nfl ticket on satellite National Football League American football NFL on television Super Bowl Monday Night Football Oakland Raiders College football New England Patriots NFL Network National Football League Lore San Francisco 49ers American Football League Canadian Football League St. Louis Rams Major professional sports league Southern Methodist University Pro Bowl Buffalo Bills Indoor football New York Giants NFL Films Cleveland Browns Cincinnati Bengals Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium Kansas City Chiefs World Football League Jim Thorpe Super Bowl XXXVIII Norway national football team Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XXXIV Major League Baseball television contracts Defunct NFL teams New York Jets Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl X Atlantic Coast Conference San Diego Chargers Pro Football Hall of Fame George Halas Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XXVI Las Vegas metropolitan area Dolphins Stadium Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl IV Houlihan's Stadium American football strategy Super Bowl I Jacksonville Jaguars Green Bay Packers Fox Broadcasting Company XFL College basketball Brooklyn Hobart NFL playoffs Washington Redskins Gold Coast, Queensland The Price Is Right Dallas Texans (NFL) Joe Namath Sid Gillman BBC Super Bowl XIII Password (game) Howard Stern United States Football League West Virginia University Glossary of American football Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Atlanta Falcons National Wrestling Alliance John Elway WCCO Baltimore Ravens Al Davis The Amazing Race Super Bowl XXI Running back Indianapolis Colts Donovan McNabb Bud Adams Super Bowl XXVII Arizona Cardinals Major League Soccer Gordon Banks Super Bowl XXIII NFL Draft ESPN Michael Irvin Arizona State University 2005 NFL season Philadelphia Eagles Jim Harbaugh Magic: The Gathering Terry Bradshaw The Replacements (film)
