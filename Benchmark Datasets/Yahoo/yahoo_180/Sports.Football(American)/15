your nfl power rankings rank all nfl teams or just the top if u want on how good they are going into the season colts patriots ravens chargers eagles bears saints bengals panthers seahawks ers cowboys the colts won the championship so i out them number one as long as their defense holds and i think it will closely behind are the patriots due to their ability to win aswell as their key offseason moves next was hard for me between the ravens and chargers i put the ravens here because they had the best defense in the nfl and with this years schedule baltimore has an easy schedule to run on and wont have to pass the ball that much and can rely on willis mcgahee to run the ball next is san diego because they've proven they can win lt was a monster for them last year and im expecting him to do similar to last year i picked the eagles instead of the bears here because the bears had the easiest schedule last year in the nfl and im not convinced that chicago has what it takes they played or teams that finished or better last year not a hard schedule dont get me wrong chicago made it to the super bowl but im expecting mcnabb to stay healthy and lead this team before his injury mcnabb was on pase for about yards and over tds Carolina Panthers Donovan McNabb Professional American football championship games Indianapolis Colts American Football League September 2005 in sports St. Louis Rams Buffalo Bills Running back New York Jets Baltimore Ravens Philadelphia Eagles NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Super Bowl XXVII Terrell Owens NFL playoffs, 2004-05 October 2005 in sports NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Super Bowl V January 2005 in sports December 2004 in sports Kansas City Chiefs San Diego Chargers Monday Night Football Jim Harbaugh Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXIX Super Bowl XXXIX 2005 NFL season Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXI Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl X Washington Redskins Cris Carter Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl I Pro Football Hall of Fame Michael Vick Super Bowl XIV Oakland Raiders Super Bowl XIX Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXXVIII NFL playoffs Super Bowl XVIII Tampa Bay Buccaneers Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXXII Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl XVI Super Bowl VII NFL playoffs, 2000-01 Denver Broncos Madden NFL Super Bowl VI NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Rodney Harrison 1978 NFL season Super Bowl XX Detroit Lions Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXII NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl XII National Football League championships September 2004 in sports Joe Gibbs Peyton Manning Super Bowl XXXVII Atlanta Falcons Brett Favre NFL playoffs, 1994-95 Super Bowl IX Chicago Cubs Ryan Leaf Choke (sports) NFL playoffs, 1996-97
