over under td's on kick returns for devin hester i read that he spent this off season trying to get even better but his opponents will probably be a little more ready for him this year too plus he's not going to get kicked to nearly as much as he did last year i say he only takes or to the house this season definetely under defenses special teams will have him figured out and plus kickers probably will do everything they can to avoid him last season was impressive with the missed field goal returned for a touchdown and everything but he wont be able to do it again he had total kickoffs returned for td's last season and i will be shocked if he has half of that im saying td's returned this coming up season who knows he could very well surprise and have more than that you cant predict this kind of stuff Super Bowl XXVI American football Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXXIV Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XVIII Glossary of American football Carolina Panthers Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XIX Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXXIII Super Bowl V Super Bowl XVI Pittsburgh Steelers Canadian football Super Bowl III Super Bowl XXXV National Football League Lore Super Bowl VII Super Bowl X Super Bowl XII Miami Dolphins Super Bowl XI New York Giants Super Bowl XXXII Super Bowl XXVIII New England Patriots New York Jets Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XV Super Bowl XXV San Francisco 49ers Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl I NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Kansas City Chiefs NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 2005 NFL season Super Bowl XXII Cleveland Browns Super Bowl II NFL playoffs, 2004-05 NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Super Bowl VIII World Football League Super Bowl XXIX National Football League Super Bowl IV St. Louis Rams Iron Bowl NFL playoffs, 2000-01 September 2005 in sports Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXX Super Bowl XXXVII NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Punt (football) Alex Ferguson NFL playoffs, 1990-91 NFL playoffs, 1972-73 Touchback NFL playoffs, 1999-2000 American football strategy Arena football Onside kick Rugby league NFL playoffs, 1997-98 NFL playoffs, 1982-83 1974 NFL season Wide receiver Ben Roethlisberger Mike Vanderjagt Troms__ I.L.
