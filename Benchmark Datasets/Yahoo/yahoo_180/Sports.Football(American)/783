its almost here football here are some opinion questions good afternoon football fans what team do you think will be the most improved over last season what division do you think is going to be the most fun to watch and what team do you think is the most over rated hey pumped for football most improved team has got to be the arizona cardinals a lot of answers i hear to this question are the jets and ers but they both finished in the middle of the pack last year so if they don't make the playoffs how are they improving the cards however finished th to last so there is a lot of room to improve new coach whisenhunt brings a lot of promising attitude to the team leinart will get his first full season edge should get more carries with new system and revamped o line and they have one of the top three wide receiver duos in fitzy and boldin and on the defensive side adrisn wilson antrell rolle bertrand berry karlos dansby and calvin pace are some of the better players in the nfl at their respective positions don't be surprised if this is a top defense on special teams they also have one of the top tier kickers in neil rackers and since they play in a dome no wind always helps and they have a dangerous return threat in j j arrington nfc west will probably be the division most fun to watch i think this it is the only division where any team can win it also could've been the nfc south if it weren't for the falcons and vick but now they have harrington they're screwed if the seahawks stay healthy and the ers can prove young guys can get the job done it should be a great way race for most of the season every team's offense should be exciting to watch the rams are stacked at every offensive position the seahawks are also stacked at every position the ers have frank gore one of the most exciting in the game today and the cardinals are also stacked as long as leinart can stay efficient and get the ball to fitzy and boldin very exciting division that should be competitive all year long most overrated team in my mind is the saints they have arguably the worst defense in the nfl and everyone is picking them to win the nfc with the post katrina comeback and all the emotions i just think they were riding a fluke into the playoffs and the lockdown bears d showed them that their run was a fluke brees had that huge year years ago in san diego then had a rough start and got injured years ago now i think it's same story new setting huge year st year in new orleans and now will come back to earth i'm not saying he'll be the worse qb in the league he'll still be top a top qb but he won't be behind peyton again deuce is getting rusty as well which could limit running game production i think they will be lucky to go i see them going eliminated st round of playoffs Atlanta Falcons Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXXVI Super Bowl XVIII Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XIX San Diego Chargers Super Bowl XXII Cris Carter Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXXI January 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXIV Tampa Bay Buccaneers St. Louis Cardinals Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XIII American Football League Super Bowl XXXIII Arizona Cardinals Super Bowl III Super Bowl VI Joe Gibbs December 2004 in sports Monday Night Football Playoff Tennessee Titans Super Bowl XXI NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Seattle Seahawks Super Bowl X Super Bowl XII Boston Red Sox October 2005 in sports World Series International League Super Bowl XXVIII Los Angeles Kings NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Toronto Raptors Super Bowl XV Super Bowl VII Brett Favre American football Super Bowl XVI Oakland Athletics New York Knicks Chicago Bulls San Francisco Giants Running back Randy Moss NFL playoffs, 2001-02 1994 NFL season Super Bowl XXXII Jacksonville Jaguars Toronto Blue Jays NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 NFL playoffs Super Bowl I Oakland Raiders Super Bowl II Super Bowl XX Super Bowl XXXV Detroit Tigers Norway national football team
