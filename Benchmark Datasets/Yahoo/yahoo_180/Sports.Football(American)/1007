will the steelers make the playoffs in the afc is extremely tough and deep but the steelers could be a sleeper i think yes they will they will go and will make the playoffs this year if you consider everything that went wrong for them last year they only missed the playoffs by one game last year the steelers lost a few games just because of muffed punts but this year i expect them to have one of the best returners in the league with willie reid being healthy i also think several of their players will have a better year i expect ike taylor to have a breakout season i think he has talent and is becoming more skilled at the corner position i also expect lawernce timmons to play a big part in the steelers defensive with joey porter gone timmons will fill the role of a pass rushing linebacker very well ben roethlisberger is going to be better a quarterback this year he has had a full year to recover from his motorcycle accident ben also said that he usually takes months off in the off season but this year he said he only took weeks off this year this will make him a better quarterback and more resistant to injury the steelers second year players will really shine too santonio holmes will do great last year he showed flashes of greatness i also believe anthony smith will have a good year last year i did not think bill cowher did a good job coaching in all the years i could remember the steelers were always coached very well by cohwer they were always motivated and got very few penalties however last year was different they seemed sloppy and not very well coached however i am not saying that the new coach mike tomlin will be a big improvement his first year but he will not be a big drop off from what cowher was last year however one problem the steelers will have is their secondary there is no doubt that troy polamalu will have another pro bowl season but the other cornerbacks and safeties will have to make a big improvement i think tomlin will help these defensive backs tomlin was the defensive backs coach with the tampa bay buccaneers so my prediction for the steelers this year is this may be a very generous prediction if they make the playoffs anything can happen Super Bowl XXIV Buffalo Bills Super Bowl XXVI Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl XXV St. Louis Rams National Football League Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XI September 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XVIII Super Bowl V Super Bowl XXXIV San Francisco 49ers NFL playoffs, 2002-03 American football strategy Ben Roethlisberger American football Minnesota Vikings Super Bowl XXVIII Super Bowl III Super Bowl Philadelphia Eagles Indianapolis Colts NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Jacksonville Jaguars Super Bowl XII Bill Cowher Oakland Raiders Glossary of American football Super Bowl XXII Super Bowl XVII Super Bowl XXXI Tony Dungy Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XXX Toronto Raptors Super Bowl VI December 2004 in sports NFL playoffs, 1982-83 Super Bowl XIX January 2005 in sports Super Bowl XXXVII October 2005 in sports Brett Favre Super Bowl I NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Tennessee Titans November 2004 in sports San Diego Chargers NFL playoffs, 2001-02 Dan Marino NFL playoffs, 1997-98 Denver Broncos Super Bowl XXXIII Donovan McNabb Running back NFL playoffs, 1995-96 Joe Gibbs New York Knicks NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Super Bowl XVI XFL 2005 Pro Bowl Los Angeles Kings Boston Bruins Defensive team Houston Rockets NFL playoffs, 1979-80 Super Bowl II Super Bowl XXXVIII Tampa Bay Lightning Indiana Pacers Monday Night Football Warren Sapp NFL playoffs, 1999-2000
