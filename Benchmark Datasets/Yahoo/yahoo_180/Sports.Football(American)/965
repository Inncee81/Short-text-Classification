fantasy football plz help on yahoo i saw the projected ranking of players the think that confusing me is that last year p manning had fan pts but he is projected at th overall and players like wille parker rudi johnson and joseph addia are front of him even thought they have less fan pts than p manning why is that can u tell me please running backs are definitely more importants than qbs mostly because the difference between the best running backs and the not as good running backs is so large many of the lesser known quarterbacks will give a fantasy team production almost as good as the top tier quarterbacks but there is a much bigger gap between the top running backs and the middle level rbs if your fantasy team has a middle tier quarterback and one or two top tier rbs and one or two top wrs it will do much better than if it has a top tier qb but no good rbs or wrs a good draft strategy is to wait until the rd or th round to draft a qb and draft a rb in the st round this is what i have done in my drafts years ago i won my league championship and went i had middle tier qbs brad johnson and mark brunell but top tier rbs like larry johnson and thomas jones and top tier wrs like santana moss and chris chambers last year i went losing in the championship with middle tier qbs in eli manning and rex grossman but with top tier rb in brian westbrook and top tier wrs in steve smith javon walker and donald driver combined record in years with top tier rbs and wrs and middle tier qbs obviously though the players who are top tier and middle tier change but the strategy stays the same tips for this year whatever you do dont draft eli manning my opinion he is not as good as advertised there are better qbs out there available at the same time also grab donald driver if you can maybe in round or later if he's still there he is so underrated but so good Pittsburgh Steelers Super Bowl XXVII Buffalo Bills San Francisco 49ers New York Jets Miami Dolphins Dallas Cowboys Carolina Panthers September 2005 in sports Super Bowl XIII New England Patriots Super Bowl XXI Donovan McNabb Kansas City Chiefs Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Browns Tennessee Titans American football Chicago Bulls Jacksonville Jaguars San Antonio Spurs V8 Supercar Indiana Pacers Green Bay Packers St. Louis Rams New York Mets Super Bowl XXVIII Houston Rockets Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XIV University of Florida United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics Super Bowl XXXVI Oakland Athletics Crystal Palace F.C.
