how to tackle da right way alright so ive been a kicker in football for the past years and nothing else this year im gonna be a soph either starting jv or starting varasity i kinda wanna play a d postion but i havnt been doing it in the team drills before i do i wanna have some sense of how to tackle can anybody help me out yo we have hell week right now and its fcking awful much of what john said is true however don't think you are just supposed to aimlessly fly into him unless in certain situations you have the sideline helping you out always have your shoulders square to the ball carrier it is no different than kicking a ball in this respect football coaches will often have you repeatedly practice getting into a breakdown position this is theoretically the perfect position to be tackling from your feet are even with the width of your shoulders toes pointed in slightly for balance slight squat when in this position nobody should be able to push you over one way or the other and then as john said wrap however don't just wrap explode facemask in their chest not the top crown of your helmet unless you like drinking through a straw forever wrap around the waist or the top of their thighs and pull him into you of course the ball carrier isn't going to making this easy you will sometimes slide off be hit harder juked miss on the wrap get stiff armed etc however if your shoulders are square and your feet are planted properly there is very little the ball carrier can do besides go all barry sanders on you finally remember you are one of men on the field if you've done all of the above properly odds are the worst thing that can happen to you is that you got run over however you slowed him down for one of your teammates to grab also be angry an angry person hits harder and more efficiently than someone just running around the field there is no number to explain it but making yourself hate the man you are tackling does an awful lot to the energy you let loose on contact Professional wrestling holds Glossary of American football Rugby union Volleyball American football Canadian football Cincinnati Bengals Professional wrestling attacks Equine conformation Australian rules football Carolina Panthers Rugby union positions Suplex Fast bowling Baseball New York Giants Norway national football team National Football League Lore Swingout Wing Chun Super Bowl XXVI Softball San Francisco 49ers Comparison of Canadian and American football New England Patriots Rugby league Super Bowl XXVII Water polo Diving Tackle (football) Pittsburgh Steelers Professional wrestling aerial techniques Tank Lineman (football) Tag Football (soccer) Parade (military) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Super Bowl XXIII Batting (cricket) Backstroke Super Bowl XXXVIII Tris Speaker Breaststroke Glossary of climbing terms Touch football (rugby league) Satchel Paige 2005 NFL season Snooker Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl IX Super Bowl XVII Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Protoss Babe Ruth Super Bowl III Marching band Powerbomb Super Bowl XXI Glossary of ballet terms Reggie Jackson New York Jets Super Bowl XIV Shaggy dog story Super Bowl XI Salute Cleveland Browns Rugby league positions Glossary of nautical terms Down (football) Team Fortress Classic DDT (professional wrestling) 2004 World Series Ty Cobb Violin The Marshall Mathers LP Shawn Michaels Tenshinhan Theory of conduct Offensive team Harrow Football Lindy Basic Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Super Bowl XIX Rugby football Paintball Spanking
