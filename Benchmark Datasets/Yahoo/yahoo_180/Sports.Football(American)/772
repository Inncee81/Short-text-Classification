how do you get better hands i play wr at my jv high school team and i run a i play st string wr but i always screw up because i am inconsistant at catching sometimes i catch everything and sometimes i drop every pass so i need to get better so i can catch any ball every time its thrown at me before my coach drops me to nd string plus i have an extra hard time catching bullets so please help on that thanks not to beat up on a previous answer but you want to try hard happen once that starts a few tips focus on counting how many time the laces rotate don't worry if you lose count that's not the point it just makes you focus on the ball more you could try gathering the ball as the ball comes to you grab it in with your hands and wrap your forearms around it i hope that makes sense get a dodge ball or playground ball and throw it off a wall at close range work on using your hands to grab the ball throw the ball hard so it comes back to you fast play catch from yards away make sure the person throwing you the ball isn't trying to kill you with it you just want to focus here on using your hands to catch the ball good luck Volleyball Aerial (dance move) American football Tag Dodgeball Glossary of American football Baseball Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Super Bowl XXVII New York Giants Four square Softball Professional wrestling holds Super Bowl IX Cleveland Browns National Football League Lore Tenshinhan Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl III American football strategy Cincinnati Bengals Super Bowl V Shaggy dog story Canadian football Professional wrestling match types Swingout Super Bowl XIV GunBound Naruto jutsu Fast bowling Table tennis Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Quarterback Super Bowl XIX Basketball Violin Super Bowl XI Pittsburgh Steelers Beer Pong 1957 World Series Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XXV Super Bowl XII Super Bowl X Wide receiver Professional wrestling throws Ravi Shastri Fielding (cricket) Team Fortress Classic English cricket team Super Bowl XXXIV New England Patriots Billiards Cricket Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Pedro Mart__nez NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Sandy Koufax Australian rules football Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Super Bowl XIII Ultimate (sport) Super Bowl XXI Squash (sport) Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Bullet Rugby union positions Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Paintball Super Bowl XVIII Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Side pass (dance move) Craps Equine conformation Professional wrestling attacks Carolina Panthers Water polo Super Bowl XXXI Suplex Drill bit Super Bowl XVII Professional wrestling aerial techniques Super Bowl XXXIII Mills Mess Stolen base No-hitter Gordon Banks Textile manufacturing Super Bowl XXII Football (soccer) Doom enemies
