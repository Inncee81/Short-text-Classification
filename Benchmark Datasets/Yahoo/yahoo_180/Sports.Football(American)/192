why do african american quaterbacks just get labled as running quaterback my point of view is that people like skip bayless on cold pizza cant accept that black qb's are multitalented and that they can throw but since that doesnt fall into the typical dropback passer mode that they are criticized i didnt know that in order to be looked at as a good qb you have to play the same as everyone else you know if whites had the ability to run ex i peyton manning could run whenever he is getting pressured he would do dat instead of running out of bounds i think its the stereotypes the owner's and gms who draft the quarterbacks have look at who owns all the nfl teams old white men coincidence i got this idea from the players who don't fit the stereotypes look at mike mcmahon he's faster than any qb except mike vick look it up but because he's white no one will give him credit he's always talked about as being surprisingly fast the surprise isn't like he got fast over the offseason all of a sudden because he's always been a great athlete the surprise is always that omg he's white any black qb with mcmahon's amount of talent would be given time to grow look at tarvaris jackson but since gms and owners see white quarterback they expect to see pocket passer quarterback so when guys like mcmahon fail to meet that stereotype they'll bounce around the league because they won't meet what gms imagine those players to be conversely look at a black qb byron leftwich who is a classic pocket passer no one will admit to him being a pocket passer however because he is black i've noticed that announcers scouts and others always note his lack of mobility when discussing him and they discount his game because of it what they don't admit is that leftwich runs about as well as any pocket qb and can scramble if need be sort of like tom brady's speed instead of focusing on his positives as a pocket qb they bemoan his inability to fit to their personal stereotypes of being a typical black qb i e your running qb i think its a few old idiots like skip bayless and others around his age like of the nfl owners and some of the gms again coincidence who keep these stereotypes going and now they've gotten into the collective unconscious of mainstream football fans so now its a common thing that all black qbs are supposed to be runners and all white qbs are supposed to be immobile personally i think if you can ball you can ball white black or green just bring your a game and lets stop the stereotypes American football New England Patriots Quarterback Canadian football San Francisco 49ers National Football League Glossary of American football Cincinnati Bengals Cleveland Browns Michael Vick Jacksonville Jaguars Tom Brady New York Giants Super Bowl I National Football League Lore Super Bowl XXXVI Passer rating Buffalo Bills American football strategy Super Bowl XXXVIII Super Bowl XXIII Super Bowl XXXIV Donovan McNabb Super Bowl XXVII Dan Marino Kansas City Chiefs Carolina Panthers Toronto Blue Jays Miami Dolphins Super Bowl V Super Bowl III Baltimore Ravens St. Louis Rams Super Bowl IX Brett Favre American Football League Comparison of Canadian and American football Super Bowl XXIV Dallas Cowboys Peyton Manning Oakland Raiders September 2005 in sports Negro league baseball Reggie Jackson Super Bowl XIII Defensive team ESPN Super Bowl XXI Super Bowl XI Super Bowl XXXIX Super Bowl XXII Vince McMahon Indianapolis Colts Kasparov versus The World Salary cap Volleyball Super Bowl XII Official (American football) Super Bowl XX Philadelphia Eagles NFL playoffs, 2004-05 Super Bowl X Theory of conduct Super Bowl XVIII Major League Soccer Australian rules football Fast bowling Terrell Owens XFL Glen Jacobs Joe Namath New York Jets Tris Speaker Satchel Paige NFL playoffs, 2002-03 Minnesota Vikings Oakland Athletics Toronto Argonauts NFL playoffs, 2003-04 Paintball Detroit Tigers Billiards Super Bowl XXXI Super Bowl XVII Basketball Poker jargon January 2005 in sports French Defence Super Bowl VI Arena football
