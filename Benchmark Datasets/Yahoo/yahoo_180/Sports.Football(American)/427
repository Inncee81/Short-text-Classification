how come when someone famous dies the murderer is never found a lot of famous people that i like have always ended up dead i loved darrent williams who played corner on the broncos pac and notorious big theyre all dead and no one has been charged with their murders there are shows on tv where detectives solve a murder case in hours did the detectives get tired after a couple hours its been years since pac and biggie died and its been about months since darrent williams died rip to every one of em and hopefully the people who killed em will do some time because most people dont like talking to the police on csi and shows like that its usually on sort of rich neighborhoods or places where no one is afraid to snitch The Notorious B.I.G.
