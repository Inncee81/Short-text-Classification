step parent adoption in new mexico my husband wants to adopt my oldest children from a previous relationship their ages are and i'm not sure of the laws or how to go about it their biological father has nothing to do with them hasn't seen or called them since the yr old was born my husband is the only dad they've ever known i'm not sure where they're biological father is and i have no way to contact him do i have to go to court so he can adopt them or can i just go through a lawyer or even possibly file papers myself and where to get them thanx for your answers you have to make an attempt to contact the biological father in order to do a stepparent adoption the easiest and fastest way to get a stepparent adoption done is with the non custodial parent's consent to the adoption since he has not contacted the children in over a year you can file for a stepparent adoption under abandonment charges since you do not know where the father is you are going to have to publish a public notice in the paper the notices usually run for about thirty days giving the non custodial parent time to see and to respond to the notice the non custodial parent in your case the father would not contact you directly if he were to see the notice he would respond to the courts if he sees the notice if he does not respond to the notice in the alloted time then the adoption will move forward as though he is consenting to the adoption while most states do not require that you have a lawyer for a stepparent adoption it really is best to hire one some lawyers charge a flat rate for a stepparent adoption but this is usually when the non custodial parent is aware of the adoption and consents to it as it is then only a matter of filing the papers and getting them signed by the judge having to serve a public notice adds both time and money to the adoption procedure for the actual adoption itself it differs from not only state to state but county to county in each state as to how that is handled some counties require an adoption hearing while others simply have the judge sign the papers and then mail them out to the family you will also need to check your local laws as to if you will need a guardian ad litem gal or not this is an attorney who is appointed to the child in some cases even when a state requires a gal the courts may waive it for a stepparent adoption it never hurts to ask look online at the website for your local government many courts now have forms available online to fill in and print out even if you use a lawyer you can still fill out the paperwork yourself lawyers usually give you their initial consultation for free so make sure that you speak to more than one before deciding on hiring a lawyer even quick adoptions are several months long and it is important to have a lawyer who matches your personality style before signing on to deal with him or her for the next few months you will need copies of each child's birth certificate as well as for you and your husband if you were married to the biological father you will need a copy of that marriage license along with the divorce and custody decree you will also need a copy of the marriage license for you and your current husband all of these documents can take several days to weeks to obtain depending on the state who holds the records so you will want to start on that as soon as you can while a homestudy is usually required for adoptions this is typically waived for stepparent adoptions since the children have already been living as a family with the stepparent stepparent adoptions usually start at about although i have seen lawyers who will charge a flat rate of for stepparent adoptions when the non custodial parent consents adoptions which require a public notice are usually around now this changes depedning on the area that you live in the price of the notice as well as what your lawyers hourly rate is but it is a good ballpark figure while you can get off cheaper removing the legal fees and doing the adoption yourself having the peace of mind of knowing that everything is done and done right is really worth paying a lawyer for it would be a shame to have an adoption denied or overturned due to an error in the paperwork good luck on your stepparent adoption journey you can check out the link below for more information on stepparent adoptions
