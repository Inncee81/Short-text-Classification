advice on parenting i am in the process of adopting my cousin she will be in sept and i am turning in march i also have an month old baby she lives in mi in a foster home she and her younger sister already adopted by the family she was placed with were put in foster care in seperate homes years ago after their father molested them she has since developed r a d reactive attachment disorder she is now indescrimiately affectionate and becomes attached to almost anyone she meets last month her fathers parental rights were finally revoked and she became available for adoption no one else in my family stepped up for her so i did and i have been approved she will be comming to stay with me and my family in fl in weeks this will be a trial placement for months then we will go back up north to get it finalized now for the question does anyone have any advice on raising a child only years younger has anyone delt with her kind of rad how about a year old and an infant good for you for having the guts to do this it's not an easy decision to make i think one thing you have to try and remember is to not get carried away and become just friends it's important to have a good relationship but she has to respect you in order to listen to you and in order for your oppionion to matter the good thing is that the gap is small and she may be able to relate to you better take advantage of that but don't let her think of you the way she thinks of her school friends about the rad i have never had any experience with it but i read a little bit about it it seems it's something she developed due to the abuse and neglect she went through do some research and talk to a specialist but i think if you just show her the love and affection she deserves without overdoing it she 'll improve gradually show her you're not going anywhere and you're there for her make her understand she has to follow the rules like everyone else at home and she's loved and wanted like everyone else too no more no less she's one of the family what she needs is security and she'll start to feel that gradually as far as the baby is concerned i wouldn't put them in the same room give her her own space but let her interact with the baby too having her lelp out with him too will make her feel needed and also will make her care for him a lot more you'll need lots of patience it won't be easy i 'm wishing you lots of luck and courage and i admire you very much for doing this Adoption Theory of conduct Infantilism Laura Schlessinger Social rule About a Boy Abortion debate Reactive attachment disorder Attachment theory Friends Narcissism Extreme Programming Breastfeeding 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Jon Secada Neighbours Kodocha Charmed Pitaten Royal Assent Socrates She Loves You Second language acquisition Family Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Transsexuality Clinical depression Humphrey Bogart Postpartum depression Theodicy Melanie Wilkes Child sexuality Divorce Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Borderline personality disorder Time Out of Mind Androgen insensitivity syndrome The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.
