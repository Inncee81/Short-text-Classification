open adoptions my room mate just found out she is pregnant she is considering giving the baby up for adoption she can not keep the baby because she and the father are still in college and both parents refuse to help them out financially or emotionally she is very upset she knows that if she keeps the baby that she will have to drop out of school and the baby will not have the quality of life it deserves but again she doesn't know if she will be able to give the baby up for adoption either it's very hard for her to consider loving someone so much and giving it away i mentioned to her that she could have an open adoption i was wondering though has anyone ever been involved in anything like this being the one who gave the child away or the person adopting we would like to know the good and the bad also if you see your child still thanks for all your help it is a very tough time for all of us if she wants the baby but just doesn't see how she will take care of it she will probably end up regretting giving it up for adoption every time she sees the baby it will break her heart she will want it back but it will be too late it will kill her for the baby to call the other person mommy i think she should keep the baby and get assistance with child care while she is at her classes all she has to do it prove her income does not allow her to pay for childcare she could get wic food stamps free medical care etc she would only have to buy diapers and clothes Infantilism Kodocha Pitaten Knots Landing Diaper Parenting Friends Miss Saigon Adoption Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fathers' rights Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ageplay Childcare The McGuire Sisters Hollyoaks EastEnders Charmed Theory of conduct Childbirth Neighbours Fecal incontinence One Tree Hill (TV series) Lazarus Long Alois Hitler Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Urinary incontinence Kimi Finster Good Times Abortion in the United States Transactional analysis Health insurance Infant Piccolo Junior Saga Child abuse Something Positive The Amber Spyglass Day care Hera Baby Blues Shit Jon Secada Jam (TV series) Cytomegalovirus Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) The Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Cerebral palsy About a Boy Marriage Divorce Characters in the Smurfs Strong Medicine Characters of Lost Drawn Together Kyle Broflovski In vitro fertilisation RuneScape quests Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Le Malade imaginaire Angelina Jolie Days of our Lives Eddie Guerrero Poker jargon Full House Children of God Incarnations of Immortality Boston Public Polyamory Pregnancy Division of labour Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Social rule Frankie Laine Comanche Fathers' rights movement in the UK Justification (theology) Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show The Inside Code: Lyoko The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Childfree Sin City The Critic Feminists for Life Clint Eastwood Dinah Marler Flat tax The Shining (film) Pet skunk Rugrats Emergency Medical Services Grumpy's Three Wishes
