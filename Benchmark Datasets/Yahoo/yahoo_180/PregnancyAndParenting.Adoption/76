looking for parents who have put they're child up for adoption and people who were put up for adoption okay so the deal is i think i may be pregnant i find out tomorrow i want to keep it but my boyfriend of over a year and a half does not want a child im young years young i honestly think i can do it but my boyfriend almost says its going to ruin his life i love him and dont want to do that to him and i dont want to lose him but im not sure how i can cope with all of this parents how did you cope with putting your child up for adoption how did you feel seeing your child then well not letting it go but yeah and any aditional details people who were adopted put up for adoption how do you currently feel about your birth parent s how did you used to feel about them do you wish that you knew your birth parents are you angry any aditional details so basically im looking for advice and answers please help i dont want to make the wrong decision and regret it later if i decide to keep it we talked before and got in a huge fight over it how can i get him to understand where im comming from and support me oh and idk if i said it before but i know the decision is entirely left up to me but im in love with my boyfriend and i dont want him to feel left out of the dissicion making unless there is a way i can alter his dissicion into the same as mine then i will have no problem with his input p but it still bothers me to think that i would leave him out of this completely i mean this is our lives not just mine nothing wrong with including him in the decision making process but you are more affected than he is simply because you're the one who will be carrying the baby and if you chose to parent the baby you'll be in the trenches if you choose to make an adoption plan you'll be the one to carry more of that emotionally i believe the time for him to be thinking about whether or not to be brining a baby into the world would have been before he slept with a year old that is just my opinion though ok now onto your situation go and get the test done to find out whether or not this is even an issue if you're pregnant you can provide for the child then begin to make plans to be the parent that the child needs with or without your boyfriend's help btw if you lose him over this situation he wasn't worth keeping around again just my opinion this might include you getting a ged it might include seeing if you have a friend or relative to watch the baby while you finish school finishing school in some form or fashion though is imperative don't neglect this after you're done with school you can find a job to pay the bills it will be a difficult road filled with sacrifices but you won't have sacrificed being this child's mom now if you decide that you aren't able to be the parent that the child needs then look toward making an adoption plan contact a lawyer or agency don't answer ads here or elsewhere you never know what might happen make appointments with several interview them ask for references call those references see how people feel about having worked with them and if they'd work with them again if the situation warranted also check online to see if you can find folks who aren't on the reference list ask them the same questions select the right agency or attorney move on from there from there you can decide how open you want the adoption to be it can be closed where you have no contact whatsoever it can be open where you have regular contact with the child and adoptive family it can be anywhere in between including some visits annual pictures and updates or whatever fits your needs and the child's needs the best you get to decide how open you want the adoption to be consider what is best for the child make your decision i am the mom to two adopted girls and one foster girl and two biological sons my foster daughter has regular contact with her birth mother and birth aunt it's been a good thing for her to maintain that connection my adopted daughters were adopted internationally so they can't maintain a relationship with their birth family while the adoption was a positive thing for them they grieve the loss of their birth family it's something that hurts me to see them go through i hope this helps Friends Adoption EastEnders Charmed Theory of conduct Kodocha Knots Landing Fathers' rights Social rule Pitaten Infantilism Humphrey Bogart Abortion debate History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Everwood Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jean Grey Grief Polyamory Neighbours Androgen insensitivity syndrome Marilyn Monroe Phoebe Halliwell Boston Public Cindy Sheehan Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair Domestic violence Dinah Marler W.I.T.C.H.
