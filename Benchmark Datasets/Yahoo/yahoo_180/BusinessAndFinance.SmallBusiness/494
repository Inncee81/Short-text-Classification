can i deduct paving of driveway necessary for home business i just had my driveway paved which was necessary for business deliveries trucks to my home the office portion is the barn situated beyond the house can i expense the whole thing because of this if so should i classify this as payment to a subcontractor thanks it depends on what your business is and and if it is used strictly by the business traffic or if it also accesses your private residence you may be able to take a portion of the cost and apply it as a business expense it would go under building improvements or transportation costs if you produce a product delivery costs should be adjusted to include a portion of it because the driveway is required to receive goods and is considered a variable cost you need to consult your tax dept regarding the amount allowable as a business expense if the property is owned by the business and you live on it you can consider the house part of the business and of the costs can be applied but if you just have a section of it used for the business say of the property space is for your business then probably only of the driveway costs can be used as a business expense Gross domestic product Insurance Taxation in the United States Microeconomics United States Postal Service Tax FairTax Sport utility vehicle Social Security (United States) Publicly funded medicine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Mortgage 401(k) Public transport United Kingdom corporation tax Wal-Mart Student loan Road transport Flat tax Easement Public good Hybrid vehicle Supply and demand Leasing Economy of India Food Stamp Program American individualist anarchism Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Big Dig Property (ownership right) Credit card Capitalism Property tax CPU cache Surplus value Compiler optimization Economy of the United States Street Intellectual property McMansion Biodiesel Toll road Capital accumulation Highway London Congestion Charge National Weather Service Enterprise resource planning Income statement Production theory basics Welding Freeway Productive and unproductive labour Wood Tax deduction Passenger car Affton, Missouri Urban sprawl Capital gains tax Airport Economics Zoning Free trade Hiawatha Line Arlington County, Virginia Personal finance Wayne Corporation Faux frais of production Transport in Sudan Inventory Transformer General Dynamics F-111 General aviation Inflation Unemployment Operating surplus Transportation of Los Angeles Sewage treatment Small business Child support Energy development Keynesian economics Just In Time Mail Space Shuttle program Asset Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Autonomous building Cost Income trust Progressive tax Information Services Procurement Library Divorce Light rail Alcohol fuel E85
