i want to own a franchise then my own business what should i major in years old here sophmore my major is business management a community college currently have a gpa so i planned to transfer to a year college rutgers currently i plan to own a franchise in my early 's i then possibly want to open my own business after i get my feet wet with franchising or more franchises my goal this is the problem i am not very good at math i am only in college to have something to fall back on i know you do not need a degree to be a business man i already invest of a million dollars in stocks mutual funds etc etc from an accident early on in life i am extremely confused on what to do at this point in my life i orginally wanted to graduate with an associates and get into business but now im starting to believe i need a year just incase what do you think i should major in if you were in my situation i really want to do business however i really am terrible in math and i am afraid to do bad or fail what would u major in also growing up all my friends fathers were very successful business men i've always had the mentality that college is not necessary for what i want to achieve in life because i have money on the side invested please be realistic here and realize that i am not the most school oriented student here and infact i dislike school a lot however i know i need something to fall back on please answer this question from a realistic stand point and not you can do it if you put your mind to it thank you all this is my advise transfer to a four year live on campus and while you pursue whatever major interests you have fun and screw every cute girl you can it is college it is preparation for real life and basically all college teaches you is how to make critical informed decisions based on self based research while requiring and developing the ability to perform your work through self motivation and that is really it besides to open a franchise all you really need is money in the bank and a desire to dedicate yourself to the success of your business most franchised business' won't even talk to you without you having or more in assets but they don't care if you never even finished high school just that you are finacially ready to invest in their company honestly it is less expensive to start your own business rather than a franchise a franchise will require you to pay a franchise fee the start up costs and most require residual royalties over the life of your business as well although a franchise is less risk due mainly to brand recognition it is much more work and much more expensive also you have to do things as the franchise says not what you want anyway go to college for the experience and to gain important knowledge not so you have something to fall back on construction jobs are for that live it up and enjoy life while you are allowed to just set your goals one at a time and pursue thier accomplishment and then it is on to the next goal that is how you will suceed that is what you ought to do you need an mba to do anything in the big business world anyhow so just keep that in mind and know that owning a small business is not easy Mutual fund Graduate school Theory of conduct Education in the People's Republic of China Microcredit Capital accumulation Insurance Deflation (economics) Warren Buffett Citigroup Grade (education) W.
