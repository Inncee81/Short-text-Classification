what do you need to do to open an online business i was thinking of opening up a websites and i'd be selling information not an actual physical product more of a how to guide figured though i need 'business name' to make it seem legit so wasn't sure with making a business bank account if i needed to register this or anything also if it makes a difference i came up with this all on my own no research or anything nothing or no one to really influence me just came out of the blue without getting into if its sellable or not just seeing if i have to go register my business and get a license anywyas to try to relate what my product is lets say you had a bunch of apples and you decided to cut them up and throw them into a pot then added some roast beef and fried chicken and orange juice fresh squeezed and it somehow tasted good so you decided to sell your recipe online litterally it would be secure credit card payment then either still working it out with my friend who is designing the site you download the stuff as a word document or you get it e mailed to you basically i know it'll get leaked onto the internet expect the business to only be good for weeks all completely legal and not immoral but ultra conservative low end estimates has this netting k i figure i might as well go forward and do this sounds like you should just charge a membership fee or viewing fee you'll have to set up online payment and a privacy policy for payment information you shouldn't need a license for anything like that but you will have to pay taxes on your income couldn't tell you much about that part Trademark Gross domestic product Copyleft Microeconomics Apple Computer Internet fraud Intellectual property Electronic commerce Tax Identity theft Credit card Copyright Insurance Spyware United Kingdom corporation tax Taxation in the United States GNU General Public License Commodore International Skype Corporation Credit card fraud Postage stamp Open source culture Open-source software Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Opera (web browser) Wal-Mart Bank Child pornography Mortgage Surveillance Bond Pretty Good Privacy Poker jargon Domesticated turkey Gold standard FairTax EFTPOS Barbecue Open access Free trade Surplus value Online shop Productive and unproductive labour Economy of India Electronic money Microsoft Atari 8-bit family Chili con carne United States Postal Service Google Phishing Gmail Common criticisms of Microsoft Password British national identity card Windows Vista Ramen Life insurance Euro Social Security (United States) Citigroup E-mail London Congestion Charge Tesco Tofu Spam (electronic) Windows XP Economy of Russia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Advance fee fraud Kazaa Bank fraud Hamburger Mail fraud Primerica Financial Services Capital accumulation Schabir Shaik Trial Cuisine of Denmark Extreme Programming X Window System Value added tax Neopets E-mail spam Podcasting Measures of national income and output Cajun cuisine Corporate governance Rum Screenplay Bretton Woods system Microsoft Windows Law of value
