i want to renew a domain name wich i bought together with a hosting plan i don't longer have this hosting but i need the domain name how can i solve this the renewal for the domain name should be separate from that of the site plan from the host it was for me when i did the same thing as you check your information when you signed up and how you signed up you should have to go to the host's site but log in to a separate section for your domain name account hey john why don't you just copy and paste my name instead of trying to guess the number of j's how easy is that seems for someone who is speaking of doing something an easy way that this would be a cinch yours might be a good solution if he wanted to change hosts as well since he doesn't state that he wants to or even that he currently has a host then i offerered up nothing more he simply asked about retaining the domain name for now saying nothing about having a site that it would be attached to at the present nor even wishing to have it attached to a site right now perhaps you need to take another look at the question Wheel of Fortune Public domain E-mail Domain Name System Gmail Password Windows XP Enterprise content management Theory of conduct Hey Jude Sudoku E-mail spam The Amazing Race Trademark Quantum computer Expert system Monty Hall problem BitTorrent Web traffic Internet fraud Theodicy Rove Live Eucharist Mach kernel Have I Got News For You $ale of the Century CPU cache You Don't Know Jack Whois Extreme Programming Crossword Richard Feynman Spam (electronic) Anthroposophy Modem Bill Maher Plame affair timeline Plame affair PHP X Window System German grammar RuneScape cheats Collision detection Subjunctive mood Pretty Good Privacy Cyprus dispute Philosophy of language Asset Copy protection Aida (musical) Jeff Gannon Notary public Sharon Tate Abortion debate Consensus decision-making FairTax Sender Policy Framework Ethernet Hash table Visual Basic Halting problem On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Complexity classes P and NP Jiddu Krishnamurti The nature of God in Western theology Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Computer virus Web hosting Ken Jennings Debugging Diablo II: Lord of Destruction AmigaOS Goatse.cx Criticism of Prem Rawat America Online Capitalism Philosophical Investigations Parsifal Private branch exchange UK Singles Chart 2005 United States Grand Prix Grid computing Web crawler Copyright English grammar Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
