should i give up on my ebay package almost two months ago i bought a package of a lot of about books a month after it didn't arrive the seller sent a check back money fully refunded she said the package got lost but she'll keep an eye out for it and tell me it's been almost another month now should i give up about once a week i kindly remind her to find that package for me i checked her feedback and the last five are all neutral complaining of a long shipping but getting the items nonetheless i guess i'm the one person who gets nothing from her then it'd be around extra getting the books myself added to the original price i paid her and if she does find them it's all for free i have had things from ebay take a while to ship before though i don't think that long but anyway i'd just say give up if she refunded your money you are really out nothing by the way next time if they offer shipping insurance or tracking or anything maybe you should go that route never hurts it may end up tacking a little extra charge to the shipping but it'd probably be worth it if you really want to know the status of the package Internet fraud Microeconomics Wheel of Fortune United States Postal Service Poker jargon London Congestion Charge Amazon.com Price discrimination Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Philatelic investment Tax Taxation in the United States Value added tax Short selling FairTax Insurance Live 8 Ocean's Twelve EastEnders Home Box Office Mac OS X Advance fee fraud Money Octopus card Warranty Mozilla Firefox ROM image Bulk vending Commodity markets Islamic banking Topps Chrono Trigger Mutual fund Make money fast Warren Buffett Neopets Auction Nine Inch Nails Publicly funded medicine Wal-Mart Discus (fish) The Joker's Wild PayPal RuneScape economy Common criticisms of Microsoft Hollywood Squares Life insurance Health insurance Final Fantasy XI Dot-com Arbitrage Annuity E-mail spam Enron Corporation Hyperinflation Textbook R.E.M.
