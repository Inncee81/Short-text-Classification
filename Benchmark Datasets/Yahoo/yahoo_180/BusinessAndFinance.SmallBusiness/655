tips on running a coffee shop ok so i want to run a coffee shop in san francisco when i'm older a place where people can go to hang out or to do some work on their computers and to read i'm going to make muffins provide coffee and other things that a normal coffee shop has i'm going to open it at around am im going to have a section for people to be able to use their computers a section where they can read and a place to eat and hang out any tips at all for helping me make this business successful and to make my coffee shop popular thanks okay you'll need to have two 'levels' one for computer users one for readers and there will always be some who just want 'coffee and a bite' who will 'sit wherever they want ' while you say you will 'make' the muffins that is not a good idea for one thing you'll want a 'good variety' of 'ediibles' not just muffins and can 'contract' those for less than the cost for you to 'bake them in house' you'd need a full 'commercial bakery' behind the shop which will triple the 'cost' of the 'coffee shop ' next are you going to have just coffee bad idea you'll want to serve a 'variety of drinks' drip coffee espresso latte iced and hot tea herb tea and even some milk and some good sodas for edibles you should have things like muffins scones croissants and english muffins plus some 'sandwiches' and possibly some salads and always have at least one 'soup' for lunch i've lived in sf and you will 'need soup' year 'round which you should 'change daily' or you could do up to three different soups and 'keep' one for every day a basic 'vegetable soup' and change the other two always have 'clam chowder' available on fridays next you'll need to think of 'seating' and 'flow' also things like 'bussing' cleaning the tables after customers leave and keeping the whole 'shop' clean and the 'seating' and 'plugs' for people who don't want to use a 'battery' up on their computer will you have any computers that people can 'rent' or use for free what will you put as 'software' on those and where will you put them and how will people 'pay' to use them how many seats think in terms of 'tops' restaurants use the term how many 'two tops ' how many 'four tops ' and how many 'long tables' where either 'singles' can sit or a large group could sit what about 'books ' would you want to 'sell new books' you could open 'right next door' to an independant bookstore and just 'cut a door through' that works well in the city i now live in or just let people 'donate' the books they don't want and others 'take them away ' you'll need to 'keep records' and have a 'real plan' or you could end up with far too many books or far too few books then there's the biggest thing you'll need to know before you ever open your doors customer flow how you will 'advertise' and what the ads say will do a lot to 'determine' the type of 'customer' you get also your 'location' will influence that too you can't open a place for 'homeless' to gather in a high end shop andy more than you can expect to get 'high end customers' in a shop next door to a 'homeless hotel ' also in sf you have one other 'thing' to think about the 'sexuality' of the customers you want do you want 'no gays' or 'all gays' or 'a combination fo straights and gays' or no straights all straights or a combination of what about 'security' what will you do if a homeless person comes in and falls asleep at a table with or without buying a cup of coffee will you want 'cops as customers' to be your security or will you want to hire a 'clerk' who can become a 'bouncer' as needed you have a 'lovely idea' and i am not trying to get you to decide to 'quit' but you must think everything through for now since you are 'still in school' try to take as many 'business courses' as you can including one in 'business planning' because the first thing you'll need is a 'good business plan' to know 'what you know what you need to learn and what to 'delegate' to others ' i wish you already had a 'name and address' of your 'future coffee shop' because my husband and i will visit san francisco in the future and i would love to walk in and 'introduce myself' and congratulate you on 'a job well done ' i know you'll do it because you are 'already there' in your head all you need is a 'little help' to get you there in reality Cha chaan teng Coffee Cuisine of Denmark In-N-Out
