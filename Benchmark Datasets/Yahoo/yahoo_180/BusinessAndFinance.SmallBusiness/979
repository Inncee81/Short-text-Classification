how do you get your film playing at small local theaters suppose i made an independent film would i need a license to rent it to local theaters and how would i get it on the big reels they use would it need to win a film festival to be shown how long of a film do you think you can make without a big budget most of the independents still run six figures and take off from there let's say you have made a film if you go to the independent movie houses you may be able to talk to the manager about a special showing offer it for free they are not likely to buy an unknown's work no matter how good he she will likely want to watch it first this is a long shot but stranger things have happened your amc regal and other franchised theaters are not likely to touch it because for them it is all about the income they can get from the film do you have community access television in your area these local independent stations are often looking for filler material or something new especially if it is locally produced that could generate a following and put you on the road to bigger and better things don't despair keep at it your personal drive and ambition are what will keep the dream alive until it happens for you good luck Movie theater Serial Motion picture rating system Cable television Mystery Science Theater 3000 Monopoly (game) Wheel of Fortune Television syndication Craps ITV Lauren Bacall Canon (fiction) Our Gang Sharon Tate Fahrenheit 9/11 Widescreen Movie studio Filmmaking Anamorphic widescreen Theory of conduct RKO Pictures American Motors The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie IBM PC compatible Property (ownership right) William Shatner Reservoir Dogs Tokusatsu Jennifer Lopez Channel 4 Movie projector Cinema of Canada KTTV The Rocky Horror Picture Show Film KCAL-TV Anime Dream Theater Care Bears Luck AMC Theatres Media in Ireland Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Animation in the United States in the television era Martin Lawrence The Riordans Royal Rumble WGNT Last Action Hero November (film) Doctor Who spin-offs Petula Clark Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Reel Retcon Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Meat Loaf $ale of the Century The Price Is Right Star Trek Grand Forks, North Dakota B-movie GNU General Public License Scenes from a Memory Julia Stiles Radio drama Back to the Future St. Louis Cardinals Field of Dreams GoldenEye Nintendo MTV UPN The Jazz Singer Paramount Pictures WGTW-TV Cult film Trailer (movie) Manos: The Hands of Fate Cyberspace Samuel Goldwyn Social rule Paul W.
