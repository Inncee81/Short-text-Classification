gardening business idea hi im trying to help out my father he has a gardening business he runs on his own he has about yrs of experience and is a hard worker he has a good reputation and clientel he is almost and well i dont want him to work to hard by himself anymore he makes good money but just want to take care of the family i would like some ideas for him to expand his business by internet or by word of mouth such as a gardening consulant or something just any ideas that i can make happen thru the internet so that he wont work to much but be able to make a living we are from la but maybe thinking of moving to las vegas i will be out of the military by the end of the year so whatever helps thanks maybe something online will be cool i want to focus on the internet helping out with the business thanks if you help him expand his business you should be there to help him run it talk to him about it first and if he's ok with it wait until you're out of the military to expand his business without helping him take on the extra work load would mean he'd have to work harder to stay afloat and that would be the opposite of what you want to do Extreme Programming W.
