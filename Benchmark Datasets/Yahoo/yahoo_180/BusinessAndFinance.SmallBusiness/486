how can i start my own daycare business please help i rent my home but my landlord is ok with my proposal if your landlord okays it then you should be fine you will need to be approved and be licensed if you plan to care for more than x number of kids you'll have to check your area to see what that amount is and you will want a liability policy separate from your regular homeowner's liability policy in case one of the kids or parents gets hurt i would also make sure i got in writing from the landlord that it is okay to have the daycare business at the house by allowing you to do so the landlord is opening himself up to liabilities as well right now he may not realize that and once he does he may change his mind in allowing you to have it there Leasehold estate Day care Insurance Mortgage Estoppel Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Mediation Leasing FairTax Rent control Babylonian law Eviction Home insurance Accounting methods Identity theft Interplay Entertainment Tort reform Corporation Property tax Auto insurance Modding Liability Limited liability company Surveillance Lloyd's of London German car number plates Medical malpractice Income statement Hearsay Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Publicly funded medicine Government of Maryland MPAA film rating system Judiciary of Hong Kong Monopoly (game) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Smoking ban Open Directory Project Conscription Nuclear power Waste (law) Warranty Education in Japan Zhao Ziyang United States v.
