im wanting to start an orphanage childrens home i am wanting any info on it including legal issues in africa hi kirsty i've just been reading all your questions and it sounds like a cool idea lots of need for it my church are very involved with an orphanage out in uganda i've included the weblink so you can read about it and contact them if you want to ask and q's about how they go about it i know it's a different place to namibia but i imagine some issues will overlap it would seem good to me to test the water first i don't know how old you are how much experience you've had of living abroad in different cultures especially namibia who do you know out there as far as i can see it would be very challenging and dangerous to set up an orphanage anywhere on your own with no proper support network and even more so in a different culture it's tough demanding work how much experience have you already got of working in and supporting a namibian orphanage i don't want to put you off by all these questions cos i do think it's a great idea if you take things a step at a time with this ugandan orphanage day to day it's run by africans themselves we didn't start the orphanage it was initiated and funded by africans a few ppl from our church got to know people out there and decided to support it as the african leader was struggling so now we fund it teams go out to visit from time to time at the very least once a year we've initiated various projects over there building work latrine work beds a baby unit you could contact someone for exact details to run this orphanage day to day it costs per month there are kids there that's a very basic standard of living i think often they might just have one bowl of gruel type food in a day the orphanage has a school too so the money covers food accomodation and education i think fund raising has been a bit challenging but as a lot of people have got involved it's probably not so bad now we're a charity which probably makes it easier there's a reasonable supporter base we put events on get involved in local festivals several companies have shown support we run car boots etc etc it sounds potentially difficult to transport clothes goods etc over there we've had a lot of donations but so far it's seemed much better to largely just send out money and buy stuff over there more economical boosts the local economy however i know there has been talk of sending some containers out you could ask about that Plame affair 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup Theory of conduct Economy of Namibia Microeconomics W.
