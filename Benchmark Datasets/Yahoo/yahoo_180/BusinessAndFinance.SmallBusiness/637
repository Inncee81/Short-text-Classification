how do pampered chef consultants earn trips i'm considering joining the pampered chef forces and i'm just wondering how exactly you earn free trips i would love to go to some of the places that people earn trips to and i'm just wondering how that works their incentive program is broken down into points you get one point for every dollar of product you sell when you start up and do your first shows they give you points for becoming an active consultant when you recruit others and they do their first shows you recieve another points for them becoming active consultants when you promote to another level you earn points or if a consultant you recruited promotes you also earn points they have different levels of incentives at each level you can choose to go on the trip or take a gift certificate for if you for some reason can't go on the trip or you don't want to i started working as a consultant at the end of one year and i didn't know how the points really worked i figured to qualify you had to sell all the time so i never even gave it a second thought half way through my second year i realized i had already acheived the first level and was well on my way to earning the second the second level was a trip to san francisco we had just been to san fransisco that year so i opted for the gift certificate it was and i went to best buy and bought the best sony digital video camera available i would never have spent that much money on a video camera but it was my reward and i wanted something amazing to keep up with my small children i am so grateful for the pampered chef for giving me that option this year if you earn the second level they will send you on a carribean cruise for days i will easily earn the third level which is a trip for all expenses paid to london for days and nights or you could choose to go to washington d c on a trip for if you earn the th level you earn an extra day and an extra night it isn't difficult to earn the trips it just comes down to running a consistant business and keeping track of where you are and what you want to achieve let me know if you have any questions Wheel of Fortune Neopets The Apprentice 2 Microeconomics Amway Grand Theft Auto (game) Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Animal Crossing Labour economics San Francisco 49ers Emotions (album) Capitalism The Amazing Race $ale of the Century Digital photography Mutual fund Poker jargon Insurance Education in the People's Republic of China The Ashlee Simpson Show Unemployment benefit Berkshire Hathaway ITunes Music Store Wal-Mart Taxation in the United States Torquay United F.C.
