why is everyone going to china for parts etc i have a small business in chgo area we will have to close soon due to our clients going to china for parts that cost less has anyone been concerned about this delimma recent stories reflect badly on china lead in paint for kid's toys recall of food etc why can't americans buy american so what if it costs a little more parts made in america by american citizens keep the jobs here i'm so angry about this i could bust than there's walmart what of their products are made in china wake up america well first of all not everything in china is bad china is a quickly devoloping country and is encountering growing pains however american business operates on the principle that cheaper is better that is primarily because americans are greedy and want to make more money china doesnt allow the same type of labor unions our country does and the cost of living is much lower in china therefore they pay there employees less most of which may not be as skilled as employees in america are expected to be that is why the big three american automakers are suffering so badly for years they outsourced parts from mexico and canada why because they could produce parts cheaper because they dont have labor unions usually people in a union are paid more as they are seen as highly skilled laborers however in mexico the cost of living is much lower than here stateside so they simply pay there employees less thereby reducing the cost of manufacturing a product so that they can sell it for cheaper that is part of the reason that the big three are having such a hard time that fact itself is giving people the wrong idea why buy american if its made in canada well if americans werent so money hungry and expected full benefits from their parent company they wouldnt need to outsource paying a union to produce an individual part can cost gm three or four times what it would cost to have it made in mexico and if they depended on unions to produce every part the ford focus would cost three times what it does now that doesnt make you very competitive on top of that gm is still paying for full medical benefits for employees that are retired most of those have their spouses insured and it is costing gm millions if not billions of dollars so they need a way to save money even if you arent in a union usually skilled laborers are paid more in the u s because we simply cant afford not to get paid at a given rate i am sorry that you are losing your job because somewhere there is a guy in a plush office who will make a ton of money because he is outsourcing a product from china and i do agree that is wrong but then so is most of america these days and if the car example isnt good for your situation i just know its based on the same principle it all comes down to saving a couple of bucks if some of these companies actually thought about their employees i would respect them more but on the same token their own employees can run a company into the ground especially if they are in a union by not being cooperative when it comes to cutting cost Outsourcing Wal-Mart Unemployment Offshoring Insurance Free trade Tariff Capitalism Microeconomics Labour economics Social Security (United States) Health insurance Life insurance Economy of the United States Sweatshop Delta Air Lines Capital accumulation Canadian and American health care systems compared Canadian and American economies compared Citigroup Keynesian economics Airline Kyoto Protocol Illegal drug trade 401(k) Privatization American individualist anarchism Minimum wage Economy of Russia Supply and demand Law of value Bulk vending Trade union Economic inequality Flat tax Intellectual property Social Security debate (United States) Monetary policy Unemployment benefit Education in the People's Republic of China Publicly funded medicine Tax Economics Freeters Cooperative Annuity Hyperinflation Taxation in the United States FairTax Famine Surplus value Great Depression Bretton Woods system Primerica Financial Services Filling station Divorce Marshall Plan Economy of India United States Postal Service Sport utility vehicle Anarchism and capitalism Arbitrage Natural monopoly Pharmaceutical company Conscription Economy of Africa Poker jargon Biodiesel Labor theory of value Blackjack Affirmative action Economy of Norway Economy of Belgium Say's law Food and Drug Administration Mortgage Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 MMORPG Reaganomics Health care in the United States Externality Canadian dollar Gross domestic product Trade United States dollar Protectionism Tort reform Economy of Macau Unemployment types
