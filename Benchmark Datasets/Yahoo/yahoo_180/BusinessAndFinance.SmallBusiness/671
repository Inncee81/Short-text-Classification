which job is better ups or telemarketing job for college student i work for ups but offered a call center job i don't know which one is best they pay the same offer good hours but call center has weekends with out optional meaning i must work weekends for a year i don't know i'm a student and need some spending money but i'm a lazy person and its hot as heck this summer can someone tell me what its like to work in call center enviroment too thanks i am a loader and the call center is not telemarketing it is phone interviews for customer satisfaction s it depends on the type of callcenter if you're talking telemarketing you'll be calling people and trying to sell them something and your pay will likely be mostly comission based if you sell more product then you get more money the stress is probably much higher that being said you'll likely be in a nice air conditioned room so it's comforatble in the summer if it's telemarketing for the alumni association you'll be making calls to graduates of the college asking for donations reading from a script that they give you i hope that helps since it's not a sales telemarketing job and it pays the same as ups and it's indoors air conditioned and you claim to be lazy the question seems to be should you switch from a labor job that gives you your weekends to a desk job the eats up your weekends personally i think i'd rather have my weekends given that choice but if the heat work is too much for you go for the call center job you can always talk up the call center job in a resume highlighting your excellent communication skills good luck Telemarketing Call centre Singlish The Apprentice 2 Social rule Graduate school Air traffic controller Ocean's Twelve Predictive dialer Direct marketing Education in the United States Internet fraud Wal-Mart Customer relationship management Unemployment United Parcel Service Contract Microeconomics Education in the People's Republic of China Animal Crossing JR Digs Economic inequality Sales College admissions Academia Hollywood Squares Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
