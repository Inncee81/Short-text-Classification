ebay problem i bought an ipod on ebay and after more than a week the seller contacts me and says that her supplier's ipods were not up to par and wanted to refund my money back instead she said to wait days for the supplier to refund her so that she can transfer that money to my paypal account it has been four days now and i've tried to contact her twice but i still havn't gotten a reply yet i sent her another email saying if i don't get my refund soon i would file a dispute what should i do now she has over feedback and positive the ipods were a buy it now option and multiple other people also bought the same ipod since there were many available i had a similar issue a year ago i waited awhile and the seller never responded to my emails i filed a complaint through paypal and although it takes awhile it works out in the end they contact the seller on their own and if the seller doesn't respond to them in a timely manner pay pal will refund you the money minus a processing fee and will suspend the seller's account the seller will not be able to sell or buy anything until they pay you back and this includes the processing fee so you'll get all your money back eventually it will just take time i know it sucks PayPal Internet fraud ITunes IPod Phishing Taxation in the United States ITunes Music Store Supply and demand Something Awful Electronic commerce Call option Apple Computer Microeconomics Advance fee fraud SCO-Linux controversies Bulk vending Stock Oil-for-Food Programme E-mail Neopets EFTPOS Gmail Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Enron Corporation Inventory Something Awful Forums Credit card Price discrimination Money ROM image Dot-com Warranty Put option Wal-Mart Mortgage Derivative (finance) Voluntary Student Unionism Plame affair Capitalism Mutual fund FairPlay Liberty Dollar Tax Redundant array of independent disks Digital rights management Octopus card Money supply United States Postal Service Mergers and acquisitions Option E-gold Publicly funded medicine Blog Matrix scheme Live 8 Margin (finance) Stock market The Amazing Race Security (finance) IPod nano MMORPG Customer relationship management Hyperinflation Philatelic investment America Online Poker jargon Surveillance Atari 8-bit family Timeline of the Enron scandal Gramophone record Public domain Electronic money Credit card fraud Publishing Common criticisms of Microsoft MAME Gross domestic product E-mail spam Windows XP Health insurance Podcasting Outsourcing Arbitrage Economics Gold as an investment XML Skype Islamic banking London Congestion Charge Annuity Jack Thompson Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Domain Name System Auction Gold standard Fiat money IPod shuffle
