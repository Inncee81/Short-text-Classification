a supply demand business that's most likely to be profitable i need an idea for a business that's based on buying and re selling like buying wholesale then selling it for profit or even a business where you invest in machines to provide most of the service like a coin laundry or tanning salon let's say you save around and you want to start a business so you can settle down and have more personal freedom or at least be able to work from home what type of business is usually profitable with the proper effort out into it of course something you can live comfortably off of and be able to move around more freely thanks whew you ask a simple question but the answer is very complicated if you want to work from home you would probably want to stay away from a business that would require you to carry inventory obviously your space is limited you may want to consider some type of financial service business like insurance or real estate if you have k to k to invest many insurance companies would love to talk to you in my opinion the advantage of insurance over real estate is that you get residual income with real estate you have to touch every dollar you make the biggest thing that surprises people about owning a business is the massive amount of work that needs to be done in the beginning to start things up i can step away from the business for a little while now but for the first years you are tied to it if you can hire someone that would help but remember that those people are counting on you for a paycheck any way you look at it starting a business is tough but rewarding Insurance Life insurance Citigroup Bank Gross domestic product Microeconomics Warren Buffett Airline Business Keynesian economics Sears Holdings Corporation Labor theory of value Surplus value Real estate broker Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Tax Corporation Mortgage Wal-Mart Annuity Income trust Personal finance Joseph P.
