please give me advice if i want to set up a small online bookshop oder music shop how much it cost to build up site when i hire any web designing company if you are aexpert you can mail me it really depends on how much help you would need with setting up the site at the very basic end you could spend as little as a few hundred pounds to get someone to put the pages together for you however if you need a lot more help and need someone to sort out your order system security etc as well as providing ongoing support this will cost thousands and will need to be on an ongoing contract basis i don't know how much research you've done into this but there are a few things worth considering advertising will be a big expenditure for you you will have to pay top prices to secure bids on searches like buy books even if you have a niche offering this will cost it is an incredibly competative market you will be competing against massive multinationals who have buying power to significantly undercut prices simply making a site isn't enough you will need to understand how to get this site visibly through organic searches search engine optimisation etc or you will need to pay someone to do this offline both music and book shops are struggling as supermarkets in particular are seriously undercutting them online some operators are doing well but many smallers ones are not be aware that selling to the uk market at least the likes of cdwow offer competative pricing by locating offshore i appreciate that sounds quite negative but its important you understand this before you spend time and money if you are serious about doing this then you will need to make a reasonable capital outlay in order to get it going as others have advised a much easier and safer to test the water at least is to sell it online through somone like amazon or ebay Electronic commerce Microeconomics Economics Airline Search engine optimization Mutual fund Wal-Mart Gross domestic product MMORPG Spyware Insurance Tesco Amazon.com Surplus value CPU design FairTax Online shop Dot-com Web traffic Neopets Bond Capital accumulation Mac OS X Internet fraud L4 microkernel family Inflation Pharmaceutical company Free trade Tax Philatelic investment E-mail spam Life insurance Day trading Political economy Illegal drug trade Spam (electronic) Arbitrage Acorn Computers Supply and demand Stock IBM PC compatible Advance fee fraud Gmail Hyperinflation Asian financial crisis Management information system Finance Octopus card Atari 8-bit family Online marketing Commodore International Aldi Nuclear power Network effect Yahoo!
