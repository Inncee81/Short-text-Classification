finding suppliers for ebay this is turning into quite a task i'm looking suppliers so i can sell items on ebay anything i'm not bothered i have a relative who owns a computer shop he said i can use his suppliers and put it through his shop so i get the best price possible problem being even doing this the items are still cheaper on ebay so no profit to be made i've searched the net for suppliers but most seem like scammers and any who seem ok require you to spend so much i can't do this i'm limited infact if they supplied me as i needed items it would suit me down to the ground but they won't i've also looked at drop shipping most have sign up cost before they give you the privialge of selling there items then theres fees per item sold and once you add ebay fees etc theres little or nothing to be made then theres the fact that items may be sold out etc how can i get anywhere on ebay i buy stuff on ebay which has been poorly listed by this i mean in the wrong section or awful photos description etc then i relist the items in the correct section with a higher start price but a much better description and more detailed photos sometimes you make a little sometimes you make alot Neopets Wal-Mart Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Auction Amazon.com Advance fee fraud RuneScape cheats Bulk vending Electronic commerce Arbitrage Supply and demand MMORPG Microeconomics RuneScape economy Network effect Topps Inventory Internet fraud Live 8 Commodity MapleStory Final Fantasy XI United States Postal Service Commodore International Best Buy Labor theory of value Intellectual property Capitalism Airbus A380 Mergers and acquisitions AMD Information Services Procurement Library Atari ST Law of value Value added tax Labour economics Spam (electronic) First-sale doctrine 3dfx Free trade Ford Motor Company CPU design Inflation Nintendo Entertainment System Online shop Capital accumulation GunBound Dairy Alcohol fuel Short selling Google RFID Relationship marketing American Motors Asian financial crisis Something Awful Dot-com Uranium Web traffic Konfabulator Atari 8-bit family Illegal drug trade Economic rent Insurance Sears Holdings Corporation RuneScape skills Publicly funded medicine Oil-for-Food Programme Privatization SCO-Linux controversies Natural monopoly Monetary policy Apple Macintosh Overclocking Gross domestic product Public domain Digital photography Skype Tesco Diagon Alley USB flash drive Online auction business model Management information system Procurement Inkjet printer Health insurance Surplus value Quarashi Animal Crossing ROM image Supermarket Taxation in the United States Cable television Cray-1 Magic: The Gathering Deflation (economics) Public good
