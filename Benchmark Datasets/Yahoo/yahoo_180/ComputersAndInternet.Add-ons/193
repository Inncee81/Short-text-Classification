i've got a dell computer and i want to install a keyboard the keyboard is a microsoft one and is meant to run with windows xp which of course is on the dell however when i unplugged the other keyboard and plugged in the microsoft one it kept saying that the usb port had malfunctioned and the device was not recognisable does anyone know of a way i can fix this i adore my own keyboard usb port malfunction possibly because the keyboard is considered a low speed device and you have high speed usb ports other possibilities the new keyboard is faulty can you use it in a friend's computer or plug it into a laptop this new keyboard does it have a lot of buttons or special features on it it may be drawing too much current from your motherboard which could also explain the error message and finally since this is a dell system the keyboard may be specific to that system you may need to contact dell for help the alternative is to buy a usb to ps keyboard adaptor like the mouse adaptor and plug it into the keyboard ps socket for reference the keyboard port is found at the bottom edge of the motherboard hope this helps Personal computer USB flash drive Mouse (computing) Apple Macintosh Laptop Atari ST IPod IMac AmigaOS Windows XP Musical Instrument Digital Interface RS-232 Amstrad CPC Windows 2000 Hard disk Bluetooth Adapter Desktop computer PlayStation 2 Architecture of Windows 2000 Modchip Computer bus BS 1363 Nintendo Entertainment System X Window System Capacitor plague Amiga IBM PC Apple IIGS Microsoft Windows BIOS Timeline of computing 1990-forward Nintendo DS History of Microsoft Windows Pocket PC Computer hardware IBook Commodore 64 USB mass storage device class Sharp Zaurus ATI Technologies Port (computing) Xbox Common Unix Printing System Plug-and-play Apple Desktop Bus AlphaSmart FireWire IBM PC compatible ZX Spectrum Device driver PowerPC Linux Opera (web browser) TRS-80 Color Computer Atari 8-bit family Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Jack plug Peripheral Component Interconnect Apple Computer Keyboard layout Sega Dreamcast Game controller Computer and video games PlayStation 3 Dongle Commodore 128 Digital audio player History of the graphical user interface Computer Bubble Bobble Apple II family PC card Mac OS X PlayStation Portable Extension Cord Technical standards in colonial Hong Kong Sound card Embedded system DirectX Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Desknote D-subminiature Southbridge (computing) Booting
