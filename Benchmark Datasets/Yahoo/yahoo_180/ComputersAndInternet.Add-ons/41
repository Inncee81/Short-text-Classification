how to run programs off of external hard drives i'm wondering if i wanted to put all of my programs from my computers hard drive to an exteral hard drive how would i got about doing it programs like microsoft office grand theft auto san andreas yahoo messenger etc would i just need to copy the program files folder from inside the c drive and then they would work i know that is where all the information is kept so it would make sense and there wouldn't be any extra files stored somewhere else that i would need right of course games like gta san andreas have a folder in documents for save games etc that you would need but like for microsoft office i would just add it and run the application using the same icon that is short cutted to the desktop and start menu correct thanks for the help matt i think it would be better to uninstall anything you want to move from your computers hard drive and reinstall it on to your external hard drive as there are references to installed programs in the registry which would be wrong if you just moved files around desktop icons are just shortcuts to the present location of program files moving the files would make these icons shortcuts point to a non existent file location Windows 2000 Macintosh Finder Windows XP AmigaOS Computer virus Object Desktop NTFS Windows registry File system Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas NTFS junction point Linux Partition (computing) MS-DOS History of the graphical user interface Stardock Grand Theft Auto (game) System 7 (Macintosh) System 6 PlayStation 2 Windows Vista Gmail Icon (computing) Screenshot Grand Theft Auto III File Allocation Table ITunes Microsoft Windows Xerox Star Taskbar Mac OS X Mouse (computing) Portable Document Format Mac OS history Redundant array of independent disks Macromedia Flash OpenOffice.org Windows Installer Konqueror Apple Computer LiveCD Library (computer science) Hot Coffee mod Spyware Apple typography IBM PC compatible Computer IPod Grand Theft Auto (series) DOS MSN Messenger GNOME Windows Mobile Hard disk Mach kernel Start Menu PHP Spatial file manager Apple II family Floppy disk Newline Mozilla Firefox Xbox Microsoft Word Copy protection WordPerfect Windows Me Virtual memory MDAC Apple IIGS Microsoft OS/2 Grand Theft Auto: Vice City File format Google Desktop History of Microsoft Windows Atari 8-bit family System/36 Common User Access Microsoft Office Uninstaller AppleScript Knoppix OpenDocument Windows 3.x Emacs CPU cache Computer forensics Danger Hiptop NeXT AOL Instant Messenger PlayStation Portable Ebook Mac OS X v10.4 Windows 95 WordStar Google
