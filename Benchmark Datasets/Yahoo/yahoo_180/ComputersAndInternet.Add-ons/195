my dvd drive won't respond but i have a power light and it's reading the dvd i have in there so i've got both cd and dvd drives installed on the same ide cable and its set to 'slave' but i can't get the dvd drive to respond to anything manually on my computer and it won't show up but it acts like it's reading the dvd that's already in the drive how can i fix this so it'll actually show up does the cd drive show up if it does switch the drives and see if it works then it might be a problem with the ide cable also i don't think you need to mess with the jumpers when playing around with optical drives Advanced Technology Attachment DVD Hard disk USB flash drive Universal Serial Bus Computer bus Xbox Ethernet Computer hardware CD-ROM Laserdisc Power Macintosh G3 PlayStation 2 Redundant array of independent disks SCART Modem Windows XP Mouse (computing) Embedded system Digital photography TiVo Modchip STS-61 Nintendo Revolution Elevator Copy protection EMac Bluetooth SCSI IPod RS-232 IMac Nintendo GameCube Knoppix Delta Goodrem Linux PlayStation Portable High-voltage direct current IBook Mac mini Floppy disk Four wheel drive Serial ATA Xbox 360 Blu-ray Disc Regional lockout Sound Blaster System/36 Atari 8-bit family Apollo Guidance Computer Sega Dreamcast Solar power Compact disc AmigaOS Telephone Turing machine Fahrenheit 9/11 Fire alarm control panel System/34 Optical fiber CD recorder VHS DualDisc Carburetor My Life as a Teenage Robot Lighting Coaxial cable Category 5 cable Windows 2000 Electric power transmission Television Read-only memory Camcorder Switch Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Apple Desktop Bus Movie projector Chappelle's Show Little Britain Disk storage Cable television Disk cloning Enigma machine TRS-80 Determinism Beavis and Butt-head Game programming Dimmer CD-R PlayStation 3 Technology in the Stargate universe Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Integrated development environment X10 (industry standard) Warez Drive letter assignment PowerBook Case modding Sex and the City Emacs
