can you run a program off an external hardrive i have a laptop and a desktop computer and they run pretty much all of the same programs and they both are pretty tightly scrunched for hard drive space i recently bought this external hard drive to back up my d animation work and i was curious if i could install programs and such to free up space off my computers for other things yes it is possible because i do however if you can try to put it on the main drive why because the connection speed between the external hdd and is slower than the internal drive Hard disk Apple Macintosh Floppy disk Windows XP IBM PC compatible Virtual memory Linux Supercomputer USB flash drive Desktop computer Personal computer Universal Serial Bus PowerPC Computer bus Mach kernel PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Mac OS X Pretty Good Privacy PowerBook Skype Computer hardware ZX Spectrum Commodore 128 Computer Windows 2000 Sharp Zaurus Partition (computing) System/36 Atari ST Stardock Power Macintosh G3 CPU design History of Microsoft Windows NeXT Redundant array of independent disks Microprocessor IBM PC Central processing unit Computer storage Macintosh Finder Commodore 64 AmigaOS Computer architecture IPod Computer virus Acorn Archimedes Knoppix ITunes Memory (computers) MS-DOS Bluetooth Computer and video games CPU cache Desknote Computer cluster SCSI Apple IIGS Serial ATA Western Digital Embedded system IBook ATI Technologies RISC Apple II family Pentium 4 DOS Object Desktop LiveCD Modchip Dot matrix printer 64-bit X Window System PlayStation 3 Overclocking CDC 6600 Digital audio player GNOME Java programming language Commodore International Kaypro Xerox Star Sun Microsystems File system C programming language Cray-2 Sega Microsoft Windows Computer case Industrial robot Screenshot Unreal IMac Read-only memory System/34 Coprocessor OpenOffice.org Acorn Electron Control Data Corporation W.
