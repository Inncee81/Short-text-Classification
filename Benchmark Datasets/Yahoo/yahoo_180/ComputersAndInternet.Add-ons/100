audio keeps jumping whenever i go on utube or yahoo music or listen to anything on the computer the sound keeps jumping whenever i play cds on my pc they sound fine it's only when i listen to stuff on the internet help i agree with richard when you listen to streamed music you are basically listening to the music online from their server and the music has to be buffered before you hear it so for example when you see the message buffered then its a good time to start listening to the music in question as by the time you reach of that song the buffering will be at or in other words finished were as when you listen to a song through your media player on the desktop the music is being played directly from your hard drive so the music is in real time and thats why your music wont jump on your p c the faster your internet connection the quicker your music will buffer online and the better music streaming you will experience some media players have audio quality options try lowering yours and see if theres a improvement i hope this helps good luck mate Windows XP Video game music ITunes MP3 Modem Copy protection Compact disc Digital audio player High fidelity Compact audio cassette Linux Bluetooth Online music store Vorbis Chess Musical Instrument Digital Interface ITunes Music Store Sound recording MiniDisc Laserdisc Apple Computer Windows Vista Hard disk Internet radio Mixtape Common Unix Printing System Transmission Control Protocol Gramophone record Sampling (music) Walkman Multitrack recording Quake III Arena Podcasting Timpani FairPlay X Window System Karaoke MDAC Steam (content delivery) Asynchronous Transfer Mode Last.fm Xiangqi History of Microsoft Windows Redundant array of independent disks MSN Messenger BZFlag E-mail spam Final Fantasy XI Commodore 64 MMORPG Sony RealNetworks Floppy disk Laptop Computer Xbox I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Desktop computer Digital photography Dorama OpenBSD John Cage Apple IIGS Emacs Voice over IP Windows Server 2003 Buffer overflow Volleyball E-mail Google Oscilloscope Microsoft Enterprise content management Internet protocol suite House music Cache This Week in Tech Halo 2 Bubble Bobble Flute Windows 2000 Amstrad CPC Radio drama Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Internet Apple Macintosh Electronic music Loudspeaker ZX Spectrum AmigaOS Forth programming language Boards of Canada Pipeline (Unix) Mac OS X Neverwinter Nights BBC
