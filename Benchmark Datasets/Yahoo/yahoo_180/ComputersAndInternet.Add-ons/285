does anyone know where i can buy a usb hub and a pentium mhz processor i believe it is called i need the usb and the pentium in order to have my mp player work whenever i plug in the device it says new hardware found so i try to install the player and it says error while trying to install i contacted the company and microsoft about this but nothing helps what you really need is the usb the speed of your computer shouldn't make a difference for loading music onto an mp player the mhz is the speed of a computer and by today's standards that's pretty slow so any computer should work just fine its whether or not you have usb that is the holdup it sounds like you can go to system information and it should tell you exactly what you have on your computer hardware wise go to start control panel performance and maintinence system information you can buy a usb card and put it in your computer that will give you usb slots but as far as the computer speed once again i don't think that matters its just what they recommend sounds like a new computer is in store for you though Universal Serial Bus Apple Macintosh USB flash drive Timeline of computing 1990-forward Windows 2000 PlayStation 2 IPod Musical Instrument Digital Interface Computer bus Xbox Windows XP PC motherboard Pentium III Secure Digital card Hard disk Nintendo Revolution PlayStation 3 RS-232 History of Microsoft Windows Booting IBM PC compatible Computer hardware Floppy disk Commodore 64 Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Power Macintosh G3 Xbox 360 IBook NVIDIA Nintendo Entertainment System Pentium M ZX Spectrum AMD Apple II family USB mass storage device class Athlon Overclocking CPU design Modem AirPort MicroATX RISC IBM Personal System/2 Pentium 4 FireWire Apple Computer Pentium Pro Central processing unit Game Boy Celeron Ethernet TRS-80 Color Computer Cyrix PCI Express PlayStation Portable Commodore International Virtual memory Plug-and-play Apple IIGS Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sega Dreamcast Computer Redundant array of independent disks Personal computer Embedded system Atari ST Linux kernel System/36 Software-defined radio Mach kernel Pentium II Knoppix Nintendo GameCube Digital rights management Microprocessor IBM PC Computer and video games Mandriva Linux NX bit Two-factor authentication Palm OS AmigaOS NForce4 MSX HyperTransport Burroughs B5000 Pentium D Nintendo 64 Architecture of Windows 2000
