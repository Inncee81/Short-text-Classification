direct debit authorization with semi ann mortgage statement a direct debit authorization form came with my semi annual mortgage statement what is that for and what are the pros and cons of using it this allows the bank to directly debit the amount of the payments from your checking account it provides authorization to the bank to withdraw directly from your account on a regular basis without further authorization necessary from you i normally do not provide direct debit authority because in the event something goes wrong multiple withdrawls mistakes in the amount they control the withdrawls the only benefit it you never forget to pay your mortgage some banks may actually give you a discount on payments since they are automatically debited from your account if not don't do it i think it's better just to set up a recurring payment online from your bank account this way you still never forget to pay but you are still in control of the payments Credit card Bank Debit card Automated Clearing House Personal finance EFTPOS Life insurance Student loan Mutual fund SmartRider Mortgage Automatic teller machine Oyster card Bond Savings and loan association Bank fraud Insurance Islamic banking United Kingdom corporation tax E-ZPass Cheque Annuity Surveillance Taxation in the United States Interac Schabir Shaik Trial Identity theft United States Postal Service Money Canada Health Act Monetary policy FairTax Derivative (finance) Television licence 401(k) Accountancy Health savings account Internet fraud Tax Wells Fargo Payroll Perl Electronic money Legal tender Electronic toll collection Collateralized mortgage obligation Cooperative Security (finance) Central bank Social Security (United States) Corporate governance Credit card fraud Financial services Filling station Government National Mortgage Association Gold standard RuneScape cheats Octopus card Financial markets Bank of China (Hong Kong) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Finance Dividend Auto insurance Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 12 Social Security debate (United States) Fiat money Economy of Russia Health insurance Leasing Primerica Financial Services Popular, Inc Universal life insurance Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Article One of the United States Constitution Microeconomics Chip and PIN Mergers and acquisitions Publicly funded medicine Zero coupon bond VISA (credit card) Consumer finance Housing cooperative Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Pension Concurrent estate Reserve Bank of New Zealand Loyalty program Athenian democracy Hyperinflation Fractional-reserve banking Treasury security Agricultural policy Mail fraud Subsidy Gross domestic product Deflation (economics) Estoppel
