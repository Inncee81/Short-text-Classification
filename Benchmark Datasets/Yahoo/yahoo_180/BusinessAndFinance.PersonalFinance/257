what's the best way to go about refinancing to pay off debts my ex is signing over his half of the house to me in return i will need to refinance the house to payoff credit card debts that he left me with not to mention a credit line debt the morgage right now is if the credit card debt was incurred while you were married you are on the hook for that debt if if if the credit account was a joint account or if it was a secured card even if your name wasnt on the card to answer your question go to the mortgage holder and tell them what you are doing it sounds like you have some serious equity in the house have them write you a new first mortgage thats does the following pays the old mortgage off pays off and shuts down the line of credit pays off all your credit card debt a home mortgage is always going to be the lowest interest rate of any of the debts you mention so it is smart to roll all that high interest rate debt into your mortgage and then shut down the card accounts so the ex cant get to them to try and back door you into new debt you are thinking along the right track just follow through and you'll be fine edit due to further information were these the days when you could file bankruptcy and simply write off credit card i would agree with the answerer below but the bankruptcy laws have changed recently i say roll the credit card debt into the mortgage because if she is affording the payments the interest accrues at a much lower rate on the mortgage and if she pays the same amount monthly into her mortgage that she was paying on servicing other debt the payment will pay more principal than keeping the accounts separate and thus get her out of debt sooner rather than later Mortgage Debt Bond Refinancing Credit card Mortgage-backed security Debt consolidation Student loan Interest Taxation in the United States Government National Mortgage Association Deflation (economics) Derivative (finance) Personal finance FairTax U.S. public debt Social Security (United States) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Primerica Financial Services Economy of Russia Predatory lending Security (finance) Treasury security Life insurance Real estate bubble Annuity Credit score Collateralized debt obligation Money Government debt Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Municipal bond Federal National Mortgage Association High-yield debt Collateralized mortgage obligation Estoppel Bank Islamic banking Gold standard Donald Trump United Kingdom corporation tax Savings and loan association Microeconomics Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Schabir Shaik Trial Insurance Charles Ponzi Citigroup Bankruptcy in the United States Monetary policy Concurrent estate Article One of the United States Constitution Allodial title Economy of Pakistan Financial services Futures contract Bretton Woods system Developing countries' debt Child support Appeal Debt levels and flows Corporate finance Poker jargon Social Security debate (United States) Credit card fraud Blackjack Economy of India Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Cost of capital Credit derivative Intellectual property Bankruptcy Financial audit Hong Kong Monetary Authority Economy of Chile Bank fraud Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Payroll Securitization Credit history Tax cut Capital accumulation Divorce Salary cap British property bubble Debit card George W.
