is there a court decision in alabama that concluded that credit card accounts are written contracts i know that the federal truth in lending act defines credit card accounts as open accounts however i have found that if the courts in your state have ruled otherwise then that ruling takes precedence i am trying to find a ruling that states that the alabama courts consider credit card accounts written contracts instead of open accounts i have heard from an attorney in alabama who stated that it is indeed a written contract but he did not provide any supporting proof can anyone out there provide this information or has anyone been through a court trial regarding collection of a credit card debt that was older than the year statute of limitations in alabama alabama law appears to be contrary to your premise the alabama court of civil appeals has ruled that an account stated as opposed to an open account is not founded on the original liability but is a new agreement between parties to an original account that the statement of the account with the balance struck is correct and that the debtor will pay that amount even though there is usually a written agreement to extend credit in a credit card setting and even though there is a balance statement normally sent by a credit card issuer each month that activity occurs it seems that a subsequent agreement would be necessary to take a credit card balance outside of the open account statute of limitations Contract Credit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Supreme Court of the United States First Amendment to the United States Constitution Appeal Administrative law of the United States Estoppel Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 United Kingdom corporation tax Constitution Lawrence v.
