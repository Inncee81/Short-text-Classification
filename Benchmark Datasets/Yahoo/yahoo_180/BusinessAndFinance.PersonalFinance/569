i have just got a home loan what is the best form of protection i can get income protection loan protection there are so many forms of protection which one or ones are worth it i want to protect against unemployment and illness and death aaaaargh there are too many options help first off congrats on the new home i think the best form of protection is to save up six to months worth of your monthly expenses in cash this is easier said than done if your employer offers income continuation insurance protects against illness disability for a reasonable price go for it as far as life insurance goes it depends on your family situation get enough to cover funeral expenses and to replace your income contribution to your family for as long as you feel is necessary to support them i'm not a huge fan of unemployment insurance there are always jobs out there we just may have to lower our standards until something better comes along unless you think you are at a very high risk of losing a high paying job the money spent on monthly premiums would be better off saved and invested Insurance Life insurance Unemployment benefit Health insurance Social Security (United States) Annuity Unemployment 401(k) Inflation Personal finance Tax Hyperinflation Health care in the United States Mutual fund Predatory lending Economy of the United States Taxation in the United States Warren Buffett Freeters Universal life insurance Interest Capital accumulation Labour economics Great Depression Derivative (finance) Economy of Russia Publicly funded medicine Gross domestic product Credit card New Deal Social Security debate (United States) FairTax Deflation (economics) Bond Microeconomics Title insurance Medicare (Canada) Wal-Mart Flat tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus National Insurance Health savings account Primerica Financial Services Compensation of employees Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Money Economy of India Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Financial markets Student loan Medicare (United States) Health maintenance organization History of the United States (1918-1945) Bank Monetary policy Economy of Haiti Option Efficiency wages Privatization Tuition Berkshire Hathaway United Kingdom corporation tax Keynesian economics Reaganomics Citigroup Margin (finance) Bank fraud Term life insurance Deficit spending Centrelink Income trust Wealth American International Group Lloyd's of London Yield curve Debt Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Finance Microcredit Food and Drug Administration Cable television Economy of the Republic of Ireland Economy of Africa Canadian and American health care systems compared Tariff Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Unemployment types Employment in Hong Kong Education in the United States Bretton Woods system Mortgage-backed security Collateralized debt obligation
