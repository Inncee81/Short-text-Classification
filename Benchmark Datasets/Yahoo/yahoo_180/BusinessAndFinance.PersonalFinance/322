debt settlement i was talking to a friend of mine this morning and he was telling me he was going to do debt settlement even though he still had the ability to pay his bills he said he would get the settlement company to get his balances on credit cards and unsecured debt cut by or more then make a lump sum payment right away and his debt would be cleared with almost no negative effect on his credit he said usually what happens is you take from to years to pay off the amount and in that time it reflects poorly on your credit but as soon as you pay it off it is as if it never happened is this true if so why doesn't everyone do this it sounds like he is a little mis informed or is it true the answers above are both correct depending upon the specific debt settlement company used most debt settlement companies can make a request from the creditor to mark the account as paid as agreed or paid in full either way with a zero balance credit implications in the future are tough to predict he will be late on his accounts and may even wind up with collection accounts if the credit card companies sell the accounts he may even be sued if the debt settlement company has poor relations with the credit card company in his favor will be a drastically decreasing debt to income ratio considering that he will be paying his over all debt down faster than the average consumer hence increasing his fico score and ability to borrow money settlement letters can be seen with both sets of results at http www fdnsolutions com settlementletters and debt settlement is only for consumers in a legitmate financial hardship my guess is that if your friend is able to pay his bills and enrolled in a debt settlement program its probably a case of over promising and later on under delivering have your friend ask for some results from the settlement company so that at least he can see some proof Credit card Deflation (economics) Credit score Mortgage Bond Life insurance Bretton Woods system Monetary policy Microeconomics Annuity Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 FairTax Government debt Student loan Money Economy of Russia Interest Commodity markets Capital accumulation Inflation Bank Gold standard Money supply Finance Corporate finance Social Security (United States) Estoppel Capitalism Economy of the United States Insurance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Article One of the United States Constitution Keynesian economics Tax Debt levels and flows Law of value Personal finance Citigroup Supply and demand Futures contract Security (finance) Gross domestic product Mergers and acquisitions U.S. public debt Social Credit 401(k) Derivative (finance) Great Depression Short selling Credit repair Advance fee fraud History of the United States (1918-1945) Legal tender Surplus value Enron Corporation Primerica Financial Services Double-entry book-keeping Supply-side economics Islamic banking Apple Computer Euro Ford Motor Company Business performance management Financial services Divorce Cheque Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Tariff Arbitrage Economy of India Deficit spending Electronic commerce Tax cut PE ratio Theory of conduct Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Mutual fund Credit history Price discrimination Economy of Pakistan Animal Crossing Cost of capital Blackjack Baccarat Poker jargon Technocratic movement Contract Consensus decision-making Free trade Economy of Africa
