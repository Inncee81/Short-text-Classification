can you open a bank acount at without your parent's permission if so could you give me any details i opened my first current cheque account with the tsb shortly after my th birthday with no problems true i was already a saving account customer but as long as you have some id and proof of your address you should not have any problems however you will only be given an atm card to access your cash and a cheque book but no guarentee card until you are some banks might be willing to give you an electron or solo card but as these are hardly accepted anywhere they are not much use if you speak to the bank and your parents you might find the bank is willing to issue a debit card switch or visa delta with cheque guarentee facility if your parents are willing to stand as guarentors that you will not go into debt worked for me especially as i was earning regular money at the time your best bet is to make an appointment to speak to either a personal banking advisor or the manager to discuss your options Credit card EFTPOS Bank Debit card Automatic teller machine Bank fraud Ulster Bank Electronic money Money Schabir Shaik Trial Credit card fraud VISA (credit card) Personal finance Euro Smart card Chip and PIN Octopus card Bank of China (Hong Kong) Legal tender American Express Toronto-Dominion Bank Password Money supply Nationwide Building Society Loyalty program SmartRider Surveillance Interac Identity document Betting (poker) Traveler's cheque Life insurance United States Postal Service Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Popular, Inc Internet fraud Irish Life and Permanent Identity theft The Amazing Race Financial services Annuity Corporate finance Wheel of Fortune Confidence trick Visa (document) Windows XP Mergers and acquisitions Double-entry book-keeping Mutual fund Baccarat Citigroup Plame affair Online shop Online gambling BancNet Gambling Monty Hall problem London Underground Computer Mail fraud Winning Streak Interest Student loan Scrip Bureau de Change Indian nationality law Monetary policy Wachovia Poker jargon John C.
