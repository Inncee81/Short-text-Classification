ok somebody help me if you found a really old letter saying that some one had opened a bank account for you when you were born but they are dead now how would you know how to find out if it exists there is no account info or bank name it was just a letter she wrote to my mother saying it was there she gave no other info well without that information it becomes quite difficult if the person who opened the account was from a small town i would check with the banks in that town in most states unclaimed money in accounts goes to the state not the bank so you could check with the state to see if there is any unclaimed money under your name or the other person's name i would say your chances of claiming this money are just about if the other person is dead and the account is in that person's name the money belongs to the dead person's estate without account info good luck proving the money was intended for you Bank fraud Mail fraud Advance fee fraud Trust (Law) USA Identity theft Money supply Bank Wheel of Fortune Internet fraud Password Money Poker jargon Fiat money Cheque Annuity Monopoly (game) Automatic teller machine Money laundering Lost, mislaid, and abandoned property Betting (poker) Charles Ponzi United States dollar Prolog Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Money order Bond Credit card Mortgage Health savings account Tax Panay incident CPU cache United States Postal Service Riggs Bank Credit union Freedom of information legislation Contract Mutual fund Life insurance Schabir Shaik Trial Taxation in the United States Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Digital signature Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Extra-sensory perception Consensus decision-making Inflation Make money fast Oplan Bojinka Political corruption Pretty Good Privacy Gold standard Child support Legal tender Government of Maryland James Hanratty National identification number Finance Swiss banking Corporate personhood Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Islamic banking Blackjack The Notorious B.I.G.
