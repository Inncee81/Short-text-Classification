have you ever filed bankruptcy and how long did take you to recover yes i did file bankruptcy in january of after a lost restaurant and divorce killed my credit score thankfully i had some positive things that worked in my favor i sold my house after it was discharged which meant i had a mortgage that was reported as being paid off i sought to get rid of any collections that should have been discharged in the bankruptcy after a year i was offered a credit card with a limit without any annual fees i used it and paid it off every month then i purchased a new car with a high interest rate of score i continued to make extra payments on the car and keep my credit card paid off every month so i did not pay any interest six months after i purchased the car i refinanced it with a local credit union at score this paid off my initial car loan which boosted my credit some more i was also offered a credit card from the credit union i was reluctant to use it until i decided to only use in on special occassions however i still made sure that i do not spend more than what i can pay off when the bill comes due two years from my ch discharge my score was at and months later i finally past i am shooting for over because at that point i know i can get the most favorable terms for purchasing another house dispite having a bankruptcy and being self employed note i know that it is very rare to be offered a credit card without any annual fees i was close to getting one that had fees just to build my credit do not get yourself back into debt but credit when used wisely is a beautiful thing make sure that you never spend more than what you can pay off at the end of the month i might have said that before lol hope this helps Mortgage Credit card Student loan Debt Insurance Debt consolidation Bond Primerica Financial Services Credit score Donald Trump Deflation (economics) Refinancing Interest Bank Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) Economy of Russia United Kingdom corporation tax Appeal Money Article One of the United States Constitution Personal finance Predatory lending Short selling Mortgage-backed security FairTax Annuity Government National Mortgage Association United Airlines Gross domestic product Futures contract Security (finance) Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Gold standard Bankruptcy in the United States Tom DeLay Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Bankruptcy Government debt Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Mutual fund Graduate school Treasury security Great Depression Savings and loan association Bretton Woods system Alex Ferguson Credit derivative Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mario Lemieux Poker jargon Value added tax Wal-Mart Dot-com Wachovia William Pitt the Younger Credit history Life insurance Cooperative Federal National Mortgage Association Social Security debate (United States) Legal tender Economy of the United States H-1B visa Octopus card Auto insurance 401(k) Best Buy Oakland Athletics MetroCard Islamic banking Estoppel Neopets Delta Air Lines Contract bridge London Congestion Charge Health care in the United States Leeds United F.C.
