paying off a student loan i am graduating shortly and i am wondering about the process of paying off a k loan i would assume i am getting a decent job after graduation and will be able to afford to pay between a month towards it without getting into fianancial trouble i am a bit knowledgable about finances and whatnot so feel free to give me more advanced recommendations here are my main issues should i pay off k quickly or slowly i don't want the interest to accumulate to k over years should i consolidate my loans during the grace period into a low interest one or should i hold off since once i consolidate my rate will be locked down if i get a signing bonus of hypothetically k should i invest it or pay off the student loan the investments might have higher interest than the loan making it more worthwhile to save instead of pay any other recommendations would be appreciated thanks once you can afford to make payments consolidate your student loans to lock into a low inetrest rate as it is now your interest rate is probnably variable and will only go up when you consolidate pick a monthly payment amount you're comfortable with maybe not as high as you anticipate you can afford that way if you have a tight month you can make the lower payment if you get a sign on bonus investigate what interest rates are out there for you as far as investing it you may want to think about talking to a certified financial planner about what would be the best way to go with the money Student loan Annuity Credit card Life insurance Monetary policy Mortgage Insurance Economy of Russia Interest Debt Bond Deflation (economics) Mutual fund Education in the People's Republic of China Bank Personal finance Derivative (finance) Social Security (United States) Keynesian economics United Kingdom corporation tax 401(k) Euro Microeconomics Federal Reserve Capital accumulation Money Government National Mortgage Association Municipal bond Hyperinflation Unemployment Free trade Anarchism and capitalism Savings and loan association Islamic banking Government debt Graduate school Variable universal life insurance Credit score Capitalism Labor theory of value Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Progressive tax Investment bank Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia FairTax Price discrimination Collateralized debt obligation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social Security debate (United States) Flat tax MMORPG Education in the United States Schabir Shaik Trial Gross domestic product PE ratio Microcredit Charles Ponzi Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Economy of the United States Minimum wage Interest rate History of the United States (1918-1945) Security (finance) Public transport Israeli Arab Marshall Plan Hillary Rodham Clinton Debt consolidation Say's law Federal National Mortgage Association Gold standard Usury Present value Short selling Unemployment benefit Top-up fees Publicly funded medicine Deficit spending Economy of Chile Wealth condensation Salary cap Economy of India Economy of Pakistan Stock Monetary and fiscal policy of Japan Tertiary education fees in Australia Reaganomics Mensal__o scandal Modern portfolio theory
