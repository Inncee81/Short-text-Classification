need to set up phone jack for fax machine i don't have a phone jack in my home office and need one for my fax machine do the wireless jacks work for this or will the fact that i have dsl cause problems just trying to figure out if i should spend the money on a wireless jack or just call a phone guy thanks in my opinion you will be much better off with a wired jack this is simpler and more reliable than a wireless jack and guaranteed to work with your fax machine if you are the least bit handy you might want to consider installing the jack yourself all you need to do is run a cable from where you want the new jack to the nearest existing jack and connect a couple of wires on each end if you can connect up the speakers to your stereo you can probably do this also don't forget to use a dsl filter between the jack and your fax machine Digital Subscriber Line Modem Bluetooth Telegraphy Broadband Internet access Telephone exchange Telephone Voice over IP Burglar alarm Mobile phone Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Fax HomePNA Internet Wi-Fi Surveillance Loudspeaker Xbox WiMAX Wireless LAN Universal Serial Bus Router Telephone booth IPod IEEE 802.11 IP Multimedia Subsystem Television Embedded system Musical Instrument Digital Interface Jack plug Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows XP X10 (industry standard) Cable television Transmission Control Protocol Acorn Computers North American Numbering Plan Power line communication Home cinema Tungsten Handheld Public Switched Telephone Network Digital circuit Audiophile Enigma machine Floppy disk Private branch exchange Atari ST Eircom Automatic teller machine Network Switching Subsystem D-subminiature Internet service provider ITU-T Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Central processing unit High-voltage direct current Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Advanced Technology Attachment Radio GSM services Telephone tapping Electrical wiring Wireless access point IMac Internet protocol suite RCA connector BlackBerry UK telephone numbering plan Walkman Spam (electronic) AppleTalk Apple Open Collaboration Environment Password N-Gage RS-232 Mineral County, West Virginia Whois Wardenclyffe Tower 9-1-1 Sound recording Triple play (telecommunications) Karaoke TIA-568A/B Electric power transmission RISC USB flash drive Handheld game console Inmarsat Vending machine Monochrom Drill bit Konica Minolta X86 Tesco Telephone numbering plan Laserdisc Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Colossus computer
