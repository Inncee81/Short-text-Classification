getting vonage voip service do i need to buy a special phone no vonage will provide a special router telephone adapter that connects to your broadband connection cable or dsl most likely and provides a couple of ethernet connections for your computer network and provides one or two lines of dial tone phone service depending on what you purchased from vonage you just plug one or all of your regular phones into this jack if you prefer you can just connectorize a single wire going to all your phones into kind of a 'demarc' to get all your phones on one pair of wire for convenience one suggestion though you might find that the performance of your phone service is better if you don't connect other network devices that use your internet connection ahead of the vonge router if you connect your computer s to the vonage router it can respond to your performance preferences and throttle data service to the computer when needed to ensure that your phone service always takes priority i have done this and it works pretty well one other tip on the vonage web site you can set up a forwarding number in the event that there is a service outage if you do this in the event your internet service drops for a couple of minutes you still won't lose any calls assuming you have a cell phone or alternate phone number i don't think mine goes down very often but it has a few times and it's good to get the phone call anyway hope this helps i hope you enjoy vonage i found that for the money it's really a pretty good service not perfect but certainly worth the money Digital Subscriber Line Telephone 9-1-1 Telephone exchange Router Ethernet Asynchronous Transfer Mode Bluetooth Wi-Fi Broadband Internet access Private branch exchange Universal Serial Bus Password HomePNA Enhanced 911 Integrated Services Digital Network Internet Phreaking Power line communication Telephone numbering plan Cisco Systems AppleTalk Session Initiation Protocol Embedded system Cable television Wireless LAN Skype Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol General Packet Radio Service Network address translation WiMAX TIA-568A/B Musical Instrument Digital Interface Denial-of-service attack Internet service provider Telephone tapping Surveillance Telegraphy Internet Group Management Protocol Mobile phone Jack plug Computer bus Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Emergency telephone number AT&T Cable modem Eircom IP Multimedia Subsystem NSA encryption systems Xbox Internet protocol suite Poker jargon IPv6 Communications protocol UK telephone numbering plan Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Public Switched Telephone Network IPod Multiprotocol Label Switching FidoNet Computer Transmission Control Protocol Telephone call IiNet Dual-tone multi-frequency Frame relay PDP-11 FireWire Internet fraud Differentiated services Nintendo DS Quality of service Dialer Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Satellite internet IEEE 802.11 Hash table Triple play (telecommunications) ITU-T Computer network Yahoo!
