do you incur idd charges when you call an overseas toll free line say if i call a toll free line in us from singapore will it be toll free for me or only for the us locals you might have a charge there isn't a perfect universal law on this one what's happening of course is you're dialing the number for the states after your international access code in singapore now singtel or starhub or will have to give that call over to carrier they're connected with to ultimately land it in the states so maybe they give it to at t as part of their contract to exchange business it's likely at t will accept it no problem and get it to the end user maybe a business in new york city for no extra cost but there's a fair chance that your local operator in singapore will charge you a fee from singtel's side they've likely signed a contract to exchange traffic with at t in this case at t can send them m minutes per month and maybe singtel can send m back to the states the toll free calls count in their limit their other option is to sell those minutes outright or put them on the international wholesale voice market and sell them so giving away free ones might be ok if it's just a few but they're likely to at least charge you a little bit of something Telephone numbering plan Broadband Internet access Toll-free telephone number Virgin Mobile Toll road Voice over IP Singapore Telecommunications Cable television BlackBerry Modem UK telephone numbering plan Eircom Communications in Singapore Phone fraud Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Singapore Private branch exchange StarHub North American Numbering Plan Airline Skype Telegraphy Interstate Highway Optus FidoNet Singapore Changi Airport Phreaking United States Postal Service Insurance London Congestion Charge Public good Taxation in the United States GSM services Hong Kong International Airport History of Singapore System/36 Temasek Holdings Octopus card Emergency telephone number 9-1-1 Local exchange carrier Short selling Blue box Telephone exchange Narita International Airport Internet fraud Security (finance) Telephone number E-mail Toll bridge NorthwesTel GNU General Public License Digital Subscriber Line Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Public domain Singapore Airlines U.S. Highway 1 Freeway CPU cache Tax Asian financial crisis 407 ETR Tesco Transport in Hong Kong American individualist anarchism Price discrimination Short message service Derivative (finance) Elis Prefecture Internet Relay Chat Zoning Pennsylvania Turnpike SCO-Linux controversies America Online Ethernet Pan American World Airways Futures contract Road pricing Internet Ryanair United Airlines Filling station Neopets Air New Zealand Transmission Control Protocol Mortgage Laws of Singapore Straits Times Index Open source culture Publicly funded medicine Wal-Mart Referendum Electric power transmission Data retention Gross domestic product Credit card System/34 Telephone tapping
