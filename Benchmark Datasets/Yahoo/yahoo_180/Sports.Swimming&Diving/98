can i pass lifeguarding school it's only a day course with a minute practical exam on the th day so it's very fast and i have to pay attention i have been as much as i can but i'm still forgetting too much because there are a lot of details in doing rescues i only have days left tomorrow and the next day to improve and to show i have what it takes they currently think i'm not putting in enough effort i really want to pass because i need the job and i want the skills does anybody think i can pass if i put in serious effort for the next two days or is it too late i'm sure i could but perhaps you objective observers could be more realistic for me i think if you put in the effort of course you can pass i know that these are almost full day courses but even in the evening you need to go home and study there are lots of little things like the symptoms of a heart attach hypothermia etc that you need to try and remember memorize in a lot of these courses the instructors will tell their students that they're not pulling their weight and you need to improve etc as a method of motivation but also to see which students actually do put in more effort and which students get stressed drop out can't handle the pressure lifeguarding is a high pressure job so they want to make sure that you are able to handle it so my advice is a stick with it always show lots of enthusiasm and effort b study the details at night to make sure you understand it c never give up even if you think you are not doing the right steps forgot something keep going a lot of the grading judging is your effort and attitude good luck Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Martial art Swimming Extreme Programming Social rule Pitaten Education in Germany Education in Portugal Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct A-level Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Education in Japan Drowning Past teachings of Prem Rawat College admissions Grade (education) Intelligent design movement Alexander Technique Unemployment Education in the United States Internal ballistics Suicide methods Hypertension Advanced Placement Program New York Giants National Certificate of Educational Achievement Law school Teacher Education Education in Romania Equine conformation Drill instructor Dialysis Affirmative action Juris Doctor Jet engine Rugby union positions Principal-agent problem Higher (Scottish) Beavis and Butt-head Tai Chi Chuan GED Japanese tea ceremony Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hypothermia Avalanche Law School Admissions Test W.
