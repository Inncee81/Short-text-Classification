can you use bleach in a ' by pool instead of chlorine to kill algae hi kim not only can you use bleach but it's a great way to fight algae in your pool typically it's cheaper too first off bleach is chlorine there is no way around it the laundry bleach that you buy at the drug store is a concentration of sodium hypochlorite chlorine if you buy pool chlorine it is normally supplied in a concentration of either or solution of sodium hypochlorite chlorine yep bleach is the same exact thing as pool chlorine except bleach is quite a bit lower in concentration figuring out how much bleach or pool chlorine can be easy once you know the concentration look on the bottle for the there are a couple of pool chemical calculators out there that help you calculate how much of any chlorine solution is needed for your gallon pool but one thing you will want to do with any pool that uses chlorine is be sure that you have some stabilizer in the pool the cya stabilizer protects the chlorine from getting eatin' up by the sun's rays without it your chlorine would go to zero very quickly on a sunny day among the stabilizer cya level you can also benefit from having your water tested for all the usual chemicals as well fc tc ph ta cya etc after you get your water tested you can post the results at a forum like troublefreepools and post the results the members will be happy to help you do you have any type of water test kit to test for ph and chlorine if not go out and get yourself a test kit i am figuring your pool volume near gallons since it's not filled to the brim if you start with a chlorine level of zero then you would add enough chlorine to bring your chlorine up to shock levels get the cya reading and you'll better determine the exact level with a gallon pool cup of laundry bleach will bring your chlorine level up ppm if your chlorine level is at ppm and you want to bring it up to ppm just add cups of laundry bleach to bring it up ppm if you use a pool chlorine solution you will need to add barely over cup of pool chlorine to get each ppm increase in your chlorine level however if your fighting an algae bloom you should bring your chlorine levels up to shock levels elevated chlorine levels until the algae clears and the chlorine levels return to normal you should wait to swim in the pool no matter what type of chlorine you use dan Chlorine Hydrochloric acid Ammonia Hydrogen peroxide Concentration Swimming pool Solar power Parts per notation Hard water Biodiesel Cyanide Menstrual cycle Sewage treatment Ozone Haloalkane Coral reef Neutrino Microeconomics Marine aquarium Hydrogen Ozone depletion Sodium percarbonate Sea-Monkey Sodium chloride Bromine Polychlorinated biphenyl Use of poison gas in World War I Lake Fire fighting Explosive material Chloroform Ozone hole Brewery Asthma Lac operon Gold Chlorite Diving Dioxin Hydrogen chloride Ethidium bromide Redundant array of independent disks Wood pulp Inflation Tetrachloroethylene E85 Sodium perborate Supply and demand Solar cell Alkane Jet engine Algae Soil pH Hydrogen economy Fluoride therapy Sterilization (microbiology) Poison Trisodium phosphate Algal bloom Acetic acid Fluoride Titanium Illegal drug trade Ozone layer Solvent Halogen Water (molecule) Siphon Dialysis Allergy Biological warfare Autonomous building Sodium hydroxide CPU cache Tide Water supply Snowball Earth Textile manufacturing Carbon tetrachloride Dishwashing RISC Sauna E number Drowning Swimming Chlorination Laundry detergent Sun
