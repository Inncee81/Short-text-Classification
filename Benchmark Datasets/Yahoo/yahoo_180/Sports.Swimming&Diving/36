snorkeling and spearfishing so i picked up this new hobby spearfishing i went down probably about maybe ft max under water and my ears started hurting so bad i was wandering if it would actually do some damage to my ears or head can i go deeper and be safe what is the deepest i can go with out it affecting my ears could they go deaf if you can explain some of this it would be great the change in pressure as you go down in the water is causing the pain you need to equalize your ears as you descend for most people equalizing only requires pinching your nose and exhaling gently against the pinched nose some of the lucky people can equalize just by making a swallowing motion when hear your ears crackle they are equalizing you can rutpure you eardrum if you do not equalize if you equalize your ears the limiting factor of your dive will be your breath hold capabilities and not your ears Diving Barotrauma Scuba set Snorkel Rebreather Ear Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Drowning Decompression sickness Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Hiccup Timeline of underwater technology Hearing impairment Earwax Pneumonia Decibel Balance disorder Diver rescue Diving regulator Scuba diving Cat 1957 World Series Cochlear implant Reflexology Otitis externa It's All Gone Pete Tong Swimming Sound M__ni__re___s disease Wudu Jala neti Spearfish, South Dakota Microphone Dog Ear canal Earring Mosquito Vulcan (Star Trek) Traumatic brain injury Breathing gas Halitosis Radiation therapy Equine conformation Angling Valsalva maneuver Siphon Tai Chi Chuan Sense Breastfeeding Spearfishing Explosive material First aid Spatial disorientation Cetacea Hearing aid Noonan syndrome Stall (flight) Decompression stop Tobacco smoking Wegener's granulomatosis Massage Final Fantasy magic Characters of Naruto Reptile Gramophone record Paget's disease of bone Breaststroke Stroke Otitis media Bene Gesserit Snake Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Stairway Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Common cold Stereophonic sound Book of Isaiah Psychoacoustics Grommet Submarine Naruto jutsu Cephalic disorder Table saw Gun safety Torpedo Bong Cabin pressurization Frogman Italian commando frogmen Bleeding Stethoscope Body piercing Tattoo Deaf Dive computer Whitney Houston Protoss Tooth Crocodilia Free-diving
