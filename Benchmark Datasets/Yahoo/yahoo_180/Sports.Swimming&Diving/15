will wearing ankle wrist weights help me become a faster swimmer i am years old and want to become a faster and stronger swimmer will using them be harmful to my body what size weights should i use tomas it's great to hear from a young swimmer who wants to improve his times make sure when you receive advice on this forum that you get some assurances from the people who advise you that they know what they are talking about i am not a swim coach or trainer but i have been a competitive amateur athlete since boyhood and i still am i have done lots of research into training techniques for my sports running skiing and tennis i have also helped my son with his sport which happens to be swimming he is now a college swimmer in a championship program i asked him your question too we both agreed that ankle and wrist weights are probably not appropriate training techniques for swimmers many basketball players like them but the strain on your joints elbows and knees offset the benefits of the increased resistance from the weights swimmers who want to train with increased resistance usually use hand paddles for their hands and swim fins for their feet the paddles and fins increase the surface area of your hands and feet and so doing allow you to move more water with each stroke or kick moving more water requires more effort and basically increases the resistance it s very important to concentrate on your form and technique when doing this type of training in the water if you let your form break down you will negate the benefit from the extra workload and just teach your body bad swimming habit if you concentrate on proper form in a relaxed but efficient stroke you will go a long way towards making yourself better at your sport many great swimmers train exclusively in the pool logging over a hundred hours in the pool a month others like my son like to break up the swim training with other forms of exercise so that their bodies and minds stay fresh running and weight training in the off season with just one or two light workouts in the pool can keep you interested and break up the tedium of the swim athletes training regimen if you would like to experiment with resistance training my son recommends using the weight training program described by olympic swimmer jason lezak here http www bodybuilding com fun jasonlezak htm my son was very pleased with the results he got using weight training and good technique it might work for you too whatever you do decide on make sure you talk to someone who can help you do things the right way good luck mike Breaststroke Diving Butterfly stroke Swimming pool Triathlon History of swimming Tai Chi Chuan Basketball Medley swimming Equine conformation Mixed martial arts Table tennis Volleyball Sport Marathon (sport) Muay Thai Canoe Professional wrestling holds Cross-country skiing Badminton Judo Running Fencing Boxing Exercise Breastfeeding Martial art Kayak Frogman Alexander Technique Georgia Institute of Technology Fanny Blankers-Koen Water polo Michael Phelps Tennis Urinary incontinence Taekwondo Punt (boat) Lifeguard Swimsuit Sumo Archery 1896 Summer Olympics Sport rowing Dog agility Olympic Games Spanking Sailing Andre Agassi Social rule Osteoarthritis Welding Baseball Scientology beliefs and practices Golf Milton H.
