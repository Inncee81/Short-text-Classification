for all nc realtors i have flipped two homes in the last year and am looking to do some more i am taking a real estate class now and i have heard that if i want to be a real estate investor that i should not take the exam to become an agent i don't understand why this would be bad so my question is if i am mainly looking to invest in real estate flipping properties should i get my real estate licence please explain why or why not thank you for all replies i don't know of a single investor that flips several houses a year that doesn't have a real estate license there are many benefits of having one such as being able to get your house on the mls yourself and only paying commission and lenders will actually allow you to represent yourself as a buyer's agent so you can get a commission back at closing a non realtor can never get cash back at a closing when they purchase property i used to flip houses about or a year before i got into rental properties and i cannot for the life of me think of a single benefit to not having a license Mortgage Real estate Insurance Mutual fund Government National Mortgage Association Title insurance Warren Buffett Microeconomics Annuity Multiple Listing Service Labor theory of value Donald Trump Lawyer Property tax CBS Dividend Citigroup Concurrent estate Financial markets Tax Security (finance) Monopoly (game) Islamic banking Intellectual property Bond Ponzi scheme Temasek Holdings Notary public Income trust Real estate developer Stock Real estate bubble Debt Berkshire Hathaway Trust (Law) USA Real property Mobile home Licence to Kill Finance Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks GNU General Public License Carl G.
