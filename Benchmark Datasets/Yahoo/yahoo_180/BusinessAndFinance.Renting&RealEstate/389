should i try and call her okay my fiance and i found a gorgeous house for rent we were the first ones to call about it the landlord called us last night and said we have someone turning an application in at am so if you guys want to be first drop your applications off before our office opened well we did just that i hadn't heard from her this morning so i called at am she had just gotten into the office said she would go over our application and call us back her office closes at pm i also told her we had the deposit and she said she wouldn't need it until we met up with her well that was at am it's now pm and the office closed at pm should i call again maybe she got busy maybe she's waiting to hear back from our present land lord i'm getting quite nervous any thoughts closes at pm not closed yes call her even if she got busy there isn't anything wrong with keeping up on things especially in the business world if we want something done most of the time we have to keep bugging the people who are involved just call her and ask her what the status is on your application and then go from there there's no harm in that good luck and i hope you get your house ps if any landlord gets upset or discriminates agains a prospective client because they are inquiring about the status of their applications they are not good landlords people like you who want the house and shows interest like you are gives me the impression that you will be reliable for rent Estoppel Social rule Leasing Mortgage Conspiracy (TNG episode) The Inside Poker jargon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Debugging Plame affair Friends Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Avenue Q Knots Landing Pitaten About a Boy Operation Market Garden EastEnders Leasehold estate Shaggy dog story Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Burglary Rent (musical) Plame affair timeline The Amber Spyglass Ashton-Tate Insurance Colony in Space The Death Gate Cycle Good Times Coming of Age (TNG episode) Mary Jane Kelly Full Metal Panic?
