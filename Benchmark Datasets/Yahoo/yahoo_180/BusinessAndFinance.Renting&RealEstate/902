i was supposed to get my deposit refund check days after i moved it's been months already what do i do i live in houston tx and i moved out of my apartment on may th they told me to wait days to get my refund it's been months already but i haven't get it yet first they told me that they sent it to the wrong address so they put a stop payment on the check and will send me another one then they said that by mistake they mailed it to the apartment i moved from i was moving out of it and they sent it over there sounds ridiculous and stupid so another stop payment but this time they were going to fedex it when i called to let them know i haven't get it they told me that they sent it again to a wrong address so i told them that they should call fedex and give them the tracking and find out what happened but no they said that they were going to put another stop payment and they will fedex again this time they'll use their own address and i have to pick it up over there but today when i went to pick it up they said that they fedex to me so i'll have to wait where can i complaint about it fyi my apartment was as good as new when i moved out ok one last chance for these idiots call them and get the fedex tracking number from them if they do not give it them you know they did not send it so next i would go to the court house and file a small claims case against them just a note they seem to like to put stop pays on these checks so when you were in their office i would have demanded they put another stop pay and cut you a check right then and there also if you do receive a check call the bank to verify funds and take it to their bank to cash not yours and call fed ex today just by using your address and name they can tell you if there is a package enroute to you just tell fedex operator you were told that a package was being sent to you good luck Internet fraud United States Postal Service FedEx Corporation Mail Credit card Mail fraud Bond Bank fraud Cheque Tom DeLay Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Social rule Bowl Championship Series James Hanratty Octopus card Schabir Shaik Trial Plame affair CPU cache Poker jargon Advance fee fraud Jack Abramoff Child support Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping Florida Central Voter File Oil-for-Food Programme The Inside Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Debugging 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Economy of Russia United Airlines Taxation in the United States Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Enron Corporation Chatham Square Accounts payable FairTax Wheel of Fortune Annuity Data retention Katelyn Faber Taxicab Tax Ashton-Tate Mensal__o scandal NorthBridge Apartment Complex Futurama (TV series - season 3) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Islamic banking Money creation Ocean's Twelve Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus EFTPOS Mortgage Domain Name System Automated Clearing House Best Buy George Costanza Federal Reserve Good Times Password Appeal American Idiot Paul Martin Armstrong Williams Trademark 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression W.
