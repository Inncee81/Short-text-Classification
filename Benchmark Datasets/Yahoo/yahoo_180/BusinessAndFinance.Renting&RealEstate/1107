has anyone used upack com to move i'm in the process of moving and have been pricing out different companies i have found a great price with upack com and want to know if anyone has had any bad experiences with them i used them in february to move from ca to wa i found them on the internet and their prices were less than all of the other quotes i received i had heard about a lot of shady moving companies before so i checked them out on epinions com and the better business bureau before i decided to use them and their feedback was good i had nothing that arrived damaged but i have heard that you should pack your belongings very tightly and securely in the trailer because otherwise some things may get broken the trickiest part is deciding how much space you need in the trailer the estimate that they provided turned out to be accurate for me everything was clearly spelled out in their contract and they took their space measurements with me so there was no confusion i had a great experience with them and would recommend them i even had to reschedule my pick up date at the last minute and they were very accommodating and friendly also i chose to pack at the terminal and pick up from the terminal instead of having the trailer dropped of at my apartment to load and unload it turned out to be cheaper for me that way including the cost of renting a uhaul truck to take my things to and from the terminal you can choose to pay extra for them to guarantee your delivery date but i chose not to my belongings took one day longer to arrive than they originally estimated but there was a snowstorm so that legitimately slowed them down you can also track the location of your belongings while they are en route i hope this helps you out good luck with your move Less-Than-Truckload (LTL) Shipping Insurance Boston and Lowell Railroad Airport E-mail spam Extreme Programming Semi-trailer Economy of the United States Modem Battle of the Bulge Microeconomics Final Fantasy XI Airbus A380 Mutual fund USS Tunny (SS-282) Auto Train (Amtrak) Hubble Space Telescope Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Battles of Lexington and Concord Norwegian Campaign Health insurance CPU cache IBM PC compatible Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Weezer Fast bowling Short selling Deflation (economics) Space Shuttle program E85 Surveillance Electricity meter USS Waters (DD-115) BC Rail Bulk vending Protoss System/34 Corporate governance United Parcel Service Mobile home Solar cell System/36 Social rule Rail transport in Ireland USS Wahoo (SS-238) Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Upholstery Poker jargon Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Hash table USS Whale (SS-239) Contract Internal ballistics Avalanche Mouse (computing) Annuity GSM services Economics Bond Surplus value Internet fraud Capital accumulation TransUnion Online music store 1957 World Series Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Rail terminology Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 2000 Australian Grand Prix Natural Selection (computer game) Windows XP Norway national football team Acorn Computers PlayStation 3 Gross domestic product Windows Server 2003 USS Wickes (DD-578) Fable (video game) Rational Unified Process Philip J.
