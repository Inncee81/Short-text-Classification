fridge broken is my landlord responsible for the loss of food okay i just went to my fridge and it's not cold whatsoever the dollars i recently spent on food is spoiling as we speak i tried calling my landord he's supposed to offer hour maintenance emergency and the butthole isn't answering his phone i can't afford to just go out and buy more food anyone know if he should be responsible for the loss of my groceries fyi yes i made sure it's plugged in and yes i checked the temperature setting i'm not a complete idiot anyone who can give me the best info gets big ones fyi again i do live in an apartment complex if that makes any difference if you feel he is not responsible do you think it would be fair that we both pay up for the loss often the vent at the bottom of the fridge gets clogged and if you just clean that take a wire brush and run it over that it'll get working pretty well again also pull the grate on the bottom off and run the wire bruch through the metal all under there really this can make a huge difference in some fridges where this is never cleaned still if you went from well cooling to not cooling pretty qjuick its probably a mechanical problem just keep bugging the landlord but if its late you may need to wait until early tomorrow for a call back no i think you are out of luck on any food you lose due to this but the landlord should pay to have the fridge fixed and should do that pretty quickly also don't be to hard on the landlord he's very probably ignoring your call but if its pm or later he probably couldn't get anyone out there tonight anyhow so he just not calling you back as there is nothing he can do right now Poker jargon Solar power Social rule Motor oil Carburetor Microeconomics Leasehold estate Bread Russian joke Knife Heinkel He 100 Public transport Domestic AC power plugs and sockets The Amazing Race Tire Humphrey Bogart Extreme Programming Bong Mach kernel Singlish Procrastination Dairy Piccolo Junior Saga Carbon dioxide Wheel of Fortune Craps Vacuum tube Make money fast Futurama (TV series - season 5) Shaggy dog story Thermal power station FairTax U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Sin City Monopoly (game) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Soldering Ocean's Twelve Mattress Flat tax Ozone depletion Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Cheating in Counter-Strike Modem Burglar alarm Iggy Pop Bulk vending Episodes of Lost (Season 1) M16 (rifle) RuneScape quests Spark plug Thermostat Gas metal arc welding Brewery The Inside The Ashlee Simpson Show Strap-on dildo IPod Rush Limbaugh Pretty Good Privacy Kasparov versus The World Avenue Q Sonic the Hedgehog Reading spark plugs for racing Swimming Welding Hard disk Computer forensics Ozone hole MMORPG Fuse (electrical) Redundant array of independent disks Ben Johnson (athlete) Overhead lines AFI 100 Years series Wal-Mart Foodborne illness Universal Serial Bus Neopets Nuclear power Textile manufacturing Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks 1957 World Series Babylonian law Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Piano Plastic Violin Toyota Prius InterCity Express Internet fraud Escape from New York Full Metal Panic?
