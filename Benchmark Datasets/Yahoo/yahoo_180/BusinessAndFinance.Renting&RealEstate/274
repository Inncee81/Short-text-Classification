renting a house do you think this is fair i saw my dream house i've got the money for the rent and deposit and i know i can afford it but the agent is taking character references for all the applicants and is going to choose who he 'likes' best to get the house is this fair ethical surely they should give the house to the first person to confirm they want it and hand over the deposit etc i understand them asking for bank references but i feel that kind of picking and choosing is unfair i am a student with jobs who has worked extremely hard to get myself into a better situation my empoyer doesn't give references and the other person who could give me a reference is on holiday they are going to give the house to one of the working couples who both have jobs because it 'looks' better i'm gutted do you think this is right or should it be first to the post there are certain things a landlord cannot base their renting decisions on they cannot base it on race religion age sex or sexual orientation etc of the persons renting that said the landlord has the ability to rent to those people who they think are the most responsible and reliable people out there most good landlords learn to make a thorough check of prospective tenants including personal an professional references as well as past landlords to find out if there is any history which might cause them to doubt your responsibility remember it may be a rental to you but the owner is signing over the well being of a very expensive asset that belongs to them so that you can live in and potentially party in smoke in do drugs in and otherwise destroy on him if he choses the next renter badly so yes he has the right to chose a renter based on their perception of your responsibility Leasing Rental agreement Gentrification Housing cooperative Babylonian law Abortion debate Leasehold estate Goodness and value theory Estoppel Public housing Monopoly (game) Motion picture rating system Theory of conduct Parasite singles Social rule Ethics Avenue Q Sexual orientation Human sexual behavior Apartment Karl Rove Scientology beliefs and practices Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Microeconomics Employment law Randomness Rent control Economic inequality Capital accumulation Infantilism Unemployment Concurrent estate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Eviction Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks The nature of God in Western theology Annuity Anarchism and capitalism Transsexuality Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Pitaten David Hume Economic rent Alcoholics Anonymous Theodicy Free will Intermediate consumption Little Britain Philosophical skepticism Judiciary of Hong Kong FairTax Monetary policy Asset Capitalism Plame affair Aesthetic Realism Efficiency wages Prostate cancer Prostitution Inflation The Young Ones (TV series) Property tax Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Apartment building Public policy Real estate economics Joseph Chamberlain Flat tax First-sale doctrine Cancer Education in the People's Republic of China Unlawful combatant Ethical consumerism Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Transactional analysis Education in the United States Corporate governance Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Same-sex marriage Life insurance Polyamory Coercion Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Katelyn Faber Poker jargon Causality Mortgage Dissociative identity disorder Economics Harlem Friends Waste (law) Bank Dead Like Me Sant Thakar Singh Gender role Public domain
