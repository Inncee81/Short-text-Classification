what should i say to our landlord we are in a year lease and need to break it or sublet it i am months pregnant and currently live miles from any relatives we are going to need their help when the baby comes and we have found a new house that is closer to my mom and brother and aunt's and can move in today if we wanted how do i approach my current landlord we do have a friend that can finish the rest of our lease and has great credit and a good backround and is willing to move in as soon as we move out whats the best way to start off the conversation to break our lease should i do it over the phone or in person do you think he will understand and not charge us any penaltys help i would approach the landlord in person if possible don't forget that a landlord is usually looking at profit and loss and does not look at the situation as emotionally as a tenant who considers the place their home he will probably be fine with it especially if you have a friend who can take on the lease before you go do check your contractual terms what are the conditions on breaking a lease are there any penalties you need to know where you stand so that you can speak confidently broach the subject starting with explaining about your pregnancy and then ask whether he would prefer to take on your friend as a tenant or that you would sublet the property and let him choose between those two options if you make it as effortless as possible as it seems you already have done by finding someone to take the lease on he really shouldn't have a problem Leasing Leasehold estate Babylonian law Friends Contract Estoppel The Amazing Race Social rule EastEnders Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Rental agreement Melanie Wilkes Eviction Waste (law) Neighbours Pregnancy Sexual orientation Schabir Shaik Trial New York Jets Concurrent estate Charmed Property law Manorialism Shaggy dog story Real property Microeconomics Knots Landing Sharon Tate Burglary Hubert H.
