can i find someone who is reliable mature responsible to take care of my apartment while i'm on vacations my family and i always go on vacations and i am in need of someone to handle my mail newspaper deliveries clean my apartment minus the floor mopping and window cleaning as well as handling the recycling any ideas if you are on vacation how dirty is your house really getting if it is just a week you should be able to water your plants and clean your house just before you go and you can stop your newspaper and mail of course you can't do this if you have pets in your house if you are talking about more than a week have houseplants or pets you should be able to find someone reliable but the problem is finding someone who can do everything since cleaning is usually not part of someone's deal when they are house sitting your best bet is to ask around to someone you trust first frankly there are very few people i would trust to go in my house but i do have a few responsible neighbors who i would definitely trust if you are going with an outside agency you would have to make sure they are insured i do know of lots of people who have had someone clean their houses and they have gotten stuff stolen Garfield Houseplant Pet skunk Consensus decision-making Sento Social rule Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Fancy rat Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Public-key cryptography Nuclear power Brewery Japanese tea ceremony Community emergency response team Plame affair timeline Autonomous building Domestic rabbit Energy development United States Postal Service Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Full House American Red Cross Donald Rumsfeld Blood Simple Microeconomics Blackjack The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Sims The Daily Show Weasley family Solar power Survivor (novel) Rent (musical) Trusts and estates Avenue Q House Moe Szyslak Spam Prevention Early Warning System E-mail spam National Health Service Ethical consumerism Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks M16 (rifle) Software bug Grover Cleveland Unemployment Insurance Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Suburbs of Johannesburg Kibbutz Poker jargon 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Le Corbusier Richard Chase 2003 North America blackout Windows 2000 Cruising (maritime) Florida Keys Microcredit Vacuum cleaner Charles Ives Kashrut ZIP Code Mid-levels Citigroup Doublespeak Dialysis Chatsworth House Email authentication Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Computer virus Animal Crossing Chevy Chase Theory of conduct Discus (fish) EastEnders Leo Frank Japanese toilet Health insurance Textile manufacturing Scouting Air traffic controller Charles, Prince of Wales Magic (cryptography) Public bodies and task forces of the UK government Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Dry cleaning Robot Palmdale, California Fahrenheit 9/11 F.
