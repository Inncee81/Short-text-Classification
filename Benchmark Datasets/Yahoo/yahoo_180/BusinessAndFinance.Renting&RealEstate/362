can a ny lease purchase tenant be evicted before purchase for non payment obviously the purpose of a lease to purchase agreement is to sell so you would charge late fees first and what not but what happens if the tenant buyer is days or more delinquent can you evict or must it be a foreclosure if there is a lease with an option to purchase tim this is unrelated to my question i am the seller trying to find out if i would get taken advantage if i do a lease to own and the people stop paying i am not in any danger of foreclosure not even close but thanks be forewarned the general concensus among landlords is that most folks who say that they are only interested in lease purchase rentals are scammers who are only trying to find a way to make themselves more of a nuisance to get rid of but if you have a well written agreement then they are strictly a tenant until the actually close on the property and they forfiet any and all equity in the agreement if they violate any of the terms of the agreement yes i would charge late fees and i wouldn't wait days for the rent to begin eviction keep in mind an eviction takes a minimum of days and can take months how much money can you afford to lose and how much time do you want to give them to trash the place you evict a tenant and you foreclose on a mortgagee rent your place if you want to be a landlord and sell the place if you don't if your prospective tenant really wants the place they can always make the offer to buy it whenever they qualify for finiancing Leasehold estate Leasing Housing cooperative Eviction Rental agreement Estoppel Islamic banking Security (finance) Predatory lending Concurrent estate Babylonian law Foreclosure Annuity Real estate broker Stock Monopoly (game) Conveyancing Allodial title First-sale doctrine Futures contract 401(k) Public housing Life insurance Taxation in the United States Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Derivative (finance) Renting Insurance MMORPG Squatting Oakland Athletics Intellectual property Land reform Internet fraud Government National Mortgage Association New Deal Mutual fund Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hire purchase Real estate bubble Great Depression Capitalism Microeconomics Student loan Fixtures Deflation (economics) Apartment building Unconscionability Real estate Debt Eminent domain Advance fee fraud SCO-Linux controversies Plame affair RuneScape cheats Arbitrage CPU cache PE ratio Operating surplus Economics Property (ownership right) Call option Unreformed House of Commons Option Timeline of the Enron scandal Real property American individualist anarchism Credit card Free trade Stock market Supply and demand CBS Publicly funded medicine Price discrimination Lehigh and New England Railroad British residential property market Confidence trick Put option Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Stamp duty Schabir Shaik Trial Art Modell Bond Barrister Municipal bond Airline Hedge fund Poker jargon Anarchism and capitalism
