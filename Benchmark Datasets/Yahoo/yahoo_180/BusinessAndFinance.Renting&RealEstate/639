attention loan and title agents need house guidance i found a dirt cheap property foreclosure nice looking from the outside problem is they made an addition on someone else's property it looks like a big garage added to the house and are telling me that i can't buy it or will have problems buying it they said that the property has either had contracts or sold times i have of the value that i can pay with me but i would need financing for the rest my question is how bad is it can i just cut off that part what questions should i ask and will i get financing interesting this is pretty complicated but here goes the gagrage is encroaching on someone elses land the first question i would find out is how long has the garage been added to the house you as the owner are basically trespassing and the property is in violation of the towns city's zoning laws no title insurance would be issued and hence no loan however if the garage has been there for a long time there may be a loop hole you may try to get an easement from the landowner you are encroaching upon my advice would be to hire a good real estate lawyer and ask if they would do a consultation you can talk to the town builing inspector for his input for free Mortgage Easement Real estate broker Property (ownership right) Microeconomics Title insurance Insurance Life insurance Adverse possession Islamic banking Babylonian law Allodial title Deflation (economics) Theory of conduct Predatory lending SCO-Linux controversies Zoning Surplus value Land reform Property tax Oakland Athletics Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capitalism Leasing Tax Foreclosure Capital accumulation Intellectual property Externality Great Depression Donald Trump Plame affair ACORN Free trade Money Stock Labor theory of value Mutual fund Non-aggression principle Estoppel Annuity Real property Trespasser Government National Mortgage Association Property law Monetary policy Conservation easement Contract American individualist anarchism Ownership Warren Buffett Wal-Mart Anarchism and capitalism Taxation in the United States Copyright Lawyer Short selling Unreformed House of Commons Personal finance Gross domestic product Health insurance Torrens title Digital rights management United Kingdom corporation tax Trust (Law) USA Privatization Corporation Financial markets Anarcho-capitalism Student loan Lloyd's of London Mensal__o scandal Economy of the United States Economy of Russia Joseph P.
