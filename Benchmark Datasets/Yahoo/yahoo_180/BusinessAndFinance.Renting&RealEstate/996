real estate careers i'm in college about to start my senior year for fashion and retail management but i'm starting to doubt if it's something that i want to do for most of my life i've noticed that i'm very interested in real estate sometimes i browse the internet to look at apartments and houses in other states just for the fun of it plus i'm constantly looking at real estate shows on television i think i'd be interested in real estate appraisal is this a good field to go into can you tell me what type of training is necessary college degree certificate etc what type of salary do real estate appraisers make would it likely be worth it for me to change career paths i don't know what planet luisa has been on but although re appraisal can be difficult to get into it is a good field appraisals are in demand whether houses are selling or not appraisals are requested by lenders attorneys for divorces and settling estates insurance companies and people buying and selling houses appraising can be challenging you have to do much more than take pictures and find comparables to place a value on the house you have to have construction knowledge too the requirements to be an appraiser vary by state so you will want to check that out in my area you have to apprentice with an experienced appraiser and the local appraisers haven't been willing to have apprentices to avoid competition Mortgage Donald Trump Real estate Real estate appraisal Lawyer Insurance Microeconomics Federal National Mortgage Association Paralegal Life insurance Title insurance Mutual fund Tax Education in Germany Hartford, Connecticut Ocean's Twelve Inflation The Apprentice Bank Attorney at Law Property tax The Apprentice 2 Quizbowl Apprenticeship Annual percentage rate The Apprentice 2 candidates Real property Business Bond Trust (Law) USA Education in the United States Google Neopets Finance Notary public Valuation (finance) Citigroup Van Sweringen brothers Real estate economics Supply and demand Primerica Financial Services NASDAQ School counselor Education in Australia Model (economics) Guild Price discrimination Motion picture rating system Jennifer Lopez Warren Buffett Worldwide ERC Health insurance Maryland General Assembly Election, 2006 Mediation Alois Hitler Annuity Unemployment Wells Fargo Capital accumulation Concurrent estate Council house Deflation (economics) Fullerton, California Publishing Teacher Student loan Professor The Amazing Race Conveyancing Carlsbad, California Airsoft Economy of Russia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Freeters Corporate governance Oakland Athletics Emerson College Road-rule enforcement camera Insider trading The Apprentice 1 Amtrak Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act The Apprentice 3 Predatory lending William Hogarth Trinity College, Dublin UCAS Barry Minkow Construction Taxation in the United States Tai Chi Chuan Rob Portman Monopoly (game) Babylonian law American individualist anarchism Auction Physician Blackjack
