rental security deposit question i recently moved from a condo and had a security deposit cat deposit cleaning fee and painting fee the cat damaged screens in the unit but otherwise there was no damage i figure there would be about cost for rescreening the screens i had a few places where the paint needed to be touched up and the carpets needed to be shampooed should i receive back since the cleaning fee paint fee cover the cleaning part how long should i wait for a refund before getting upset at the landlord days after vacating is when you should get your refund furthermore the landlord must provide you with a detailed list of any money he or she keeps for argument's sake lets say the screens were each that's actually very reasonable you would get back total is gone b c of the cat for screens then comes out of your deposit for the rd screen the cleaning fee was a fee not a deposit you won't get that back painting fee was a fee not a deposit so you won't get that back therefore the owner cannot deduct additional money for painting and cleaning unless he or she can prove repainting and cleaning was substantial and beyond the coverage allowed by the fee hope that answers your question Publicly funded medicine Credit card Taxation in the United States Rental agreement Insurance Octopus card Mortgage EFTPOS Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Social Security (United States) Shampoo Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Leasing Renting Short selling Paintball National Kidney Foundation Singapore United States Postal Service Intellectual property Donald Trump Public domain Auto insurance Eviction Canada Health Act Health savings account Life insurance Tax Star Trek: Enterprise Babylonian law Unemployment benefit Sumo Carpet United Kingdom corporation tax Land reform Copyright Cable television Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Television licence Student loan Medicare (United States) Health insurance 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Social Security debate (United States) Bail bondsman Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Gas metal arc welding $ale of the Century Krag-J__rgensen Flat tax London Congestion Charge London Underground Kwantlen University College Wal-Mart The Apprentice 2 Eliot Spitzer Kyoto Protocol Nintendo Entertainment System Islamic banking Welding FairTax Movie projector Predatory lending MMORPG Housing cooperative World Championship Wrestling M16 (rifle) Alex Ferguson Internet fraud Margin (finance) Health care in the United States The Football League Union Pacific Railroad Automatic teller machine Magical objects in Harry Potter Public good Something Awful Economics 2005 United States Grand Prix Day trading Ocean's Twelve Kibbutz Katelyn Faber Bank Leeds United F.C.
