i am getting ready to buy my first home what kind of programs are out there for st time home buyer's what is the best way to find a good lender i do not know what my taxes will be or insurance so it is tough to decide what my price range is any help would be great the first thing you need to do is go to a bank or a local mortgage broker since he she will know approximately what the taxes and insurance will be as a percentage of your loan for your area he she will claculate what you can afford if they are good they will also pull your credit and ask for supporting documentation so that there will be no surpises when you have found a home to buy also they will be able to tell you what programs are available for you as a first time buyer and for your profession the broker and the banker should be able to provide you with a good faith estimate which will give you an estimate of monthly payments and closing costs i e money you would have to pay in order to get the home and a truth in lending which will tell you the total amount of all your payments providing you keep the loan for the full term e g years and the adjusted interest rate which takes into account all fees and charges to you once you place an actual loan application i e after you have found the house getting these documents within hours is the law be aware that on the good faith estimte the banks do not have to follow the same disclosures as the brokers so some of their fees are hidden or grouped under some general category in order to ensure that you have found the best lender shop around once you have a signed i e signed by both seller and you the buyer agreeing to all terms and conditions contract on a home it would be most expedient to complete a few loan applications within hours of the executed contract to meet any of the loan deadline requirements having your credit pulled for these applications will not affect your credit if done within a short time span in florida there are many programs through the counties cities faith based organizations and other charitable organizations for first time buyers some offer downpayment assitance e g in palm beach county you can get up to k depending on your income and family size some programs are there to ensure that you get a low interest rate others are just subsides many of them allow you to use or combine other programs most of these programs do not require you to pay back the loan unless you sell wthin years for plam beach county it is years Predatory lending Student loan Bond Bank Life insurance Short selling Islamic banking Annuity Stock Deflation (economics) Monetary policy Contract Microeconomics Real estate bubble Mutual fund Credit card Taxation in the United States Financial markets Tax Title insurance Citigroup Economy of Russia Corporation Supply and demand Financial services Finance Social Security (United States) Annual percentage rate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax Futures contract Primerica Financial Services Inflation Derivative (finance) Mergers and acquisitions Gold standard Price discrimination Government debt Government National Mortgage Association Option Money 401(k) Personal finance Leasing Central bank Usury Interest Debt GNU General Public License Economy of the United States Bretton Woods system ACORN Capitalism Conveyancing Wal-Mart Health insurance Education in the United States Subsidy Stock market History of the United States (1918-1945) Surplus value United Kingdom corporation tax Corporate finance Money supply Federal National Mortgage Association New Deal Estoppel Federal Reserve Social Security debate (United States) Trust (Law) USA Internet fraud Economy of India Savings and loan association Publicly funded medicine Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Housing cooperative Islamic economics Gross domestic product Anarchism and capitalism Dividend Illegal drug trade Hire purchase Margin (finance) Certificate of deposit Unemployment benefit Credit derivative Agricultural policy Wind power Public good
