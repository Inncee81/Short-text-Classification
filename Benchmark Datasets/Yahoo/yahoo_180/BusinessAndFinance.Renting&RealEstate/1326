what is the general cost to start in real estate i have researched the basics of getting into real estate such as the classes you need the cost of the license the test you need to take and other legal matters my main question is how much money is typically needed to really get going i live in georgia and am pretty sure that the cost of the license is and the test is i've heard that in person classes range from while online classes go between and that you shouldn't take the online classes if someone could elaborate on this it would be much appreciated also a ballpark estimate of how much money would be needed for other fees that pop up such as advertising yourself i live at home with parents currently so living expenses would be minimum any information would be much appreciated advertising prices vary and when you advertise in newspapers sometimes certain companies offer special deals one cost you aren't considering is the fees to join and maintain a membership to your local board of realtors which in my neck of the woods costs about a year also it might be necessary for you to keep errors and omissions insurance which will likely cost you a year then there are the everyday expenses that catch when you aren't looking like gas color copies signs or the rider signs with your name and phone number you put with your company signs continuing education lock boxes and or the electronic key to open them cell phone your usage will rise and other office expenses the big one is that after all that you have to split your commission with your broker often when starting out i hope this helps you toward your final tally Insurance Real estate broker Mutual fund Lawyer Education in the United States United States Postal Service Credit card Cable television Taxation in the United States Education in the People's Republic of China Wal-Mart Life insurance Software patent debate Acorn Computers Pharmaceutical company National Kidney Foundation Singapore Broadband Internet access Microsoft Floppy disk E-mail spam Tax Intellectual property Advertising Microeconomics Graduate school Medical prescription Homeschooling Solar power Internet fraud Sears Holdings Corporation Spam (electronic) Education in Germany Plastic Doomsday argument Day trading Mach kernel Stock Monopoly (game) Computer Notary public Modem Blackjack Voice over IP Verizon Wireless Contract Public domain Surveillance Auction Paintball Global Positioning System Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Pretty Good Privacy Nuclear power RFID GNU General Public License Password Morse Code Opera (web browser) Trust (Law) USA Real estate economics Warren Buffett Annuity Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Poker jargon Motion picture rating system Euro Illegal drug trade Hydrogen economy Food and Drug Administration Mortgage Alcohol fuel Taxicab Chiropractic ITunes Music Store U.S. presidential election, 2000 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Publicly funded medicine Am730 Photography Micropayment American Broadcasting Company E85 Embedded system Citigroup America Online Open-source software Digital circuit Billboard (advertising) Transformation problem
