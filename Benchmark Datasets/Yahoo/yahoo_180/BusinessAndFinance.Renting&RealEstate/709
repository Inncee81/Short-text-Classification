has anyone lived in an apartment and you can hear the people upstairs having sex does anyone have any ideals on what to do i bought a fan to block out the noise and i cant move i have a lease compete j k that can be really frustrating i would try to find a way to let them know that you can hear them and it's bothering you maybe knock on the ceiling a few times if that doesn't work or if you can't bring yourself to talk to them about it then it might be time to invest in ear plugs sorry Sin City Avenue Q Hearing impairment Friends Public Image Ltd.
