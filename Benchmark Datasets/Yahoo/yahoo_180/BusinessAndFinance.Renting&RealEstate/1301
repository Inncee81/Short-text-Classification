cosigning an apartment with somebody for a year than leaving i am currently on a lease that i cosigned with somebody else in february it is for a bedroom bath apartment all utilities are included except for cable and internet if i decide not to renew the lease and move out can my room mate keep the apartment and can she be the only one the lease or would she have to find another room mate is it possible for somebody to lease an apartment for a year by themselves at mos they get a room mate for mos can she and the other person cosign a lease or is cosigning strictly for year long terms i thought that she and i were cosigners because the full rent of the apartment is a month she pays and i pay another supposedly if i tried to get out of it in the middle of the lease if she did not want to pay for the other half or if she did not find a roomie who could pay for my half that i would have to be responsible it is confusing because i was told if i took my name off of the lease and somebody put their name on it if they did not pay their part of the rent or messed something up in the house it would mess up my credit when you and your roommate signed your lease you both promised to rent the apartment for the full term of the contract once the contract has been fulfilled the question of whether or not your roommate and a different roommate or your roommate by herself can remain and sign a new lease is completely at the discretion of the landlord leases are never the same some say you can have roommates some don't allow them and others say yes but there will be an extra charge the thing to remember is that the original lease is a contract between the landlord and the original tenants and if another person comes along looking for a place to live they have no rights or responsibilities to the property unless the the landlord acknowledges them as a tenant too by the same token you will always be a tenant with rights and responsibilities to the property unless the landlord has given you written permission otherwise Leasehold estate Leasing Rental agreement Apartment Estoppel Babylonian law Chatham Square Vista Way The Commons Apartment building NorthBridge Apartment Complex Property (ownership right) Monopoly (game) Irish Land Act Chatsworth House Friends Stuyvesant Town Land reform Housing cooperative Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Rent (musical) Public housing Property law Renting Manorialism Contract Boston and Lowell Railroad Plame affair Harlem American individualist anarchism Concurrent estate Hani Hanjour Islamic banking SCO-Linux controversies Section 8 (housing) Student loan 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Modding Serfdom Oakland Athletics Intellectual property The Inside Rent control Unreformed House of Commons Social rule Judiciary of Hong Kong First-sale doctrine Assignment (law) Miss Saigon Condominium Mortgage Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Squatting Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim George W.
