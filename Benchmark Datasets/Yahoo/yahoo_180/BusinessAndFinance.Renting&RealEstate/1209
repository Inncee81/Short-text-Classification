can you purchase a commercial rental property without cash say the property was and through an llc can i finance the as a new llc without any company credit or assets say that they want down also could i personally garauntee the myself and lend that to the llc so then the llc can make the down payment so if i did it that way could i then finance the other with the llc cause i was always under the immpression that commercial rental properties are not valued like a home that the loan is based on the actual property itself the value of the building so the loan amount wasn't based on assets that the llc already had but that it could be based on what the building was worth please help thankyou closing fees and transaction fees realy has nothing to do with it you can get the seller to pay or you can finance them in with the building thanks though there are a couple of things you an do to acquire this property none of which is without coming up with a down payment and you have to have cash unless the current owner is gonna take back the financing themselves most lenders want to see a down payment of or more for any entity to purchase a commercial property if the llc has no credit history or money in the bank chances are you will have to personnally guarantee the loan yourself called a re course loan even if you placed any funds in the bank account of the llc it has no banking history or what is known as seasoned funds the llc also has no history of earning any money so it can not prove how it can repay the loan under any circumstances we are now at financing the loan with your down and you placing the property in the llc's name you would have to guarantee the loan personally for the other you may use the llc's checks to repay the loan thus giving it some history what is your reasoning for wanting to do this property this way are you attempting to establish credit for the llc if so there are other ways of accomplishing this building corporate credit is like building personal credit it takes time and baby steps who do you know will lend a year old high school graduate with no credit history no job or means of paying back the loan the same applies to a corporation i hope this has been of some use to you good luck fight on Bond Corporation Money Student loan Insurance Islamic banking Finance Debt Citigroup Financial services Donald Trump Stock Short selling Bank fraud Tax Annuity Interest Leasing Security (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Predatory lending Life insurance Mergers and acquisitions Monetary policy Mutual fund 401(k) Capital accumulation Cheque Personal finance Temasek Holdings Microeconomics Deflation (economics) Microcredit Corporate finance Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Derivative (finance) Bretton Woods system Savings and loan association Bank of America Government debt Mortgage-backed security Financial markets Usury Inflation Limited liability company Internet fraud Capitalism Housing cooperative Federal National Mortgage Association Tertiary education fees in Australia Municipal bond Money creation Bank of China (Hong Kong) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Trust (Law) USA Primerica Financial Services FairTax Government National Mortgage Association Collateralized debt obligation Trademark Soci__t__ G__n__rale Surplus value Great Depression Enron Corporation Futures contract Taxation in the United States Real estate broker Debt consolidation Wells Fargo Marshall Plan Credit score Schabir Shaik Trial Economy of the United States Accounting methods Fractional-reserve banking Real estate Contract Hyperinflation PE ratio Economy of India Securitization Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Education in the United States Islamic economics Productive and unproductive labour Wachovia Variable universal life insurance
