had an electrician come out and check my lines only to find out that the lines have been spliced and i' m paying in part fot the whole fourplex my landlord told me good luck in proving it i'm gonna need tath and then some i live in long beach ca and have checked with the elec co and they say that they cna't help cause its from the meters to the house and that makes it a civil matter help this thing is driving me crazy i have lived in a bdrm apt in a fourplex for the past three years and have been paying astronomical elec bills since moving in after receiving an bill this after paying a month for the past months on a level pay plan i have had sce investigate and they say that the meter reads are correct so i had aqn electricain come in and check out my lines there are lines that feed into my meter but only three that reach my elec panel in my apt plus there is a breaker box attached to my meter that probably powers the garage in which lives a guy with an elec wheelchair the electricain says that there is another junction box and a splice somewhere in the house and that i am definately absorbing other tenents usage to some degree my landlord jsut laughed at me when i brought this to his attention and told me to prove it as he knows that will be no easy task in my getting back approximately that he owes me for stealing my power help this is driving me crazy it may cost some money but before you start alerting everyone in the world about what you discovered or what you were told you must have positive proof i am not an attorney or an expert on your situation but i think you can get the ball rolling by doing the following a videotape or take pictures of the box and the lines make sure the pictures are very clear and very detailed b date and sign those photgraphs a if you have to it might be to your benefit to get a licensed registered and insured electrician who does work in that municipality to come in and explain to you where the lines are going and which apartment is being charged for electricity used by the other apartment who did the splicing and who is committing the theft please do not telephone or e mail the folks at city hall each every day the wonderful ladies and gentlemen working at city hall get bombarded with requests b the best way to do this is to go to the municipal building and ask for a list of registered electricians which that municipality recognizes and who probably paid the municipality a fee for a license and or registration in order to be able to do work in that municipality c you must make a physical appearance you must actually go to the municipal building and ask to speak with someone in the building codes or licensing and inspection office this is what those offices are referred to in pennsylvania i don t have a clue what they would be called out there if that municipality does not do that particular aspect or they don t have a department as i mentioned ask the person on duty if he she can recommend about five electricians who do work on a regular basis in that municipality d write down those names e ask that person working at city hall if its okay with him her if you can mention his her name when you make the calls to the electricians if its okay it may help to get your foot in the door with that company or that person a when you get home begin calling the electricians on that list b don t forget to ask the person answering the phone what his her name is knowing a person s name even if its only a first name goes a long way to getting in touch with the powers that be when a person has a difficult sounding name spell it out phonetically if you possibly can avoid it do not leave your name or phone number with any message on a voice mail or answering machine use this only as a last resort c briefly explain your situation to the receptionist ask the receptionist who it would be you would be speaking with or if he she that person isn t in ask when would be a more convenient time for you to call back to speak with that person call at the appointed time and briefly explain the situation to that person ask if he she can come out and give you a professional opinion about the situation if he she isn t able ask if he she can recommend someone or a company who does that work you may have to call an electrical inspection or electrical certification service company or individual all day long all these ladies and gentlemen do is inspect electrical systems and certify them as being up to code a when that person comes out inspects the system and provides a professional opinion about the situation and its discovered there is theft going on due to splicing or whatever is being done to run up your electric bill ask if he she will write his her opinion on his her company's letterhead and b if you will prepare a statement on your computer if he she will go with you to a notary public and get that statement notarized a when these steps are accomplished here s what your next step is b telephone e mail and write letters to all of the following b your landlord tell him her you have proof positive about the theft of the electricity each and every month that theft is causing you to pay a lot of extra money on your electric bill at this time its not necessary to tell him her how you got that information and proof demand an immediate correction of the situation as far as an adjustment to your bill i simply don t have a clue how this should be handled other than alerting the electric company give the landlord a reasonable amount of time about fifteen to thirty days to correct the situation stress to your landlord how much of an extra financial burden this is causing you i know this is a very slow time consuming aggravating costly and frustrating process if your assumption proves to be fact it should work in your favor b if the landlord does not correct the situation by that last day of that time period write to the electric company you should write different letters to your landlord and the electric company using the same facts stress to the electric company how much of an extra financial burden this is causing you b if the landlord doesn t do the right thing by you and correct the situation the next step is to write to the electric company or you may wish to consult with a knowledgeable competent attorney familiar with public utility matters b the county city district attorney carbon copy cc the exact same letters you sent to your landlord and the electric company to this office b the california state attorney general s office carbon copy cc the exact same letters you sent to your landlord the electric company the district attorney s office to the california state attorney general s office b the california state public utility commission or whatever the state governing body is who controls utilities in the state b when you write letters to these entities or officials please get an exact name with the correct spelling and correct address for your correspondence to that person when you simply type or address a letter and or envelope to the office of the attorney general sacramento ca or another generic name or department your correspondence might just sit on the bottom of that pile until someone decides to open your correspondence and look a little bit deeper into your letter and its accusations c please don t shortcut or skip any steps i know this is going to take time thank you for asking your question you did a great job not only for your information but for every other person interested in reading a sensible answer my answer tyvm i wish you well vty ron b Expert system Theory of conduct Identity theft Taxation in the United States
