if they have increased recently and are there plans to change what they cover or will those monthly costs be going up or down in the near future when i moved into the condo in june my fees were month on january st they dropped to month in my world paying less a month is like a raise i would also want to know about the reserves the condo association has for emergencies contingencies and future improvements also if the condo association is planning a large project the condo fees you have been told may be due to increase talk to your realtor or real estate agent they should be able to clear this up during pre qualification these fees should have been entered into the equation sometimes a person can qualify for everything until they add the condo fees which adjusts the income ratio standings and makes them no longer look 'good on paper' in the process of closing the seller will have to give you copies of the most updated condo docs that are available at this time you may have to pay a 'copying fee' or something to that nature some of these docs can be hundreds of pages long other i've seen pages you will have a specified amount of time to look over these docs and see if you can 'abide' by the rules and regs laid out by the condo association if for any reason you cannot accept the condo docs and all the rules and regs that apply to the property you may and i say may depending on the real estate laws of your area state be able to end the sales buyers contract please discuss all of this with your realtor or real estate agent they should get paid to keep you informed and keep informing you about the process at all steps along the way if they are not doing this for you demand that they do their job or find another realtor or real estate agent that will realtors do this for a living and understand the closing process most folks will get into a real estate transaction only a few times in their lives a realtor can have hundreds if not thousands of transactions in their careers sometimes realtors can forget that a buyer or seller may not be informed as they are and make the assumption that the buyer or seller are better informed than they really are a good realtor or real estate agent will keep you informed and be there to answer any and all questions the more you know the less buyer's remorse if any you will have best of luck and do not be afraid to ask questions this is one of the largest purchases you will make in this life you need to be well informed to make the right choices Taxation in the United States Supply and demand Life
