retard what do i do people i know and meet always call disabled people retarded etc and have no respect and think its so funny and my brothers mentally disabled not so much just mild autism but i never mention it to anymore because of their attitudes towards disabled people what do i do luna i'm a little confused by you you say that people you know always call disabled people retarded have no respect think it's so funny if you know that this is wrong and you have an autistic brother why do you hang around with them you say that you never mention your brother his autism anymore because of their attitudes towards disabled people so what do you do laugh along with them i don't know how old you are i can understand you want friends but shouldn't your brother come first your brother is not retarded he has autism which is a developmental disability i worked with autistic children for some years before i became physically disabled from illness autistic children can often be of higher intelligence than healthy people you ask what can you do first you can stop being ashamed of your brother i don't know how old your brother is or how easy it is for him to be around people he does not know or large groups of people if he is old enough why don't you take your brother out with you sometimes it may be good for him it will certainly be good for you to get used to being with a disabled person in public this may help you learn how to deal with ignorant people your brother is not going away and neither is his autism although he may improve greatly you need to accept him with pride for who he is why don't you say something to these people when they start with their comments about retarded people tell them to grow up already that they're not funny get angry tell them you're sick of hearing that crap if these people do not stop i think it's time for you to find new friends when i was in school there were a few jerks like that and they thought they were the funniest people around i knew they were jerks so i didn't hang around with them it can't be possible that everyone you meet is like this tell yourself you are better than they are don't sink to their low level have pride in yourself in your brother find friends you can be proud of too good luck Autism rights movement Controversies in autism Asperger syndrome Mental retardation Autistic culture Mental illness Rain Man Political correctness Ethical challenges to autism treatment Neurodiversity Autism epidemic Learning disability Autistic savant Autistic community Autistic spectrum Stuttering Gifted Shaggy dog story Social rule Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Intelligence quotient Facilitated communication Disability Cephalic disorder Piccolo Junior Saga Shit AFI 100 Years series Alcoholics Anonymous Eugenics Pervasive developmental disorder Homer Simpson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Theory of mind Hypoglycemia Bernard Rimland Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Friends Aspies For Freedom Milton H.
