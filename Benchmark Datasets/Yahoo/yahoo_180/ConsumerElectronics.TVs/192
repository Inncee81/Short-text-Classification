i'm curious why more people don't go projection with the price of projectors dropping and the quality already at the p level i'm confused as to why anyone would buy just a regular tv for times the price smaller screen and the same picture quality are people just not aware that projection is an option or do they think that the picture quality is bad or what i'm just wondering why more people don't do it weeder i guess i should have clarified front projection kyality that's all good but any tv less than you will not be able to tell a dif between p and p plus the only thing even broadcasting p is blue ray and hd dvd you can get a p pj for k which is the same if not less than a rear projection tv aman all valid points however i disagree with you regarding it as a regular tv we've been using it for years and it works exactly the same as a regular tv amaan with all due respect that is just not true after the initial setup granted the setup is more complicated but not that much and most people have separate sound anyway for surround we have one system in the living room in the bedroom and they all work just like regular tv you just turn in on and watch and we only have remote that works everything a few reasons why people don't choose projection more complicated setup a longer wire runs from sources to projector b must find a place to mount both the projector and the screen c projector location cannot have any obstructions between it and the screen d separate audio system is required because projector doesn't have built in speakers lamp in projector will burn out every few years and replacement can be costly not everyone wants a really large screen with its large image and lack of built in speakers casual tv watching is impossible with a projector even just watching the news in the morning has to be a big theater production cooling fan for projector's lamp makes noise some people would consider a screen on the wall even a retracting one ugly additional info a projector does not work exactly the same as a regular tv with a regular tv you can hook it up to nothing but power and the coax jack on the wall and be able to enjoy watching tv the tv by itself has everything necessary built in the screen the tuner the speakers are all in one box controlled by one remote and in one place that's conveniently located close to the power and cable outlets with a projection system not only do you need to set up the projector you need a separate screen the location of the projector most likely won't be convenient to the power and cable outlets so you'll have to install new ones or find a way to hide the long cable runs if the projector has a speaker built in not only would the sound be terrible because of the speaker's low quality but the sound would be coming from the wrong direction because that would be unacceptable to most people a separate audio system is required now just to watch basic tv you need to configure the projector the screen and the audio system unless you have a universal remote you're going to have at least remotes to mess with while it's still not terribly complex i assure you that a projection system is more complicated to set up and use than a basic tv in many ways they do not work exactly the same many people either don't have a surround sound system or those that do simply don't want to bother using it all the time i don't need my whole audio system on when i'm watching the news while i eat my breakfast an others are still sleeping sure some audio systems have a night mode that lessens the chance of waking people up but how is that any easier than just leaving the system off and just using the tv's built in speakers response to vicseo b while it may be convenient to put a projector on a coffee table it would still be ugly and inconvenient to run wires from a side wall to the middle of the room whether it's mounted or painted a screen on the wall is an added thing that isn't necessary with a conventional tv d ok so there are some projectors that have speakers so what shouldn't the sound be coming from somewhere in proximity to the screen not from the coffee table ceiling or somewhere behind the viewer just because it has a speaker doesn't mean anyone would want to use it whatever features or procedures are available to extend lamp life doesn't change the fact that a conventional tv doesn't require any of that because it doesn't have a lamp however long the lamp lasts it will eventually burn out and replacements aren't free even quiet fans make a bit of noise if it's sitting on the coffee table in front of you you're more likely to notice it ok so instead of an ugly screen on the wall you just have an ugly wall i don't see how that's any better Movie projector Television
