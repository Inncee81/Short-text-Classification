is plasma the best should i buy a plasma tv everything i see and hear tells me that plasma is by far the best flat out theonly thing is that when it starts to die it dies how long do plasmas last i need ten years or at least before i totally believe in plasma but the picture quality is by far the best and i have been researching quite a bit lately pretty much all test labs and reviewers agree that plasma has the best picture of the flatscreen display technologies best in this case meaning most accurate color contrast ratio and black level microdisplay crt tube and direct projection technologies can also create great pictures often better than plasma but are not flatscreens lcd the other main flatscreen technology has advantages in bright rooms and non critical viewing but cannot meet the visual specifications of plasma plasma longevity is much less of an issue with current technology than it has been in the past plasma manufacturers now advertise hour half lives time until the picture reaches half its original maximum brightness as the useful life of their sets this equates to years of life if your tv is on hours a day if you run your set at less than maximum brightness and contrast which you should you can expect the higher end of these numbers since this is a gradual effect you can often compensate for dimming plasma by re calibrating your settings lcd technology is actually more of a sudden death scenario than plasma in that when the backlight burns out suddenly it must be replaced however lcd backlights can be replaced as long as they remain available while plasma panels can't be effectively recharged or repaired once they lose brightness having said that plasma is still a bit of a touchy technology in terms of power heat output and fragility it's one of the few types of a v component i would buy an extended warranty for Television Liquid crystal display television Light-emitting diode Cathode ray tube Oscilloscope Organic light-emitting diode TFT LCD Digital photography Loudspeaker Gamut Central processing unit Solar cell Bicycle lighting PowerBook Screensaver Stereoscopy High-definition television Fuel injection Lighting Solar variation Solar power Sun PlayStation Portable Welding Pixel Big Bang Incandescent light bulb Laserdisc Tesla coil Plasma (physics) Laser Photography Movie projector Nintendo DS Contrast ratio Directed-energy weapon Transistor Particle accelerator Fluorescent lamp IBM PC compatible Lightning Binoculars Gross domestic product Turbocharger Polarization Battery (electricity) Internal ballistics TGV Cold fusion Tank Decibel Dimmer Items in the Metroid series Color Transformer Quark-gluon plasma IPod Galileo spacecraft Apple typography Explosive material Ionosphere Toyota Prius Magnet DLP Nuclear fusion Video Digital audio broadcasting Aurora (astronomy) DVD Phase-shift keying Audiophile Computer Hypoglycemia Computer display Life extension Handheld game console Radar Hydrogen Non-standard cosmology Microeconomics Langmuir probe National Weather Service Plasma stability MP3 Global warming Carbon dioxide Terminal ballistics
