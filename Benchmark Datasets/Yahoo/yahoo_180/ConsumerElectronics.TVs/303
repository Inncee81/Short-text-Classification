can't get a clear picture on the television i currently have a basic satellite package with dish network i'm considering cancelling the service completely because it's expensive and the majority of shows that my family likes to watch come on the regular television channels problem we don't seem to get a clear picture unless we have cable or satellite of some sort everything is really fuzzy and there's shadows and sometimes even a slight static noise in the background why is this is there anything that we can do to resolve maybe something that we can purchase and attach to the television or an antenna on top of the house if you have a serious answer please be specific as i'm a bit of an idiot when it comes to things like this to drop the dish get an antenna installed at least feet off the ground on a secure mounting location check local laws or home owner rules first use guy wires if it is feet off the ground or more make sure they install a lightning arrestor and ground that properly with a copper or galvanized steel rod in the ground make sure to orient it toward the most local stations or if they are in different directions ask about an antenna rotor or dual antennas and a combiner in fringe locations more than miles from the transmitters get a really good antenna it is better to buy one that exceeds the distance rating because over the year life span maximum time to replace unless damaged by winds it will work better when you do replace it always replace antenna lightning arrestor and cable coax so as to keep these critical parts new enough to do the job if you live in the united states prepare for purchasing a digital over the air tv atsc converter box in the next year or so see this web site for more details as analog tv ends in http www dtv gov Digital television Cable television High-definition television Lightning rod Federal Standard 1037C Satellite television Home Box Office Communications satellite Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Ethernet Television Coaxial cable Wi-Fi Modem Radar Federal Communications Commission Overhead powerline National Weather Service Oscilloscope Television in the United States STS-61 Radio Media in Canada TV-FM DX TiVo Radio masts and towers Naval mine Wind turbine Transmitter Drill bit WWOR-TV Digital Subscriber Line Wind power Tallest structures in the United States Electric motor Digital audio broadcasting SCART Satellite dish Lightning safety Surveillance Decibel Suspension bridge Set-top box Lightning ANT1 DVD Wardenclyffe Tower Hard disk Broadcasting ABS-CBN Universal Serial Bus Television network Commercial broadcasting Television syndication MIM-23 Hawk DirecTV Television in Canada Telephone tapping Dish Network Telephone Bluetooth Broadcast television system Aircraft carrier Radio controlled airplane WTBS (TV) General Dynamics F-111 Electricity pylon TBS (TV network) NTSC Five (TV) XERF Electric power transmission Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina TGV Integrated Services Digital Network B-47 Stratojet Microphone RS-232 BBC Channel 4 Ford Crown Victoria American Broadcasting Company Internet Royal Navy CVF programme Gramophone record Digital cable Volleyball Circuit design Atari 8-bit family UPN
