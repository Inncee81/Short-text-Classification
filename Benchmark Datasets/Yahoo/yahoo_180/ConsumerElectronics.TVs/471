hdtv novice i am looking to purchase a lcd hdtv set please excuse the novice questions confused about info from varying sources the main thing is i am on a tight budget college student budget so i was wondering how wise is it to purchase a refurbished television set looking for a or model would one be a better choice for me i plan on using the set to not only use a television set but as a computer monitor and gaming monitor i have read that there is not much difference between to contrast ratio so should i be fine with a contrast ratio with a ms response time will i see ghosting with the ms time while playing video games finally are any of these brands worthwhile westinghouse vizio viewsonic figured since i'm budget conscious going to stores to see tvs wouldn't help since they all have name brand sony toshiba etc i'm not a videophile but am used to crt have yet to see hd on a set so what you guys are suggesting is to stay away from brands like westinghouse and vizio i just simply cannot afford a toshiba or sony at for a television i'm not necessarily looking a permanent television but one for the upcoming year range i have seen refurbished westinghouses for range for a contrast ms ms is this not a good deal i know i may be unrealistic with my price range of with lower being better is there any specific television models and or sites thanks for quick responses haha a quick note about the drunk college student comment known all about it even lived in a frat house would never do it again but tons of lasting memories and lack of at the same time however i am a settled down sr so i probably will keep my tv on a stand the comment about all brands have the same manufactuers how can i find this info also if this is true there most be a lowest costing non name brand that is the best bargain since it will have the same hardware as other name brand systems with a different casing just reiterating i am bargain shopper you seem to have a good handle on your information yes lcd with ms response and is all good refurbished is just a tv that has been sent thru the manufacturing line a nd time nothing wrong or bad with refurbished in fact i'd rather see you buy a known brand name that's refurbished than to buy a brand new vizio or westinghouse tv set once those new brand name tv sets fail it's not possible to repair them locally you have to ship it to the manufacturer shipping is not unusual i only have one suggestion when you take it to college mount it as high as you can above your bed no doubt you will have one drunken azzhole come into your room and face plant himself onto every inch of wallspace you have and lcds won't handle him very well so make sure it's well above feet or higher that idiot won't have any money to repair your tv High-definition television PlayStation 3 Plasma display Liquid crystal display television Liquid crystal display Laserdisc Floppy disk Microeconomics IBM PC compatible Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Laptop Nintendo PlayStation 2 PlayStation Portable Digital television Nintendo Revolution Oscilloscope Cathode ray tube DVD Cell (microprocessor) Commodore International Teletext Gamut Atari 8-bit family Sega Saturn PowerBook TiVo Xbox 360 Xbox Sears Holdings Corporation Computer and video games Apple Macintosh Handheld game console Iowa class battleship Sega Trademark Law of value CPU cache Economics MP3 Bluetooth Poker jargon ATI Technologies Commodore 64 Amiga Atari ST Pixel 1080p Computer display Electronic commerce Apple II family R46 (New York City Subway car) Loudspeaker Nintendo GameCube Sinclair Research Ltd Blackjack Nintendo 64 MMORPG Mattress Game programming IPod Final Fantasy XI CPU design Management information system Bicycle lighting Embedded system Capitalism History of computer and video games In The Groove (game) High fidelity Internet fraud Debugging Redundant array of independent disks Overclocking Battery electric vehicle Apple Computer Atari 2600 Nintendo DS Sega Dreamcast View camera RISC CBS Digital Visual Interface Windows 2000 Tier One RFID Color Transformation problem
