fixing hitachi tv convergence problem which resistor s to replace http answers yahoo com question index ylt aph lvi k pycpuni f bty ix qid aabihsm i originally posted a question on how to fix a hitachi tv convergence problem i got to removing and replacing the ic but now i am unsure which resistors to replace the kit i purchased came with several fusible resistors axial ranging from ohms which ones do i need to replace and i do i find them the kit should have a pictorial of the ics and the locations of each resistors unless yours is bootleg watch out there are after market knock offs that dont last very long you need an ohm meter and need to check each one usually the resistors dont need replacing but check to see if any look burnt go ahead and put it together and turn it on and see if its still out of wack if so go to menu and try to adjust the convergence if most of the colors will move into the crosshair except then a resistor is out in that circuit ie red wont converge but blue will go to red circuit near convergence amps and check all resistors hope that helps Resistor Circuit design Electrophysiology Action potential Ethernet Operational amplifier Series and parallel circuits IPod Intellivision DVD SCSI Impedance matching Electronic amplifier Nintendo Entertainment System Potentiometer Galvanometer Transformer Voltage source CPU cache Atari 8-bit family Quizbowl Atomic Kitten System/36 Impedance Canon T90 Electronic color code Volt RLC circuit Electrical network Series (mathematics) View camera Inflation Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Analysis of resistive circuits Analog computer Hard disk Current source Commodore 64 Current (electricity) Photoresistor RC circuit Random walk Heathkit HyperText Transfer Protocol Eye Electrical element Thermistor Circuit diagram Oscilloscope System/34 Inkjet printer Windows XP STS-61 Fuse (electrical) Electrical resistance Capacitor Enterprise content management Motorola 68000 Airport Sinclair ZX81 E85 Loudspeaker Sega Saturn Transmission line Opportunity rover Bass guitar Quantitative marketing research Photography Ordinary differential equation Toyota Prius STS-59 Transistor-transistor logic CPU design Logic gate Legal research Convergence of Fourier series Wind power Vacuum tube Circuit breaker M60 machine gun Negligible Battlefield 2 Genetic algorithm Lighting Railway signal GunZ The Duel Monetary policy Electronics Macromedia Flash Bicycle lighting Texas hold 'em Heinkel He 100 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Poker jargon Google Table saw Jet engine
