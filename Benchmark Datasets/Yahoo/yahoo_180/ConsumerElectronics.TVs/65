what is the refresh rate on a sony kdl v p lcd i'm looking for the refresh rate in hertz for example hz hz hz the reason i ask this is because i've heard that new lcd tvs have a hz refresh rate and i just bought this tv last month so i want to know if this tv has the hz refresh rate i'm concerned because i just spent on a tv and i hope it's future proof so if they make ps games or br movies that take advantage of a hz tv i'll be covered ok tv tech man so all tv broadcasts are fps but that's not the case with video games most games are fps but some games are fps and sony even claimed that the ps is capable of rendering games at fps lets say my tv has a hz refresh rate how will games running at fps or fps look on my tv will i experience screen tearing and blurriness reality check all signals will be sent to the tv at frames a second or hz the hz refresh rate occurs inside the tv it takes one frame of picture and sends it to the display times why because have you ever seen a fast moving picture on some of the older tvs the background gets blurred because so much information is being changed that the tv does a rough in of the entire picture first then fills in the details on its second pass now the tv has the chance to not only rough in the picture on the st pass it has more chances to fill in the details too before it has to rebuild another frame of video that means your tv will completely fill in the details and provide a sharp clear fully detailed frame of picture on each and every frame while the older ones might only get one chance to provide all the details in the first pass with fast moving pictures there is too much change to accomplish a fully detailed picture in the first pass it takes a couple passes that's why the new hz refresh rates are going to really sharpen up high speed action sony introduced motion flow to the consumer line this year in the higher end models xbr units have them and some of the other models too look at the manual the intro should tell you about this new refresh rate or check the specification page well i did it for you you have the wax f chassis and the motion flow technology is in the wax chassis but you have p which is the highest resolution panel on the market right now High-definition television Frame rate Liquid crystal display television Movie projector Mouse (computing) First-person shooter NTSC Teletext Television Stereoscopy Super Nintendo Entertainment System Liquid crystal display Nintendo Virtual Boy Refresh rate PlayStation Portable Automatic number plate recognition Sega Saturn Motion capture Laserdisc Casting Light-emitting diode Computer display Xbox 360 Video Eye ATI Technologies Digital cinema Dynamic random access memory MP3 Atari 8-bit family Computer and video games Computer animation IBM PC compatible Apple Computer Interlace Original Amiga chipset History of computer and video games Poker jargon Machinima Camcorder Computer and video game genres Counter-Strike Windows Vista Movie camera Oscilloscope Cheating in Counter-Strike Cathode ray tube Natural Selection (computer game) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Deinterlacing Halo: Combat Evolved PowerBook MPEG-2 Telecine Blu-ray Disc TRS-80 Color Computer Compact disc Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting CPU cache Xbox Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sound Blaster Console game Nintendo S__CAM Internal ballistics 720p Thunder Force Radeon Light gun Web crawler Persistence of vision PAL Widescreen Digital television RISC Laptop Rendering (computer graphics) Sinclair ZX81 Computer role-playing game VHS Guilty Gear Sega Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Hard disk SCART Gameking Nintendo 64 National Weather Service Grand Theft Auto III
