can i put speakers not magnetically shieded close to a lcd tv i just purchased a lcd tv and i have a pair of good speakers but not magnetically shielded if i put them close to the tv would they harm the lcd tv as in the case of crt tv in other words would lcd tv be magnetised realist is right magnetic fields only affect crt sets which depend on an electron beam to make the picture electron beams are extremely susceptible to even the tiniest magnetic fields the earth's magnetic field can and does affect crt sets especially the larger screen sizes Magnet Liquid crystal display Oscilloscope Television Pixel Transformer Plasma display Liquid crystal display television Gamut Magnetism Particle accelerator Loudspeaker Interlace Screensaver Aurora (astronomy) Plasma (physics) IMac Nuclear magnetic resonance Earth's magnetic field EMac Laptop Movie projector Microphone Compass Degaussing Nuclear fusion Cyclotron PowerBook Stereoscopy Solar wind Planetary orbit Antenna (radio) Diamagnetism Double layer Welding Carbon nanotube Phase (matter) TFT LCD Transmission electron microscopy Paramagnetism Free electron laser Galileo spacecraft Magnetic sail Geomagnetic storm Handheld game console Universal Century Technology Transducer Broadcast television system Blazar Cassini-Huygens Ionosphere Digital Visual Interface Van Allen radiation belt Aharonov-Bohm effect Radiometric dating Speed of light Synchrotron radiation Computer display Maxwell's equations Light gun Fishfinder Langmuir probe Magnetosphere Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Nonlinear optics GunBound Organic light-emitting diode Digital camera Refresh rate Neutron star Fusion power Dirac equation Tide Radar Electron microscope Cosmic Era technology Digital photography High-voltage direct current Ionizing radiation Seismometer Deflector shield Shadow mask Electromagnetic field Light-emitting diode Birkeland current Neodymium magnet ATLAS experiment Chemical shift Permittivity Electromagnetic radiation Vacuum tube Faraday effect Particle beam Canon T90 Linear particle accelerator Federal Standard 1037C Magnetic resonance imaging Project Orion
