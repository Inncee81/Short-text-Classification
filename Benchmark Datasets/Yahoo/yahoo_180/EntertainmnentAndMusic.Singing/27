i am years old i want to be a singer realy bad like hannah montana how do i do it i am years old well the last thing you want to be is a 'fake musician' that would be hannah montanna she was chosen by disney just like hilary duff and lindsay lohan she didn't purposely get signed disney picked her out but thats not my point i think the best way to get into the music buisness is get some lessions learn how to sing the real way with an instructor and its also good to learn another intrument like guitar or piano that way you have something to go along with your singing and if your going to be a solo act its much better then start singing and playing practive alot write some songs then play at a few local coffee shops get permission from a few places to play outside their shop also sens your ten hardly anyone is going to take you siriously i am a young singer songwritter myself around to ish so act very proffesional and anyone who thinks your a joke can deal with it ignore the ignorant haters are a waste of time don't worry about openions also dont just get into this because you want to be a famous popstar thats not what music is about its not about fame money being cool or anything like that its about playing music and expressing yourself if your in this to be famous let it go its not for you plus people like me the real musicians who couldn't care less about fame will make fun of you but really if your in this for fame just let it go let your popstar time be daydreaming in your room with music i look down on people who strive to be famous i am not trying to be famous but nor am i avoiding it i don't care it would be nice to be rich and have alot of fans but i would also be perfectly happy with a small handfull of supportive fans it makes me sad how there are hardly any musicians nowdays who play for playing thats all i can think of so there you go Hilary Duff Pop music Avril Lavigne The Ashlee Simpson Show Bon Jovi Ashlee Simpson Celebrity I Want to Hold Your Hand Rock (music) Lindsay Lohan Blood on the Tracks Knots Landing Roxette Blonde on Blonde The Beatles Slow Train Coming Buddy Guy The Contender (television series) Whose Line Is It Anyway?
