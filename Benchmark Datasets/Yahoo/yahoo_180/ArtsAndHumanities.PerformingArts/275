question related to guitar the strings of my guitar has drifted apart from the fretboard means there is a lot of gap b w strings and fretboard which makes it difficult to play is the neck of my guitar bent how can u tell whether the neck of the guitar is bent if it is can it be rectified and in future how to avoid this to happen thanks in advance its an acoustic o cut guitar and the shopkeeper told me that has a bent neck without giving it a look so i don't believe him the shopkeeper told you it's a bent neck because this is the only reason the action will rise like you have described it's a very common problem with guitars better guitars have an adjustable truss rod in the neck which your repair shop will know how to adjust to restore the proper action to your guitar if the guitar is a less expensive model it may not have such an adjustment available in that case the guitar could be repaired but the repair would cost more than the guitar is worth and should only be considered if the guitar has some particular sentimental value to you you can tell if the neck is bent by lying the guitar flat on a table and looking at it from the bottom end with your eye at the level of the strings from this vantage point the warp of the neck will become evident neck warping often occurs if the guitar experiences extremes in heat and humidity in storage be careful where you keep your guitar don't leave it in the attic or in hot cars for extended periods don't store it near the radiator etc if you're going to put your guitar in storage for an extended period loosen the strings to reduce the tension on the neck and consider getting a dehumdifier for your case this is just a device that contains a chemical dessicant to reduce the moisture in your case you'll need to keep the guitar stored in the closed case when not in use Guitar Violin Cello Double bass Harp Fender Telecaster Oscilloscope Thermal power station Equine conformation Piano Estoppel Fret Floyd Rose Twelve string guitar Textile manufacturing Drill bit Nuclear power Slide guitar Welding Energy development Electric guitar Spark plug Seismic retrofit String theory Nuclear reactor Microeconomics Classical guitar Urinary incontinence Carburetor Acoustic guitar Inflation Supply and demand Social rule Lap steel guitar Mattress Hyperinflation Handloading Hydrogen economy Rail terminology Tire Time travel Guitar/synthesizer Solar cell Fire fighting Lute Disc brake Black hole Floppy disk Intonation Harmonica Hurdy gurdy Explosive material Prostate cancer Aluminium CPU cache Pedal steel guitar Internal ballistics String instrument Spacecraft propulsion Naval mine U.S. 1st Cavalry Division Chernobyl accident Rod Stewart Eddie Van Halen Table saw Blood on the Tracks Surveillance Bassoon C programming language Tablature John Myung Lighting Timpani Wind power Redundant array of independent disks Diving Saxophone Aerial (dance move) Clarinet Plastic Professional wrestling attacks Radiation therapy CPU design Password Gramophone record Transformer Mandolin Incandescent light bulb Ionizing radiation Sitar Buddy Guy
