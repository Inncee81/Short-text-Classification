what are some vocal exercises to help with the sound of my speaking voice you need to find the area of your optimal speaking pitch this area is fairly standard for most voices of course we hear unusually high or low pitched voices that are unique at the same time they may be improperly produced with time speaking outside of your optimal speaking pitch range can tire and weaken your voice for younger females late teens early s the pitch may be somewhere between the middle c on the piano and the b or b flat just below the middle c more likely the optimal pitch is about b flat maybe the a just below for women in their s and s optimal pitch usually is around the a or a flat for older women optimal speaking pitch is around a flat g and perhaps a bit lower of course for male voices there is a different optimal pitch range i can explain how you can find it but if you are doing this exercise slightly incorrectly you may not be able to find it most people press a hum when they first try this gently place your hand over the bridge of your nose and your cheekbones if you can take a full comfortable breath and sigh into a hum sliding down through the notes from about d just above middle c one area of the slide will feel buzzier isolate that note speak for a while like a robot on that pitch it should feel very good focus on that easy buzzy feeling then inflect your voice so that you are using the pitches just above and below that note speak naturally Clarinet Violin Harmonica Saxophone Vocal range Flute Trombone Timpani Bass guitar Tonality Stuttering Piano Goldberg Variations Musical mode Alto horn Equine conformation Tone (linguistics) Blues Social rule Bagpipes Musical terminology Musical Instrument Digital Interface Human voice Pitch (music) A Day in the Life Guitar Sound effect Authentic performance Helium Chinese language Guqin Musical notation Horn (instrument) German language Fast bowling Harpsichord Harp Transposing instrument Tablature Clef Bicycle Stereoscopy Japanese language Tae eul ju Well-Tempered Clavier Physical attractiveness Taiwanese (linguistics) Fugue Hangul Singer Anchor Softball Bassoon Western concert flute Pipe organ Tin whistle Double bass Mouse (computing) Uilleann pipes Harmonic series (music) Weight training New Zealand English Time Out of Mind Mute (music) Screw Non-native pronunciations of English Sign language Chess opening Note Dither Interval (music) Power chord Marching band M16 (rifle) Synthesizer Speech synthesis Blue Man Group Mattress Electric guitar The Empty Child International Phonetic Alphabet Oral sex Sandy Koufax B-47 Stratojet 1957 World Series Anime Vietnamese language Fan (implement) Euphonium English language Gender-neutral language Vocoder Native American music Cello Socrate
