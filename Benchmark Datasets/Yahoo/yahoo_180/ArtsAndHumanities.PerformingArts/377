does the type of string on a guitar affect its quality i mean i have a steel string guitar but when i listen to people play on guitars with nylon strings it sounds a lot better so i just want to know if there's a difference between the sound quality of steel and nylon string guitars the tension on a nylon string is much lower steel has a great deal more pull per square inch than nylon so it gives a bright ringing tone at least until it gets worn out nylon gives a warm rich tone because the string is allowed to vibrate a little more widely due to it's lower tension there is also a difference in what materials you make the original gut strings were made of horse's intestines and everything from the curing process to the health of the animal could affect it's tone and durability now most strings are made of nylon nylon core with wrapped steel many different kinds of steel steel wrapped steel and every other kind type thickness and treatment that you can imagine the latest trend is to wrap strings in a durable casing so dirt and the elements can't penetrate past the windings even the windings themselves can make a difference originally we had the round wound strings this meant that a very thin round piece of wire was wrapped around a core next there was the flat wound string instead of a round piece of wire the string makers used a flat piece of metal ribbon so that the sound between the strings would sound more even jazz guitarists particularly like this kind of string then there is the half wound string which is that same very thin piece of wire but one side of it has been shaved or flattened so that the string retains most of it's bell like quality while making it quieter to slide up and down the string without that annoying squeak the materials themselves can make a difference as well strings are made from everything from aluminum to platinum including silver gold and everything in between there are as many formulas as there are manufacturers and every season someone comes up with some new innovation while the other companies try to back engineer the process and copy it on top of that musicians do everything from soak their strings in molasseses to polishing them with toothpaste to get that slightly different sound that will hopefully make them unique enough to catch a star for their fifteen minutes or more of fame Harp Piano Double bass Electric guitar Clarinet Welding Screw Guqin Timpani Bassoon Mattress Cello Undergarment Acoustic guitar Saxophone Terminal ballistics Gramophone record Casting Transformer Lute Strap-on dildo Gas metal arc welding Trombone Wire Solar cell Strings (music) Bullet Textile manufacturing terminology Aluminium Drill bit Billiards Floyd Rose Plastic Knife Fender Telecaster Berimbau String instrument Harmonica Flute Harpsichord Suture Harmonic series (music) Bicycle frame Wood Leather Classical guitar Cartridge (firearms) Gong Equine conformation Diamond Hurdy gurdy Seismic retrofit Knitting Titanium Table saw Amateur telescope making Typewriter Rope Authentic performance Pitch (music) Microphone Barbed wire Repouss__ and chasing Electrical wiring Diving suit Magnet Mute (music) Judas Priest Nylon Internal ballistics Friction Space elevator Sail-plan Synthesizer Bow (music) Slide guitar Clothing Phonograph cylinder Diamond cut Arc welding Brazing Tire Spark plug Movie projector Corrosion Vowel Time Out of Mind Steel guitar Katana Plectrum Loudspeaker Rolling-element bearing
