what vocal class do i belong to baritone or tenor my exact vocal range is from a b to a f without going into falsetto since falsetto doesnt coun't for male singers correct am i a tenor ii or am i a baritone many young men have that range it isn't the range that gives the definition to your voice but rather finding out where you feel the most comfortable if your passagio or gear shift into your higher voice comes at the f consistently and you feel happier singing in the upper middle register chances are you are a tenor if your passagio comes at the d and you feel that the last couple of notes are more work you might well be a baritone this is something that is highly subjective and of course without having heard you properly i'm just making an educated guess do you take lessons your teacher is the best person to ask if not try and corner your choir director for a few minutes and see if he she is competent enough to help you figure it out there is no glory to be won by being one or the other category there is a great deal of personal satisfaction to be won by knowing you are doing the right thing for your voice singing in the wrong category can eventually be harmful to the instrument so take your time and figure it out slowly if you are still in your teens this really will take a couple more years before your full bodily maturity is reached only then will it be safe to categorize you absolutely best wishes and keep on singing Vocal range Saxophone Choir Singer Human voice Countertenor Falsetto Trumpet Infantilism Soprano Shaggy dog story The Wall Bagpipes Boyz II Men The Band Elton John Domestic violence Alto horn Clef Boy soprano Jon Secada Goodness and value theory Alto (voice) Vocal weight Utilitarianism Musical notation Castrato Songwriter Metaphor Eastern Orthodox Church The Beach Boys Big band Opera A Course In Miracles Condom Summa Theologiae Barbershop music The Creation Happiness The Beatles Guitar Theory of conduct Baritone saxophone The Dream of Gerontius The Emancipation of Mimi Sacred Harp Asperger syndrome The Jackson 5 Figured bass Bohemian Rhapsody Trombone Minnie Riperton Basso Rudy Vallee Tom Waits Objectivist philosophy Bing Crosby Parsifal We Belong Together Jewish music Native American music Marching band Pitaten Transposing instrument Musical instrument classification Clarinet Rigoletto (opera) Uilleann pipes Mike Patton Friedrich Schleiermacher Porgy and Bess Religion ABBA Goldberg Variations Value system Singing Mario Lanza Olivier Messiaen Fidelio The Four Tops The Jazz Singer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Temptations Blood on the Tracks Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Merit Contract Francis Crick Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Baroque music Mariah Carey Carmen Tosca Blackfoot music Captain Beefheart Human sexual behavior
