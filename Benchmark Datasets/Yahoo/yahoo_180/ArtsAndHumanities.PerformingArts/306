iv heard about a piano class that teaches u how to play by listening is that possible iv seen an add bfore saying that there is a new way of giving out piano lessons to student which is by teaching the student to listen to the song tht he she likes then try to hit the right keys its weird tho bcs im learning piano myself and i cant seem to see the possibilities in dat iv had a friend who said its possible as he had tried it before actually this is called learning by rote and i'm not going to tell you that it doesn't work because it obviously does it is a slow cumbersome way to learn but it does have it's advantages especially if you are dysfunctional dyslexic dysgraphic or you are visually impaired if you have no learning or visual impairments however it would be in your best interest to learn notation simply because it is faster and enables you to talk to other musicians thus using your time more efficiently some famous musicians who had to learn by rote are paul mccartney dyslexic stevie wonder and ray charles visually impaired i am mentioning this because i do not want you to think i am being playful or sarcastic there are situations where this is a perfectly legitimate way to learn Dyslexia Blind musicians Learning disability John Cage Herbie Hancock Steve Reich Stevie Wonder She Loves You Layla Harmonic series (music) Suzuki method Olivier Messiaen Asperger syndrome Second language acquisition Blindness The Beatles John Mayer (musician) Highway 61 Revisited Hearing impairment Visual Basic Brian Jones (musician) European classical music George Harrison The Beatles' influence Jazz Songwriter Blonde on Blonde Louis Armstrong Real Love (song) Music lesson Marching band Sonata form Yesterday (song) Python programming language Yoko Ono A Day in the Life George Gershwin Blood on the Tracks Musical mode Backward message Aphasia Past teachings of Prem Rawat Software engineering Charles Ives I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Music Hey Jude Guqin "Weird Al" Yankovic Philosophy of language Richard Feynman Bringing It All Back Home Franz Schubert The Long and Winding Road American Sign Language Clarinet Dyscalculia Goldberg Variations Joseph Haydn I Want to Hold Your Hand Stop and Smell the Roses Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Authentic performance Singlish Witold Lutos__awski A Hard Day's Night (song) MP3 Eric Clapton Piano Capoeira Slow Train Coming Sonata (music) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ragtime Buddy Guy Grunge music Weebl and Bob Swedish allotment system Little Britain Carnatic music The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Shot of Love German grammar Strategic management Eleanor Rigby Bowl Championship Series W.
