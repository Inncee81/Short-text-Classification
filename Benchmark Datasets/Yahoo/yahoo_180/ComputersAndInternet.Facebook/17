what is a facebook it's somewhat like myspace except it's a lot safer you actually have to be part of a high school college etc network to be part of it and someone has to verify that you work there or you go to that school etc you don't come across as many creepy guys as you would on myspace it doesn't have those weird html stuff and you don't have to decorate your profile like you would have to do for myspace i love how facebook is just everyone has the same profile the same everything except there are a lot of weird applications which you can add but they're cool and facebook takes a lot less time to load a single page myspace would take forever well that's pretty much it facebook i think is amazing a lot better than myspace if you ask me Facebook (website) MySpace Nine Inch Nails "Weird Al" Yankovic Extraordinary Machine The Ashlee Simpson Show Ajax (programming) Okashina Okashi Time Out of Mind W.
