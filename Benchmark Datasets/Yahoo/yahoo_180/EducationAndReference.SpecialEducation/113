resource room classroom setup help i am a first year resource sp ed teacher who is about to set up my first classroom i want to be sure to include bulletin boards that are motivational and informative yet fun inspiring i am working with students that are k help me out fellow resource room teachers what do i need to for sure include what should i stay away from thank you for your suggestions most of your display space will and should be taken up by things that are related to what you are teaching and any behavior management reading incentive programs you may be using the younger students will need a chart for reference for number formation counting practice skip counting etc the alphabet in manuscript and cursive is a definite must there should be a poster with your rules listed on it either pre made and hanging up before school or posted after the first day if you want the kids to help you create the rules this is effective with the older kids they have a vested interest in it for beginning the year it's best to create a board with all of your student's names on it nothing too cutesy so your older kids won't barf maybe a fall theme leaves falling from a tree and one leaf with each child's name there's tons of possiblities i also like to have some sort of nature poster plants and or animals to bring in the outdoors it's a calming influence and kids love animals also keep in mind that you can and should display charts and poems that you create during lessons if you teach a lesson using a nursery rhyme for the kindergarteners display it at their eye level for a few days and encourage them to re read it in any spare time they have if you teach the older kids about rules for capitalization write them on chart paper and hang up the chart for the kids to refer to while they are writing so when you decorate initally leave a few empty spaces on the walls where you can fill in these items as you go overall aim to start the year with all of your bulletin boards displaying something but keep in mind that you'll want to display lesson info and student work very shortly i usually start with at least one generic bulletin board displaying pre printed school theme stuff that i can take down at the end of the first week and replace with work the kids have done don't make things too busy or you'll distract the kids Kindergarten Billboard (advertising) Murdock-Portal Elementary School Columbine High School massacre Teach the Controversy Logo programming language Quicksort Harrow School Homeschooling Fischer Random Chess Literacy Education Beavis and Butt-head Lesson Unicode Spot the Dog Education in the United States Education in Germany A Course In Miracles Bart chalkboard gags Kodocha The Giver Mahjong Python programming language Scooby-Doo Hogwarts College Graduate school Computer-assisted language learning King George V School Infantilism Summa Theologiae Wheel of Fortune El Lissitzky Unemployment The Adventures of Pete & Pete StarCraft: Uprising Raffles Institution Mnemonic John Cage Billboard Hot 100 HTML element Education in India Hogwarts subjects Linked list 0 (number) King City, Ontario Second language acquisition Education in Romania Corporate governance Recess (TV series) Cultural Revolution Education reform Great Teacher Onizuka Education in Hong Kong Socrates Poetry XML Classroom Hello world program Mathematics Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Tai Chi Chuan Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Catcher in the Rye The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Teachers (film) Education in the People's Republic of China Ludwig Wittgenstein Ra (board game) Past teachings of Prem Rawat James Ruse Agricultural High School Animal Crossing PLATO Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Franz Schubert Glen Ridge, New Jersey Fair use Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur Book of Mormon
