does your autistic kid do anything like this with colours my three year old son is autistic non verbal with some sign language hyperlexic and numerate just lately he's become fascinated with colours he would arrange them in patterns and carry blocks or crayons around with him we've now noticed that he invariably arranges the colours according to the spectrum red orange yellow green blue violet if he's arranging books and can't find the exact colours he'll do the closest shade maroon for violet for example we did not teach him this and there are no books or videos in the house that talk about the spectrum we haven't heard or read about other autistic kids doing this just wondering if anybody else had maybe like lynnw i can answer you without being patronising something no one else so far has managed to do lining things up and obsessional behaviour is common with asd my son is high functioning holding a job whilst doing a levels and learning to drive and yet still comes home and does his 'stims' to relax my son was non verbal til age by the way when he was your sons age and non verbal he spent many peaceful happy hours lining all sorts of things up according to colour and size shape and would get very distressed if prevented from doing so some people see it as part of the autistic mind especially a non verbal autistic their way of bringing peace and order to a chaotic world that they cannot yet access if its bringing him joy then enjoy him doing it Autism Asperger syndrome Color Controversies in autism Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum Ethical challenges to autism treatment Autistic spectrum Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Milton H.
