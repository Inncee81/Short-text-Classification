special education i am and was in special ed until second grade my teachers and parents have helped me a lot and i have slowly worked up to getting strait as in school now i help tutor the special ed class for math in the morning during the school year i was wondering why do some people not accept special ed kids how do they get into special ed in the first place why is it that some people like me are really successful and some don't quite make it i feel really guilty sometimes for getting through my learning disability like maybe i didn't deserve it i have learned a lot from tutoring but still have a few questions that i am too afraid to ask the teacher hi judy i will help you with your questions but these are good questions and the teachers you are working with would be more than happy to answer them i know they would because i am a special ed teacher myself people do not accept others because they are afraid annoyed or they do not wish to be bothered with someone that is different from them although this is more profoundly experienced when you have more severity in the disabilities that a person may have it happens to all of us people will not like a person because they have red hair or brown skin or are a different religion disabilities often make someone different from what a group of people might consider normal however the more a person is different the more they often feel like they are not 'accepted' they are our prejudices i call them the isms like racism agism sexism and others children are referred to special education by a person or group of people that have noticed a child experiencing troubles academically socially physically behaviorally or a combination of those factors to a teacher or school administrator there is a three tier process that must occur for a child to identified with a disability according to federal standards the first is called the iat process an intervention assistance team of people who work with the child meet and try to solve problems in the classroom with the regular education teacher if it works the process stops there if not then a formal assessment involving a lot of testing is done with various professionals that testing process is called a multi factored evaluation if these people determine that a child has a certain type of legal disability then the third step occurs a special program of study with a special education teacher it is written up with goals and accommodations designed to help that child and called an iep which means individual education plan everyone has different levels of ability and motivation some children work harder than others some have more or less support at home alot of things will affect how successful a child can be with the program i am so happy you have been successful i have children like you who may simply have been behind for reasons that could not be controlled early on and sometimes disabilities are either overcome or worked around this is not about whether or not you deserved it more than another it was just how it worked out for you you are a precious person to have gone on to be so grateful for the help you did get to now wish to share it with others you would make a wonderful special ed teacher my dear perhaps you might think about doing this in the future best wishes to you i have to run if you have any more questions write to me debi lockwood yahoo com Education in the United States Education Homeschooling Education in the People's Republic of China Special education Dyslexia GED Extreme Programming SAT Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Charter school Affirmative action Autism Education in Romania Clinical depression Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Prostate cancer Gifted Learning disability Scientology beliefs and practices Kindergarten Education reform Expert system Cancer Experiential education Intelligent design movement Abortion debate Boston Public Economic inequality Controversies in autism College A Course In Miracles Education in Portugal Milton H.
