i have a year autistic child who wears diapers at night he shreds the diaper to pieces by morning ideas we've tried everything from duct tape to wrestles singlets which another mom told me worked for her my child is potty trained during the day now yeah but is severely autistic non verbal so i can't have a conversation with him to reprimand or explain he can't do that to his diaper many autistic children are highly attuned or even painfully sensitive to certain textures some children find the feel of clothes touching their skin almost unbearable you might try changing the type of diaper that you are using your child may also have a sleep problem that includes difficulty falling asleep frequent nighttime awakenings and early morning awakenings stimulation of the limbic system of the brain may also help treat autism aromas from essential oils have the ability to stimulate this part of the brain since the sense of smell is tied directly into the mind's emotional and hormonal center try diffusing therapeutic grade essential oils such as young living's vetiver or frankincense or add a few drops on the soles of your child's feet to help her sleep better with less diaper shredding improving the diet can be helpful in cases of autism try replacing high glycemic sweeteners with a low glycemic sweetener such as blue agave nectar gastrointestinal disorders may be linked to brain dysfunction that cause autism in children try adding a digestive enzyme to your child's diet to improve digestion hope this helps good luck Autism Controversies in autism Asperger syndrome Hypoglycemia Urinary incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Nutrition Autism epidemic Autism rights movement Traumatic brain injury Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Sensory Integration Dysfunction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Chronic fatigue syndrome Brain Narcolepsy Infantilism Insulin Medicine Gifted Autistic spectrum Diaper Breastfeeding Cancer Omega-3 fatty acid Puberty Insomnia Autistic enterocolitis Ethical challenges to autism treatment Hypnosis Addiction Autistic culture Prostate cancer Essential oil Autistic community Controversies about functioning labels in the autism spectrum Glucokinase Bedwetting Diabetes mellitus Sleep Clinical depression Andrew Wakefield Perfume Neurodiversity Intelligence quotient Erectile dysfunction Stomach cancer Aromatherapy Kimberly-Clark Corporation Autoimmune diseases Coeliac disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Thimerosal Adult attention-deficit disorder Stroke Diazepam Dyslexia Acne Clomipramine Sleep apnea Empathy Pervasive developmental disorder National Institutes of Health Honey Domestic rabbit Electroconvulsive therapy Autistic savant Fibromyalgia Haloperidol Gastrointestinal tract Endocrinology Acromegaly Gluten-free, casein-free diet Dream Vomiting Out-of-body experience Epilepsy Glycemic index Orgasm Theory of mind Thyroid Growth hormone deficiency Diabetic neuropathy Borderline personality disorder Motivation Consciousness Narcissism Radiation therapy Bipolar disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Atkins Nutritional Approach
