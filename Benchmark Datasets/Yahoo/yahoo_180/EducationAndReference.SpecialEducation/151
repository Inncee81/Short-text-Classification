i'm to begin teaching a nd rd grade moderate severe autistic class what do i do it's my first year teaching and i will be taking teaching credential classes at the same time i'm having a hard time figuring how i'm going to teaching these students i will have plenty of aides but how do i develop lesson plans and actually teach them i've searched online libraries and am not finding anything really helpful also are the learning state standards the same for autistic children thanks for any help i am going to be very honest if you do not have the educational background in special ed had any experience in teaching other than student teaching and the school and district are not providing you with the information and assitance you need to teach these children you need to reconsider this position moderate to severe autistic children face a myriad of challanges and it take a well educated experienced and supported educator to work with them it sounds as if you have very little understanding of autism the behavioral interventions you will need or the best ways to present information these kids are at a point where they can not afford to be placed with someone who has to figure this out as she goes along this is not a field to enter into as a way to get free tuition unless you are sure this is what you want to do if you are planning to take this get your credentials and then move onto a normal class as soon as possible please do not do it if i am wrong i do apologize that being said the school will provide you with copies of each child's iep this will include the targeted goals for each child in most academic areas as well as in speech and behavior you will be expected to use these goals in developing curriculum and lesson plans the behavioral plan for each child will also tell you what to expect as far as acting out towards others themselves and property and the way to handle it in general this will be different for each child you will need to come up with a general curriculum that you can then adapt to one to one teaching with each child all of this is not easy even expereienced teachers find it challanging you should have a mentor assigned to you use them for all they can offer schedule time to talk to all the specialists working with your students speech ot pt and get thier ideas and input read as much as you can in books that include commentary from parents and teachers with practical suggestions go back through the archives here and see what has been posted look up information on applied beharioral anylasis education for children with learning disabilities and alternate forms of communication your school should provide you with access to any books websites and the like they use you will more than likely need access to a site that provides simple images for use in visual schedule and communication books all of this sounds overwhelming as i said it is you will need to be smart enough to know that you need help and aggressive enough to make sure you get it good luck hope while i agree many general ed teachers have done outstanding jobs with inclusion students this young lady is teaching moderate to severe students in what would appear to be a self contained class for autism that can indicate that these are students with more intense needs and issues many of the suggestions being given are what we know to be the basics of teaching kids on the spectrum read the iep's firm schedules meeting with parents etc if this is informatation she has not heard or known it would seem she did not get even a basic class during college on special ed a huge issue in today's educational climate becuase nearly every class will have up to of it's students on an iep or it also seems to point to the fact that her administration team is not supporting her as it should this is clearly a new teacher going into a very challanging classroom she should be working one on one with a mentor to answer these questions and develop her plan for the year at the very least they should have given her the testing and curriculum standards as they apply to her class as without them she really can't develop much of a curriculum i support any person who wants to go into special ed however and i admit there are always things we don't hear or read in postings online this young lady seems totally unprepared for this move which could mean she had no intention of being a special ed teacher many of our best teachers come to the field in similiar situations but just as many come in spend a year struggling and leave leaving some of our most succestible students to try and make up what may have been missed overlooked or just not taught as the teacher was unprepared on how to run such a class i would rather have someone so unsure take the time to talk to her supervisors and peers get a few extra classes under her belt and build her confidence before entering this class Education Homeschooling No Child Left
