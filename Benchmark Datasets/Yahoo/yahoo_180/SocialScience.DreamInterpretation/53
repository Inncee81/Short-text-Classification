what could this mean i continuously have the same dream i defy all logic and survive all these horific disasters while everyone around me doesn't i'm a bit confused with what it could mean these disasters range from fires to earthquakes in this dream i just stand still and watch as everyone is killed my friends and family the oddest thing about this all is that i'm never upset nor happy when they're gone it comes down to basic apathy it's just really bad because it's in third person and i can't force my body to do anything i think that your mind is afraid of being solitary and alone perhaps you are already alone and you hate it you should go out with friends more take breaks and meet some new people if you feel happy in your dream once you're the last one then you might secretly want to be solitary perhaps you are to busy or don't like you firends it all depends on the details of the dream and how you feel even the disasters might have somethin to do with the dream Theory of conduct Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Jam (TV series) Shaggy dog story God Emperor of Dune Avenue Q W.I.T.C.H.
