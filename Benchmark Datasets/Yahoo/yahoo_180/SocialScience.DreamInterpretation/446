why when i dream that it's snowing outside i feel so awesome in my dream i have a strange feeling i don't know if i'm using the good word but i feel like it's magical lol did i say that i was emotionless in my dream i said i felt awesome in my dream is that emotionless to you lol maybe it's because of the fascination most people experience when they are very young when it comes to snow when we are very little we equate snow with magic with christmas holidays family gifts santa reindeer the north pole for some we never lose that magical feeling when we see snow falling maybe some people do consciously forget but subconsciously the pleasant magical memories are still there and it's through dreaming that often the door to the subconscious mind opens up and it allows these forgotten memories and emotions to be remembered and re lived Unconscious mind Dream Lucid dreaming The Cure Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Consciousness Scenes from a Memory Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants Dean Koontz Santa Claus Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Cliff Richard Rankin/Bass The McGuire Sisters Carl Jung Jon Secada Philosophical skepticism Hypnosis Frosty the Snowman LOL (Internet slang) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Amber Spyglass The Shining (film) Infantilism Christmas Empathy Out-of-body experience Sigmund Freud Christmas television special Christmas worldwide Carlos Castaneda Star Ocean: The Second Story Scarlet Witch The Smoking Room Human Bene Gesserit Edgar Cayce Skiing Psychedelic drug Soul Chaos magic Darwin from Insectivorous plants to Worms Time Out of Mind Magic (paranormal) Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (television special) Social rule Wizarding world Fritz Leiber Magic (Harry Potter) Memory RuneScape quests Please Save My Earth Eyes Wide Shut Charmed The Mother Rich Mullins Yoko Ono Philosophy of mind Witchcraft Rent (musical) False memory 10cc Christmas song E.
