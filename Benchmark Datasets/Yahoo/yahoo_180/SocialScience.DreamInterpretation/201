my dreams predict events in my future i hardly ever remember my dreams but the dreams that i do remember seem to foreshadow a part of my life for example i dreamed a couple weeks ago that my ex boyfriend boyfriend at the time was hanging around his ex girlfriend again and it appeared to be true we actually broke up because of her my other dreams in the past that i've remembered have somehow predicted a future event to happen too so last night i had a dream that my ex and i were cuddling on my bed and talking again we've been broken up for a couple weeks and came to a decision that we were done for good but now that i had this dream it makes me wonder what's it mean and is it even possible for dreams to predict the future or is it just coincidence dreams usually reveal things in your life that you are already feeling chances are you subconsciouisly knew your now ex was not fully committed to the relationship your latest dream is no doubt your hopeful thinking that he will come back this will most likely result in you pursuing this and since he is a guy and probably not interested in any kind of real relationship will entertain the idea and get back with you at least until something else comes along it should be a warning that your personal feelings are getting in the way of rational thought it's certainly not a prophecy Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) God Emperor of Dune Predestination Cliff Richard Jon Secada The Ashlee Simpson Show Philosophical skepticism Meaning of life Knots Landing Out-of-body experience Apocalypse Free will About a Boy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Lucid dreaming The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Book of Daniel Children of Dune Memento (film) Friends Pitaten The Invisibles Sin City S__ren Kierkegaard Sex and the City Dream Undergrads StarCraft: Uprising Time travel 24 (television) Neighbours Mulholland Drive (film) Law of value Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Phoebe Halliwell Time Out of Mind Miss Saigon Carl Jung Eschatology Sabbath Kodocha Spice Girls Spanish verbs End times Fiddler on the Roof D__j__ vu Badly Drawn Kitties T'Pol Kain (Legacy of Kain) Theodicy Theory of conduct W.I.T.C.H.
