dream ofa haunted house what does it mean to dream im in my grandmas house and its haunted by the ghost of some girl in my school ps it think it is haunted in real life wow evil monkey thanks for creeping me out well you don't say whether the girl from your school is living or not everyone you meet in your dreams represents some aspect of you or your personality unless it is someone who has died in that case it is the spirit of that person trying to get a message to you the house also represents you and the condition of the house is meant to give you some clue to your emotional state the fact that it is haunted would suggest that there is something going in on your life that you don't understand literally something that is hazy or not clearly defined that this is your grandmother's house suggests wiser or more mature aspects of your personality again since this relates to the haunting it seems there is something emtionally about your wiser self that you are dealing with and that you are having trouble figuring out good luck Animism Pitaten The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Ghostwriter (television series) Dead Like Me Scenes from a Memory Holy Spirit Ghost Storytelling The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Force (Star Wars) Supergirl Asperger syndrome Scientology beliefs and practices John Berryman Umbra (World of Darkness) Spiritism Paul Is Dead The Lovely Bones Apology (Plato) Evil Incarnations of Immortality Obi-Wan Kenobi Picnic at Hanging Rock Infantilism Predestination paradox Meaning of life The Amber Spyglass Oh My Goddess!
