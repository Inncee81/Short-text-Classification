when you were a child did you ever think you would find the entrance to magical worlds i read a lot when i was little and had a hyperactive imagination i always thought that i would find real magic someday a little part of me wants to think i still can but i keep getting older and i don't know if i ever will i feel bored with reality i say make your dreams reality you need to find someone who will bring magic into your life sometimes i feel like i am the only person on the planet without a true love and friend don't stop searching when you do is when your soul dies Jon Secada Incarnations of Immortality Reality Carlos Castaneda Charmed Friedrich Schleiermacher The Amber Spyglass Arthur Machen Theory of conduct Paul Is Dead Urantia Gregg Alexander S__ren Kierkegaard Changeling: The Dreaming W.I.T.C.H.
