psychic guidance concerned about psychic dreams and premonitions i have been having premonitions day dreams and visions that have often been prophetic in nature also i have had a few night dreams that i remember that seem to come true its not like a deja vu thing but actual images words and events that have yet to happen so far nothing has been of a hurtful or bad nature its usualy mundane or insignificant but i am worried about the chances of that sort of thing happening when i have day time sensations its usualy something that is going to happen within hours when i dream it usualy is much longer away weeks months i get very uneasy when it happens scared is more the word for it i am looking for advice on ways to deal with this my friends say it is a gift to me it feels more like a curse ok first of all dont be afraid of it it is a gift and look at it this way when you have a dream or vision of prophesy it is possible to use that information to lessen the impact of the event or even alter it like to warn you or someone else not to go somewhere at a certain time becasue a bad event will happen you may save a life and others may still be harmed but you have to remember when its a persons time to go it is their time and other people can be saved from a trajedy because they werent meant to be there and that near miss will effect them in such a way that it can change their life for the better do you get what im saying i have had many many prophetic dreams and some of them were about people dying and it upset me a great deal but then i realized that it was their time to go and me being warned about the event before hand made me avoid the event and prevented me from being involved and harmed because it wasnt my time i was only meant to bear witness to the event not experience it directly Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dream Jon Secada God Emperor of Dune Theory of conduct Social rule Miracle Phoebe Halliwell The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Father's Day (Doctor Who) D__j__ vu One Tree Hill (TV series) Prophet Parapsychology Scientology beliefs and practices Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Charmed Cliff Richard Predestination paradox Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Numerology Avenue Q Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Religious Society of Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jewish Messiah Children of Dune Ezekiel Macbeth Ten Commandments House of M Kain (Legacy of Kain) Miss Saigon Scenes from a Memory W.I.T.C.H.
