another dream question i have been having a re occuring lucid nightmare read about my previous dream predictions before going on i began meditation to try to have more control and remember the dreams better about a week ago for the past three nights i have been having a dream in which my best friend asks out the girl of my dreams this being a lucid dream i think nothing of it and because i feel that im awake i say nothing later in the dream i aproach my friend and he begins trash talking his girlfriend after his vulgar rant i tell him how i feel about and punch him in the face a fight brakes out and within a few minutes the girl of my dreams walks in on the fight she tells me im scum slaps me in the face and tells me she hates me in the dream i'm heart broken lost my best friend and the girl of my dreams i fall to my knees and look at my hands a sense of vertigo hits me and i see my self in a birds eye view the view changes and im looking at my hands again they're bloodied and have crusifiction holes in them i look up and see my best friend his hand held out in friendship i take his hand and he helps me stand i look at him and say thanks but as i say it he turns in to a horibble demon his palm hits me square in the forehead and i don't feel the heartbreak anymore i hit the ground and slowly stand back up my friend is gone i'm in an empty street but theres the litter of a big party wrappers cans confetti etc i turn around and see the girl of my dreams she says nothing and i cant muster myself to say anything as i walk away she says so thats all you feel i turn around and see her crying all i can say is yeah i guess it is i re turn around fall on my knees and close my eyes then i wake up i've had this dream for the past nights and it always ends the same way i hope this isnt a premonition expecally the demon part xd in response to the first answer we were class mates for years but other than class room palls we were never anything more so yeah hhhmmm that demon part is a little well weird and i can make nothing of that part but the whole girl thing means that she does like you and you need to do something about it it means that if you dont do something about the girl someone else will and you'll be screwed and that person will most likely be someone close to you Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Shawn Michaels EastEnders The Invisibles The Amber Spyglass Hall & Oates Billboard Hot 100 Sin City Out-of-body experience K' Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pitaten Miss Saigon The Shining (film) Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dream She Loves You Little Britain Piccolo Junior Saga Aerial (dance move) Cliff Richard The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe YuYu Hakusho Joke Professional wrestling attacks Phoebe Halliwell Trish Stratus AFI 100 Years series Kain (Legacy of Kain) Big Brother (USA TV series) Oh My Goddess!
