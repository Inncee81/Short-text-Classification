i managed to kill every single last one of them but why did i leave her alive last night i had this dream where i was michael myers from the halloween movies going around killing random people and enjoying it it stated off with me wearing the mask walking into my university hiding in the shadows and killing off other med students and staff then all of sudden one of my elementary school teachers walks through a door and tells me i'm being naughty and says she's going to inform the principle i just walk away and keep killing other people until this one girl manages to survive she turns around walks toward me takes he cloths off and i make love to her she turns to me and i realise it's my girlfriend so she asks why i came and i tell her i forgot to bring you my valentines card we then walk out of the university past the dead bodies holding hands does anyone know what this dream means i think you are very competitive and confident that you will do well in school in your dream you are killing off the competition the fact that your girlfriend survives means that you have come to the conclusion that you do have room for her in your life and your relationship with her is not in conflict with your doing well in school a little harder to understand is why the elementary teacher showed up she seams to represent guilt is it possible you're feeling just a bit guilty about something you've done to be so successful The Shining (film) Columbine High School massacre One Tree Hill (TV series) The Amber Spyglass EastEnders Daredevil Michael Myers (Halloween) Days of our Lives Silent Night, Deadly Night About a Boy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Knots Landing Pitaten Scream (film) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Great Teacher Onizuka The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Subtle Knife Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dead Like Me My Parents are Aliens Futurama (TV series - season 5) Halloween (film) Shaggy dog story The Catcher in the Rye Invader Zim Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Kill Bill W.I.T.C.H.
