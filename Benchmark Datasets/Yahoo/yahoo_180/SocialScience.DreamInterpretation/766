does anyone else have dreams like this or am i paranoid i keep on having these dreams on a fairly consistent regular basis of people showing up in my dreams that i've never met before in my life as usual with me the dreams themselves end up being very vivid highly detailed full sensory affairs but these ones i dream of people i've never met before meeting them in places i've never been before and these people they have questions for me they want to ask me things personal things about my life the tone of the dreams has varied somewhat from a job interview to a full blown interrogation by multiple strangers the messed up part of it is once these dreams start my waking up doesn't stop them sure if i am lucid enough i can wake myself up be awake but if i go back to sleep anytime soon after i end up right back there the interrogation continues i had this happen with me once four times in a night the questions would start i'd wake up go back to sleep it would resume continued that particular night after waking myself up the fourth time in a row i had to stay up for hours straight before i felt safe enough to sleep again and while none of the recurring dreams with this theme have been as intense since still i'm just wondering does anyone else have dreams like this am i the only one being interrogated in his sleep or is this just my brain's way of saying you do yahoo answers way too much i don't know any thoughts or ideas that aren't totally mean and negative would be appreciated thanks hmmm i would go to my mother if i thought she'd be helpful trouble is she had her own issues when she lived yes she's passed on died it's ok you didn't know and i am a bit old here to be going to my mother going to be soon but i do like the response to stress theories so far i have had a lot on my mind and not a lot of social contacts to share things with maybe some of this is my own mind's telling me to dump the info and let it go already and i do have a buddy or two who i talk with about any esper or paranormal side there might be to this they wonder what this is about as well i'd say there is something going on in your life and you really need to be paying attention to everything it could be a sign of what has been or what is to come it may only be an indicator that has nothing to do with you personally but i think your future is going to change and soon Dream Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story Milton H.
