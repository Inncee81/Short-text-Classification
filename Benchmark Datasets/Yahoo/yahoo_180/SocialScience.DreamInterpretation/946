do i have physic abilities more than once in my life actually very often i get this overwhelming feeling about people places i get chills and i physically emotionally interupted i get a very concious feeling about things often sometimes in dreams and alot of times i have such a moving emotional feeling that tears water my eyes up sometimes i can think my way out of it and sometimes i just go with it am i a nut or are these of a physic nature hi jalapeno there is a really fine line between being intuitive and being sensitive psychic is a sort of obvious hit the ball out of the park type of thing it's hard to miss but pay attention to your feelings and your dreams come back here if you want help interpreting them it's fine to pay attention to what you are feeling this is a good thing i would urge you to check your motive that is so important not just here but in all aspects of your life years ago i had a friend who regularly had readings done from a local psychic one day the psychic asked my friend about someone who very much matched a description of me the psychic talked about my height and weight and age and even knew the color of my gf's hair she said that i was very psychic but if i did not leave it alone it would make me mad that there was a dark side to every place that there was light and that i was not ready for what i would find i am not sure i ever will be something to think about as you step onto this road good luck Carl Jung Out-of-body experience Lucid dreaming Please Save My Earth Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Jon Secada The Contender (television series) Dream W.I.T.C.H.
