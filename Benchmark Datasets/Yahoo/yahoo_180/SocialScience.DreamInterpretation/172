i've dreamed about spiders the past two night the first night i saw two average sized or not big spiders i saw one scurry in front of me and as i layed down i knew another one was going behind it i reached out my hand and caught it i felt disgusted as i felt it moving between my fingers trying to get away but i never got rid of it the second night i dreamed about several spiders they were everywhere in my home or the house i was living in and i was creeped out i did kill of them but one kept getting away i feared taking a shower or laying down my sister was in the dream also but she wasn't as creeped out as i was and she's terrified of spiders any ideas of what these mean i don't fear spiders i don't like them but who does i mean i won't ever have one as a pet if i see one in my house i will kill it but if i see one outside i'll leave it alone according to dreamcrowd some believe that the spider is symbolic of an unkind and sneaky individual are you the spider building a web or are you being dragged into one a spider's web might represent entanglement and the general complexities of life depending on the details of the dream it could also symbolize a smothering individual ironically very old dream interpretations say that the spider is an omen of good luck alternatively carl jung felt that the spider's web was a symbol of wholeness due to its formation circular shape construction and complexity he called circular symbols mandalas and said that they hold valuable meaning for the dreamer the spider and his web may be calling for an integration of the dream's personality leading to greater self awareness and resulting in feelings of completeness therefore the spider and his web may be considered profound and spiritual dream symbols that call for greater self understanding and encourage us to derive meaning and satisfaction from the intricate framework and interplay of life try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Carl Jung Mandala Year of the Spider Psychoanalysis Milton H.
