horrible weird dream about school yesterday i dreamed that i was back in school i recognised it but it looked really different as if someone rearranged it i had just finished my p e lesson and me and my friends went to the changing room to get changed back into our uniform but then i noticed that there was a window on the wall opposite from where i was standing the bad thing is that a second or so later i saw someone looking in from the window it was this boy in my other classes but i had a bad experience with him once and then i felt really scared i told my friends but they told me not to look at him i couldn't help but stare back at him then the p e teacher came in and told us to hurry up coz she needs to teach the next class then i took my coat and got changed behind that but i could still see him staring at me he seemed to be fixed upon me what does this mean serious answers only please thanks x it means that your bad experience with him has affected you more that you thought your subconscious is expressing your fear and that you don't feel safe that you feel vulnerable or exposed expressed by the window and the changing clothes being undressed to further bad experiences with him what he represents it's also saying that you felt you couldn't count on the adults in your life to help because the p e teacher comes in out notices does nothing has there been an event in your life recently that made you feel vulnerable and unsafe your dream life may have brought this up as a way to tell you it's affecting you more than you'd like to admit and that you have to deal with it this time good luck sweetie One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Avenue Q Transactional analysis God Emperor of Dune The Parting of the Ways Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Charles Goodyear Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) K' Goodness and value theory Piccolo Junior Saga Darth Vader Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Coming of Age (TNG episode) Cliff Richard Friedrich Schleiermacher Miss Saigon Columbine High School massacre Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Blood on the Tracks Great Teacher Onizuka The Shining (film) Social rule The Subtle Knife Father's Day (Doctor Who) W.I.T.C.H.
