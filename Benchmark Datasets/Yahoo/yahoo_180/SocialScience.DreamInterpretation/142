please interpret never had dreams like this last night i had a weird dream about being in this house and having to look after all these really tiny mice from these cats whilst trying to save one i kill some its really weird because i woke up after that and and fell asleep an hour later and that dream continued on with the same cats and being in some dimmly lit house with them then today i had a nap and the dream just continued what do the cats signify and is it normal for dreams to flow on from one another that doesn't usually happen so it sort of qualifies as a recurring dream i think elie was on the right track whether it's kids or a to do list you feel overwhelmed with your workload the mice represent your responsibilities whatever they are the cats just represent distractions from your responsibilities i think you're on the right track with the naps sounds like you could use some sleep get some Sleep Dream Cat Narcolepsy Siesta Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Characters of The Sandman Philosophical skepticism "Weird Al" Yankovic The Amber Spyglass Shaggy dog story Charmed Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Phaedo Scenes from a Memory Avenue Q Futurama (TV series - season 5) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Secret of NIMH The Shining (film) Mouse (computing) Jam (TV series) Doraemon Cordelia Chase Miss Saigon Phantasms (TNG episode) Tiny Toon Adventures Pitaten Delayed sleep phase syndrome Mickey Mouse Fictional character Dean Koontz Sleep paralysis A Day in the Life Lights Out (radio show) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dreamlands Insomnia King Crimson The Cat in the Hat Dream (DC Comics) Sonic the Hedgehog Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mulholland Drive (film) Prolog Red Dwarf The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Teacher's Pet (Disney) W.I.T.C.H.
