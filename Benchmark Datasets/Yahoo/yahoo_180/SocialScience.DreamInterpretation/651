can someone please tell me what my dream means i had a dream that i was sitting on the toliet really and the door was really low so all these guys came up to the stall i was in and keep on staring in on me and peeping in and it seemed like i kept on trying to hide something that was in the toliet it is super embarrissing lol but i just want to know what it means because it was sooo weird thanks hmmm that's a little different but there are some familiar elements so i think i can take a reasonable shot the toilet is usually associated with the dreamer's emotional state i would suggest that the dream indicates that you are concerned with people seeing your emotional secrets you may feel like people or a specific person are getting to close to some emotional truths you are working hard to hide those truths but you are feel exposed and potentially vulnerable has someone new entered your life or have you been opening up to someone or thought of opening up to someone dreams are often resolved by confronting the issue in your waking state facing your emotions or opening up to someone else may help you resolve the dream for more info i suggest checking http dreammoods com best of luck Lucid dreaming Toilet Dream God Emperor of Dune Scenes from a Memory Sin City Obi-Wan Kenobi Domestic violence The Cure Plame affair Social rule Self-harm Homophobia The Amber Spyglass Surveillance One Tree Hill (TV series) The Shining (film) Ethics Alexander Technique Avenue Q Paranoia Agent Futurama (TV series - season 5) Scientology beliefs and practices Shit Post-traumatic stress disorder Luck Carl Jung Objectivist philosophy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Poker jargon Polyamory Jon Secada Miss Saigon Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Assassination Super Mario Bros. 2 Love Meaning of life Blood on the Tracks Shaggy dog story Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Sigmund Freud S__ren Kierkegaard Hide and Q (TNG episode) Controversies in autism Anxiety Drama Traumatic incident reduction Characters of The Sandman Pretty Good Privacy Magical thinking Borderline personality disorder Originalism Akatsuki (Naruto) Columbine High School massacre Game show Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Animism Philosophical counseling Blood Simple Contract Emotion Logic RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Evil Cutey Honey Daredevil Abortion debate Existentialism The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Sleep Out-of-body experience Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Jean Charles de Menezes Numerology Undergrads Consensus decision-making The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) John Howard Yoder Gestalt therapy Narcolepsy HyperText Transfer Protocol Oh My Goddess!
