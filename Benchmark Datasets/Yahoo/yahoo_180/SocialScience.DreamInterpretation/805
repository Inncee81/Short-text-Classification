weird demon calling in my dream okay before i was creeped and now i'm pissed i want to get rid of this demon who keeps calling me in my dreams it started when i was but i didn't think it was bad but it didn't happen very often normally the demon would ask me to be his master before when i realized that he was actually calling me i didn't know where to find him because i wanted to be his master i was so i ignored it for quite a few years and he didn't come back until this month where he would yell and bark saying be my master which would happen every single night ugh and i want to get rid of him because i try my best to think that this is not a real demon and he said that his name was zaz i am quite familiar with this demon because he had talked to me before years old and i don't remember correctly but he was talking about my problems and he said he could help me if i became his master and before i have had some anger problems that i have never had before and i still do i just want to know if i should try to speak with this zaz or try to ignore him or what and why does he want me to be his master according to dreamcrowd to see a pentagram in your dream represents the connection of your spirit to the earth air fire and water these elements contribute to various aspect of your well being it signifies protection to see an inverted pentagram signifies conflict negativity and aggression it is often associated with satanism and evil are you feeling guilty about something alternatively it represents the physical world it points to the notion that you may be on the materialistic side try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Pentagram God Wicca Phoebe Halliwell Piccolo Junior Saga Pitaten Xiaolin Showdown RuneScape quests Dream Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Taikyoku shogi Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Baphomet Radiohead Satan Races in the Warcraft universe Dilbert A Course In Miracles Characters of Naruto Force (Star Wars) Incarnations of Immortality Determinism Numerology Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Supernatural Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Tenshinhan The Life and Times of Juniper Lee One Tree Hill (TV series) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Plame affair Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Leo Wyatt Satanism Cyberspace Buffy Summers Bob and George Carl Barks Devil YuYu Hakusho Theory of conduct Exorcism Angel Avenue Q Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Philosophical skepticism Emanuel Swedenborg Knots Landing Charmed Demonic possession King Piccolo Saga Shaggy dog story Ouija Hell The nature of God in Western theology Magic (paranormal) Reincarnation Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) The Demon Headmaster Free will Thunderbolts (comics) Number of the Beast (numerology) Blonde on Blonde Jean Grey Out-of-body experience Carlos Castaneda Jedi Warcraft III Azazel Genie Aikido Legacy of Kain Classification of demons The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Negima Pok__mon Chronicles Angel Sanctuary Internet troll Kain (Legacy of Kain) K' Sant Thakar Singh Berserk Phaedo Sigmund Freud Witchcraft Conker's Bad Fur Day Poker jargon Elemental spirits (Seiken Densetsu) Socrates Simone Weil Rave Master House of M Naraku Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Atomism The Shining (film) Who Shot Mr. Burns?
