do you think there are really deep meanings in every dream i never gave much thought about it before but i stumbled upon this section and i was wondering if everyone thought that every dream has some deep meaning if you do then what does it mean if you do not remember your dreams and or do not have them i think dreams often reflect your subconscious issues are they all very deep not so much most of the time i think dreams reflect common things like anxiety about tests love relationships taxes etc the experiences are common and pretty mundane most of the time but are still very emotionally charged and intense for everyone each time we experience them however people do have dreams with deep content reflecting spiritual growth as well both types of dreams are interesting to look at in my opinion and both types of dreams are important and valid to study many people do not remember their dreams after waking but most people dream part of the reason we think we don't dream is because dreams are very ephemeral and once we awaken we begin to fill our conscious mind with the mundane thoughts of waking life after we start thinking about the day ahead it's hard to remember our dreams unless we've really made a habit of doing so remembering dreams is actually a skill that can be learned and requires practice just like any other skill additionally use of alcohol and sleep drugs dampens the ability to dream so people who regularly use sleep aids otc or drugs alcohol may in fact inhibit their rem sleep and dream ability and overall sleep quality Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Dream Narcolepsy Consciousness Sleep Alexander Technique Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Unconscious mind Hypnosis Edgar Cayce Neurofeedback Human Human sexual behavior Psychosis Psychoanalysis Carl Jung Cannabis (drug) Milton H.
