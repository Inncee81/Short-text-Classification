unusual dream correct interpretation please in my dream when i looked out of my rd floor house i could see only darkness though it was during the day it was unusually dark as i looked out the south facing window i saw that it was raining very heavily and there was a very strong gale behind the silhouettes of coconut trees i could see a large bright white moon like orb going oscillating like a pendulum i felt tremors and thought it was an earthquake and tried to hide myself after sometime i went near the window and i saw that the entire town is flooded and a strong water current is flowing right below my rd floor window and rising steadily i am frantically looking for a place to go and think of moving to the terrace taking my mother in law who stays with me at the back of my mind i was worried about where my child in school and my husband at work were immediately after this i woke up with a start feeling very disturbed it was am i never get such wild dreams what could this mean the fact that you were so disturbed and could remember it so vividly means that this is an important dream houses often mean either the desire to feel safe or refers to the structure of your psyche i think in your case it was the first water often refers to the unconscious floods and a fear of water means that you are afraid of your unconscious and the power it holds some aspect that you are ignoring and has become part of your unconscious is threatening to flood your personality and drown you what this aspect is i can only guess the moon and pendulums oscillating are both measures of time although what the trees mean i can only guess darkness is often associated with fear and the unknown you fear for your family what will this unconscious part of my personality do to them how old are you due for a thirty something or midlife crisis especially the midlife crisis is often associated with unassimilated material because the first part of your life is associated with the exterior world in the end only you can truly say what this dream means to you hope this helps Dream Tide Modernism Drowning Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Amber Spyglass Psychoanalysis Apollo 8 Ekadasi Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Jon Secada Tsunami Unconscious mind Sigmund Freud Volcano Analytical psychology Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) The Parting of the Ways Tenshinhan Mount Pinatubo Autism Seismometer Supernatural Narcissism 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Seismic retrofit Deluge (mythology) Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Karen Horney Earthquake 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophical skepticism Hurricane Wilma The Star Wars Holiday Special Out-of-body experience Lucid dreaming Pompeii 2005 Kashmir earthquake Geology of the Moon Bad Wolf Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sento The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever Aerial (dance move) Bene Gesserit Cliff Richard Psychology of religion Force (Star Wars) Fernando Pessoa Datalore (TNG episode) Maxwell's equations Moon Pitaten Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Columbine High School massacre Climate of the United Kingdom Infantilism Freeters Mercury 4 Gnosticism Theory of conduct Sydney Riot of 1879 Toa Saturn Comanche Transactional analysis The Time Machine Poker jargon Gravity 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Quantum mechanics Jam (TV series) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dean Koontz El Ni__o 1997 Pacific hurricane season Eldfell Milton H.
