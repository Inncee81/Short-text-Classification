having really messed up dreams what do they mean lately ive been having these wierd series of dreams its like every night continues the dream of the night before and their very sad dreams i dream of dying but im still aware of everything around me and also of being raped and being a prostitute im only i dont think i should be having these kinds of dreams but i feel like theyre trying to tell me something some dreams can be from the enemy and are him trying to weaken your defenses to get you to think the way he wants you to other dreams can be from god but reveal the enemies plans and assist you in how to pray other dreams are from god and his plans for you other dreams can just be nonsense or you just don't understand them as a child i used to have frequent nightmares from the enemy my mother discovered jesus christ and told me about him as a child i would pray for jesus protection before i went to bed and that his angels would guard me i also asked god that he would make me his warrior even in my dreams as i knew i had had encounters with demonic entities in my dreams and could feel them evern after i woke up i have had much success and even in my dreams i have become aware and rebuke the enemy in my dream in jesus name and the dream will come to a halt usualy waking me up there is usualy still and evil presence felt but i know how to take authority over that as god has give jesus a name above all name that every knee should bow and every tongue confess that jesus is lord and that the demons fear his name worshiping god also causes the negative presence to flee as well so i recomend both speaking out them to be gone in jesus name and praising the lord in the midst of the presence till you feel peace now for understanding in dreams it is good to ask god for that as daniel did in the bible if you don't know your bible i would recomend you read it and hang out with people who do and know god and have experiences to share so that you can learn from their experiences and gain your own most of all talk to god and ask him for his plan in your life and that you will know his son jesus try this web site if you want to read the bible www blueletterbible org i recomend starting with the new testament in mathew mark luke and john and then moving to acts and also pray god will teach you and give you knowledge of what you are reading Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sabbath John the Baptist Christian eschatology Holy Spirit Angel New Testament John Howard Yoder Book of Isaiah Dispensationalism Christianity Christian views of Jesus New Testament view on Jesus' life God Sola fide Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Mary, the mother of Jesus Ten Commandments Eastern Orthodox Church Resurrection of Jesus Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eucharist Book of Mormon Biblical canon Characters of The Sandman Mary Magdalene Original sin End times Jesus Baptism Emanuel Swedenborg Antichrist Names and titles of Jesus Protestantism Christian anarchism Joseph of Arimathea Satan Apostle Slow Train Coming Saint Peter Saint James the Just Genesis Fundamentalism Virgin Mary in Islam Matthew 2 Church of Christ Gospel of Thomas Aramaic of Jesus Joseph Smith, Jr. Gospel of Mark Demon The Pilgrim's Progress Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Devil Agap__ Abraham Historical Jesus Meaning of life Prayer in Christianity Religious Society of Friends Dream Soul Gospel of John Baptist First Book of Nephi God Emperor of Dune Mass (liturgy) Judas Iscariot Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Charismatic Sant Thakar Singh Idolatry Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Hell Knots Landing Pentecostalism EastEnders Kabbalah Miss Saigon Priesthood (Mormonism) The Death Gate Cycle Apocrypha Mortification of the flesh Roman Catholic Church John Wesley Apocalypse King James Version of the Bible Christian views of women Coptic Christianity Book of Joshua InterFaith Isa Philipp Melanchthon
