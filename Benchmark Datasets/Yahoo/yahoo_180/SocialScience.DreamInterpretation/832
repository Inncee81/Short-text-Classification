intrepret my dream anyone hi i had a dream last night and i'm bothered by what i did and saw in the dream i remember that i carrying another female somewhere and i'm assuming it was a house and i sort of felt like a man or maybe even turned into one but then i realized that i wasn't and immediately put thelady down and went to go find her prince charmings so they could go figure out who she belongs to and argue over her just to let you know i'm completely straight i'm not a transsexual or a cross dresser i don't find females attractive though sometimes i compare myself theen i found myself in disney land waiting to ride the new nemo submarine ride with a close friend i haven't seen in a while as we got on the ride there were a couple of attractive guys and we immediately started talking i saw them in my dreams a couple of times while on the ride some of them kept complaining that it was a waste of time but i disagreed and told them to look at the lovely features and animals later we just lef often times in our dreams our sub conscious minds rationalize one illogical event with another possibly illogical event in your case your dream may have found you carrying another woman and then to rationalize that you felt like a man maybe were a man or a prince charming for a short bit till your mind said that doesn't make sense i'm a woman so you set her down to look for her real prince charming and prince charming of course reminded you of disney and so there you were thinking about the new disney ride and talking with attractive men maybe your prince charming you may have dreamt the men were bored on the ride because men and boys classically like the adrenaline rush of the speedy roller coasters and so you found yourself teaching them how to appreciate the astestic features of the ride you may have seen them many times because our dream cycles often repeat the dream within a night each time having the same dream with perhaps slight differences my question is do you remember how it all started why you were carrying the woman to begin with perhaps she was injured or couldn't move perhaps she is a version of how you see yourself longing to be carried away by your prince charming Shaggy dog story Milton H.
