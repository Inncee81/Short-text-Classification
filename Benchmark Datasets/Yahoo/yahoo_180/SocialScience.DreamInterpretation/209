what does this dream mean i was laying on a trampoline it was kind of gray outside and i was outside of patrick's house on their trampoline it was creepy outside and there were old barns and a henhouse it was all on a creepy field then i saw his room and my phone started ringing it was him he said he was sorry for breaking my heart and that he wouldn't do it again and then he picked me up off the trampoline and gave me a hug then my friend jasmine randomly appeared outside of an old barn jasmine said how happy she was and then i said that i was happy too we walked over to the barn and a black man with a straw hat on said that there was a big dog who hadn't eaten in years he said to be careful we went in the barn to see if the dog would eat if we went in there we said on what was like a bench and my friend jasmine went outside of the barn so i sat with patrick and he started coughing and it looked like he was coughing up a little bit blood i left to go find jasmine then i found jasmine and then we heard something and looked up at the window there was a woman there who was supposedly his mom she had long black hair and she was holding up a sign that said he's dead and it was colored in black then i said no he can't be dead and i started crying i told her that she killed him because she divorced patrick's dad then a wind moved in and a storm was on it's way my friend jasmine started laughing at the moon because it had a smiley face and was cackling a very familiar music started playing but only while the moon was laughing then i turned around and there was a large body of water and his mom was in the boat holding the same sign patrick appeared in my arms and i told him not to die then i woke up what does it mean according to dreamcrowd to hear barking in your dream represents your tendency of barking orders at people instead of asking or talking kindly it may also indicate that you are annoying others grumpiness or fussiness to see a happily barking dog in your dream symbolizes pleasures and much social activity if the dog is barking ferociously then it represents your habit of unnecessary barking at people and the situations around you it could also mean unfriendly companions carl jung said that the wise old man is the archetype of the spirit and the speaking fountainhead of the soul dreaming about him may attempt to bring the dreamer into awareness of the larger meaning of ones life old people in dreams represent wisdom and maturity they may appear in our dreams at times of confusion and lack of direction or when we need consultation and help in decision making try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation Shaggy dog story The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Garfield Pitaten Dream Piccolo Junior Saga W.I.T.C.H.
