weird dream i just had a weird dream but it's freaking me out recently my house was broke into so i'm not sure if bits of it was from anxiety of what happened but here we go i was dreaming that i was dying no one was trying to kill me or anything but my dad was in it and he was telling me all this stuff that he's sorry he couldn't be a better father and all this basically he was apologizing for sucking as a dad but it's not that he is a wonderful father but anyways it then cuts to me being raped but i wasn't being raped at the time it was like i was watching myself being raped and what's crazy is it was my doctor who was doing it i don't know it was weird i then woke up soon after that is this just some silly nightmare or what please interpret my dream thanks the rape in my dream is actually a little weird i could understand people dreaming about that if it happened to them in some point of their life however i have never been raped the only thing i can think of is i'm having anxiety of being raped by what happened when someone broke into my house along with the anxiety of possibly being dead at this moment although nothing bad happened to me then it still scares me that it could happen thanks for the answers guys this dream has everything to do with your house being broken into you dreaming you were dying represents your vulnerability and that a piece of you is missing which is your sence of security your father was there to apologize because we look to our fathers for protection which he did not or could not provide for you and therefor he feels he did not live up to his fatherly duty as protector your doctor represents trust which was breached as your home was breached you being raped is not a sexual representation but you feel violated by this intruder the doctor being the one raping you means that you think someone you know and trusted broke into your home thereby violating your trust even more this is a manifestation of your belief not a fact i hope this makes sense and i hope it helps sweeter dreams in the future Theory of conduct Father's Day (Doctor Who) Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Grandview, U.S.A.
