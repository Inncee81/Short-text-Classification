this may sound like a stupid question when you're lucid dreaming how do u really wake up in real life after you're already basically awake thats confusing me oh and another thing possibly another stupid question if u hurt someone in your lucid dream it wont really have an effect on them right or if you hurt yourself no effect right please no rude comments thank you fro reading i don't know what causes one to wake up from a lucid dream but i think lucid dreams often have the most significant meanings and perhaps your waking up is a result of your brain wanting to remember what the dream was about by comparing it with the real waking world i've never been able to have a negative effect on someone with a lucid dream though i have had some interesting coincidences where i had lucid dreams about people i care about and they had one about me Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Dream Philosophical skepticism Jon Secada Consciousness Binaural beats House of M Hypnagogia Social rule Frank Herbert Sleep Hypnosis Dream Theater Theory of conduct Philosophy of language Philosophy of mind Freddy Krueger Finnegans Wake Therion (band) Second language acquisition James Hillman Astral projection Computer numbering formats Narcolepsy Simulated reality Vanilla Sky Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Rudolf Steiner Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Sleep paralysis The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie American Idiot Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Irony Emanuel Swedenborg A Day in the Life Knots Landing Qualia Animism Phantasms (TNG episode) Milton H.
