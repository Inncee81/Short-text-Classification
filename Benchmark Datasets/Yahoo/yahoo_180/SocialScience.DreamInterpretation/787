please interpret this dream it's driving me crazy all i remember is a guy slitting my throat and i blacked out and woke up at the hospital they sent me home without fixing my neck and i kept looking for a bandaid because the wound would gape open if i moved my head gross i know but what does it mean by the way i'm serious it was just this morning the guy was very vague and i never felt any pain evils lilly you're right looking at my life right now it's a little crazy we've been living with my parents for over months now waiting for our house to be finished the builder has missed every single deadline we're supposed to close monday and it's not even done could this possibly be it i guess you're answer strikes close to how i'm feeling right now it's hard to live under my parents rules with kids of my own to take care of whew i feel better already the vague guy is the builder and he literally has you by the throat getting it in the neck figuratively killing you he's vague because he is an incidental person in your life right now albeit important when the building is done he will go away the fact that you're in a hospital means that there will eventually be recovery but the lack of a band aid could mean that you resent having to pay him because of all the aggrevation but you must since the work is done as long as it meets agreed upon terms so there is no a aid symbolized by the bandaid this dream will pass into memory when the building is finally done it's main message is that it is an expression of the tension you're feeling John F.
