psychic my dream was of a family gathering at a near by river and i was helping my grandmother down a water slide suddenly my hand slipped and we both went down at the same time when got to the water my great aunt from the other side of the family told us we needed to get out because there was a dead little girl and a snake in the water we did i told my mother a few days later and she told me the there was a body found in that river the day after i dreamed it am i psychic or is it just coincidence there are two separate issues involved a dream interpretation precognition and evaluation of your psychic skills one dream is not enough for the evaluation however it makes sense for you to learn more about psychic gifts and in my opinion your dream urges you to develop your own gifts good luck Parapsychology W.I.T.C.H.
