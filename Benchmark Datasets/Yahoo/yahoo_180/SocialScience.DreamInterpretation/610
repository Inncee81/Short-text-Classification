recurring dream of bloody and dirty public bathrooms this is a dream that i have had in the past several time and just had again the other night in my dream i walk into a public bathroom that looks like a locker room there are about doors i start opening each one looking for a clean place to do my business however every door i open the toilet is full with water and there is blood and other dirty things so then i go to the next the door and the same thing in some dreams i find the least dirty bathroom and do my business and in other dreams i never find a place to go i know this is weird but any help would be great because of the way this dream makes me feel i consider it a bad dream i like to remind everyone that nobody can really interpret your dreams better than you can but i can give you some things to think about that might help you make sense of this unnusual dream everything in a dream is a symbol the fact that you are walking is a strong symbol for you moving along your life journey having a need to enter the bathroom and then finding it in the condition that you describe these suggest that you are blocking yourself by hanging on to negative emotions or a negative experience blood is a strong symbol and suggests you may be draining your own energy through worry or fear the color red is symbol for energy so what's it all mean well i dunno but i would not be surprised if you haven't figured it out by now there is something going on in your life that is creating worry in you and you are letting that worry have too much say it may be a very small thing or it certainly could be something large like moving starting a new school or job by letting go of the anxiety your energy should come back and this particular dream should stop good luck The Shining (film) Toilet One Tree Hill (TV series) K' Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Out-of-body experience Anxiety Sin City Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Changeroom Friends Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Toilet humour Fecal incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic incident reduction Shit Infantilism EastEnders The Inside Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Japanese toilet Conker's Bad Fur Day Pitaten Urinary incontinence W.I.T.C.H.
