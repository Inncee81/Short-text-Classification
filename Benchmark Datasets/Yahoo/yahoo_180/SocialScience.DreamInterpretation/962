flying in dreams using swimming movements why when i have dreams about flying the seem very real oh well anyway i usually fly just one metre above the ground so it's very low and my body is actually swimming to move forwards it's really interesting and quite realistic any similar experiences or explanations lol if you are flying with ease and enjoying the scene and landscape below then it suggests that you are on top of a situation you have risen above something it may also mean that you have gained a different perspective on things flying dreams and the ability to control your flight is representative of your own personal sense of power having difficulties staying in flight indicates a lack of power in controlling your own circumstances you may be struggling to stay aloft and stay on course things like power lines trees or mountains may further obstruct your flight these barriers represent a particular obstacle or person who is standing in your way in your waking life you need to identify who or what is hindering you from moving forward if you are feeling fear when you are flying or that you feel that you are flying too high then it suggests that you are afraid of challenges and of success another way of interpreting flying dreams is that these dreams symbolize your strong mind and will you feel undefeatable and nobody can tell you what you cannot do and accomplish Dream Super Mario 64 Fixed-wing aircraft Out-of-body experience Gliding Autism Paragliding Drowning Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Diving W.I.T.C.H.
