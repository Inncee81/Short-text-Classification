real or dream few days ago i had this weird thing happening to me in the middle of the night i was urgent and wanted to go to the toilet when i got up i was suddenly pinned down and unable to move so i struggled and then hurt the right side of my neck after much struggle i finally managed to get up but was then throw back down again and my head was in the middle of the mattress my body was turing on its own head not twisted but just following the direction of my body after about round of turing it stopped and i immediately when back to sleeping position when i really woke up i was indeed urgent and needed the toilet now the puzzling thing is that i have no idea whether this is real or dream cause it happened at the place that i was sleeping at can anyone tell me whether it's real or dream what does the dream means don't tell me it's about anything related to toilet or bed all i want toknow about why i was being made a fool by an invisible creature help appreciated btw it felt so real that i had no idea how to explain it it sounds like you had what is called sleep paralysis followed by muscle spasms due to the urgency to get up if it starts to be a real problem or you get injured from it you might want to talk to a doctor about it but if it's just occasionally i wouldn't worry it acually happens to a lot of people Shaggy dog story Out-of-body experience Mattress The Amber Spyglass Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Urinary incontinence The Shining (film) Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Lucid dreaming EastEnders Piccolo Junior Saga Professional wrestling throws Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Milton H.
