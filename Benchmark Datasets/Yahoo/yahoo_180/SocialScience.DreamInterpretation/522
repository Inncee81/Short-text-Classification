dreams is it okay to dream of men when you are married ever since i was a teenager i have been having dreams about certain young men these men have been what i call my protectors one is my brothers best friend and a total gem another was a friend at school another is a workmate nothing immoral happens in these dreams they just talk to me hug me and maybe kiss me they tell me things are okay i am married and have a difficult relationship i had difficult school days too do you think in my mind i need these ones to help me or is there something deeper it is perfectly fine for you to dream about these protectors of sorts in the past through many times of trouble and tribulation they protected you from dangers at least subconsciously if not physically so with the problems with your marriage they appear to comfort and provide care that you might not be getting from your spouse i understand that it might be a little unnerving for their appearance in dreams since it is usually an indicator of turmoil but do not fret be assured there is nothing wrong with dreaming about them however you may have problems in the marriage that need to be addressed whereas they are protectors they are only effective on your thoughts and emotions if you and your husband have problems sitting down and communicating you may want to consider seeking marriage counseling to fix the relationship and stop the dreams until another issue arises good luck Marriage Divorce Grief Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) Same-sex marriage Polygamy Haven (TNG episode) End times Religion and sexuality Teenage pregnancy Psychoanalysis Love Jiddu Krishnamurti EastEnders Psychotherapy Humphrey Bogart Past teachings of Prem Rawat Jean Grey Philosophy of language Unconscious mind Sexual orientation W.I.T.C.H.
