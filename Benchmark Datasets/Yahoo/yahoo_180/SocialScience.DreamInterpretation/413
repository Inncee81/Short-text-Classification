what does this dream mean i have had a few dreams that my boyfriend is really rude to me then breaks up with me for dumb reasons that would normally not matter like talking to my friends it makes no sense to me why i have these every once in a while according to dreamcrowd to see your boyfriend in your dream represents your waking relationship with him and how you feel about him to dream that your boyfriend is dead indicates that something in your own self that is no longer functional and is dead you are not being allowed to fully express yourself it is also symbolic of your own relationship with that person perhaps you need to let go of this relationship if your boyfriend is away and your dreams of him involve a lot of touching signify how much you miss his presence and have him being nearby the dream is telling you not to take the day to day things for granted learn to cherish the smaller things in life to dream that your boyfriend tells you that he is gay or that he doesn't love your anymore represents your own insecurities with the relationship it may also mean that the relationship is moving to a new level to which you are expressing some anxiety and fears about the changing situation you may feel left out it in his life or that you are unable to share in all his experiences it boils down to trust and communication try posting your dream on dreamcrowd for a free interpretation One Tree Hill (TV series) Scenes from a Memory W.I.T.C.H.
