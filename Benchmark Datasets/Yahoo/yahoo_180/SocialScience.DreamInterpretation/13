dream interpreters ok so i had an insane and rather hilarious dream the other day two of my friends offered me a piece of pizza i start eating and they proceed to laugh i ask what was wrong with the pizza they reply more or less saying that was joke pizza now you've got the mark of the beast apparently the antichrist had contaminated the world's food supply with olive oil and if you touched olive oil you got the mark of the beast then my extremely religious aunt and uncle enter the room who had also touched the oil then my their son comes in completely drenched in olive oil the only point of interest in any of this is that their son disowned in real life them due a custody battle so apparently everyone got the mark of the beast and lived happily ever after thoughts made great conversation material lol no i didn't make it up but i watched a documentary on hell earlier that day lol very very amusing ahah its just your imagination working especially since you watched the documentary your mind was wondering what your religious relatives would look like if they were bad thats all The Ashlee Simpson Show Green Goblin Knots Landing John the Baptist Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Antichrist Shaggy dog story The Star Wars Holiday Special Piccolo Junior Saga Invader Zim A Course In Miracles Douglas Adams YuYu Hakusho Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Milton H.
