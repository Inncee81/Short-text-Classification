i need some dream interpretation okay this is it so im in this great white place there are no walls or anything just shinning white and i walk up to this woman with curly light brown hair whos wearing this pale yellow dress with red beads on her neck she wears glasses and smiles very serenly i start talking to her but the words make no sense at all like they were just random words some of them were bear house sinocopated water wall etc this dream seems to be a very spiritual dream but one in which there is a sense of confusion yet the imagery of the great white place and the serene woman indicates a somewhat heavenly place with a sage like person with whom you are attempting to communicate at the same time your communication with her is frustrated because her words to you don't seem to make any sense at all to me this would seem to indicate that you're feeling frustrated spiritually or intellectually as if someone you look up to isn't communicating well to you the imagery of being in a place with no walls would lend itself to two possible things to me depending on how you felt during the dream if you felt scared or confused during the dream then this would probably indicate that dream is one where your subconscious is telling you that your situation is somewhat frightening to you there are no boundaries in your situation and you are a bit frightened because you don't know where you are going and what the rules are on the other hand if you felt no fear or felt light free or serene or just confused by the woman's words then issue of being in the no walls room means that you enjoy being free to create your own path or that you simply accept it as part of your journey either way i think this is definitely a spiritual journey sort of dream your subconscious is indicating where you are in your growth along the path and while you're a little confused right now i think you need to look to how you actually felt in the dream to assess where you are were you scared or were you calm Out-of-body experience Milton H.
