why do they say it these two girls say they have a asthma and the dr is not giving them an inhaler but i don't get it if they have asthma then would'nt their doctor give them a inhaler i am going to my doctors soon to see if i have asthma should i say anything to these girls like they are lieing asthma is treated in different ways depending on how it presents in each patient my year old has asthma and presents with a chronic cough not wheezing so she does not have a 'standard' rescue inhaler she is on a daily medication regimen to help prevent asthma episodes but once they occur chronic cough begins there are additional meds we use which can include an inhaler that is used every hrs the difference is that using the inhaler will not stop her asthma episode after one use it's just another medicine in the arsenal to help get it under control if that doesn't work then we go to using a nebulizer every four hours and as a last resort the dr can prescribe a steroid which is pretty fast and effective i'd just leave these girls alone no use getting into it with them over their health when you can't know for sure one way or the other hope the dr visit is helpful for you Asthma Pneumonia Allergy Hay fever Lung cancer Homeopathy Chronic fatigue syndrome Medicine Duesberg hypothesis Diabetes mellitus Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cannabis (drug) Migraine Traditional Chinese medicine Common cold Influenza Propranolol Cystic fibrosis Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tuberculosis Medical cannabis General practitioner Mesothelioma Stomach cancer Drowning Eczema Tobacco smoking Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Route of administration Psoriasis Prostate cancer Acupuncture Cancer Sleep apnea First aid Gastroesophageal reflux disease Chemotherapy Epilepsy Anabolic steroid Antidepressant Radiation therapy Malaria Opioid Alternative medicine Controlled Substances Act Emphysema Multiple sclerosis Wheeze Aspergillosis Fecal incontinence Drug addiction Growth hormone treatment Publicly funded medicine Physician Rabies Addiction Bong Anorexia nervosa Pulmonary aspiration Hypoglycemia Fluticasone Breastfeeding Medical prescription Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Lupus erythematosus Aortic dissection Health issues and the effects of cannabis COX-2 inhibitor Natural Hygiene Stroke Hypertension Bone marrow transplant Traumatic brain injury Paget's disease of bone Methylsulfonylmethane Buprenorphine Clomipramine Hepatitis C Pulmonology Pulmonary hypertension Gout Nuclear medicine Legionellosis Bronchitis Insulin Acute respiratory distress syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phimosis Tocopherol ACE inhibitor
