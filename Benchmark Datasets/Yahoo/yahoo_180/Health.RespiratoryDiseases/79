what about the tb shot i have to get a tb shot tomorrow and i know i will have to go back hours later so it can be read i got mine when i was young but i don't remember much does it hurt what is the procedure like hi have you ever been hospitalized and given intravenous medications isn't it that before they give these meds especially penicillins they have to do skin testing to know if you are allergic to the drug this is the same procedure they do in tb shots or ppd purified protein derivative the inject the a tiny amount of the medication just underneath the skin later it becomes reddish and if a nodule will be formed they will measure the largest diameter of this to determine whether it is a positive or a negative result this can only be done after hours because some of the reactions are delayed and cannot be detected right away to be truthful its the most painful kind of injection more so than just plunging the needle in the muscles this is because the nerves for pain are located just underneath the skin and they are touched during the procedure don't worry it will just take a few seconds Allergy Prostate cancer Insulin Mantoux test Intravenous therapy Lumbar puncture Rheumatoid arthritis Local anesthesia Childbirth Pneumonia Multiple sclerosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Lethal injection Obstetrics Asthma Group A streptococcal infection Tuberculin Route of administration Cocaine Myocardial infarction Sleep apnea Breast cancer Tuberculosis Penicillin Hay fever Carpal tunnel syndrome First aid Needle aspiration biopsy Traumatic brain injury Tattoo Acne Anesthesia Amiodarone Polymerase chain reaction Penis Malignant melanoma Epidural Acupuncture Diabetes mellitus Breastfeeding Nuclear medicine Technetium Methylsulfonylmethane Cancer Stopping power Hypoglycemia Massage Gastroesophageal reflux disease Cardiac stress test Animal testing Botulin toxin Eczema Gastroparesis Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Ultraviolet Narcotic Paracetamol Chiropractic Psoriasis Syphilis Action potential Scar Immunosuppressive drug Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Medicine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ben Johnson (athlete) Malaria Gout 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Herpes simplex virus Narcolepsy HIV Diazepam Dialysis Enzyme Stroke Caffeine Thimerosal Coeliac disease Multiple chemical sensitivity Weight training Anthrax Atherosclerosis Growth hormone deficiency Chlorpromazine STS-62 Apollo 8 Spider Fecal incontinence
