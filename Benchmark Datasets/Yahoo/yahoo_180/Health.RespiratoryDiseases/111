is there a way to get asthma medication without health insurance when i was diagnosed with asthma while living in the us my doctor gave me a large box no joking of physician samples of the inhaled steroid he thought would work i obtained medication that way for four months basically it cost to get diagnosed and every two months to go back and get more meds i really don't know how much it would have cost otherwise likely far more the poster who mentioned wal mart's prescriptions is partly correct i have seen the list of medications available and unless you're on albuterol unit doses for a nebulizer then there isn't much there for you even then only gets you unit doses which is days at maximum dose there are no inhaled steroids or inhalers on that list unfortunately you will likely have to pay out of pocket for your asthma medication it's important for you to know that if you are prescribed an inhaled steroid it might be expensive and also be the backbone of your asthma control i've found that my albuterol salbutamol doesn't do as much to stop my coughing as my advair does since i started on advair month i've been in control and feeling good if you don't have much money and will have to pay out of pocket please inform your doctor of this instead of advair month you could get the same effect with albuterol and flovent at lower cost this doesn't work as well but much better than either alone for price dry powder inhalers dpis tend to be most expensive these are advair spiriva pulmicort symbicort flovent and there are a few others they tend to be long acting bronchodilators and inhaled steroids also being generally the newest drugs next most expensive are unit doses for nebulizers these are usually short acting bronchodilators and you would have to buy a nebulizer with air compressor to use them albuterol by unit dose usually runs about dose and you might have to take it x a day that can get pretty expensive fast drugs available by nebulizer are albuterol atrovent duoneb pulmicort xopenex and there are a few others the most inexpensive although still fairly expensive are metered dose inhalers mdis this is what is commonly called an inhaler they usually hold a hundred doses of medication each these are the most portable and normally don't require additional equipment to use drugs available this way are albuterol atrovent combivent like duoneb flovent and a variety of other inhaled steroids advair xopenex and there are many more this is probably the best and most cost effective way to get your medication there are a bunch of different inhaled steroids only available as mdis too far more than there are as dpis to make an mdi work more efficiently a holding chamber might be prescribed it's a plastic tube that holds the medication so that patient co ordination is less critical these cost about and are washable if i was without insurance and needed medication i would either continue to get physician samples like i did when i was in the us or i would try to get my medications as mdis for greatest economy and portability Health insurance Salbutamol Pharmaceutical company Publicly funded medicine Medical prescription Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Growth hormone treatment Folic acid Cannabis (drug) Prescription drug Common cold Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Drug addiction Migraine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cystic fibrosis Medicine Chronic fatigue syndrome Psoriasis Hay fever Homeopathy Canadian and American health care systems compared Clinical depression Insurance Medicare (United States) Bong Physician COX-2 inhibitor Medicare (Canada) Prostate cancer Ben Johnson (athlete) Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Multiple sclerosis Bipolar disorder Pneumonia Antipsychotic Alternative medicine Radiation therapy Intravenous therapy Animal testing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Growth hormone deficiency Candidiasis Rabies Obesity Internal ballistics General practitioner Endometriosis Paracetamol Malaria Carbon dioxide Welding Stomach cancer Microeconomics Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Rebreather Schizophrenia Tobacco smoking Duesberg hypothesis Drug abuse Cocaine Propranolol Health maintenance organization Psychiatry Maprotiline Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Illegal drug trade Arguments for and against drug prohibition Androgen insensitivity syndrome Food and Drug Administration Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tianeptine Acute respiratory distress syndrome Clinical trial Asbestos Economics Antidepressant Menstrual cycle Hydrogen sulfide Diazepam Health care in Canada Health care in the United States Gross domestic product Pharmacopoeia CPU design Epilepsy Allergy Diabetes mellitus
