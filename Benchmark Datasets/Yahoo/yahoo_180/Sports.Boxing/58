correct me if i'm wrong or just feel free to disagree floyd mayweather is a tailor made champion i personally think that floyd mayweather is probably pound for pound the most naturally gifted and skilled boxer in the world but i think he is a tailor made champion it seems to me that he will not fight anyone that he cannot dominate with speed the only opponet that he has gotten in the ring with that had his level of ability was zab judah if you follow judah you know that he has a preparation problem if he does not knock you out in the the first rounds he will gas out and lose and if you saw the fight you can argue that zab won of those six rounds he has not gotten in there with anyone who is a legitemate threat since no disprespect to de la hoya i love him but de la hoya of is not the de la hoya of when he was much quicker reckless and willing to force the issue now everyone was excited about a matchup with shane mosley shane will not be dominated by speed and poses a legitmate threat so i say the fight will never happen what do you think mayweather is definitely tailor made he has handpicked his opponents for the last few years gatti baldomir an aging oscar come on where is mosley where is margarito and now all the sudden floyd thinks he is gods gift to boxing and will only fight for money something he obviously can't get with margarito but he sure as sh t could with mosley so why won't he fight mosley the answer is an obvious one mayweather knows he will lose i love how mayweather fans always skirt that subject why won't floyd fight mosley Shane Mosley Floyd Mayweather Jr. Oscar de la Hoya Winky Wright Zab Judah Kostya Tszyu Antonio Margarito Genaro Hernandez John John Molina Bernard Hopkins Welterweight Javier Castillejo The Contender (television series) F__lix Trinidad Erik Morales Ivan Calder__n (boxer) Sugar Ray Robinson Floyd Patterson David Reid (boxer) H__ctor Camacho Mike Tyson Evander Holyfield Edwin Rosario Muhammad Ali Ricardo Mayorga Glen Jacobs Richie Sandoval Naseem Hamed Bob Arum Roy Jones Jr. Joe Louis Bobby Chacon 2005 United States Grand Prix Sonny Liston Jack Dempsey Kermit Cintron Jorge Paez Archie Moore Professional wrestling match types Paul Wight September 2004 in sports Yori Boy Campas Fernando Vargas Sugar Ray Leonard Dick Tiger Rafael Limon Livingstone Bramble Gameplay of StarCraft George Foreman Primo Carnera Kurt Angle Joey Maxim Rocky Marciano Carlos Zarate Carlos Palomino The Rumble in the Jungle Joe Frazier Azumah Nelson December 2004 in sports Willie Pep Samuel Serrano Emanuel Steward Yvon Durelle Playoff Mark Calaway Mixed martial arts Lightweight Bob Fitzsimmons Henry Armstrong John Mugabi Free will Piccolo Junior Saga Leon Spinks Jerry Quarry November 2004 in sports Marco Antonio Barrera Theory of conduct A.J.
