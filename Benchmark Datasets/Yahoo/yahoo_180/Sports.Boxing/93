do you remember your very st fist fight did you win have you gotten better since then my first fist fight was in the th grade i probably wasn't even pounds yet and the girl i fought was at least i admit she got me to the ground and sat on me but all she did was scratch and pinch i was the only one actually throwing punches i got to tell you i was a runt as a kid and fought all the time but back then few people carried guns and it was an old school trait to settle disputes with your fists i really was about a fighter and lost as many as i won i was always the kid who fought the bully and after a while i learned how to tuck my chin in behind my shoulder how to duck block counter punch and generally how to fight it is a skill like any other and if you do it enough you at least improve at it if not get better honestly i lost count of how many times i fought but as i got older i got better at it i averaged one fight per post while i was active in the military usually it was with the unit bully and after than i didn't have to fight any more people respected me the military is a lot like prison in that respect there are always bullies no matter where life takes you and i was always the one who stood up to them my first fight was so long ago that i don't remember it i must have been pre school aged and probably in diapers probably with one of my cousins Boxing Professional wrestling attacks Piccolo Junior Saga The Contender (television series) Martial art Joke Punch (strike) Professional wrestling match types Aerial (dance move) Vegeta Mixed martial arts Columbine High School massacre Dodgeball Tenshinhan Unreal The Marshall Mathers LP Muhammad Ali One Piece minor characters Akuma (Street Fighter) Terry Bogard F-16 Fighting Falcon Pitaten Wing Chun Lightsaber combat Tekken characters Geese Howard Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Professional wrestling aerial techniques Guilty Gear YuYu Hakusho Tai Chi Chuan Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Carnival of Champions Shawn Michaels Static (superhero) Salute Biff Tannen Mike Tyson Shen Gong Wu Sugar Ray Robinson Strike (attack) Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Kung Fu Hustle Fighting game Double Dragon Shoot boxing Suplex Eagle Claw Sub-Zero War of 1812 Australian rules football Ben Johnson (athlete) Diving Humphrey Bogart Jack Dempsey Judo Japanese tea ceremony The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Cowboy Bebop Indian Army Powerbomb Cody Travers The Rumble in the Jungle Bully Star Ocean: Till the End of Time Bruce Lee United States Marine Corps Kim Possible Baseball Tank The Fairly OddParents Saved by the Bell Waking the Dragons Time Out of Mind Ranma __ characters Springfield Elementary School Rocky Marciano Equine conformation Volleyball Sonny Liston Son Gohan Characters in Bleach series Curtiss P-40 Marty McFly E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
