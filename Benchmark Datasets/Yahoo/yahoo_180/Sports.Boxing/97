need a boxing routine i need some help with figuring out a boxing routine but the catch is that i dont have a heavy bag but i do have wraps jump rope and a place to do all this i plan on doing this for self defense and fitness all i ask is a routine thanx no heavy bag no prblem go to the army navy store get a duffle bag line in with heavy duty trash bags and fillit with play ground sand from home depot or you can try to find one on e bay a pawn shop or i got mine at a yard sell lb everlast perfect condition for bucks and here is a great routine work on combinations while one punch can be effective when they are delivered in vollies of two three four five or six they become devastating that is the theory behind combinations combinations take skill and stamina you expend a lot of energy punching away and only through conditioning will you be able to last a whole fight whether it is four rounds or twelve combinations require that you complete each punch correctly so that it sets you up for the next one for instance a jab will set you up for any number of punches a straight right puts your weight in the right position for a left hook combinations flow they are never awkward to perform as long as all the punches are performed in sequence and with technical precision that is your mission should you choose to accept it so what are the combinations well there are many but you will want to master the following again see fighting fit by doug werner and alan lachica for illustrations of these combination as well as over other photos or remember on the punches page each punch had a number beside it well here is where they come in handy to recap again reverse for southpaws jab straight right left hook left uppercut right uppercut so a is two jabs a is three jabs these combinations are an effective way to throw a bunch of punches from a distance it is imperative you recover completely after each jab so subsequent jabs are delivered effectively and accurately one of the most important and famous of all combinations the mighty in this you throw a jab which closes the distance and sets up the head for the power punch of the straight right delivered right after the objective with the jab is to snap your opponent's head back which exposes his chin which you then nail with the right sending him to the mat throughout the whole sequence you should feel firm on your feet never off balance if you do you're not doing something right it's one of two things you are either reaching for the opponent or not recovering completely from your punches both big no no's the other most important combination good english eh jab straight right left hook this basically completes the same objective for the first two punches jab the head to expose the chin nail the chin with the straight right this creates a weight transfer to the left side which automatically sets you up to land a devastating left hook your target for the left hook is the right temple of your opponent clobber it perfecting these two combinations will take some time but make sure you do they are all natural and like all combinations must flow you'll have a pretty good indication when you are doing them right because it will feel right not to mention the power of your punches will increase and the right left right and the opposite left right left the goal here is to time the weight shifts correctly with every punch you throw it should set you up nicely for the subsequent punch the right shifts the weight over the left which is perfect for the left hook which subsequently puts the weight back over the right which naturally makes you want to throw the right again the challenge here is to ensure you are not just throwing a flurry of arm punches you must get your body involved because that is where the power comes from then you will see true devastation as your opponent receives your offense from two different angles that's part of the beauty of combinations delivered correctly punches start hitting you from all different angles it makes defense that much harder the use of combinations while extremely effective also requires extreme caution it is easy to forget to recover after each punch when you send out the flock of arms but every time you don't recover you expose half your head and if your opponent realizes it kiss a few brain cells bye bye adding uppercuts into the mix word of advice get the four combinations mentioned above perfected first then worry about putting in the uppercuts uppercuts are used in close and you do need to work them into your combinations but adding them is very hard to do correctly and takes a great deal of time and precision and dedication to master when you are ready here is a six punch combination for you good luck with that heavy bag workout once you get one together the second workout is more strenuous as it takes rounds it's also more fun as you work some combinations there's nothing like unleashing or punches in a row that flow together nicely heavy bag workout harder workout with this workout go for speed power and coordination each punch must be fully recovered in order to set you up correctly for the next punch in the sequence if you have to start slow to get it right do it round double jab move around the bag and double jab rest minute round jab straight right rest minute round b jab head
