calzaghe kessler whos gonna win this and why i have been away for a few weeks but i see the brit bashing is still rife on the site in my absence the posters who jump on the bandwagon and say that calzaghe has fought nobody pretty much dont know their boxing he has fought or world champions or former world champions during his reign including eubank made or so defences of title woodhall reid both olympic medalists as well as world champs and lacy was supposed to walk through joe and im sick of everyone saying lacy was overrated he was apparently the second coming of tyson according to you american fight fans but as soon as he gets put in his place by a brit you just want to flood the internet with lame excuses i would agree that joe dont like to move outside of britain to fight but that is down to the fact that his purses are much bigger over here because he gets massive gates i think the crowd was at his last fight and who in america gets them crowds exactly nobody as for the fight i see this being a great match up between the two best super middleweights around i see calzaghe controlling the fight as i see him having the better boxing skills i was very impressed with kesslers skills in his fight against andrade but can he do the same against someone with joes talent my one fear in this fight though could be that calzaghe gets drawn into a war which he has been known to do throughout his career its not that joe cant slug because he can but my fear is that if he trys to trade with mikkel then he leaves himself open to injuring his hands again and i dont think that joe can beat kessler with one hand so i believe the way for calzaghe to fight would be too try and hand the younger kessler a boxing lesson as he did to lacy and this should see him victorious in my opinion Joe Calzaghe Boxing Muhammad Ali Michael Watson Mike Tyson Sugar Ray Robinson Eddie Guerrero Hulk Hogan Evander Holyfield Joe Louis Lennox Lewis The Contender (television series) Steve Collins Naseem Hamed Roy Jones Jr. Sports timeline Professional wrestling match types The Great American Bash International League Chris Benoit Anthony Mundine Norway national football team Calgary Flames Kurt Angle World Boxing Organization Michael Spinks G.I.
