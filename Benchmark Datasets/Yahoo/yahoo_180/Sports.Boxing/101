morales diaz fight will the fight be on regular hbo soon does anyone know if the fight that took place last week will air on regular hbo anytime soon i forgot to tape it it should be on already it is out here in los angeles but a friend of mine lives in the other part of town and he doesn't have it yet so i'm assuming that hbo is airing the fight in limited area's but they almost always air it to everyone a week later after a fight is done which would mean that it should be on hbo by Six Feet Under Home Box Office Peter Cook Sex and the City Marco Antonio Barrera Jeopardy!
