muhammad ali vs larry holmes in their primes who wins aiiight y'all to stonewall and others jimmy ellis was ali's sparring partner too and the two went so far back since they grew up together and ali whupped him good all holmes knew he learned from ali had they been in their primes holmes would not have had that knowledge and experience to benefit from for the sake of the question though holmes had arguably the greatest jab of any heavyweight but ali had far more numerous and superior skills speed agility accuracy intelligence power way underrated etc so given that ali would really emerge victorious over holmes w superior combinations hand foot speed etc holmes might get some rounds in but ali would deliver his usual masterful performance knowing holmes he would try to out psyche ali which would have failed miserably against the master if anything this would have so insulted ali that he would have made holmes pay for this like he did against patterson folley bonavena etc if ali had any weakness it was a susceptibility to left hooks which was not holmes' strong suit so ali takes it w a near shut out unanimous decision to paraphrase ali himself he wouldn't have gone for the kayo he woulda whupped him Muhammad Ali Larry Holmes Boxing Joe Frazier Ken Norton Floyd Patterson George Foreman Mike Tyson Rocky Marciano Joe Louis Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Punch (strike) The Contender (television series) Evander Holyfield Trevor Berbick Gerrie Coetzee Larry Holmes vs. Gerry Cooney The Rumble in the Jungle Michael Spinks Roy Jones Jr. Tony Tubbs New York Giants Paul Wight Succession to Muhammad Shawn Michaels Tenshinhan The Ark in Space Liberal Party (UK) Rugby union positions Ossie Ocasio Archie Moore Heavyweight Transformers: Cybertron Bob Foster Angelo Dundee Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fight of the Century Professional wrestling holds Jack Johnson (boxer) Ali Poker jargon Sugar Ray Robinson Mixed martial arts Laila Ali Muhammad Ali of Egypt Jerry Quarry Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. Jersey Joe Walcott Ingemar Johansson H__ctor Camacho John Holmes (actor) Muslim League Los Angeles Kings Wild ARMs 2 Paul Morphy Speed of light Gerry Cooney First English Civil War Same-sex marriage in Canada Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Items in the Metroid series Pittsburgh Steelers Wilfred Rhodes Charley Goldman Satchel Paige ATI Technologies Somalia Battle of Gettysburg Sherlock Holmes Big Brother (USA TV series) One Tree Hill (TV series) Muhammad Ali's seizure of power Aikido Hasim Rahman Chris Benoit Team Fortress Classic November 2004 in sports Pete Rademacher Dream Job (Season 2) RuneScape weapons Sydney Riot of 1879 Mark Calaway Mystique (comics) George Chuvalo ESPN25 Chris Byrd Ernie Terrell Tim Witherspoon U.S. presidential election, 2000 Muhammad Iqbal Cleveland Williams Indianapolis 500 B__b Ric Flair Greg Norman The Five Doctors
