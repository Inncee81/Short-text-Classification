how do i get in shape to train with a professional athlete i am about to get the chance of training with a world class boxer and i just want to know how to get in good enough shape to be honest if i had my way i would be in the same shape he is in i am sure that if he thinks i suck or am not good enough he wont really want to train with me i just want to know what kind of workout regimen do pro athletes follow i know it's not likely but i want to get in incredible shape in weeks and am willing to do basically anything to get there to be honest i would only be concerned with my stamina if i were you conditioning is the key here you can't train learn anything if you aren't even in shape to go through the reps needed to get to or come close to that pro's level in any sport so i feel conditioning stamina is the key get up early and get your miles in dude then go to the gym and do punch outs hit the heavy bag as many times as you can in under a minute then do it again and again so your arms won't get heavy when he comes in b c i'm sure he's not going to hold back the last thing you want to do is be barely hold your own because you are tired so you might as well torture yourself now i would say get your miles in hit the j ropes etc get your normal bag work in etc add in the punch outs to go ahead and prepare yourself in case you have to slug it out from time to time mentally you'll already be there from your training so it won't be a big deal weeks is enough time eat right drink your water etc Boxing The Contender (television series) Weight training Baseball Triathlon Mixed martial arts Muay Thai Boxing training Hulk Hogan Muhammad Ali Equine conformation 1957 World Series Poker jargon Scientology beliefs and practices Professional wrestling match types Reggie Jackson Tris Speaker Final Fantasy magic Ben Johnson (athlete) The Rumble in the Jungle Professional wrestling Sin City Norway national football team Professional wrestling slang Eventing Alexander Technique Martial art Water polo Batting average Professional wrestling attacks GunBound Sailing Naruto jutsu Ty Cobb Indianapolis 500 Lance Armstrong Tenshinhan Andr__s Galarraga Kurt Angle Theory of conduct Drowning Urinary incontinence Pete Rose Anchor Mick Foley Tennis National Football League Trish Stratus History of baseball in the United States Sport rowing Royal Marines Aikido Drag racing Paragliding 1986 World Series Leon White Dyslexia Computer New York Giants Tank Athletics Shawn Michaels Diving Extreme Championship Wrestling Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME YuYu Hakusho Satchel Paige Sugar Ray Leonard Storyteller System Japanese tea ceremony Alan Arnett McLeod World Series King Piccolo Saga Dog training Dog agility Mario Pok__mon types American football Montreal Screwjob Seabiscuit USS Wasp (CV-7) Glossary of climbing terms Team Fortress Classic The Marshall Mathers LP Piccolo Junior Saga Kitesurfing Humphrey Bogart San Francisco Giants Glossary of wildland fire terms Fast bowling Professional wrestling holds Bob Fitzsimmons Anatoly Karpov Firearm Democratic Party (United States)
