rocky marciano what if marciano had not retired after suffering his first real knockdown against moore but still wining the fight how would he have fared against the likes of floyd patterson muhammad ali and sonny liston do you think he would have won those fights or do you think he would have gone out worse of like two old pass their primes louis and moore did against the younger marciano if marciano was so good do you think he would have done well in his older years still fighting like louis and moore did or was he not that good enough stonewall jackson you are the idiot my friend you obviously don't know shit about boxing so go play with yourself in your room little child this is a question for people who know the sport of boxing and the sweet science behind it you are a complete fucking moron kid not only did marciano retire to early but fighting a way past his peak moore doesn't prove shit but that he can beat an old great just like every other young decent boxer could you are so fucking retarded buddy marciano was good but he wasn't great for he never proved shit against a great at his peak or even remotly close like ali for instance over and over ali proved how good he was he even beat liston when liston was still fresh get over yourself marciano isn't being picked on little child he is just being reviewed as a mis understood scared ass who wanted to make a few bucks in the boxing world but not run into any real danger fact now beat it loser great answer big e it seems like you are the only one to answer my question the way it should have been answered so far great job bro it's good to see that there are still some people who have common sense and the audacity to keep their composure and not get all bent over a question being aired online if anyone doesn't like it then why answer it i didn't ask for all these nut hanging marciano fans to come onto this question just to spit how much there asses hurt because they think it's offensive lol i am a marciano fan but do i get offended by what i see as a fact no thanks again simply put marciano was a decent fighter but by no means would i call him a great fighter he retired without putting a chapter of fighting a young and up and rising star like patterson in his book because patterson was young and eager marciano never fought a young eager fighter who was there to win and had the skill patterson's camp actually wanted a fight with marciano according to d'amoto even though marciano didn't fare to well against most of the heavyweights at that time ali liston ect he though he would do great against marciano marciano used somewhat of a peek a boo style if that's what you want to call what marciano was doing but patterson did it better with marciano being a tad bit shorter than patterson marciano would have quit a bit of trouble patterson stated that he liked to fight boxer his height or shorter because it suited him best for his style although i do see marciano beating patterson i don't see him beating him bad like everyone predicts or thinks have common sense you idiots patterson was a great boxer who utilized his style to his best and if d'amoto believed he had a chance against marciano then he did basically if marciano didn't take patterson out early then don't expect him to do it late patterson needs to jump on marciano early but if he decides to fall of his game plan and fight marciano's fight then expect him to get knocked the fuck out marciano vs patterson in my eyes could go either way now marciano vs liston lmfao not a chance i see this fight going the same way marciano put the ol mongoose out if liston doesn't knock marciano out cold early he will knock him down constantly liston had a powerful awkward right hand that came out of weird angles but he was accurate with it marciano would be eating those up all night because he lacked general defense if not by far some of the worse defense i have ever seen in a heavy liston vs marciano has bad news written all over it and i just don't see marciano surviving same thing with ali vs marciano a computer fight doesn't prove shit but that there are still stereotypes out there who think marciano is the greatest of all time he isn't or he would have came out of retirement to face ali for real the fact was my friend is that marciano didn't want to because he knew ali would hand him his ass marciano was too damn slow on his feet and ali was just too damn fast on his faster going backwards than marciano coming forward that jab would wear marciano down to a frustrated marciano who will eventually be throwing wild hay makers that wont even come close to hitting ali in a dangerous spot leaving himself open constantly and dragging himself marciano would become an easy and open target for ali to destroy although i don't see ali beating marciano like liston would ali for sure would beat marciano hands down marciano was good but he retired before he proved himself maybe if he would have fought patterson liston and ali and even if he didn't win he would have still gained allot more respect that means something he could have went on knowing that he fought some of the greats when they were still great i think that's what makes a fighter great marciano to tell you the truth wouldn't fare to well against any of the 's fighters including an 's iron mike i'd hate to see what foreman and mike would do to marciano lol can you imagine his face after a fight with these men bloody and swollen lol most likely some broken bones as well Poker jargon New York Giants Shaggy dog
