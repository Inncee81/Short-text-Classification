why did lil' kim's naked truth album get a mic rating from the source see that's why i think the source is dirty lil' kim's album was great to me it was her best album but it wasn't a classic it should've just gotten mics the album also got mixed reviews from other critics that album didn't deserve mics although she's now the st female artist to get a mic rating i think lauryn hill's miseducation album should of gotten mics before this anyone agree that lil' kim' naked truth album didn't deserve mics yeah cmack there were rumors saying that she did that plus she was dating someone who worked the source at the time too i also heard that jay z bought mics for his blueprint album but probably just a rumor hahaha brianmt at the time of its release it was the first album in three years to receive a rating of mics from hip hop magazine the source however this was believed to be because one of the owners of source was dating kim's manager damn i thought kim would've suck his dick herself i guess she does have some kind of decency Hip hop rivalries The Source (magazine) Lil' Kim Nas (rapper) Hip hop collaborations Benzino Usher (entertainer) Alternative hip hop Eminem Missy Elliott Lauryn Hill Lil Jon The Notorious B.I.G.
