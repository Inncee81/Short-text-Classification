can you answer a question on thighs please hi basically two weeks ago i went on a diet i had no chocolate sweets or any crap like that i eat plenty of pasta salads and drank water only i exercised everyday i either cycled for miles played tennis for a couple of hours or did dancing sometimes all three but now my muscles on my thighs have gone all err muscly i need to lose this because i hate it can anyone give me any tips on how to do this and what did i do wrong in the first place i made sure i stretched which is what i needed to do to prevent muscle build up thanks there is no amount of stretching to stop you from building muscle under those conditions first you have to have a goal in order to understand which steps to take to achieve it a lot of information goes into how your body works and what you need to do to do to maintain or change that like how old are you how tall are you how much to you weigh what is your bmi what is the reason for your new exercise and diet regimen what is your goal weight physique and do you have a healthy body image depending on what you're doing how intensely and how often determines how your body reacts the type of exercise determines how your body builds muscle cycling tennis and dancing all build with an emphasis on lower body muscles and and even though i'm not sure of your intensity on each exercise it is a lot especially if you don't like muscular legs basically you overworked your body and your body built muscle to supply the demand you put on it you have to revise your way of thinking and figure out if you have a healthy body image what you look like and weigh now what you want to look like realistically and why make sure it's a healthy physique and not the latest magazine tabloid fad you're trying to keep up with then you incorporate a clean healthy diet eating plan which mean all foods drinks consumed not a diet but a lifestyle most importantly stop over exercising overexercising is usually found to be paired with starving or highly restrictive diets or purging anorexia bulimia other eating disorders which i can assure you is not healthy of mind nor body by any means my advice to you is to cut back on the exercise plan you have dramatically unless of course that is your field of training as an athlete or you want to keep building muscle read my post and answer these questions honestly not to be posted but to yourself and understand you need to revise your exercise regimen and why without knowing your vital stats and body composition it's difficult for me to say how much exercise your body needs and what your long term goal is but i'm going along with the fact you said you hate having muscular legs and want to lose a bit so for starters knowing every day of intense exercising is way too much try a or days a week plan alternating with an exercise day and then taking the day after off for rest try to choose only one exercise per day with a time distance limit and working out only once for the day for example instead of cycling which has an emphasis on building lower body muscles try a workout day of either walking swimming or tennis for only minutes you can even combine walking for min with swimming for min for one workout and you're done then take the next day off the following day switch it up and choose one of the other workouts for the set time keep alternating workout days and rest days off you can switch your choice of exercise for change of pace and to avoid boredom stretch before and after working out Exercise Atkins Nutritional Approach Bodybuilding Triathlon Marathon (sport) Swimming Breastfeeding Equine conformation Obesity Urinary incontinence Cancer Nutrition Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Scientology beliefs and practices Clinical depression Hypoglycemia Veganism Water Physical attractiveness Strap-on dildo Dairy Running Human height Extreme Programming Expert system Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fast bowling Insulin Adjustable gastric band Weight loss Sleep Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Baseball Medicine Diving Insomnia Stuttering Aerial (dance move) Fancy rat Gray Wolf Tooth Theory of conduct Eating disorder Tai Chi Chuan Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Chocolate Alexander Technique Hamster Bulimia nervosa Skateboarding trick Folic acid Social rule Carpal tunnel syndrome Paget's disease of bone Tennis Iliotibial band syndrome Chinese martial arts Infantilism Bread Albatross Labor theory of value Japanese tea ceremony Elephant Diabetes mellitus Low-carbohydrate diet Breaststroke Body image Massage Ra (board game) Coronary heart disease Electrophysiology Alcoholics Anonymous Word of Wisdom Volleyball Microeconomics Antarctic krill Professional wrestling holds Glossary of graph theory Menstrual cup Simone Weil Anchor Mixed martial arts Scuba set Heart rate
