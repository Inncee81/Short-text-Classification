how can i stop this since my last physical a year ago i gained seven pounds i'm afraid i have an eating disorder of bingeing i eat and eat and eat and i cant stop when i get started sometimes when i'm home watching my sister i'll eat everything i can find and usually it's unhealthy food how can i control this bingeing if you're unsure you can search eating disorder tests or something online and see if it's a possibility but by the sound of gaining nly lbs in an entire year i would guess your eating habits might be due to being bored or nervous or something usually if you're bored or not really active your appetite seems to increase and you crave more as for controlling it you would probably find a variety of methods by googling it etc and try things out also look at controlling cravings if you just stop for a minute to think everything over you can probably at least reduce the amount you eat try counting to drink water eat something healthy instead don't eat in front of the tv or pc you eat more and dont realize it when you do this there's plenty of options out there experiment Binge eating disorder Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Super Size Me Obesity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypoglycemia Addiction Weight loss Nutrition Food Veganism Cocaine Alcoholics Anonymous Alcoholism Anxiety Insulin Urinary incontinence Folic acid Piccolo Junior Saga Drug addiction Stomach cancer Bulimia nervosa Coeliac disease Eating disorder Chlorpromazine Borderline personality disorder Password Chronic fatigue syndrome Stuttering Vampire Gastroparesis Spider Mixed martial arts Friends Halitosis Appetite Psychosis Breastfeeding Clinical depression Diabetes mellitus Singlish Tooth enamel Methcathinone Dead Like Me Doxepin Tooth Tobacco smoking Escherichia coli O157:H7 Fast food EastEnders Guinea pig Hiccup Panic attack Hyperglycemia Dog Fibromyalgia Sleep apnea Omega-3 fatty acid Post-traumatic stress disorder Health insurance Coffee Fecal incontinence Milton H.
