i need something to do on the treadmilll i desperatly need this excercise and i need to have something to occupy me not just by walking i need something to do that is fun to make the time go by just a bit quicker do you have any ideas for me to do to occupy me on the treadmill i'd suggest considering walking outside as opposed to the treadmill when practical but when the weather or other distractions do not permit this here are a few ideas try the programs built into the treadmill they change the incline or speed and add variety to your workouts you may also consider wearing a heart rate monitor you can keep track of your heart rate while going different speeds or intensities and it keeps your mind occupied break the time into more manageable segments instead of thinking about walking for an hour warm up for minutes then gradually increase the speed or incline every minute or two then return to your starting speed repeat this process over a few times anything to keep your mind occupied and off the clock Heart rate Myocardial infarction Weight training CPU design Milton H.
