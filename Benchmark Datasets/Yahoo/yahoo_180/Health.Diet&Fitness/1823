will water help you lose weight i've heard many times that drinking a lot of water will help you lose weight i don't want to lose a lot just get rid of some fat i'm thinking about lbs and i know this may take a while but any good advice you all have is appreciated thanks weight loss facts low fat foods don't work you cannot lose weight using low fat diets low fat foods have been popular for more than years but yet our society is getting more overweight as each year passes this fact alone should tell you that eating a purely low fat menu is not the answer to losing weight low calorie diets don't work you won't lose weight using a low calorie dieting plan either in fact eating low calories is the worst thing that you can do to your body since that will only slow down your body's fat burning engine and ruin all chances of losing weight low calorie diets may allow a few pounds of weight loss for the first few days but then after that all weight loss comes to a halt known as a dieting plateau you can never get slim by starving yourself low carb plans don't work you'll probably find it extremely difficult to get slim using a low carb dieting plan low carb diets have recently become popular over the last couple years but the problem with low carb menus is that they are too strict and too hard to follow for average people low carb menus tend to rob your body of too much energy carbohydrates and make it nearly impossible to remain on the program for very long this is why so many dieters find it difficult to follow a strict low carbohydrate menu what about weight watchers and jenny craig dieting plans weight loss programs such as weight watchers and jenny craig usually involve slower dieting progress over a longer period of time since such programs generally promise only pounds of weight loss per week also programs such as jenny craig usually involve buying special meals and or dietary supplements during the initial phases of the program while some people may like these types of dietary programs we prefer a dieting plan which focuses on faster weight loss such as the accelerated fat burning program shown below Obesity South Beach diet Weight training Weight Watchers Super Size Me Nutrition Vegetarianism Bodybuilding Milk Adjustable gastric band Calorie restriction Little Britain Healthy eating Breastfeeding Prostate cancer Glycemic index Zone diet Dietary fiber Omega-3 fatty acid Food Carburetor Ramen Calorie Stomach cancer Binge eating disorder Cancer Folic acid Slim Fast Hyperglycemia Coeliac disease Hamburger Garfield Tocopherol Weight loss Hypoglycemia Protein-energy malnutrition Explosive material Fecal incontinence Crohn's disease Urinary incontinence Alcoholic beverage Hypercholesterolemia Fasting Internal ballistics Protein Carbohydrate McDonald's Vitamin Vitamin C Egg (food) Trans fat Nuclear weapon design Tank Coronary heart disease Raw food diet In-N-Out Burger Social rule Space Shuttle program Bread Hypertension Brown Bear Chocolate Hamster Inflation Equine conformation Coffee Alzheimer's disease Battery electric vehicle Glycogen storage disease type I Microeconomics Burma Campaign Fat Jet engine Soft drink Acorn Osteoarthritis Body type (exercise) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diabetes mellitus Insulin Economy of Russia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Glucose Robert Falcon Scott Hydrogen economy Ton Scramjet Dietitian Sleep Carbon dioxide
