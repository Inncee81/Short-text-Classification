how long will it be before i see or notice any results when taking a sea kelp supplement i'm taking one mcg sea kelp supplement tablet a day and was wondering if anyone else has taken it and when they saw results of any kind well that depends on a lot of things first of all what are you taking it for that you want to see results from kelp is a really good source of extra iodine in your diet and mcg of iodine is the general rda i assume the mcg on the bottle is the measurement of iodine that comes from the kelp not the kelp itself if it is the actual kelp you need to find a different company to buy from however if you don't need extra iodine it can do more harm than good that being said iodine is really good for thyroid health and kelp is also rich in b vitamins minerals and trace elements a lot of people have a deficiency of iodine because it's not in most foods and a lot of people don't have much salt in their diets because they haven't taken care of themselves as well as they should have high blood pressure for example Iodine Tocopherol Folic acid Edible salt Thyroid Veganism Vitamin C Nutrition Vitamin D Milk Vegetarian nutrition Bladder wrack Cyanocobalamin Antioxidant Egg (food) Vitamin Zinc Omega-3 fatty acid Potassium iodide Ionizing radiation Malnutrition Dietary mineral Sodium chloride Dietary fiber Thyroid hormone Coeliac disease Dietary supplement Dieting Radioactive contamination Water purification Prostate cancer Protein-energy malnutrition Kelp Cretinism Vegetarianism Breastfeeding Coronary heart disease Tlingit Hyperthyroidism Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Marmite Ultraviolet Anchor Cancer Pet skunk Food Hamster Alzheimer's disease Sea salt Fecal incontinence Sea Otter Golden rice Iron Hypertension Domestic rabbit Chernobyl accident Raw food diet Marine aquarium Aortic dissection Retinol Hypoglycemia Mental retardation Chronic fatigue syndrome Guinea pig Scurvy Soybean Riboflavin Endocrinology Magnesium Acne Halogen Anemia Congenital hypothyroidism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Starch Radiation poisoning Coca-Cola Flatulence Diabetes mellitus Rickets Kelp forest Protein Computed tomography Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Atkins Nutritional Approach Thyroid cancer Cyanide Bodybuilding Alkane Osteoporosis Genetically modified food Explosive material Theory of conduct Human height Paget's disease of bone Medical prescription Colorectal cancer
