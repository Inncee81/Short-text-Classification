am i really that fat here is a picture of me latley i have felt very large be honest am i you can't tell very well i excircise and eat healthy why won't i lose weight http xa xanga com bbd b t jpg ok that picture is really small so here is a bigger onehttp photo xanga com pupkrazee a bb photo html tell the truth heres another picture http x xanga com d a b jpg wow you are beautiful how old are you you cant be more than and i am being honest some of the most attractive women i have ever met were a little bigger but they were so happy fun and energetic people loved being around them i think queen latifa is one of the most beautiful women in show biz and i think she looks better a little bigger you are not petite but be glad because i am and you would not beleive how much fat i have on my body probably more than you but i don't look bigger than you your size and weight depend on a couple different things and some of these are gonna sound a little strange but i am not making this up your salt intake in your diet salt makes you retain water i had to lose two pounds over night so i had no salt drank water and only ate a grilled skinless chicken breast for my dinner that night and the next day suprise i also lost an inch and a half around my waist of course i ate breakfast after i weighed in number two that time of the month nuff said how much muscle to fat do you really have if your muscles are toned and you have a larger frame you are going to be larger and weigh a little more than if you didn't exercise but you get the added health benefit for the heart you may never be that tall and slinder woman you see on the magazine but i guarantee you will probably be happier in your life than she will ever be bone densitity and long thick hair this one sounds kinda silly but the fact is some of us have stronger bones which means less fractures and breaks with faster healing but also means a couple more pounds than our weaker counter part the hair is something few people think of but if you do have a thicker hair it weighs more and shows up on your scale if your hair is half way down your back it will also show my hair was down to my butt it is a baby fine hair and then i cut it to my ears about inches of hair was cut and i threw it on the scale it weighed over a pound and a half and it is very thin and wispy your hair might be the thick and weightier kind be a lot shorter and still weigh over a pound well these are just things i hope you think of next time you step on the scale everyone is different and there is a difference between taking care of yourself and obsessing over something about yourself or ignoring something about yourself obsessing about your weight can be a dangerous thing that can lead to mental problems get it out of your head that your size determines who will like you or be your friend i have seen too many beautiful woman dwell on the pictures of the famous and become miserable because they couldn't get smaller than a size some women have big hipps or that big booty in my case lol also don't ignore your weight or stop exercising if you stop exercising you may lose weight but you will gain fat muscle is heavier than fat and if you lose it you may not lose size but your weight will go down it can be deceptive so don't buy into it be the person you are on the inside and if she is beeutiful everyone else will see it too trust me and i hope this wasn't too long Dieting Weight training Equine conformation Milk Obesity Breastfeeding Atkins Nutritional Approach Anorexia nervosa Urinary incontinence Wood Hamster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Puberty Shaggy dog story Super Size Me Jon Secada Guinea pig The Ashlee Simpson Show Humphrey Bogart Social rule Bodybuilding The Contender (television series) Little Britain Hair Marilyn Monroe Dragon Booster Swimming EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Drill bit Vegeta Brassiere Friends Marathon (sport) Muscle Violin The Amber Spyglass Ramen Poker jargon Characters in the Smurfs Adjustable gastric band Theory of conduct Insulin Bread Dog Skin Binge eating disorder Meat Loaf Love and Theft Fancy rat Oasis (band) Prostate cancer Phoebe Buffay's songs Shen Gong Wu The Time Machine Time Out of Mind Nicomachean Ethics Ron and Fez Babe Ruth Egg (food) Menstrual cup Coffee Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Elephant Tightlacing Mass Childbirth Pitaten Empire Burlesque Piano Textile manufacturing Tyrannosaurus rex Hamburger AFI 100 Years series Protein Homer Simpson Nuclear weapon design Shark Characters of The Sandman The Emancipation of Mimi Current teachings of Prem Rawat Japanese tea ceremony 613 mitzvot Internal ballistics Queen (band)
