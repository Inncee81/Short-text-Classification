physical i only think girls would know this answer so i'm i still go to a pediatrician but i have a 'female problem' am i suppose to ask her will she know about it if not who should i see i'm pretty sure your pediatrician would know about any female problem you might have at least in theory but still it would be better for you to seek the advice of a gynecologist i have a family doctor which is good for yearly check ups school athletic physical evaluations colds and immunizations and to serve as triage to direct you to the right specialist then i have a gynecologist then i have a dermatologist one day i was doing a yearly check up with my family doctor and he asked me if i wanted him to do a routine pap smear and i said yes because then i would not have to schedule an appointment with my gynecologist it was a big mistake first the exam was painful because a family doctor does not do that all day long like a gynecologist and second he could not be sure of what he saw since he does not have the expertise so he still referred me to the gynecologist for a second opinion so at the end i still had to go to the gynecologist and repeat the exam which was so much smoother and gentle and painless since gynecologists do that all day long and get good at it a family doctor or a pediatrician will just finally refer you to a specialist so as to cover their behinds because they really don't know what they're doing and they have huge medical insurance malpractice premiums to think about just go directly to the source the gynecologist who will be a master or mistress at making you feel comfortable with no pain and will be able to answer any question you may have Gynaecology Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Publicly funded medicine Insurance Obstetrics Cancer Education in the United States Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medical malpractice Physician Science Pediatrics Chiropractic Psoriasis Phimosis Dermatology Medical record Childbirth Expert system Theory of conduct Endometrial cancer Scientology beliefs and practices Peer review Breastfeeding Physical examination Philosophy of mind Education in Romania Acne Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male A Course In Miracles Plame affair Actuary Hikikomori U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Transsexuality Midwifery Alexander Technique Ethics Terri Schiavo Doctor Bogdanov Affair Fibromyalgia Triage Milton H.
