is it bad to eat less than a calories a day i have been eating less than a calories for a while now but its not to loose weight im just not hungry anymore is this damaging my metabolism in any way im not trying to starve myself i know better i do play alot of sports and im ' and punds im if age is needed if you're not hungry you're not hungry don't force yourself to eat it's just your body telling you that it needs less food it may be that you are in need of 'detoxing' and your body is letting you know if you eat less less energy will be taken up by the digestive process and your body will focus that energy on other things like healing don't worry you'll eat more again when you're hungry your metabolism will be lowered as a result though and so you will find it easier to gain weight just as soon as you start to eat more just eat healthily and sensibly to prevent this from happening lots of fresh fruit and veggies and wholemeal foods not snacks and processed foods several recent studies have shown that people who eat less live longer so you could be doing yourself a favour in the long run just as long as the food that you are eating is good and healthy and nutricious if you want to loose weight you could try the 'zig zag method' whereby you eat low calory for three days then have one day of eating more this 'fools' your body into going into 'starvation mode' and keeps your metabolism high Dieting Nutrition Atkins Nutritional Approach Obesity Anorexia nervosa Low-carbohydrate diet Super Size Me Milk Calorie restriction Folic acid Fasting Domestic rabbit Binge eating disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Veganism Tooth Tocopherol Raw food diet Insulin Fecal incontinence Food South Beach diet Glycogen storage disease type I Sleep Eating Famine Snack food Weight loss Adjustable gastric band Breastfeeding Vitamin C Hunger Glycemic index Vomiting Life extension Hydrogen sulfide Garfield Stomach cancer Hyperglycemia Tlingit Swimming Polychlorinated biphenyl Social rule Little Britain Banana Natural Hygiene Tomato Colorectal cancer Calorie The Den (television) Food guide pyramid Bacteria Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Watermelon Snake Vegetarianism Equine conformation Starvation Diabetes mellitus Potassium Glucose Frugivore Bread Growth hormone treatment Aspartame Ton Foodborne illness Thermoregulation Burger King Spider Coeliac disease Enzyme Fat Gastric bypass surgery Explosive material One Piece minor characters Organic farming Organic food Antarctic krill Hamburger Brewery Water Carbon dioxide Fugu Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ayurveda Caterpillar Carburetor Hamster Protein Survival skills
