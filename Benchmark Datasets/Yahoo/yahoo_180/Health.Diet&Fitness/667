i am ' and lbs help any advice i just had a baby about months ago the first lb just fell off of me the first months but the rest of thus weight won't come off any advice i look like a bubble give yourself some credit and some time you did just have a child the best range to lose weight in is to lbs a week this will allow your body to accustom itself to the loss and the skin to regain its prestretched stage losing weight too quickly will cause the skin of abdomen chest and inner thighs to sag possibly dramatically i don t personally believe in any of the fad diets that keep showing up i think that they put your body into an unhealthy famine mode which will cause you to gain the fat right back if you start to eat normally again the best idea is to eliminate all junk food you can do a cheat day if you need to but don t go overboard eat balanced meals of reasonable size overeating will cause your stomach to be too large and you will still feel hungry when you re not also have lots of healthy snacks during the day ideally you ll want to eat or small meals throughout the day carry food with you so you aren t tempted to eat unhealthily when you re out of the house and don t buy unhealthy foods get foods that are low in bad fats we do need fat to survive but not saturated fat minimize the processed flours and sugars no white bread no sugar choose leaner meats and protein sources don t expect to eat pizza and burritos all the time and lose weight and eat tons of vegetables eat salads steamed vegetables and raw vegetables too you can t eat so much celery that you ll get fat don t eat too much fruit or things containing high fructose corn syrup the reason is that fructose is hard on the liver because it can only be metabolized there you can eat fruit during or after a workout don t eat late at night because your body will turn it into fat eat a smaller amount of calories than needed to maintain your weight you have burn more than you intake always exercise cardio especially but weights are good too don t give up you ll be glad you chose to lose the weight Obesity Low-carbohydrate diet Food Bodybuilding Weight training Nutrition Veganism Milk Hamster Super Size Me Folic acid Hypoglycemia Vegetarianism Healthy eating Tocopherol Stomach cancer South Beach diet Cuisine of Denmark Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fasting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vitamin C Bread Binge eating disorder Sugar Anorexia nervosa Tofu Omega-3 fatty acid Fecal incontinence 613 mitzvot Food preservation German cuisine Insulin Adjustable gastric band Equine conformation Cheese Guinea pig Hamburger Glycogen storage disease type I Chocolate Japanese cuisine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cuisine of the Southern United States Acorn Trans fat Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Domesticated turkey Raw food diet Cuisine of the Philippines Fat Colorectal cancer French cuisine Glucokinase Food guide pyramid Korean cuisine Tooth Fugu Puberty Protein-energy malnutrition Dietary fiber Prostate cancer Junk food MRE Ice cream Protein Diabetes mellitus Cuisine of Brazil Chinese cuisine Sugar substitute Soul food Weight loss Alcoholic beverage Comanche Chicken Fructose Foodborne illness Glycemic index Cuisine of Malaysia Maize Korban Meal Soy protein Tomato Little Britain Watermelon Vegetarian cuisine Pizza Calorie restriction Cuisine of Singapore
