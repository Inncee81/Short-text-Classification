has anyone ever fasted for any reason if so why did you do it how much weight did u loose did you gain it back normally later did your metabolism speed up again was it easy to stick to jw i did a water fast once it sucked doing it longer than three days is dangerous because after that many hours of not consuming protien your body starts eating away at ur muscles and you need muscles to lose weight plus ur depriving ur body of nutrition your metabolism will slow within a to day range about its different for every person it will speed up eventually i guess but it would take awhile to break a fast your suppose to consume only veggetables for the next several days following the end of ur fast if you've never fasted before dont do the water fast your body will defeat your own will power and make you gorge on food if you really wanna do a fast do a milk fast where you only drink milk and water or a fruit fast drink water tea and consume three fruits throughout your day you lose weight fast i lost two pounds a day but it does just come right back the weight you lose is about percent water maybe percent muscle and percent fat so its useless to depend on fasts for permanent weight loss i did one for a couple of days to kick start my diet to kill cravings for high carb sugary and fattening foods it worked too because after a fast just about anything with sugar like fruit is like a candy bar fasts are good for kick starting healthy diets but thats about it a lil extended note if you wanna lose weight fast without slowing down ur metabolism you could do a switch off thing i made up one day you consume calories and then the next day you consume calories then u consume calories the day after that and then back down to calories after that just keep going back and forth the food u eat needs to be mostly healthy of course Atkins Nutritional Approach Low-carbohydrate diet Breastfeeding Obesity Milk Weight training Fasting Nutrition Food Hypoglycemia Alcoholic beverage Veganism Chocolate Bodybuilding Anorexia nervosa Diabetes mellitus Dietary fiber Breakfast Yoghurt Swimming Sugar Protein Trans fat Vegetarianism Junk food Soft drink Omega-3 fatty acid Tocopherol Folic acid Fecal incontinence Aspartame Organic food Egg (food) Calorie Kit Kat Acorn Insulin MyPyramid Fast food Caffeine Protein-energy malnutrition Hyperglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Energy Coeliac disease Food guide pyramid Binge eating disorder Carbohydrate Adjustable gastric band Dairy Equine conformation Vitamin C Hamburger Cat Sleep Bread Cocaine Fat Muscle Prostate cancer Potassium Glycogen storage disease type I Swingout Pig (zodiac) Body type (exercise) Fast bowling Orders of magnitude (energy) Gray Wolf Fugu Foodborne illness McDonald's Elephant Breaststroke Domestic rabbit Water Slim Fast Tyrannosaurus rex Raw food diet Guinea pig Alcoholism Fancy rat In-N-Out Burger Agriculture Ice cream Zone diet
