i am kilograms and i feel quite fat do i need to lose weight to a very high degree you should weigh as much as you feel happy with weighing as far as a healthy weight that's what most of the other posts are about calculating your bmi diet plans etc but most people will say what the average is according to different opinions as long as you are at a weight where you are healthy the most important part is that you are happy with your weight not that you should be x pounds but that no matter what you weigh you are happy with that instead of striving to be a size or something like that that being said if you want to lose weight exercise is a really good and safe way to lose weight in addition to that i would recommend meeting with a nutritionist or dietitian to see if there is something else that may benefit you more Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Obesity Body mass index Weight Weight training Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Binge eating disorder Super Size Me Tocopherol Anorexia nervosa Breastfeeding Weight loss Raw food diet Bodybuilding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Weighing scale Veganism South Beach diet Nutrition Omega-3 fatty acid Human height Dietitian Pound Calorie Prostate cancer Guinea pig Low-carbohydrate diet Protein Trans fat United States Postal Service Folic acid Milk Kilogram Healthy eating Physical attractiveness Exercise Utilitarianism Weight Watchers Vitamin C Egg (food) Cystic fibrosis Terri Schiavo Clinical depression Mass Hypertension Coronary heart disease Vegetarianism Food guide pyramid Ton Chocolate Hamster Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Specific impulse U.S. customary units Great White Shark Coeliac disease Diabetes mellitus Brown Bear Domestic rabbit Goodness and value theory Hamburger Calorie restriction Fancy rat Dialysis Theory of conduct Concentration Tonnage Galileo spacecraft Anchor McDonald's Chronic fatigue syndrome Health insurance Grade (education) Hypoglycemia Peter Singer Aspartame Gastric bypass surgery Explosive material Margarine M16 (rifle) Shell (projectile) Metric system Cat Diamond cut Shrimp farm Physical examination Birth weight Vegetarian nutrition Organic food Sperm Whale Tyrannosaurus rex Space Shuttle program Metrication in Canada Vegetarianism and religion TGV Macrobiotic diet
