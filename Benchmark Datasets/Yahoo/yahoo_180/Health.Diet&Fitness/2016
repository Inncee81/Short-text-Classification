does any teen eat over calories even is healthy and not become fat or obese so basically i eat about a day and i'm vegan and sometimes i eat when i have an extra pb j too much cereal or like too many nuts as a snack or something and on those days i feel horrible and i workout so intesly the next day i go to the gym or times a week i am slowly loosing weight and i just read a lot of articles about how teens nees like over calories to grow right etc and i do not plan to ever go that high in calories but i was wondering why those people write those article seriously are they trying to make kids fatter i mean i know most of my friends peers dont eat that much most girls i know eat as little as possible and would probably even think what i eat is too much so i'm just kind of lost and wondering if any teens that arent fat actually ever eat that much chocolate lover i love veggies and eat them everyday i'm vegannnn i'm a vegetarian and i'm ' and weigh about pounds i usually allow myself cals a day and on weekends people tell me all the time that i don't eat enough and the thing is i believe them but disregard it i think our society has tricked us into poor eating habits forcing us to eat either way too little or way too much i find it sad how many people i come across who eat cals or less in a day and are completely obsessed with their body image and ashamed to find myself apart of said group but aside from that calorie consumption and the effect it has on your body has a lot to do with your metabolism some people are naturally blessed with a high metabolism and can eat well over cals in a day and not gain any weight for us normal people we have to make sure that our metabolism is up and running properly in order for us to lose weight or maintain it it's important to consume the proper amount of calories in order to keep your metabolism running or else all your effort in the gym will remain fruitless this means eating a well established breakfast and smaller meals through out the day however i wouldn't worry as much about calories as things like trans fats and saturated fats in the food you eat Atkins Nutritional Approach Anorexia nervosa Nutrition Weight training Veganism Vegetarianism Obesity Super Size Me Food Healthy eating Binge eating disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Tocopherol Bodybuilding Egg (food) Chocolate Milk Breastfeeding Low-carbohydrate diet South Beach diet Trans fat Food guide pyramid Little Britain Hypoglycemia French cuisine Calorie restriction Hyperglycemia Breakfast Hamburger Adjustable gastric band Fat Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Raw food diet Bread McDonald's Sleep Dietary fiber Garfield Weight loss FoxTrot Tofu Diabetes mellitus Snack food Eating disorder Meal Energy Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Hamster Roman eating and drinking Fecal incontinence German cuisine Acorn Exercise Margarine Fast food Olive oil Kashrut Sugar substitute MyPyramid Prostate cancer MRE Glycogen storage disease type I Vegetarian cuisine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Peanut Macular degeneration Fasting Coronary heart disease Jon Secada Gastric bypass surgery Eating Orders of magnitude (energy) Aspartame Domestic rabbit Japanese cuisine Social rule Natural Hygiene Cuisine of Brazil Pancake Pig (zodiac) 613 mitzvot Glucocorticoid Tooth Friends Buddhism Marilyn Monroe Puberty
