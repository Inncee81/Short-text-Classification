please i need advice i'm overweight i'm about pounds and i'm fairly tall i'm guessing i'm ft inches not positive what can i do to lose about twenty pounds i know that it won't be easy and i know it won't just happen in two days but i'm up to it please list some tips and sites thanks pricsilla that's really helpful i would still appreciate more answers though btw you shouldnt be losing pounds the approximate weight you should be at is like you only need to lose a little bit dont go all out eat healthy but yummy and exercise but fun i dont like dieting because it restricts you from eating what you want and doesnt let you live instead of eating straight fruits and veggies and only healthy stuff try eating low fat ice cream in moderation frozen blueberries sprinkled with splenda celery sticks baked apple crisps bananas with cinnamon etc you can eat healthy food but also have fun with it try making your own little meals and snacks that are healthy but are fun to make and also actually tastes decent i know that plain spinach leaves taste awful so try mixing some stuff in it so that its yummy and tastes good dieting doesnt have to be all strict and boring have fun with it also you need to exercise i know as a human being like you that jogging for hours is no fun so try speed walking around at the mall you get to shop and exercise just make sure that you dont end up drinking a starbucks frap while your doing that instead walk around with a large cup of iced water and sip on that while you walk and shop good luck calorie burning chart http www healthcalculators org calculators calories burned asp http www primusweb com cgi bin fpc actcalc pl http www fitwatch com database searchexdb html daily calorie needs http www straighthealth com pages tools caloriecalclb html bmi calculator https www healthatoz com healthatoz atoz tl cl bmi bmi jsp usersource google campaign tools adgroup bmi calc linktype search creative keyword bmi calorie counter http www calorieking com hope this helps feel free to email me for more help priscilla Obesity Dieting Healthy eating Breastfeeding Little Britain McDonald's Binge eating disorder Cuisine of Denmark Anorexia nervosa Tofu Milk Bread Tea Calorie Ice cream Veganism Ajax (programming) German cuisine HTML Food Jewish cuisine Guinea pig Rice pudding Egg (food) World Wide Web Vegetarianism Adjustable gastric band Bagel Garfield Bengali cuisine Uniform Resource Locator Tooth Ramen Fanta Snack food Hamburger Calorie restriction South Beach diet Website The Coca-Cola Company PHP Cuisine of the Philippines Recipe Weight loss MRE Nutrition Japanese cuisine Kit Kat Gmail Breakfast Sugar substitute Water XML Session Initiation Protocol Atomic Kitten Olive oil Weight training Cake Dairy Fecal incontinence Brown Bear Knife Domesticated turkey HyperText Transfer Protocol Idli 613 mitzvot Cat Web design Neopets Food guide pyramid Apple pie Cuisine of Brazil Apple Fast food Cold Stone Creamery In-N-Out Burger Weekly World News Sucralose HTTP cookie Trans fat Cuisine of Malaysia Potato Alcoholic beverage Fancy rat Common Unix Printing System Coffeehouse Gastric bypass surgery Omega-3 fatty acid
