i wanna get into shape i wanna improve cardio is it possible to do this and gain weight please help me with a weight training programme too thanks in advance hm yes it is possible to do cardio exercises and gain weight but you'll be surprised to know that you will lose the unnecessary fats in your body instead due to your continuous exercises these fats will be replaced by muscle mass thus making you gain weight but sometimes we tend to overeat when we are exercising it happened to me p we use excuses that it's okay to eat more because we are doing exercises that we would eventually lose the added food that we eat but even though we exercise we should eat the proper amount of food as well unfortunately i don't know any weight training programs p try doing sit ups push ups and back ups daily start with of each after you wake up and during the afternoon after your body has adjusted increase the number as the weeks pass by but don't overdo it it's bad for your body and eat and drink the proper kind of food and liquids respectively always do things in moderation hope this helps Dieting Weight training Bodybuilding Anorexia nervosa Exercise Atkins Nutritional Approach Obesity Binge eating disorder Super Size Me Swimming Fecal incontinence Insulin Breastfeeding Equine conformation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hyperglycemia Chocolate Milk Tocopherol Diabetes mellitus Carburetor South Beach diet Fancy rat Hamster Body type (exercise) Clinical depression Social rule Space Shuttle program Nutrition Osteoarthritis Adjustable gastric band Diarrhea Low-carbohydrate diet Weight Watchers Water Marathon (sport) Aerobic exercise Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Protein Creatine Sleep apnea Inflation Explosive material Meal Single Transferable Vote Gastroesophageal reflux disease United Parcel Service Bicycle Protein-energy malnutrition USS William B.
