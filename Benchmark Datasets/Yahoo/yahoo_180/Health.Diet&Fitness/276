i need a diet plan for me and my lifestyle any websites im sick of diet plans thinking you have the whole day based on your fooda dn cooking it makes no sense i am running around everywhere and they expect me to make a hour meal wtf okay is there any like on the go snack or something it doesnt have to be a chocolatey fudgey thing just something that i can grab in the car i don't know but try this to lose weight build muscle it'll take your extra fat fat that didn't get burn i don't exactly remember how drink lots of water eat nuts and raisins to increase metabolism workout eat healthy eat slowly because it takes awhile for food to digest so it takes awhile to be full after eating eating slowly will allow you to know when you're full to eat less don't sit in front of the tv while eating pretty much pay attention only to your food when you eat also allow your body to tell you when you're hungry when it growls eat do aerobic exercises do min exercises then have a min break you'll lose more wight than not taking breaks at all play music that you enjoy or music that makes you feel like dancing to you'll exercise more longer you can run in one place for min per day or more or run up and downstairs or jog run walk around your block then slowly increase the time by min per day and if you're gonna do sit ups cutches pull ups etc add per day starving will get you skinnier but at the end of it when you eat normally again your body will be saving it and you'll gain weight faster like bears saving their food for the winter also laughing for minutes burns calories all these have been
