losing weight while working in a fast food i work in a fast food resturant i am allowed to bring in my own food however i get up way to early in the morning to worry about what i am going to eat between am and am when i am at work i eat salads or fruit and yogurt since i started working their i gained lbs also after a divorce i walk miles every day plus some light freeweights lbs i have put in exercise videos and done the complete workouts i eat meals a day and two snacks everything is usually low cal with occasional scoop of ice cream every other week why can't i lose the weight any suggestions would be greatly appreciated i was in the same boat as you right after my ex and i split up i gained almost lbs and at ' it really shows while working in a restaurant it is so hard to maintain lose weight when you are working in food service not just because there is food at your disposal but because the constant activity leaves you pretty dehydrated often this thirst is misinterpreted as hunger i have the same issue but i try to focus more on low sodium low fat and less on low cal low cal foods are often loaded with salt and sugar to make them taste better be sure that you are drinking lots and lots of cold water and getting your daily supply of fiber and really watch that sodium good luck and remember that however long it took to gain the weight is at least how long it will take to lose it so don't get discouraged Dieting Food Breakfast Atkins Nutritional Approach Cuisine of Denmark Weight training Bodybuilding Food preservation Fecal incontinence Water Milk Obesity Cuisine of the Philippines Tea French cuisine Meal Hiking Fast food Soft drink Fasting Tofu McDonald's Low-carbohydrate diet Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia Super Size Me Dairy German cuisine Tooth Vegetarianism Japanese tea ceremony Ramen Survival skills 613 mitzvot Restaurant Jewish cuisine Binge eating disorder Hyperglycemia Nutrition Hamburger Coffee Anorexia nervosa Sugar substitute Street food Japanese cuisine Delicatessen Hamster Diabetes mellitus Tea (meal) Cuisine of Malaysia Fish and chips Veganism Snack food Sewage treatment Peruvian cuisine Soy protein Poker jargon Milkshake South Beach diet Folic acid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Watermelon Hydrogen economy Bread Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Marathon (sport) Diarrhea Rum Water purification Kit Kat Peanut Kashrut Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of the Southern United States Cha chaan teng Cuisine of Singapore Korean cuisine Customs and etiquette of Japan Protein-energy malnutrition American Chinese cuisine Nuclear reactor Banana Internal ballistics Glycerin Nuclear power
