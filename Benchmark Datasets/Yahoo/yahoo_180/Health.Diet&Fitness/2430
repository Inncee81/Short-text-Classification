i have a friend that is pregnant but interested in slimming healthily any tips my friend would like to do the diet as promoted by 'slimming world' however due to circumstances she can only do it online as oppose to go to the meetings being pregnant won't allow her to do the diet online however this company does allow pregnant women to follow the diet if they go to the meetings this isn't possible so i was wondering whether anyone had any experience either doing 'slimming world' whilst pregnant and could give some of the secrets away or anyone who managed to slim naturally during pregnancy any tips and success stories would be helpful there is no question of this not being a healthy venture so there is no need for concern advice from experts now a days is that if you eat your regular pre pregnancy caloric amount then your pregnancy weight should level off at about to lbs before birth thats only if you are overweight to begin with if she cuts back on the salt fat and sugar she should be able to have a healthy pregnancy with minimal weight gain she should see a nutritionist i did when i was pregnant with my son very informative i hate when people think that if pregnant you should pig out and eat whatever you want whenever you want putting on too much weight during pregnancy can be just as bad as putting on too little she should have her doc and nutritionist work together Dieting Nutrition Obesity Breastfeeding Tocopherol Guinea pig Pregnancy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Teenage pregnancy Bodybuilding Healthy eating Super Size Me Terri Schiavo Veganism Hamster South Beach diet Friends Fertility awareness Anorexia nervosa Little Britain Omega-3 fatty acid Hypoglycemia Egg (food) Binge eating disorder Abortion debate Garfield Elephant Menstrual cycle Oral sex Vitamin C Vegetarianism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Weight loss Cystic fibrosis Domestic rabbit Birth control Human height Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Adjustable gastric band Bread Psoriasis Oily fish Raw food diet Cytomegalovirus Puberty Low-carbohydrate diet Pregnancy fetishism Knots Landing Weight Watchers Hypertension Milk Famine Coeliac disease Food guide pyramid Roe v.
