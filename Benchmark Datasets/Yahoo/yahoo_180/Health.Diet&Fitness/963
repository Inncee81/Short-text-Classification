great question about weight lifting when lifting weights such as benching or curling should you have a fixed amount of reps per set or should you lift until you cannot do another rep for example you usually do set of on the bench should you do set of however many you can do usually i stick to sets doing anymore is not going to get bigger muscles to get stronger do about of your one rep max atleast times and if you can do more without feeling any discomfort add more weight but keep it mostly around six for power to get more definition stay atleast at reps and do a lighter weight but don't do more than four sets per exercise Weight training Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Muscle Bench press Brassiere Bicycle Weightlifting United States House of Representatives Powerlifting Bruce Lee Repetition Sport rowing Arado Ar 80 Bodybuilding Paragliding Dodge Charger Urinary incontinence Dieting Sailing Flight controls Fecal incontinence Knife Skateboarding trick Anchor Appeal Magnesium Professional wrestling throws Shane Mosley Weight Anorexia nervosa Douglas DC-8 Spanking Helicopter Recumbent bicycle Mass The nature of God in Western theology Space fountain Aircraft engine Exercise Dumbbell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Obesity Plough Hawker Siddeley Trident Car handling Coronary heart disease Autogyro Assault rifle Hot air balloon Gauge theory Fixed-wing aircraft Muscle car Poker jargon Mitsubishi 3000GT Aikido Aircraft GunBound Ravi Shastri Propeller Osteoarthritis Aviation history Paradox Cliff Richard Table saw LSD Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sports car AK-47 September 11 researchers Horn (instrument) Treatment learning Variable valve timing WCW Power Plant Hyperreal number Timpani Knitting Ford Thunderbird Golden Plates Mountain bike Rum Gaussian elimination Turbocharger Swept wing Mechanical advantage Jeff Gannon Calisthenics Canadian House of Commons Body mass index Horizontal bar F-16 Fighting Falcon Motorcycle Mercury Cougar Turing machine Cooking weights and measures Kaman Aircraft No Child Left Behind Act VTEC Ultralight aviation Planck units
