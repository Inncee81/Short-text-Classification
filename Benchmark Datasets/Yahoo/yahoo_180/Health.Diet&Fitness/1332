is gastric bypass surgery the lazy way to lose excessive weight i have a friend who peaked at pounds yet after changing eating habits and exercise he's down to and an avid runner he is scornfull of gastric bypass surgery and insists its the 'lazy way' of losing weight anyone can lose weight through eating healthy and exercise willpower is the key to making it happen well if a person is bed ridden and can't walk becuse of obesity it's a valid option what do you think is gastric bypass surgery an approprioate or lazy way to lose excessive ammounts of weight my opinion is that it's a very harsh and expensive thing that has more trouble than it's worth i wouldn't call it lazy as some people need it because they aren't able to exercise and don't have the willpower to eat less but there aren't many people that need it as much as they need help with their willpower the facts i've learned about it is that it's a very risky surgery that should only be used as a last resort quite literally you remove your stomach or at least most of it from your digestive tract so you would not be able to digest your food as much which lowers your intake and you get fuller faster to many overweight people who have tried everything this may seem like a great idea but by starving yourself which is what ends up happening when you can't absorb the nutrients from your food is dangerous and can make you dangerously under nourished the worst part is that most of these surgeries are not reversible so once you've lost the weight you can't go back to normal and eat a healthy diet you also can't use most supplements to get your nutrition because most supplements have to digest in your stomach which is lacking after the surgery you'll essentially starve yourself for the rest of your life unless you're lucky enough to expand what's left of your stomach slowly by eating more than you safely should which again is a very bad idea Obesity Adjustable gastric band Gastric bypass surgery Nutrition Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Cancer Insulin Milk Gastroparesis Folic acid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gastroesophageal reflux disease Anorexia nervosa Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia Stomach Cat Binge eating disorder Omega-3 fatty acid Vomiting Prostate cancer Guinea pig Hamster Low-carbohydrate diet Fecal incontinence Diarrhea Bodybuilding Dog Weight loss Vegetarianism Atherosclerosis Coeliac disease Homer Simpson Ulcerative colitis Digestion Vitamin C Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Weight training Chronic fatigue syndrome Urinary incontinence Paracetamol Dietary supplement Vitamin Equine conformation Vegetarian nutrition Domestic rabbit Pig (zodiac) Coronary heart disease Fancy rat Osteoarthritis Gastric acid South Beach diet Osteoporosis Gastrointestinal tract Anne Rice Cirrhosis Feeding tube Life extension Human height Colorectal cancer Protein Carpal tunnel syndrome Fast food Diabetes mellitus Carnivorous plant Brown Bear Organic food Short bowel syndrome Anemia Small intestine Trans fat Tlingit Garfield Rice Health insurance Hyperglycemia Hydrochloric acid Body mass index Flatulence Liver Exercise Eating Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Organic farming Bloat Simone Weil
