chest workout question i did about sets for my chest today all sets were completed in mintues is too much i did sets for lower portion of chest sets for middle and sets for upper sets incline flies sets incline bench each were performed at rep range do you think i should take it down a notch is not too much but if you do chest all the time it would allow for healing my suggestion is that if you aren't doing it already that you hit chest once a week and add a little variety to the workout the best way to get a better bench press if that's your goal is to do other exercises that hit the chest better than the press does and workout the rest of your body for stability and even growth here s what i do and it has been working for me obviously a workout needs to be tailored to the individual but these exercises may help arms lying dumbbell triceps extensions standing barbell curl behind head reverse hammers one arm preacher curl close grip pushdowns incline dumbbell curl parallel bar dips hammer curl single arm reverse grip pushdowns reverse grip ez bar rope push downs super light dumbbell curls chest dumbbell incline presses pullovers and presses dumbbell bench presses narrow grip bench presses incline dumbbell flyes barbell incline presses push ups between benches cable standing incline flyes cable standing decline flyes back barbell row dumbbell row lat pull downs cable row lower back machine forearms lite wide lat pulldowns supermans shoulders lateral raises bent over lateral raises no rest front raises shrugs military presses front raises rotator cuffs superlight lateral raises on incline bench with lbs dumbbells st facing forward bring dumbbells up from sides to parallel to ground palms inward slow repeat for ten reps nd facing bench bring dumbbells up from sides backwards as far as you can palms inward slow repeat for ten reps rd stand up with dumbbells and do lateral raises th back in position raise arms so they are forward palms inward arms bent in a semi bear hug position and parallel to ground bring to sides and back to center for reps i usually do lbs here because this exercise is hard do this set three times with out rest the third set i change to all lb movements all of this is slow pace like second up and one second down legs squats leg extentions leg curls adductors abductors calf lifts glute machine leg lifts i also do crunches per night my idea is to hit a variety of ranges and movements in order to work the muscle to the maximum i tend to use a weight i can do for reps and for reps on the last two movements apart from this i do minutes or cardio every day and stretch before and after the workout as well as frequently during stretching is very important to muscular growth because not only does it help prevent injury and alleviate recovery pain but it also stretches out the fascia tissue that surrounds the muscle and inhibits its growth when you are pumped and you stretch is when you get the best stretch of the fascia lastly rest and nutrition are every bit as important as the workout itself eating enough protein for the muscle to recover and grow as well as enough carbohydrates to replenish diminished glycogen stores in the muscles and liver is vital for repair and being ready for the next time you tax those muscles Bench press Volleyball Bodybuilding Breaststroke Fast bowling Ulna Scapula Arm Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Elbow-joint Squat (exercise) Glossary of climbing terms Bicycle Skateboarding trick Boxing Powerlifting Swingout Tetrapod Exercise Front crawl Clean and jerk Parade (military) Dumbbell Deadlift Carpal tunnel syndrome Internal ballistics Diving Powerbomb Horizontal bar Swimming DDT (professional wrestling) Butterfly stroke Glossary of ballet terms M16 (rifle) Figure skating Salute Temporal bone Massage Muscle Abdomen Weightlifting Sternum Mixed martial arts Hypoglycemia Insulin Casualty lifting Mandible Pole vault Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Sailing Glossary of American football Marching band Recumbent bicycle Terminal ballistics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Puberty Urinary incontinence Scar Backbreaker Marathon (sport) Lindy Basic Occipital bone Eye Aikido Archery Hip (anatomy) Drill bit Dieting Sport rowing Earring Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tibia Leaf Combine (Half-Life 2) Wing Chun Spanking Obedience training Gesture Horse Myocardial infarction Mouse (computing) Rigging Atherosclerosis Fencing Double bass
