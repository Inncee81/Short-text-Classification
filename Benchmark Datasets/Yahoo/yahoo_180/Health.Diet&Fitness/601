difference between tone and strength well i asked a question the other day about diet and training etc and got some amazing answers one of them involved alternating between fast reps and slow reps because slow gain strength and fast gain tone whats the difference between both also which one is more practical im guessing one is the one that looks good and the other is the practical one i'd like to ask about the functions of some of the muscles like is there a practical use for the pecktorials pack etc my last question is how can i train my back without doing chinups or squat type exsercises i have a rowing machine but it seems to only work the middle part of my back ive researched how to use one pretty simple obviously and i seem to be doing everything right i know there are alot of muscles in the back and would just like to know how to train them all in a none complex way if that is possible reson i cant do squats is that my heels dont stay on the floor in squat because of an operation a while ago strength is more practical toning just means your muscle is more defined as for functions of the muscles just think about what you do during the day that uses each muscle climbing stairs for your legs pushing open heavy doors with your pecs lifting things with arms etc the abs themselves lend support and strength for twisting movements and help your posture and such here are a few good exercises for the back although there aren't many compounds i know of deadlifts work a lot of muscles in the body including back shrugs work your trapezius muscles upper back rows work your lats middle back if you row to your chin or to your stomach it works upper lower lats respectively hyperextensions work your lower back Deadlift Muscle Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Squat (exercise) Biped Urinary incontinence Swimming Cerebellum Breaststroke Glossary of partner dance terms Strap-on dildo Tetrapod Irish dance Internal ballistics Milton H.
