height and weight question i'm almost lbs around there and i was wondering if that's tall for a year old girl i'm not growing anymore i was just wondering and if that's a healthy weight in some countries you are too tall in others you are just right and yet in some others you are short but not too short it's all a matter of societal acceptance as for preferences by guys doesnt matter what your height is there is someone out there who will like you regardless so i wouldnt worry about growing taller or not the weight sounds fine the generic height weight charts are only for the ideal people average body build people are usually within of that ideal weight heavy body build people are as much as more than that ideal weight light body weight people are as much as less than that ideal weight and people who are totally physically fit are usually to more than that ideal weight it's all about how fit your body is for the frame that your body is dont judge it all by weight that is not the only factor you general body type your body stance hip width musculature in different parts of your body etc etc make up the whole story Human height Puberty Sexual attraction Equine conformation Physical attractiveness Washington Monument Car handling Panzer I Weight training Panzer II Pound Obesity Growth hormone treatment Heightism Anorexia nervosa Carbine Pole vault Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Boxing Mass Radio masts and towers Weight Chair Muscle Gravity Mixed-breed dog Tai Chi Chuan Swingout Bicycle frame Generation X Body image Milk Sexual orientation Urinary incontinence High-heeled shoe Glossary of partner dance terms Atomism Mattress Jet engine Prostate cancer World's tallest structures Tide Bodybuilding Typeface Scale model Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus View camera ZGMF-1017 GINN Atkins Nutritional Approach Atomic Kitten RX-78 mobile suit series Special relativity Strap-on dildo Physical examination Snowboard Education Largest organism Truck Clinical depression Guinea pig Species Terminal ballistics ZGMF-X12 Gundam Astray Out Frame M16 (rifle) Dwarfism M4 Sherman Physical paradox Decibel Tire Supernatural Jennifer Lopez Sport utility vehicle Nuclear weapon design RX-79 Series Freedom Tower Stairway Human adaptation to space Bass guitar Tank Eventing Speed of light Britpop Horseshoe Spanking Corporal punishment ZAFT Armed Keeper of Unity MSA-0011 S Gundam Characters of Naruto Units of measurement Panzer VIII Maus Wood Aikido Gothic metal Social rule P-61 Black Widow Passenger car Weightlifting Growth hormone GAT-02L2 Dagger L
