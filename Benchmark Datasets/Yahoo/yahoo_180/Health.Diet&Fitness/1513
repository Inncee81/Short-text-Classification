this a good workout plan i work one muscle groupe a day and workout days per week doing abs everyday is it a good idea to stretch and walk a lil bit before weight training lift weights for what ever body part im doing that day and after lifting weights do a little bit more cardio also how long after i lift weights should i consume a protein shake within mins ok you've got several questions here i guess i would have to see your workout which parts on which days to be able to tell if it's a good one or not why are you working your abs daily but your other muscles once or twice a week maybe i never did care much for a split routine that scattered muscle groups out all over the place and hit them once a week weight training must be consistent with hitting the muscles every couple of days to see super results for instance upper body one day lower body the next full body one day rest the next etc it's always good to walk or do some kind of a warm up before weight training always this way your muscles are warm and ready for the first round of the lightest set never stretch first as your muscles are not warm and flexible yet stretching comes after you've warmed up weight trained and then your stretch when you can relax and not be in a hurry cardio can be done on days that you don't weight train or whenever you want it personally i think if you're doing it on the same days as you weight train do it before so you can be super warmed up to lift are you eating if you are chances are that you don't need any protein shake this is a gimmick that goes way back to the ole body builders your muscles get plenty and usually too much of protein from foods and will kick out any that is left over chances are the protein in the shakes are rejected anyway Weight training Dieting Professional wrestling holds Insulin Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Abdomen Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Triathlon Andr__s Galarraga Social rule Heart Atkins Nutritional Approach Fecal incontinence Tocopherol Breastfeeding Polymer Protein Menstrual cup Muscle Tyrannosaurus rex Piccolo Junior Saga Massage Dialysis Swingout TGV Guinea pig Eddie Guerrero Customs and etiquette of Japan Suplex Androgen insensitivity syndrome Dog Cardiac cycle Tire Radio controlled airplane Marathon (sport) Cheese Archery Backstroke Skateboarding trick Aikido Mixed martial arts Pittsburgh Steelers Satchel Paige Adjustable gastric band Fasting Prostate cancer First aid Swimming Brassiere Stomach cancer Glossary of partner dance terms Game show Spider Eye Coeliac disease Osteoarthritis Stretching Poliomyelitis Password Species Textile manufacturing Blood (computer game) Biochemistry Babe Ruth Chinese martial arts Rugby league Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Akuma (Street Fighter) Oral sex Back injury Sauna Drowning Sabbath Eventing Hemoglobin Wing Chun Obstetrics Raw food diet Stopping power Humerus Professional wrestling attacks Casualty lifting DNA Reptile Contortion Thermoregulation Taekwondo Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Running Absolute magnitude Professional wrestling slang Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Clinical depression USS Yorktown (CV-10)
