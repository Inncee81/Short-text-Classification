if i eat calories and exercise at least min a day how much weight will i lose thanks for answering in week i eat very healthy no processed foods red meat pop etc i eat a lot of tuna fruit veggies chicken etc considering what you wrote about your diet i'd say you'd do fairly well over a couple weeks but just because what you eat is healthy doesn't mean it's necessarily ideal for weight loss also you need to be thinking about condiments mayonnaise ketchup mustard salad dressings etc if you're using regular of any of those things instead of low cal fat you need to stop people generally don't think about those things because you think 'oh how much could really be in here it's just salad dressing' my advice look at the nutrition info fo everything i'm not saying you don't now but it's just something everyone needs to hear also i dunno how many meals you're eating a day but if it's three large ones you need to change that to make more progress try going for six four of them small like a serving of veggies and a couple crackers or something and two of them larger the healthiest is to make breakfast and lunch the big ones but i do breakfast and dinner this way your metabolism doesn't slow down and if you never get really hungry you're less likely to overeat or eat something horrible what i said before about foods being ideal for weight loss check this site out it's the most comprehensive one i've ever come across http www nutritiondata com index html as for exercise it depends what type you're going to do while strength training does burn fat it's not as good as cardio for it try making your routine mostly cardio but involve some strength training to tone your muscles if you follow this cal one hour of exercise six meals a day you should do pretty well at least five pounds probably more it just depends on how strictly you adhere to it Hamburger Cuisine of Denmark McDonald's Obesity Weight training Bodybuilding German cuisine Super Size Me Meal Food Vegetarianism Nutrition Breakfast Veganism MRE Salad Healthy eating Sauce French cuisine Low-carbohydrate diet Little Britain French fries Folic acid In-N-Out Burger Fecal incontinence Egg (food) Binge eating disorder Japanese cuisine Mayonnaise Weight loss Roman eating and drinking Anorexia nervosa Hypoglycemia Hot dog Adjustable gastric band Exercise Omega-3 fatty acid South Beach diet Insulin Sandwich Barbecue Chinese New Year Calorie Jewish cuisine Vegetarian cuisine Fasting Domesticated turkey Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Snack food Milk Garfield Weight Watchers Cuisine of the Philippines Domestic rabbit Raw food diet Diabetes mellitus Acorn Guinea pig Sushi Fast food Urinary incontinence Chicken Breastfeeding Food guide pyramid Cuisine of Malaysia Shit Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ramen Fancy rat Delicatessen Prostate cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tea (meal) A&W Restaurants Korean cuisine Insulin resistance Burger Tocopherol Coronary heart disease Muscle Hamster Tomato Burger King Curry Pizza Culinary mustard Glycogen storage disease type I Kashrut Ketchup Chocolate
