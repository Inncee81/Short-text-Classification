is this workout too much i run for minutes miles then i do a bit of strength training for different muscles in my legs for shoulders and for triceps then later in the day i do pilates for about minutes after i reach my goal i have to lose about lbs i plan to alternate each day with either strength training or pilates i still plan to run x a week tho is this too much should i cut down or is it ok thanx so much for me to run miles in minutes would mean i would be running mph not don't work the same muscle group days in a row for your strength training the muscles need a day is better to rest and heal and thus build strengthen the plan sounds good similar to what i do when i'm trying to lose weight mins of yoga or strength training in the morning and mins of cardio in the evening at least days a week congrats on the min miles my best has been but i can't maintain that for more than my first mile Weight training Bodybuilding Exercise Equine conformation Stress fracture Pilates Royal Marines Triathlon Messerschmitt Me 163 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Galveston Hurricane of 1900 Iliotibial band syndrome Swimming 2005 Pacific hurricane season 2005 Pacific typhoon season Tyrannosaurus rex Muscle 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Arm TGV Pioneer Zephyr Massage Vegeta Iditarod Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Tetrapod Bench press Humerus Mr. Olympia Scapula USS Aylwin (DD-355) Chinese martial arts Repetitive strain injury P-61 Black Widow Walt Disney World Railroad Port Authority Trans-Hudson Les Mills Paragliding Professional wrestling throws B-47 Stratojet Chronology of Jesus Urinary incontinence Apollo 15 New York Giants Second Battle of El Alamein Boeing 777 Ayurveda Dialysis Oasis (band) Battle of the Somme (1916) Creatine Space Shuttle program Channel Tunnel Rail Link 1969 Atlantic hurricane season USS Tunny (SS-282) USS Whale (SS-239) Fast bowling Mixed martial arts Hurricane Charley Overtraining Bonnie J.
