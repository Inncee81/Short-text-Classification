dieting is the cheat meal in or out or even a cheat day i know where i stand on this issue and i tell everyone the same thing i want to hear both sides attack and defense of the cheat meal or even a cheat day i endorse the cheat meal within reason on a disciplined diet time a week and tell people to keep this under calories time a week thats it i'm not so keen of the cheat day its to long and undiscplined and you can ruin a whole week of dieting for me calories or even a little higher isnt enough to hurt you as long as you dont go to far over the amount of calories your body can burn daily i e a lbs woman who only burns calories a day shouldnt be eating a calorie super sunday from sonic but a man who burns between and calories a day should be able to get away with a supersized big mac meal if he desires it once a week just my take but i want several more please let's get real and honest here define cheat meal if you mean triple whoppers with cheese large fries shakes then junk food and booze you don't want to go there what happens is that it sets you up to want more of that its better to treat yourself to say lobster or a good steak have a simple carb like a baked potato with tbs of sour cream small salad and you still can have a small serving of dessert that way you don't set up a means to totally go berzerk later are satisfied will still lose weight that is the smart approach to a cheat night now if you still have to have that pizza with everything skip the cheese on it then you can have a lite beer glass of wine cheat nights can work if you do it right just don't do that all the time McDonald's Cuisine of Denmark Hamburger French cuisine Atkins Nutritional Approach German cuisine Food Dieting Meal Breakfast Calorie Cuisine of the Philippines Alcoholic beverage Super Size Me Japanese cuisine Pizza Sandwich British cuisine Jewish cuisine Milk Bread Breastfeeding French fries Veganism Cheese In-N-Out Burger Fasting Vegetarian cuisine Peruvian cuisine South Beach diet Cuisine of Argentina Egg (food) Low-carbohydrate diet Fast-food restaurant Fish and chips Cuisine of the Southern United States Healthy eating Korean cuisine Cuisine of Austria The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Dietary fiber Potato Pancake Passover Hot dog Little Britain Olive oil Anorexia nervosa Bengali cuisine Obesity Irish cuisine Fast food Fecal incontinence Barbecue Binge eating disorder Adjustable gastric band Serbian cuisine Burger King Steak n Shake Domesticated turkey Snack food Dumpling Patrick Star Eddie Guerrero Bodybuilding Street food Omega-3 fatty acid Slim Fast Cuisine of Malaysia MRE Cheesesteak Roman eating and drinking Tomato Cuisine of Finland Dairy Commodity markets Vegetarianism Energy Rule of St Benedict Potato chips Rice pudding Cuisine of Greece Stomach cancer Fondue Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bong Culture of France Last meal Hyperglycemia Spidey Super Stories Professional wrestling slang
