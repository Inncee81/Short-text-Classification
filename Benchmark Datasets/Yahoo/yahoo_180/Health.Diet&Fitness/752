i've lost lbs in days is this fat or water weight i've just recently started a diet by this i mean eating healthy and balanced foods i'm eating between about cal day i'm doing this to try to lose weight obviousely and i'm trying to shink my stomache shrink it because i'm used to way overeating even though i might be full i keep eating because the food just tastes so good i eat meals everyday with correct serving proportions and something from every food group and still snacking in between i eat till i'm satisfied but eat again when i'm hungary i'm eating basically all day when i drink something it's just water i quit eating after pm and am also taking a muti vitiman about every weeks i'm going to go up or calories until i quit loosing the weight and then when i plateau knock off a couple hundred calories so i can continue to lose wieght until my goal size so after all that my question is lbs in two days is crazy is this just water weight or i'm i actually loosing real weight in days lb probably water weight however if you keep ur exercise and dieting u can lose lb of fat weight each week thats about pounds of fat weight per month thus in three month u can lose about pounds i believe that if you are dieting in healthy way you probably lose lb of water weight and lb of fat weight included however if you are doing your dieting in unhealthy way by starving then you might have lost muscle weight losing muscle weight is bad for your diet because losing muscle and starving yourself decreases your metabolism so check if you are dieting right and if you are dieting right then keep dieting and exercising in healthy way to lose fat losing fat doesnt happen over night it happens in long periods of time Dieting Obesity Atkins Nutritional Approach Super Size Me Weight training Breastfeeding Low-carbohydrate diet Milk Healthy eating Anorexia nervosa Weight loss Tocopherol South Beach diet Insulin Binge eating disorder Calorie Omega-3 fatty acid Stomach cancer Hamster Weight Watchers Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Calorie restriction Hamburger Pound Food Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Egg (food) Trans fat Vegetarianism Nutrition Margarine McDonald's Dietary fiber Cheese Urinary incontinence Fast food Veganism Chocolate Exercise Brain Ramen Guinea pig Fecal incontinence Chinese food therapy Fancy rat Coconut crab Coeliac disease Swimming Meal Gastroparesis Pig (zodiac) Protein-energy malnutrition Tooth Body type (exercise) Cat Hyperglycemia Weight Tomato Coronary heart disease Junk food Coffee Food guide pyramid First aid Marathon (sport) Prostate cancer Glycogen storage disease type I Great White Shark Garfield Domestic rabbit Energy Elephant Hypercholesterolemia Fugu Morgan Spurlock Water Cuisine of Denmark Gray Wolf Dog Equine conformation Breakfast Chronic fatigue syndrome Tasmanian Devil Ham Famine Paget's disease of bone Kashrut Cirrhosis Clinical depression MyPyramid
