how can i get over being shy and gain some confidence in middle school i was chubby and had alot of acne so awhile back i went on a diet and went to a dermatologist now i'm skinny and my acne is pretty unnoticeable and i cover it up really well so you can't see it unless you're looking for it i've gotten alot more confident since then but i'm still very shy we just moved to another state so i have a new start how can i feel better about myself and become mroe outgoing so i'll have a great junior year and make alot of friends i've never had a boyfriend before and i'm pretty sure that's why thanks p s this might not be the right category but i didn't know where to put it p hey i'm kind of going thru the same thing right now as you i just lost some weight and im going away to college for the first time so it's like i get a second chance like you i'm not particularly that confident the one good piece of advice i could tell you is to fake it till you make it even though you might feel shy and unconfident on the inside just fake confidence and charisma on the outside you should also try saying to yourself how beautiful and amazing and hot you are and try to cloud out any negative thoughts you have also in the same strain as acting confident you should walk into a room and act like you own it look people in the eye and smile a lot and try to stand up straight and avoid hunching over and looking at the ground try to participate in class conversations a lot and compliment people like omg i love your earrings or your hair when you talk to people try asking them a lot of questions about themselves ppl like to talk abt themselves and whenever your talking to someone or in a group don't sit there and be quiet but participate in the conversation above all just act so confident and you'll have everyone dying to be your friend and all the boys vying for your hot little self Social rule The Ashlee Simpson Show Piccolo Junior Saga Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Cliff Richard Kodocha Milton H.
