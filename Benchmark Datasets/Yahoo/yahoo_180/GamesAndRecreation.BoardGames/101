how do you play yourself in chess i want to be able to practice chess by playing blitz games in my mind blind fold style against myself a problem arizes it is probably not too difficult to learn how to play blindfold chess but the question is how do you play yourself in chess i have problems doing this i guess this is partially due to my style of thinking my move mentality usually goes like this this move doesnt lose me anything and if my opponent doesnt see this nifty tactic i win a piece however this doesnt work toward winning when you play yourself since you know all your tactics does anyone know of any resources or maybe advice that you can give me to help me learn to play myself in chess the skill is worth acquiring if you play in events where adjournments are involved you can use the time you have before the second session and resumption of the game to try out various moves that the opponent might try and how you would reply if they did but you don't have to do that in your head you can move the pieces around on a board you need to develop tactics that win material even if your opponent does see what you are up to then your problem about not being able to surprise yourself disappears your goal must be to win against best play Chess terminology Chess Chess opening Computer chess Chess problem Chess variant Arimaa Shogi Paul Morphy Rules of chess Backgammon ELO rating system Ruy Lopez Endgame World Chess Championship Go (board game) Joseph Henry Blackburne Blindfold chess Garry Kasparov Xiangqi Go ranks and ratings Kasparov versus The World Check (board game) Game mechanic Reversi Punctuation (chess) Fischer Random Chess Taikyoku shogi Yari shogi Tenjiku shogi Sample chess game FIDE World Chess Championship 2004 Cannon shogi Advanced Chess Fran__ois-Andr__ Danican Philidor Maka dai dai shogi Viswanathan Anand Martial art Poker jargon Correspondence chess Dai shogi Betting (poker) Draughts Draw (chess) Anatoly Karpov Board game Immortal game The Game of the Century Judkins shogi Computer Go Stalemate Archon (computer game) Chu shogi Free Internet Chess Server George Koltanowski Viktor Korchnoi Chess problem terminology Tori shogi Algebraic chess notation Computer and video game genres Helpmate Match of the Century English draughts Tournament Harry Nelson Pillsbury Hand shogi Dai dai shogi Magnus Carlsen Scientology beliefs and practices Wa shogi Tai shogi Checkmate Baroque chess Zillions of Games Martian Chess Sheepshead Wheel of Fortune Game Volleyball Whale shogi Mikhail Tal Chaturanga Frank Marshall Samuel Reshevsky You Don't Know Jack Capablanca Chess Dualism (philosophy of mind) Hollywood Squares Antichess Tony Miles Boris Spassky Two Knights Defense Tic-Tac-Dough Bobby Fischer Football (soccer) Heian dai shogi
