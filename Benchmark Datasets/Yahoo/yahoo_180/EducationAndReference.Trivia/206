why was it bruce lee's time to die we all have a time to die but i have to agree it was way too soon for bruce lee when he died in july rumors spread like wild fire he'd been killed by hong kong gangsters because he refused to pay them protection money he was killed by an angry martial artist's dim mask or death touch strike he was cursed because the house he bought in hong kong was haunted and or he had angered the chinese martial arts community for teaching their methods to foreigners so he was killed in a challenge match but the facts are these bruce died after falling into a coma caused by his brain swelling from the normal size of to grams due to excess fluid building up cerebral edema the only thing that the authorities agreed on on the afternoon he died he complained of a headache while discussing his latest movie game of death with his agents and co stars one of the actresses in the movie gave him a tablet of equagesic a type of super aspirin about p m he went to lie down and at when he was late for a dinner meeting this actress reported she could not get him awake doctors reported a hypersensitivity to one or more of the compounds in the equagesic to be the cause of his death even though his brain had swollen there were no blood vessels blocked or broken bruce knew he wouldn't live to his old age hence some who believed his fate was sealed at birth by the position of the stars but it was his wife who said he was afraid of losing the physical abilities he'd worked so hard to achieve he often said if i die tomorrow i will have no regrets i did what i wanted to do Bruce Lee Stroke Traumatic brain injury Humphrey Bogart Batman Beyond Paracetamol Kill Bill Intracranial pressure Martial arts film Zhao Ziyang Malaria Jeet Kune Do Mixed martial arts Knots Landing Hong Kong action cinema Charmed John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sammo Hung John F.
