why can you see through water if on a molecular level things are opaque why can you see through water molecules have mass there for they take up space if there are no spaces between the molecules why is it transparent why only water i can see thru clothes as well Molecule Photosynthesis Chemistry Vacuum Photon Infrared spectroscopy Mole (unit) Water (molecule) Greenhouse effect Temperature Hydrogen bond Atomic mass unit Rotational spectroscopy Hydrogen Carbon Water Water vapor Maser Life Protostar Molecular orbital Heat capacity Explosive material Protein Ozone layer Dark nebula Crystallography Transparency (optics) Biochemistry Glass transition temperature Molecular biology Coriolis effect Plastic Sun Aromatic hydrocarbon Flux Chemical formula Earth's atmosphere Kinetic theory Computational chemistry Atomic mass Ice Permittivity Molecular engineering Nanotechnology Energy level Polymer Electromagnetic spectrum Dipole Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry) Avogadro's number Soap Replicator (Star Trek) Magnetic resonance imaging Greenhouse gas Salt Liquid crystal T-1000 Cellular respiration Miller-Urey experiment Ultraviolet Iris (anatomy) Alternative biochemistry Macromolecule Long-term potentiation Rocket fuel Acid Whole proteome analysis Clathrate compound Biology Polyethylene terephthalate Phase (matter) Hemoglobin Aurora (astronomy) Cell adhesion Molecular cloud Antibody Molecular geometry Liquid crystal display Reflection (physics) X-ray crystallography Antiviral drug Statistical mechanics Ethanol Amedeo Avogadro Brewery Nuclear magnetic resonance Surface tension Gel electrophoresis Intermolecular force Origin of life Growth hormone Microwave Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene Electron configuration Helium Amorphous ice Alkane Orbital hybridisation Watercolor painting
