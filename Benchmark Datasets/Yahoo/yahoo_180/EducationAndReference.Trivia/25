where does the phrase hold down the fort come from i got this one off website i think it did a good job of explaining and i quote hold the fort holding the fort take responsibility for managing a situation while under threat or in crisis especially on a temporary or deputy basis or while waiting for usual additional help to arrive or return 'hold the fort' or 'holding the fort' is a metaphor based on the idea of soldiers defending holding a castle or fort against attack by enemy forces fort and fortress are old english words that have been in use since the 's in their present form deriving from french and ultimately latin fortis means strong which gives us several other modern related words fortitude and fort for example the first recorded use of 'hold the fort' is particularly noteworthy and although earlier use might have existed there seems little doubt that this story was responsible for establishing the expression so firmly and widely the expression seems first to to have come to prominence in american civil war newspapers and other reports notably that of daniel webster whittle us civil war army major evangelist and writer of semaphore flag messages exchanged on october between general sherman and john corse a commander of th division fifteenth corps who defended a crucial position because it contained a million and a half rations with men reports vary at the battle of altoona pass near atlanta ga when attacked and outnumbered by men and heavy artillery of the confederate army under the command of general samuel french corse's men suffered casualties of between a third and a half but against all odds held their position inflicting huge losses on the enemy forcing them to withdraw after the battle newspapers reported that sherman had sent a semaphore message from a distant hilltop to corse saying 'hold the fort i am coming wt sherman ' according to these reports the message had a stirring effect on corse's men although corse it seems maintained that he had successfully held the position without sherman's assistance and ironically sherman seems later to have denied sending such a message at all whatever the story of the battle and sherman's message and its motivating effect on corse's men established the episode and the expression in american folklore Franco-Prussian War Franklin-Nashville Campaign Vicksburg Campaign Price's Raid American Civil War Military history of Canada Irish Guards Battle of Shiloh Battle of Gettysburg Napoleonic Wars Battle of Chancellorsville Jubal Anderson Early William Tecumseh Sherman John Bell Hood Battle of the Somme (1916) Yom Kippur War Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Trench warfare Battle of Stones River Battle of Kock (1939) Second Battle of El Alamein Culp's Hill Modoc War Philip Sheridan II Corps (ACW) Red River Campaign Battle of Waterloo Nathan Bedford Forrest Battle of Iwo Jima Battle of Kursk Battle of Fort Donelson United States Army American Revolutionary War Ulysses S.
