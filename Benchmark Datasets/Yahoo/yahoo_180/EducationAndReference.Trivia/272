what is the difference between a leopard and a jaguar a crocodile and an alligator mary kate and ashley olsen it freaks me out that i m not able to see the differences when i see them on tv what signs can i use to find the differences for example i know that leopards just live in africa and jaguars in south america but how can i differ them just by their appearance same with the reptiles and those clone twins leopard and jaguar leopard lives in africa asia spots are broken circles no dot in circle black marking on the backs of ears jaguar lives in central south america spots are circles dot in center of circle belly is white crocodile and alligator a crocodile has a very long narrow v shaped snout the alligator's snout is wider and u shaped the crocodile's upper and lower jaws are nearly the same width so the teeth are exposed all along the jaw line in an interlocking pattern even when the mouth is closed they also have an enormous th tooth on the lower jaw that is accommodated by depressions in the upper jaw just behind the nostrils an alligator on the other hand has a wider upper jaw so when its mouth is closed the teeth in the lower jaw fit into sockets of the upper jaw hidden from view only the teeth of the upper jaw are exposed along the lower jaw line crocodiles have a lighter olive brown coloration while alligators appear blackish the average alligator grows to about feet meters while crocodiles can reach feet meters or more that said there is one species of crocodile the african dwarf that barely reaches feet meters also the indian mugger crocodile has a decidedly u shaped snout breaking the v shaped rule mary kate and ashley i know you said based on appearance but an observation i made is that ashley talks more than mary kate does they are fraternal twins not identical mary kate dyes her hair brown while ashley dyes her hair blonde although they both seem to prefer black white grey and super high heels the way they put their looks together is completely different ashley generally dresses more sophisticated whereas mary kate likes to dress fun and funky Leopard Crocodile SuperCroc Tetrapod Alligatoridae Gharial American Alligator Cheetah Black panther Alligator Phytosaur Mandible Eryops Tuatara Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen Equine conformation Jaguar Leaf Horse Tyrannosaurus rex Jaw Pterosaur Black (people) Sperm Whale Textile manufacturing Violin Charge (heraldry) Tooth Eucynodontia Netsuke Meriones unguiculatus Hair color Evolution of the Horse Puma Chondrichthyes Snake Plesiosaur Cat Panthera hybrid Taikyoku shogi Platypus Reptile Days of our Lives American Crocodile Kimono Maxilla Race of Jesus Glossary of partner dance terms Dinosaur Physical attractiveness Dog Oceanic Whitetip Shark Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Giraffe Steve Irwin Great White Shark Fauna of Australia Happy Tree Friends Australian megafauna German Shepherd Dog Hangul White (people) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Ammonite Brown Bear Largest organism Ford Cortina Lion Dwarf Sperm Whale Human skin color Tank Everglades National Park Penguin American football Geography of Africa Pachypodium key to species Jaws (film) Knots Landing Pachypodium baronii Race Dai shogi Pysanka Paleocene Pachypodium brevicaule Mammal Lycanthropy Aerial (dance move) River shark Puberty Jacksonville Jaguars Wood The Dalek Invasion of Earth
