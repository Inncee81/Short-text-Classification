need your opinions on an incident my buddy was involved in details below a guy that i recently became friends with asked for my opinion on something and it perplexed me so i decided to ask you all he just finished freshman year at college first month he went kinda crazy but in the end fixed up his act and got decent grades anyhow back in september one saturday night someone he knew got drunk and passed out on her bed as a little prank he gave her a major wedgie and put a chocolate bar down her underwear eventually she found out it was him my friend naturally denied it but eventually felt guilty about it and confessed she said she wouldn't report him points he should have know better but he learned from his mistake i could tell he was feeling very guilty when looking back at it overall he's a nice guy actually he keeps going out of his way for favors like cleaning up someones vomit from drinking escorting girls back when it's really dark etc he keeps worrying that he will be reported i don't think so what about you all the young woman involved has said she will not report him so it's unlikely that she will the fact is just because we apologise doesn't always mean we're going to automatically feel great again sometimes remorse takes a long time to work through our system sometimes you regret things for a long time if he sees this young woman again he could ask if she'd be willing to talk with him for a minute he could buy her a coffee and explain that the matter has been preying on his mind he has obviously never thought of himself as the type to take advantage of someone in a drunken state and he's had a big shock to realise how easy it is to go down that path he'll find it easier to forgive himself for his behaviour if he stops worrying about how it will affect him and think about how it has affected her ask if it has done and if so is there anything he can do to help change that he will earn some respect from himself and maybe her and then he can put the matter behind him cheers Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Sin City Friends Knots Landing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct About a Boy The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Futurama (TV series - season 5) Pitaten God Emperor of Dune Characters in the Smurfs Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Sydney Riot of 1879 Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 The Catcher in the Rye Blood on the Tracks Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Big Brother UK series 6 Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Plame affair The Smoking Room The Subtle Knife Jon Secada Fiddler on the Roof One Tree Hill (TV series) The Emancipation of Mimi W.I.T.C.H.
