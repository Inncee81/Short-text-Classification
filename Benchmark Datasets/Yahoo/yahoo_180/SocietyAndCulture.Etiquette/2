what is a tactful way to get someone from calling you sweetie i have an aquaintance who calls everyone she knows honey and sweetie i don't really know this person have only met her a few times but this really bothers me i think it's one thing if a family member or significant other calls you honey or sweetie but not an aquaintance or stranger and my issue isn't that it's degrading to women but that it's just so fake so how do i tactfully ask someone to stop calling me by honey or sweetie without looking like a witch or coming across rude that would annoy me too say you know i think you are so cute for calling me sweetie or honey but for some reason i think i'd really appreciate being called your name here i don't mean anything by it i just wanted to ask you as a friend is that okay thanks so much Garfield The McGuire Sisters Questionable Content Knots Landing EastEnders Tiny Toon Adventures Galaxy Angel FoxTrot Kender Shaggy dog story Marilyn Monroe Frankie Vaughan Radiohead The Smoking Room Rent (musical) Social rule Witches (Discworld) Homer Simpson Fantastic Four Capital punishment Humphrey Bogart Honey and Clover AFI 100 Years series Sin City Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Wild Honey The Amber Spyglass The Drifters The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Friends Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious Moe Szyslak Jazz standard Azumanga Daioh Ron and Fez Situation comedy The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Pok__mon Live!
