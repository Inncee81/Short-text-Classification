tipping how much should you tip your hairdresser is there a certain percentage etc that is the norm' im a woman and the place i go to isnt really expensive so it seems odd giving a tip thats almost as much as the haircut yet im not sure if only giving a couple of pounds is slightly rude well in my own experience used to be a hairdresser i could do someones hair colour and cut for around and get around tip however the majority of customers tip and can range from the little old ladies giving you the coppers from their purse to the people who tip in complete honesty though all tips are much apreciated and even is greatly recieved because at the end of the day a tip is a kind gesture to show that the standards have been exceeded in customer care and service quality and you shouldnt feel obliged to tip anyone who hast met your standards Tip Haircut Clothing The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Strap-on dildo Barber Little Britain Cat Customs and etiquette of Japan Androgen insensitivity syndrome Snooker Internal ballistics Divorce Economy of the Republic of Ireland Broadband Internet access Contract Insurance Health insurance Iditarod Guinea pig Dog Social aspects of clothing Culture of the United States Gender role Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jewish view of marriage Airsoft Craps Kimono Spark plug Double bass Katana Gramophone record Social rule Service Shaving Illegal drug trade Call girl Network effect Billiards Information Technology Infrastructure Library Salute Telephone exchange Assault rifle Depilation Oral sex Ethics Infantilism Publicly funded medicine Explosive material M16 (rifle) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Relationship marketing Verizon Wireless Szlachta Reliability engineering Gas metal arc welding Welding Condom Nail (anatomy) Kohen Saxophone TLC Efficiency wages British Rail Class 42 Honesty The Critic Kender RuneScape quests Rigour Credit card Screw Social role of hair Price discrimination Education in the People's Republic of China Solar cell Transformer Viva Hate Roman currency Wind turbine Martial Graduate school Beautiful Life Diamond Original Amiga chipset Japanese tea ceremony Vowel Loyalty business model Australian Aboriginal languages Goodness and value theory Diamond cut Piano Asperger syndrome ALGOL 68 Violin Education in the United States Advertising Human sexual behavior
