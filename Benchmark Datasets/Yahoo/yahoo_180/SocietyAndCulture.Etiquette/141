reply card on invite how to write in names if the names of a married couple are john smith jane doe smith what do you wite on the line after m i started it as mr mrs john then quit b c i was nd guessing myself my hyphenated last name can confuse me on things like this mandy s great answer the question was pertaining to myself as the guest trying to fill out the blank card they do just say m thx i thought they fill that part in doesn't the reply card come to them blank except for the m shows what i know anyway i would just write out the whole thing or since it's so much to write out mr smith and mrs doe smith you shouldn't just do smith because they share that last part of the name because if she wanted people to do that she would have dropped her maiden name and become jane smith her name is doe smith his is smith spell it out to do otherwise would be similar to addressing a card to mr mrs libo because libowitz is long and it takes longer to write out and hey the both have libo in their last name i'd definately go with mr john smith mrs jane doe smith or just with mr smith and mrs doe smith the only exception to that is if she only kept the hyphenated name for official business i know of someone who took a hyphenated name for things like her medical practice taxes insurance and other legal stuff but when introducing herself in a casual setting she just used the second part that she shared with her husband and kids if you dont' know that's the case though go ahead and assume they have two different last names and fill the card out that way Family name Maiden name John Doe Hyphen EastEnders Hey Jude Dash Wheel of Fortune United States Postal Service Suffix (name) Friends What's My Line?
