offended because they weren't singled out i tried to ask this question in the shortest form possible but i seriously messed it up here s more of the story two people at my grandparents church got offended because i didn t send them a graduation invitation to their house now yesterday they sent me a graduation present a ring i don't want to thank them after the immature way they acted about not being singled out and there is a good reason they were not singled out no one was i had a terrible battle with depression the whole second semester and i wasn't sure of graduating until about a week before the ceremony itself so sending out personalized invitations to over a people was not an option addressing them would have taken at least or days the mail would have taken another or to get to them leaving at the most days of notification for the whole thing we put up the invitation as soon as we knew so the question i was really getting at was how do i resolve this without airing my dirty laundry that seems unbelievably childish to not want to thank them for a gift and a ring is a nice gift because they were hurt at not being invited personally since it's over your graduation that means you're stepping over into grown up world in grown up world it's best to not hold grudges and act childish in situations like this even if they were ugly about it earlier consider the nice gift they gave you as a way to smooth things over simply write them a thank you note for the ring mentioning that it's a lovely generous gift then let it go if your'e determined to make a stand against the way they acted and i really would not suggest doing so you need to send the ring back not keep it and refuse to thank them for it that is times more rude than how they acted and keep in mind their offended attitudes probably stemmed from a good place they thought you were close so were hurt when they weren't specifically invited they don't need the whole truth but a simple i'm sorry i didn't realize it would hurt or offend you would work nicely here Pitaten Shaggy dog story Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theodicy Contract Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Plame affair Royal Assent Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Past teachings of Prem Rawat Jon Secada Negima The Contender (television series) Surveillance Kender Evil The Apprentice 2 Tenshinhan Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Avenue Q Blood on the Tracks Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Socrates 1957 World Series Value system Characters in the Smurfs Current teachings of Prem Rawat Vegeta Time Out of Mind Germaine Greer Hey Jude Justification (theology) Appeal Priesthood (Mormonism) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism I Want to Hold Your Hand Highway 61 Revisited Summa Theologiae Theodore Kaczynski Customs and etiquette of Japan Eddie Guerrero Epistemology Ontological argument Funeral The Catcher in the Rye Panay incident Urantia German grammar Eastern Orthodox Church Expert system The nature of God in Western theology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Lovely Bones Downing Street memo Oasis (band) Make money fast Scientology beliefs and practices Sharon Tate The Smoking Room Gmail Forgiveness Live 8 Aerial (dance move) The Book of Five Rings Haven (TNG episode) Dispensationalism Child sexual abuse AFI 100 Years series Sydney Riot of 1879 Missouri Compromise Book of Mormon Plame affair timeline Procrastination Ranma __ characters Slow Train Coming Self Portrait Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters EastEnders The Chronicles of Narnia The Inside The Pet Sounds Sessions Meaning of life Kasparov versus The World Futurama (TV series - season 4) Singlish Traumatic incident reduction Smallville (Season 4)
