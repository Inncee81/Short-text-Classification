is it an example of bad etiquette to comment on a woman's pregnancy without being certain she is pregnant okay my sister got me a cute top for my birthday it's one of those with the high waist and is a little fuller at the bottom i think it might be an empire waist but i'm no fashion guru now i don't have a bad body or anything but with those particular styles if you don't have a body like mischa barton or paris hilton you can end up looking pregnant anyway my sons and i were at the supermarket this morning and the lady at the checkout line asked me if this next baby is a boy too i just kind of mumbled that i am not pregnant and she just went on about her business without even an i'm sorry was she rude in saying it to begin with then not apologizing or am i justified in being if not angry a little miffed p s the top is either going in the trash being donated or if any of you happen to have the figure for it you can have it for all i care if it's a child that's a whole other story kids will say those kinds of things i'm referring to adults in my opinion she made a bigger arse out of herself by not apologizing no i would not feel like this if i were pregnant it would mean i looked fat for a reason and what about people who are having trouble having children can you imagine what it would be like to be going through fertility treatments and stuff wear one of those blouses one day and have people asking about your pregnancy avie thanks by cute top i really meant the top looked really adorable on the hanger on me not so much lol it was rude hugely rude not only should one be sure before one says sanything one should wait for the pregnant person to announce the pregnancy themselves before acknowledging it Pregnancy Knots Landing Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Cytomegalovirus Humphrey Bogart AFI 100 Years series Buttocks Shaggy dog story Jennifer Lopez Breastfeeding Social rule Tightlacing Care Bears Sharon Tate Madonna (entertainer) Laura Schlessinger Kyle Broflovski What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
