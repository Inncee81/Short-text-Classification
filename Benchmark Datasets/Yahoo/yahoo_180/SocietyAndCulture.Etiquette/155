should i date my neighbor i moved into this apartment months ago i took a day off two days ago and i was laying on the couch when i got a knock on my balcony door my neighbor is a friend of mine so i knew it was her we went swimming and ended up hooking up what do i do she is really cool but i'm scared it will get weird sheesh im and she is if you like her date her if you are having second thoughts just go clarify things with her and make sure you're both on the same page with everything maybe she's just looking to 'hook up' herself and didn't think you'd ask her out anyway on a logistical level i think you have a good situation if you do date because you won't have to waste time commuting but also have your own private spaces good luck McMansion Characters of Naruto Shaggy dog story Shit Daylight saving time Friends StarCraft: Uprising Knight Rider Satchel Paige Futurama (TV series - season 5) The writing of Principia Mathematica Kim Possible Pop punk Marilyn Monroe Humphrey Bogart Full Metal Panic?
