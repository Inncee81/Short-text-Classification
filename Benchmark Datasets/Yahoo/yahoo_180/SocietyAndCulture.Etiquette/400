psycho moms this is getting ridiculous i work under a pediatritian's office once already this week i was torn to shreds by a mom see the question on my profile right now there is a large executive meeting going on in my office at the same time there are four kids in the hall sliding up and down the staircase causing a dreadful racket i could tell the meeting was being disturbed by the noise so i went out into the hallway and approached the kids kindly saying hey guys can you try to keep it down a little out here we have some very importnt work going on i was very kind and when speaking to them and they all nodded politely and the noise stopped for a second then mom came out from around the corner abruptly hung up her cell phone and tore into me she was yelling what gives you the right to reprimand my kids you know you should just talk to the parents you have no right to reprimand my children was i wrong here or are these moms just nuts really this is the second time this week what rock did these women crawl out from under verol wow that's awful i would much rather the mother scream at me than take her frustrations out on her child i would have had a few choice words for that woman that woman is nuts you didn't reprimand anyone you asked them to keep it down my initial thought would have been the moment you stopped paying attention to your children was the moment i was pretty much forced to take care of them for you of course i would have just smiled and said ma'am your kids are being kinda loud let's try to keep it down okay thanks so much and gone back to work i just treat people like that like children sickly sweet though kill them with kindness Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Kyle Broflovski Codename: Kids Next Door Sin City Psycho Yoko Ono Columbine High School massacre The Marshall Mathers LP Shawn Michaels Recurring South Park characters Russian joke Prank flash Ron and Fez Rent (musical) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Milton H.
