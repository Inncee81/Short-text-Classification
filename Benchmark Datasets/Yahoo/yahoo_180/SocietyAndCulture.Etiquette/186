what is appropriate female attire for a date to sky bar on montrose on a thursday salsa night they have a live band that plays salsa merengue and bachata dress jeans and dressy top sky bar in houston well i happen to know a thing or two about salsa thursdays at sky bar first some general advice in case he's a salsaholic and you're expecting to dance non stop the whole night hair make up hair up and easy on the make up because you will be sweating a lot accessories careful with earrings that dangle they have a tendency to get caught on his shirt and cause you lots of pain as a result clothing make sure that you test whatever top or dress you plan to wear so that nothing pops out in the middle of a double right turn use double sided tape if you feel that popping out is a risk if wearing a dress make sure that it doesn't do a marylin monroe while your turning unless you like the attention shoes wear comfy shoes no spike heels unless you're used to dancing in those also wear something with a smooth sole as rubber soles tend to create more friction with you and the floor and therefore make dancing more difficult if you have dance heels that's your best bet personally i think nice pants a sexy top with a hint of cleavage or a lot depending on the message you're trying to send matching accessories nice comfortable sexy heels will do the trick if he likes you what you wear won't be as important as letting him know that you like him too if he's not a salsaholic and you don't expect to do much dancing but rather sit around sipping margaritas while others have all the fun then you can pretty much wear whatever you want enjoy you should take some salsa lessons while you're at it because dancing salsa is a blast Shoe Professional wrestling match types Aerial (dance move) Violin Irish dance Music of Puerto Rico Glossary of partner dance terms Fast bowling Social aspects of clothing Characters in the Smurfs Clothing Cello Volleyball Sailing Comanche Skinhead Professional wrestling slang Skateboarding trick Marilyn Monroe Salsa music High-heeled shoe Social rule Kilt Trailer Park Boys Little Britain Ballroom dance Undergarment Suit (clothes) Paul Is Dead Mattress Poker jargon Madonna (entertainer) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Time Out of Mind Sock Strap-on dildo Blackjack Lindy Hop Bob Jones University The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Kimono Humphrey Bogart Beavis and Butt-head Jon Secada The Apprentice 2 Diving suit Punk fashion Badminton Fruits Basket Milton H.
