was my neighbour rude or was i my neighbour is quite nice but she's got kids who are all really really noisy sometimes they're out pretty late at night but she's out with them anyway the kids are out before am after school weekends etc and they're always noisy we've never said anything because other than the noise they're ok neighbours last night my dog started barking we don't know why but he did it for about minutes my neighbour came over and asked me to make him stop the noise he never barks literally never i was speechless at first i started apologising she said it's ok he's just being so noisy so i said well not as loud as your kids but i said it sort of laughingly she got this weird look on her face and left this morning when i waved to her she ignored me and turned away was i rude no you were not the rude one she thinks the world revolves around her the kids' behavior is habitual whereas the dog's behavior was a one time thing anyone who would take the time to come over and cause a rift between the two of you over something that only happened once is petty and thinks the sun rises and sets for them and to add insult to injury you've been putting up with her kids' noise for a long time you could have been petty right back and said something like well then tell your kids to be quiet too but instead you tried to make light of it to salvage the relationship and she crapped all over that i'm totally on your side with this one people like her are my biggest pet peeve in life Shaggy dog story Hearing impairment Neighbours Social rule Dog training Shawn Michaels Friends Futurama (TV series - season 5) Spidey Super Stories Silent Night, Deadly Night Spot the Dog Obedience training Mojave people AFI 100 Years series Our Gang Russian joke The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Life and Times of Juniper Lee WNNX (FM) Breath of Fire III Avenue Q Kylie Minogue Teacher's Pet (Disney) Kodocha The Human Stain Sonic Youth About a Boy The Unquiet Dead Aerial (dance move) Forty-seven Ronin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) School bus Hush...
