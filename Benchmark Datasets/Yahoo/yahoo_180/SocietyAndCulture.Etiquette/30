do you think it is proper for a bother to give his sister a dozen red roses because she is going to a prom if she has a boyfriend that she has been dating for around years why or why do you think a brother should give her flowers at all if she is going to prom if so what kind i don't have a problem with roses i just don't think a brother should be giving his sister red roses get any other color of rose but not red if a brother wants to give flowers to his sister i think it would be better to get a nice spring mix or something like that no it is not proper for a brother to give his sister red roses however many people don't know this and i wouldn't assume anything freaky based on this alone it's just a breach of etiquette a white or yellow rose maybe or like you said a spring mix i honestly don't think flowers are appropriate anyway perhaps something less associated with romance or intimacy Rose Guns N' Roses Tournament of Roses Parade Flower Friends The Ashlee Simpson Show Olivia Newton-John Anne Boleyn Wars of the Roses W.I.T.C.H.
