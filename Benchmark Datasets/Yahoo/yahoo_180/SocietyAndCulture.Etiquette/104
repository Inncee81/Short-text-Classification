do you rsvp when the invitation requires it or do you just show up i have noticed that in my wedding and also at another party i am throwing people don't rsvp and then show up or people that rsvp don't even show up as soon as i receive an invitation i rsvp i wish more people would do it by e mail because this is the most convenient for many people now when i plan a party i usually expect half the people who did not rsvp to just show up if i know them well i will call them to see if they are coming and give them a hard time for not rsvping parties are expensive and getting an accurate head count is essential for some events therefore just showing up is extremely rude and inconsiderate Craps Social rule Request for Comments Census The nature of God in Western theology Volleyball Evite Blackjack Second Vatican Council The Daily Show Integrated services Proportional representation Canadian federal election, 1993 U.S. Electoral College Appeal Political campaign Mixed martial arts Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Hard disk Surveillance Gmail Cultural Revolution Fast bowling Roman currency Internet Group Management Protocol Aerial (dance move) Probability Ron and Fez Theory of conduct United Kingdom general election, 2005 Digital photography Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Health insurance Marriage Skateboarding trick Insurance Indian general elections, 2004 RuneScape skills I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Mattress Poker jargon Motion picture rating system Four square We Belong Together Stopping e-mail abuse Voting system Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus A Milhouse Divided 1957 World Series Paul Martin Advance fee fraud Coin flipping Social Security (United States) The McGuire Sisters Beer Pong Mad Money Leasehold estate Air navigation Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, 1968 ELO rating system Saturday Night Live The Marriage of Figaro Microeconomics Mail Mixtape Falsifiability Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Contract bridge IP address Damien (South Park episode) The Rocky Horror Picture Show Jewish services Analog-to-digital converter Piccolo Junior Saga The Championships, Wimbledon Mormon missionary Electrophysiology Martial art Baseball Contract Patrick Hillery Rugby league positions Binoculars Crossword Kurdish people Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Kasparov versus The World Gross domestic product 24 (television) Conservative Party (UK) Maya calendar Play party (BDSM) HIV test Late Night with Conan O'Brien 1986 National League Championship Series Spanish transition to democracy Tag
