wedding invite problem help what's the best way to handle this this is kind of a long story but i will try to sum it up in a nutshell i invited select people on my step dad's side of the family the reason i had to be select is because most of his family is very rude and downright mean at times which is completely opposite of my mom's side of the family anyway i invited my step aunt and her children but i did not invite her on again off again husband for many reasons he is the definition of a scumbag he says rude crude things and has no manners what so ever the last time i saw him he told me to ask my mom if he could suck her pu y he was always crude to my mom and makes me feel very uncomfortable howver i just heard that he might be coming to the wedding i haven't received the rsvp yet but when i do what should i do if she rsvp's that he is coming i know my fiance won't allow it either because he knows even more than i can type please help if possible i think you should have your step dad say something to his sister explaining your feelings make sure she understands that she and the children are more than welcome but if she brings him along they will be asked to leave if your step dad isn't able to make the conversation you do it asap don't even wait for the rsvp card just call her up and say i don't know if they invitation makes this clear but you and the children are invited but your husband is not he and my mother haven't gotten along in the past put it diplomatically and i don't think it is a good idea to get the two of them in the same room be firm but don't say anything nasty if she gets angry let her but don't let yourself get swept up in her emotions remember this is your wedding you have the right to have guests there you enjoy and not have to cater to people who you don't Social rule Futurama (TV series - season 5) Shaggy dog story Friends Theory of conduct Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Haven (TNG episode) Avenue Q God Emperor of Dune EastEnders Time Out of Mind The nature of God in Western theology The Shining (film) Kender The Young Ones (TV series) Pok__mon Live!
