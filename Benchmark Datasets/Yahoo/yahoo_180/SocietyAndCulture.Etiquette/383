is it inappropriate to wear the ring after the break up for my twentieth birthday this past january my now ex boyfriend gave me a gorgeous birthstone ring we'd only been going out four months and it wasn't an engagement ring although i think he might have thought of it as some sort of promise ring he never came out and said that it was directly but i got that impression from the way he acted about it we ended up breaking up but i still have the ring i want to wear it but i'm not sure if that's exactly 'appropriate ' it just seems kind of weird to be wearing the ex's ring am i totally crazy here or should i leave it in the jewelry box treat it as a gift given to you when times were better if you can't get over thinking of him each time you look at it then you are better off giving it away however if you enjoy wearing it because you think it's pretty release the weird feelings and enjoy it there were no strings attached to it and you shouldn't worry Birthday Engagement ring Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Kodocha Charmed The Ashlee Simpson Show Jennifer Lopez Theory of conduct Social rule Eddie Guerrero "Weird Al" Yankovic Spidey Super Stories Piccolo Junior Saga Humphrey Bogart The Contender (television series) Earring Greg Valentine One Ring Wedding ring Magic (illusion) Strap-on dildo Infantilism Jewellery Friends Diamond Totally Spies!
