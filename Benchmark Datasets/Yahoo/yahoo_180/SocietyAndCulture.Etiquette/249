was this rude i'm in cook county illinois and one of my good friends an inmate asked me to pick up her belongings since she is transferring out of the county jail to a state prison she said she spoke with her social worker and that the social worker said that she arranged for her property to be mailed to me then she said to call the trust fund property office just to make sure this all happened last week mind you so i called the trust fund office and they said that they do not mail the inmates belongings and that the inmate would have to write a letter stating that they want me to have their property so my friend called me back monday night and i told her what the office said so she said ok i will mail you a letter first thing tues morning she also said that she should be transferred either thurs or friday of this week so i received the letter yesterday and i called the office up and asked them could still pick up an inmates property saturday and they said yes as long as you have the letter the inmate wrote i said fine so i went today to collect her belongings i waited in line and when it was my turn this police officer looked at me up and down and rudely asked who i was i stated the inmates name and my reason for coming immediately she was like well you have to a letter stating that and since you don't have it you have to leave i said ma'am i have the letter in my hand then she briefly glanced at it and was like this isn't sufficient enough and is the inmate still at this facility i said i'm not sure because she was supposedly leaving this thurs or friday she was like well i can't help you because she may not be here and so she will have to write another letter from the state prison she is transferring to which i may here from her in about weeks so the officer then said was like sorry sweetie and smirked and then said next i was so pissed i plan on calling the trust fund office first thing monday morning my friend couldn't get her items herself because she is being transferred to another prison that's why she asked me to take her property like i said i called the head of the trustfund property dept before i went to go collect her belongings they said a written letter with her signature would be sufficient enough to rev tomcat she's giving you a hard time because she can you know just pushing her weight around wants to give you the run around don't let her get away with that and yes she's rude report her immediately edit tomcat i liked your thoughts on her problem but you know no worries about smuggling drugs out when her friend went in she was already searched and if she had drugs on her it was confiscated by the guards sometimes i wonder what the guards do with all what they confiscate Social rule Sydney Riot of 1879 Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Eddie Guerrero Simon Adebisi Escape from New York Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Burr Redding Vernon Schillinger Shawn Michaels Ocean's Twelve Hurricane Katrina timeline Captain Thunderbolt Knots Landing Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Schapelle Corby Prisons in the United States James Hanratty Secretar__a de Inteligencia Operation Market Garden Velvet Revolution Prisoner (TV series) Sin City Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests Cornelia Rau Miguel Alvarez Night (book) EastEnders Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Paul Is Dead Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Vivian Solon The Star Wars Holiday Special Ron and Fez Psychiatric hospital Time Out of Mind Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The nature of God in Western theology Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Black Panther Party The Inside Jon Secada United States Postal Service The Invisibles Property (ownership right) Good Morning, Vietnam Charles Graner Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sharon Tate Enrique Morales Cindy Sheehan The Shawshank Redemption John Dillinger 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Theory of conduct Blood on the Tracks Extreme Programming Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mordechai Vanunu Piccolo Junior Saga Ex-gay About a Boy Martin Luther King, Jr. Ryan O'Reilly The Emancipation of Mimi Weathermen Jean Charles de Menezes Make money fast 2001 anthrax attacks Singapore gay equality movement Donald Rumsfeld Ben Johnson (athlete) The Chemical Brothers Slow Train Coming Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina The Silence of the Lambs Plame affair Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Pitaten Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Dead Like Me British Free Corps May 2005 in Australia and New Zealand Live 8 CPU cache Surveillance Advance fee fraud MoveOn
