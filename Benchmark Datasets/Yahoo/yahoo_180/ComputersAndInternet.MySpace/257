how do i remove a myspace layout that was created through it's profile editor i've actually asked this already but the answer i chose was actually kind of wrong so anyways i've used myspace's profile editor to make a layout but based on second thought i didn't like using it and i wanted the original myspace layout back the thing is for myspace's own profile editor it doesn't allow you to copy and paste it into any of the sections anymore eg about me and the layout just automatically applies on its own no html code shows up in any of the sections so i can't delete it i've tried contacting them but no answers back can someone please help well when i do click clear all my myspace turns out with a gray background and its still not the original layout or do i have to wait the same thing happened to me too i was actually jst testing it but i hated the results wht you do is you click clear all it will reset everything that you did on the profile editor it will only refer to the codes you used MySpace Cascading Style Sheets HTML element Mozilla Application Suite Extreme Programming H2G2 Theory of conduct The Star Wars Holiday Special Cross site scripting Enterprise content management Diablo II: Lord of Destruction CPU cache Gmail Nine Inch Nails Episodes of Lost (Season 2) One Tree Hill (TV series) HTML editor HTML XML Debugging Unicode Calvin and Hobbes Time Out of Mind OpenDocument Macromedia Flash HyperCard Bob and George Portable Document Format Downing Street memo Little Britain Opera (web browser) Editor TV Tome Philosophical skepticism Hey Jude Flat file database A Tale of a Tub Jeopardy!
