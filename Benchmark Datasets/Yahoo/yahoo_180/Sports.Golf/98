in major golf tournaments is it improper to wear short pants apparently it's like degrees in ok and while everyone else caddies etc are wearing shorts all the players are wearing long pants the men are barred from wearing shorts one player whose name i can't remember wore them in i think the pga about years ago changing in a port a potty on the last hole in direct violation of the commissioner until a few years ago the caddies were not allowed to wear shorts in all the events but a couple of heat strokes took care of that i think that the masters still has a ban on caddy shorts but that tourney is in april so it isn't so hot the women can wear shorts or skirts or pants they are governed by the lpga and the rules are different plus i think it has the ability to sell tickets although there are some that you want to see covered as much as possible Golf Caddy Michelle Wie The Open Championship PGA Tour Women's majors LPGA Professional golf tours Vijay Singh U.S. Open (golf) The Big Break Tiger Woods Annika S__renstam Skirt and dress Shorts Softball PGA European Tour Lee Trevino PGA Championship Bob Jones University June 2005 in sports Trousers Fred Couples Japanese tea ceremony Ice hockey Gary Player Social aspects of clothing Greg Norman Undergarment Davis Love III Sauna Nick Faldo Majors Hazeltine National Golf Club Ernie Els Official World Golf Rankings The Golf Channel Senior PGA Championship Basketball United States Golf Association Se Ri Pak May 2005 in sports The Masters Tournament Associated Press Athlete of the Year Match play Golf glossary Arnold Palmer Grand Slam (golf) Senior majors PGA Grand Slam of Golf Sam Snead Professional golfer June 2004 in sports Volleyball Golf club (equipment) Figure skating SpongeBob SquarePants Paula Creamer Football (soccer) Hot Shots Golf (series) The PLAYERS Championship Raymond Floyd Pantyhose Ryder Cup Penny Arcade (comic) FUTURES Tour Babe Zaharias U.S. Women's Open Championship (golf) French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools LPGA Championship Ian Woosnam Billiards Tobacco advertising Sudden death George Archer World Golf Hall of Fame Sport rowing Ultimate (sport) Floorball Scottsdale, Arizona The Sound and the Fury Baltusrol Golf Club Laserdisc Tennis Michael Campbell WGC-World Cup Cowboy United States Marine Corps Sports timeline Quizbowl University of Arizona HSBC World Match Play Championship New Zealand Open Las Vegas metropolitan area Tournament Phil Mickelson Gramophone record Culture of the United States
