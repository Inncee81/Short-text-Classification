what do you think of rory sabatini having that fan removed last weekend i think he was unreasonable they are there to play for the fans like any other sport his job as he called it is to bring money in and you do that by fans and sponsors if theres no fans there will be no sponsors i hate when players forget about the people that keep them where they are in a sense they wouldn't earn what they earn in the scheme of things National Football League Steffi Graf Make money fast Rory Gallagher Cincinnati Bengals Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles Satchel Paige U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Indianapolis 500 Family Feud Major League Baseball television contracts Eric Bischoff Baseball Hollywood Squares Hitman (computer game) Knots Landing Negro league baseball Gabriela Sabatini Piccolo Junior Saga Professional sports Los Angeles Clippers Final Fantasy IX Chicago White Sox History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Indiana Pacers Babe Ruth New York Jets Rafael Sabatini Star Trek: Enterprise Leeds United F.C.
