which of these balls is best for me titleist pro v nike one callaway hx tour i'm not the best golfer in the world but i like to use nice balls i average i'm currently hitting the nike powerlong and the bridgestone e which one of these balls is your favorite and which one do you think would work best for me your score is not what effects the kind of ball your play it is your clubhead speed a prov x would not be worth it to you if you have a clubhead speed below mph or mph for a prov x i wouldn't suggest the nike one black or platinum as there are better balls to get for the same price the callaway is a nice golf ball with a very soft face it doesn't require as much clubhead speed as the prov x does but the softer face does have its downsides the most obvious one is that it will get cut up the first time you use it the grooves in your golf club tear up the face and if you hit a tree or cart path the ball cover will be scuffed beyond use don't let me mislead you though the hx tour is a great ball i hope this description helps Golf club (equipment) Golf Golf glossary The Big Break Champ Car Tire Nike, Inc.
