pesticide use in golfing more organic courses i would really like to go golfing at a course that doesnt use toxic chemicals to make the grass totally fake i wish more people supported organic courses and stopped going to the courses that just spay herbicides and pesticides to cure the bug weed problems in organic gardening you have to have more skill with how nature works and you'd have to have more educated greenskeepers but i think its worth it for the future kids of the world that we dont have all this crap on the surface where it eventually runs off into the same water we drink bathe in and all these problems for a game but im sure dow doesnt mind of course what you're saying is right but these chemicals keep the grass greener for a longer time with less damage to the grass it's a cheaper alternative to organic gardening which would be a more time consuming and more expensive problem but i do agree with you Pesticide Golf Organic food Herbicide Organic farming Green Revolution Sewage treatment Plastic Weed Mosquito Lawn Genetically modified food Roundup Dow Chemical Company Biological pest control Genetic engineering Agricultural wastewater treatment Weed control Hydrogen economy Hydroponics Organic gardening Pok__mon types Illegal drug trade Gypsy moth Alcohol fuel Hydrochloric acid Pesticide poisoning Pok__mon Abilities Perfume Irrigation Biodynamic agriculture Pollinator decline Poison Bhopal disaster Agriculture Cryonics Bong Biodiesel Dioxin Cat Ecology Future energy development DDT IBM PC compatible Compost The Coca-Cola Company Polychlorinated biphenyl Diseases of the honeybee 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid RuneScape skills Petroleum Wastewater Water Multiple chemical sensitivity Creeping Charlie Allergy Hazardous waste Pesticide toxicity to bees Diver rescue Nutrition Atomic Kitten Industrial wastewater treatment Water purification The Skeptical Environmentalist Blackjack Botany Miniature golf Eutrophication Food irradiation Caddy Craps Fire extinguisher Implications of peak oil Energy development Fight Club Benzene Septic tank Parkinson's disease Inkjet printer Moss Pepsi-Cola Oil depletion Water resources Foodborne illness Croquet Energy economics Chronic fatigue syndrome Arsenic Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Toxicity Waste management Welding Zerg Corrosion Hamster Renewable energy Mattress Phosphorus trichloride Tampon Acetic acid
