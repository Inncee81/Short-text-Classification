why does everyone expect me to be over this so soon i am and i had a miscarriage july th i was weeks along with my first child it's been a month and i still cry when i see babies pregnant women and even baby clothing certain songs even make me cry my boyfriend of years the baby's father disengaged from me completly and refused to talk about it saying it hurts too much i understand that it hurts but i feel like we would both be better if we could talk about it he finally came back around but still refuses to talk about it my mom dad as well as alot of other family friends seems to think i should be over this already telling me i need to move on i don't see why they feel like this is something i should be over already of all people i expected my mother to understand my pain as she had miscarriages before she had me i just don't understand how they expect me to be over loosing my first child so soon i mean its only been a month i'm still depressed and can't seem to move on any suggestions for coping please serious answers only if you can't be nice don't answer no the pregnancy was not planned but we were both very happy about it we are both seniors in college and felt we could manage rosesharon having a child with a disability does not ruin your life it only enhances it i am a psychology major and hope to work with autistic disabled children to me it would be a blessing to be given a special child to love protect and care for not a burden i'm so sorry for your loss i understand exactly how you feel i had a miscarriage in may and i felt terrible for a long while some people even had the nerve to ask me only days later if i was going to continue going to school i had just got accepted to a ph d program around the time i found out i was pregnant i had decided not to go to school so that i could take care of my babies yes they were twins i have still decided not to go to school my husband and i moved away and we are looking forward to trying again for our family i've just now started to come around and have made things a lot easier for my husband he was devestated as well but he tried to be the strong one for both of us i was so angry for a while and hated the fact that other women were pregnant or giving birth but i realized i shouldn't be so hateful and should be happy for them its good to write things down and look at the bright side of life you're still young and have years left to have children plus i don't think you can ever get over the loss of a child whether it was a miscarriage or later in life i'm thankful that i had other ladies to talk to who had experienced a miscarriage i'm even more grateful that they came forward and talked to me about their own loss that's really what helped me the most one of my coworkers told me sometimes we go through things in life so that we can help others in need and that's what i'm doing for you now another cowork of mine had a miscarriage about years ago and she said she still puts up a christmas ornament for that baby since he she was to be born around christmas time she said her husband used to get upset about it but its her way of always remembering the child she lost i'm sorry you had to go through this but it will only make you stronger later i know you may not see it now and you may have really rough times up ahead but believe me time does heal i wish you the best of luck and don't ever forget about this baby you lost and don't listen to those who say you should move on with your life bless you sorry if this was too long Friends Miscarriage EastEnders Pregnancy Kodocha Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Abortion debate Theory of conduct Pitaten Social rule Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Autism About a Boy Jon Secada Hollyoaks Cliff Richard One Tree Hill (TV series) Breastfeeding Leo Wyatt Humphrey Bogart Marilyn Monroe Boston Public Childbirth Neighbours Le Malade imaginaire History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Melanie Wilkes Everwood Kim Possible Clinical depression Days of our Lives The Shining (film) Spina bifida Incarnations of Immortality Stillbirth Harry Potter (character) Eddie Guerrero Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Darth Vader She Loves You Honey and Clover Sami Brady Grief Virgin Mary in Islam Sharon Tate The Amber Spyglass Characters in the Smurfs Anne Boleyn Dinah Marler Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) One Life to Live Grandview, U.S.A.
