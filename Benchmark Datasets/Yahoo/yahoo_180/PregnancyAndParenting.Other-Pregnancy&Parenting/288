arkansas family has th child what do you think according to news stories they were talking about having more kids within the hour after their th baby was born my goodness personal opinion these people must be crazy what do you think i had no idea id get everyone's undies in a bunch lol reeeelax life is too short guys to get all up in a fuss about nothing if it bugs you that much that i was curious to know what others thought they don't answer these folks have chosen to be on several tv specials and even has a series about their lives call me crazy but it seems it's their intent to have people talk about them they clearly know people who dont share the same lifestyle would find it interesting so i think the reason we've heard so much about them is because they chose to be in the limelight i have two thoughts on this issue i am envious i really want a big family of both my own adopted children and i am having a hard time convincing hubby of it isn't the size of the family that bothers me it is the fact that they are a loving wonderful family that can obviously afford lots of children it would be nice if they were willling to share that with some of the many children without families via fostering or adoption just my cents Theory of conduct W.
