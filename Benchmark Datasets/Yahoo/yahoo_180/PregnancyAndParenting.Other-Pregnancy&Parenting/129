do you recognize this baby picture my boyfriend told me that he has a baby from previous marriage i only know him for a month and i can believe him but i got a strange phone call from someone saying that he isn't always what he says that he is so now i dont know if this is his baby or not or he just got this picture on the internet somewhere by the way i couldn't get a bigger picture cause computer is more old http i photobucket com albums x rlymir mybaby jpg i was thinking if he got this picture on internet lol i once had a guy lie to me and tell me that he had a kid when he didn't i have no idea why he felt compelled to do so but i was shocked when i found out he had made it up lol it's the strangest thing i wonder if he thought girls would be more attracted to him if they thought he had a child who knows i would ask him more questions about his kid and from his answers you'll probably be able to tell if he's lying or not EastEnders Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Kodocha Jennifer Lopez Internet phenomenon Blood on the Tracks The Ashlee Simpson Show Kyle Broflovski One Tree Hill (TV series) The Strangerhood Shaggy dog story Empire Burlesque Slow Train Coming Kylie Minogue Atomic Kitten Prank flash Avenue Q The Cure Jon Secada Roswell UFO incident Knots Landing Social rule Beatles for Sale Bon Jovi Neighbours Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Little Britain Memento (film) Good Times Milton H.
