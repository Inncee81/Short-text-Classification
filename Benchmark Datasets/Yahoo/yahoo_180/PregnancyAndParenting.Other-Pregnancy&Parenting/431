is this an appropriate song to play at my best friends memorial i am in the process of making a photo slide tribute with music to be played at my best friends memorial i have a song in mind that seems very fitting apparently i am not the first to use this song in this manner there is a video with the same song i want to use http www youtube com watch v oyehqfeko k what are your thoughts my only concern is that the music is a little rowdy sorry i know this is not the best place to ask this question but i know the people in this section of yahoo answers are honest and caring watching over me lyrics iced earth i had a friend many years ago one tragic night he died the saddest time of my life for weeks and weeks i cried through the anger and through the tears i've felt his spirit through the years i'd swear he's watching me guiding me through hard times chorus i feel it once again it's overwhelming me his spirit's like the wind the angel guarding me oh i know oh i know he's watching over me oh i know oh i know he's watching over me we shared dreams like all best friends blood brothers at the age of ten we lived reckless he paid the price but why why did he have to die it still hurts me to this day am i selfish for feeling this way i know he's an angel now together we'll be someday i feel it once again it's overwhelming me his spirit's like the wind the angel guarding me oh i know oh i know he's watching over me oh i know oh i know he's watching over me i think that this song is great if you feel like it is appropriate and you think that people there at the memorial would be ok with it then great i have had friends die last year and one the year before that its hard and i wish you the best of luck i can tell you that with gods help and understanding of why it happened will help your healing process but the words to this song is amazing and i love it Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Religious Society of Friends Time Out of Mind A Course In Miracles Rich Mullins Reaction to the assassination of John F.
