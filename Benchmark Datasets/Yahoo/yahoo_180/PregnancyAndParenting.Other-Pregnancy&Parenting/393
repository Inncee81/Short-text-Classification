seeking advice from parents whose little ones share a room when my son now months old sleeps through the night regularly we intend to move his crib from the hallway into his yr old sister's room she is excited about the idea she loves him madly but i'm worried about how to make it work especially with his nap time and the possibility of nighttime playing any advice is appreciated so much thanks we did something similar when my second son was born once he was sleeping through the night we moved him into a bedroom with my older son who was for the naps not sure if your daughter is still napping or not my older son was phasing them out when we moved them in together so i would put the baby down for naps in the bedroom and my older son i'd have lie on my bed for naps or just quiet time bedtime was never an issue i put a small fan in their room for some white noise but honestly they never fooled around and never wake eachother up i guess i was lucky we have since moved and my boys are now and and they elected to continue to share a room in the new house even though we have more than enough bedrooms now my sisters two girls who are months apart have shared a room since they were and they did have a tendency to fool around at bedtime and not go to sleep so she arranged the room so they couldn't really see eachother from their cribs even bought one of those screens to put up as a divider so she did that and would be very firm at bedtime about no talking etc its worked out so far good luck Sleep Insomnia Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Fancy Crane Siesta Out-of-body experience Co-sleeping Friends Sharon Tate Miss Saigon Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Mattress One Tree Hill (TV series) Cliff Richard Sudden infant death syndrome The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) McMansion Care Bears Narcolepsy Fitz Hugh Ludlow The Young Ones (TV series) Kitchen New Alliance Party Sin City Sleep debt Lisa's First Word Slow Train Coming Avenue Q One Life to Live Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Urinary incontinence Wheel of Fortune Liam Gallagher Heart of Gold (Firefly) Mama's Family Cat Elizabeth Smart kidnapping Jon Secada The Jazz Singer Days of our Lives Child sexuality The Virgin Suicides King Lear Donald Neilson Kurt Cobain Roxette Elvis Presley The Shining (film) The Catcher in the Rye Situation comedy The Adventures of Pete & Pete Humphrey Bogart Phoebe Halliwell The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kodocha The Star Wars Holiday Special AFI 100 Years series The Fairly OddParents The Marriage of Figaro Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) She Loves You Ty Cobb The X-Files (season 1) Full House W.I.T.C.H.
