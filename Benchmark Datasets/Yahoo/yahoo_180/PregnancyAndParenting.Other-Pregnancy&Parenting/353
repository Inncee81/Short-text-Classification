what to do miscarriage i'm in a mess realy i had a misscarage in april and an ectopic this month and feel sad but have not told anyone hubby or family i find it hard cause my sister had a stillborn daughter last year she the had a misscarage but it was twins and she was born this year and is beautiful i have a daughter months and she is a very happy beautiful child i feel i can't be sad cause my situation is minor in comparison what do i do hubby knows i was pregnant but not my pain oh you poor thing you shouldn't feel guilty about feeling sad you've been through an upsetting ordeal and its natural to feel sad you need to grieve i think you should tell your husband how you feel he might be feeling the same way but is scared to say anything we tend to sympathise with mums and forget about the dads don't we i'm sure your sister wouldn't sit and make comparisons either sad news is sad news she may even be of some comfort to you because she has been there too maybe speak to a health visitor about counselling it might be easier to talk with someone who knows all about this type of situation and isn't involved in any way i don't know if you remember me i emailed you last week to see how you had gone on at the hospital couldn't stop thinking about you and i know its probably not at the forefront of your mind at the moment but the fact you were able to keep your tube is good news i know girls who lost tubes due to ectopics i honestly wish you all the best for the future and i hope you start to heal soon EastEnders Social rule Friends Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Miscarriage Theory of conduct Pitaten About a Boy Cindy Sheehan Time Out of Mind The Smoking Room Marilyn Monroe Neighbours Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theodicy Humphrey Bogart Sharon Tate Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blood on the Tracks Plame affair Clinical depression Days of our Lives Scenes from a Memory Jon Secada The Shining (film) Obstetrics Abortion debate Negima Abortion Pregnancy Terri Schiavo Phoebe Halliwell Breastfeeding The Inside Ranma __ characters Sami Brady Chobits characters Happiness Melanie Wilkes Laura Schlessinger Marie Antoinette Scientology beliefs and practices Yoko Ono Ectopic pregnancy The Death Gate Cycle Children of Dune Kurt Cobain Dead Like Me Charmed Major League Baseball television contracts The Emancipation of Mimi Transactional analysis Wonderland (McFly album) A Course In Miracles The Contender (television series) Hollyoaks Communication skill Eddie Guerrero The Catcher in the Rye Peter Pan Piccolo Junior Saga Bhajan Mojave people Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Guiding Light Leo Wyatt 2000 Australian Grand Prix Parsifal The Ashlee Simpson Show Cardiac arrhythmia Stillbirth Dog training Everwood K' Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Maria Korp Schapelle Corby English grammar Liza of Lambeth Childbirth Little Britain Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Karl Rove Fiddler on the Roof Year of the Spider Pok__mon Live!
