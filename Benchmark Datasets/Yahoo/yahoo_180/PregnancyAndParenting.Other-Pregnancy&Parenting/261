i'm months pregnant and my husband is very unsupportive even insensitive he is going out nearly times a week drinking and partying he comes home at all hours of the night what if i go into labor and he isn't around or he's drunk i try to confront him about it and all he does is get mad and i'm the nagging wife i'm sick of it he doesn't understand how tired i am and how i've been feeling more and more uncomfortable i need help with daily chores and he doesn't do anything it's like his so called friends are more important than me and the baby he really has no clue what awaits him once the baby gets here he says he's just getting all of his partying out now before she gets here but that doesn't make me feel any better i have to go back to work and she's going to stay with him i'm not leaving my baby with a hungover dad worse i want to be the stay at home parent but i can't due to finances i feel like he isn't ready to become a dad he wanted this baby so much and yet even when i told him he didn't really seem that happy i'm so sorry i think that what your husband is experiencing is a major life change that he doesn't know how to deal with so he is going out and acting irresponsibly so he doesn't have to think about it i'd bet he has a lot of apprehension and emotions that he feels like he cant sort out right now i would ask to talk to him and then do it talk dont nag dont yell i think men just tune out when they feel panicked and in trouble talk to him from your heart and tell him your concerns don't say the work you in any accusing way say i'm scared because i'm afraid i will go into labor and i will be home alone i cant sleep when your not home because i worry about you say i worked really hard today and i think i will need more help with things around here say i'm afraid that you won't want this kind of life and i will be alone i think if you speak from your heart you will get a much better response even if you are angry it's okay to be angry just try to separate yourself from it to have a conversation and try to help your family remember also why you decided to marry and make a baby with this person i know you are angry right now but there must be something good about him maybe you can say to him i think you will be a good father because you maybe he is scared and feels like he wont be a good parent maybe he needs the encouragement as much as you do EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avenue Q Fiddler on the Roof Grandview, U.S.A.
