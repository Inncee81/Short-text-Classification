stroller question i have a daughter who is months old she weighs about pounds at the moment i have a stroller in mind that i want which is the contours by kolcraft the biggest selling point for me about this stroller is that i can have her facing me she kinda gets freaked out in stores with strangers i have to constantly talk to her and show her i am there we have hit the scary stranger stage now i have read that this stroller is very heavy when lifting in and out of car as well as hard to set up take down and is pretty bulky when folded i however am willing to overlook these aspects if it is worth it i have also read how great it is for manuvering and comfort does anyone have this and what can you tell me about it when answering please say how old child is and their weight or another option i would perhaps consider is a stroller that had a handle that can be changed from front to back but i have had no such luck finding something like that i don't own a contours stroller but i have tried them out in stores they're nice but definitely not a lightweight stroller i do however think they offer a lot of nice options comparable to strollers or times as much if price is a concern for you then definitely get the kolcraft stroller however if your budget will allow it consider these strollers http babiesexpress com by html http www tinyride com bugaboo bee stroller p aspx edited to add the combi i thru stroller also has a reversible seat fairly lightweight and is http www toysrus com product index jsp productid cp view all parentpage family Baby transport Mercury Cougar HyperText Transfer Protocol Dodge Charger JavaServer Pages Uniform Resource Locator Ajax (programming) Equine conformation Hydrogen economy $ale of the Century Chevrolet Corvair Floppy disk Knife Microeconomics Wheel of Fortune Porsche 911 PHP Ford Mustang Chair Farthing (coin) HTTP cookie Geographic information system Discordianism 2000 Australian Grand Prix Anchor Animal Crossing Windows 2000 Mazda Miata Ford Thunderbird Mountain bike Mozilla Firefox Reservoir Dogs Roxette IPod Mitsubishi 3000GT XML Laptop Sharon Tate Early IBM disk storage Theory of conduct Toyota MR2 Mattress International Phonetic Alphabet Bee Gees Roswell UFO incident Chevrolet Camaro Car handling Battlebots Cascading Style Sheets Slashdot subculture Sport utility vehicle OpenDocument Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Sport rowing Bicycle lighting Boxing Cliff Richard Dance Dance Revolution Wget Have I Got News For You Oldsmobile Silhouette Uniform Resource Identifier De Lorean DMC-12 Common Unix Printing System Redundant array of independent disks Web crawler Social rule Station wagon Mercedes-Benz A-Class Recumbent bicycle Laserdisc EastEnders Jaguar E-type Extreme Programming Shaggy dog story The Joker's Wild The Contender (television series) Treehouse of Horror XV M16 (rifle) Website Lebesgue integration Game show Digital photography Domain Name System Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Poker jargon Pickup truck Sleeping car Fencing Escape from New York Heinkel He 112 Passenger car Hiawatha Line World Wide Web Handloading Xbox 360 Paragliding
