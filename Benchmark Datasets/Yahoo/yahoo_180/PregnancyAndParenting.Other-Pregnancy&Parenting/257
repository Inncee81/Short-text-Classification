if your friend could not have a child would you carry her child for her i truly don't think i could carry a baby then give it to anyone the bond is too strong for me even though it would not be my egg or husband's sperm i would still feel that way i have always admired women who are surrogates what an amazing gift if it was for a good friend who would make a good parent and who i would stay close enough to to continue having a relationship with the child then yes you do bond with the child in your womb but i think i could handle giving it to a good friend and taking the role of special aunt or something as opposed to mother part of this might be the fact that while i love kids i find babies kinda boring still it's a big sacrafice being pregnant is great in some ways but there are alot of not so great parts too i think though that if i was doing it for a friend i would definitely insist on a c section on the other hand i think i'd talk to my friend first about whether or not it was truly important in her situation to have her own biological child there are alot of children needing adoption in the us many of these children have emotional or learning problems because healthy babies are usually snatched up quickly i can see how parents might be daunted by the challenge of adopting a special needs child i grew up with two adopted special needs brothers and it's not an easy thing even if a parent does not wish that children healthy babies are available in large quantities from foreign countries these adoptions cost far more but so does a surrogate pregnancy i would make sure that my friend really really needed to see the baby as a copy of her own genes before i did it still i recognize that for some couples they bond of having a child that is truly half of each is very important and i would be willing to help give this gift Abortion debate Adoption EastEnders Friends Infantilism Charmed Humphrey Bogart Marriage Days of our Lives Childbirth In vitro fertilisation Pregnancy One Tree Hill (TV series) Laura Schlessinger Infertility Miscarriage About a Boy Polyamory Knots Landing Abortion in the United States Divorce Theory of conduct Surrogacy Everwood Kodocha History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Homosexuality and medical science Melanie Wilkes Mystique (comics) Baby Blues The Critic Jean Grey Boston Public Neighbours Biology and sexual orientation Prostate cancer Jon Secada Family Incest Sex and the City Jam (TV series) Dinah Marler Postpartum depression Love Hina main characters Child sexuality Comanche Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sami Brady W.I.T.C.H.
