i am and having my st kid in weeks i am really scared i am so scared i'm about to have a kid i don't even know if i want her i know that is a bad thing to say but i had a really bad experience while pregnant i don't know if i can do this being a single young mother i do not think i was ready for a child the father is not supportive so it hurts even more i think she deserves better then what i can give her i try to be positive about the situation but tears bring my joy down everyday some say i will not be able to party or date that my life is over and i made a big mistake by not getting an abortion i am starting to feel this way to i do not know what to do i know if i give her up for adoption my family and peers will look down on me the father says its my fault and i have to live with the consequences and that i can't date or go out that my life is over and tells me i can't raise this child i need some serious advice i feel like i am losing it ok you get to do whatever it is that's right for your baby and your family the father everyone be damned you do whatever it takes they are right that being a mother will mean that your life as you know it is over you have earned the right to give up everything you want for yourself to give it to this child you are carrying i had my first at and i decided to keep him i am very glad that i did that is not always the best decision though you are the best person to decide what is best for your child no one else will ever love this child as much as you can the father is wrong that this is your fault he will have to pay child support if you keep this child and he will be forced to help you out and who knows he could change his mind once he sees the child and maybe not do whatever you think is best many people would love to adopt your child and give him her the life you want and maybe can't give there are so many options open to you take advantage of them and talk to someone who can help you that has absolutly no stake or personal issues that will influence their advice i know you will do the right thing you are a mother now and because of that you have a innate knowledge of what is right for both of you listen to that inner voice and follow it One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada Abortion debate Laura Schlessinger Social rule Theory of conduct Everwood Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Transactional analysis Friends Adoption The Catcher in the Rye True Crime: Streets of LA Pregnancy About a Boy Ayyavazhi mythology Sex and the City Pitaten Current teachings of Prem Rawat Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) The Ashlee Simpson Show Ranma __ characters Milton H.
