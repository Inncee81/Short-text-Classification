round ligament pain just after ovulation i ovulated july st and i've been feeling those sharp pains you get while pregnant with my first baby i didn't feel them until probably weeks along i'm just wondering if it's possible to get round ligament pain just after ovulation if it means i'm pregnant or if it's just normal to have sharp pains sometimes after ovulation i remember while pregnant i'd get them whenever i'd sneeze stretch or sometimes any wrong movement and i'm experiencing the same thing a few times a day thanks ugh i am feeling the exact same thing i don't know what it is i'm fairly certain im not pregnant but it feels the same ovulation was approx days ago i hope it gets better for both of us Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness EastEnders Miscarriage Ovulation Social rule Milton H.
