can you move a septic tank access point i just recently bought a house in queens ny and realized that the access point for the septic tank was located inside the basement is it necessary to have an access point for the septic tank can i move it outside to the backyard do i need a permit from the city and what's the cost range for all this work appreciate any answers thanks the access point you refer to is actually the top of the septic tank think in terms of a small lid on a big box why would you want to move the access point maybe you are referring to the clean out t which is connected inline to the either waste main that runs to your septic tank to move the acces point or door it would encompass a tunnel of sorts out of conrete or another type of hardened material the idea being that you could access the septic for the express purpose of a septic dump sometimes when the tank has become inoperative due to various reasons you would call a septic tank type company to have your septic tank emptied the symtoms for having that performed is that the tolits won't flush or that they'll back up the tank works on a micro biological level the micro organisims in the waste actually break down other wastes if this process is interrupted the septic will quit functioning it is true that if you add yeast to the system such as rid x it will help kep the micro processes alive bleach direct undiluted is the worst for the system as it nuetralizes the process when the septic tank is cleared or emptied the service company will remove the door to access the tank insert a flexible hose from hell and start the process if you move the access door you would need to encompass a parameter that the hose could be feed by hand to accomodate this process the one aspect that could not be accomplished is to move the door and still have a visual on the tank keep in mind that the tank is also connected to a series of leach lines usually these are lines with various holes in them that distribute the waste water into the ground in what they call a leach field if you moved your septic tank you would also need to move or divert the leach lines as well or install new ones these are trenches that are about wide and about feet deep layed in gravel and sand and run anywhere from to feet depending on how big the house is the federal title talks about it it starts with sand in the leach field followed by the gravel then the pipe then the reverse of the material and then the fill dirt on top the down side of moving the leach lines is that most building departments or city planning offices will not allow concrete structures or concrete anything directly over such leach fields anytime that you are working with the septic system a permit from your jurisdiction is required at the hall of records whether it s the city county parish or whatever is a map of the location of the septic tank just as you just bought the property and didn't know where it was you could inquire with them and they would tell you where it was located a new system would be upwards of in your area good luck jim Septic tank Autonomous building Seismic retrofit Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Irrigation Brewery Domestic water system Sewage treatment Electrophysiology Glossary of firefighting terms Drill bit Basement Casting Flush toilet Glossary of firefighting equipment Land mine Thermal power station Compiler optimization Air-raid shelter New York City Subway Poker jargon Rail terminology CPU cache Toilet paper Windows 2000 Computer MDAC E85 Mach kernel Airport Floppy disk Drainage Combine (Half-Life 2) Ammunition Cable television Sewer Solar power Elevator Linked list Composting toilet Trench warfare Dairy Windows XP Fire fighting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Wind turbine Kitchen Expert system Nuclear power Microeconomics Dog agility ALGOL 68 Water purification Bong Anchor West Side Highway Rapid transit C programming language Sea-Monkey Electrical wiring Geodesic dome Marine aquarium Dialysis Corrosion Glossary of American football Canal lock Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Concrete M60 machine gun MTR Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Vacuum cleaner King City, Ontario Hard disk Semiconductor TGV Rebreather IRT Flushing Line Abortion Spring operating system Toronto Subway and RT Nuclear reactor Scuba set Glossary of wildland fire terms Biodiesel Loudspeaker
