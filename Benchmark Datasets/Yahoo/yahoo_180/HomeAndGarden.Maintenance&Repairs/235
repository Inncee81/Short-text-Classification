how long do you run your pool filter daily i just got a inground x and know nothing about pools for the basics you should run the filter for hours a day the best thing to do is to go to your local pool supply store and give them the dimensions of the pool and they will tell you what to do be careful not to buy stuff you don t really need they will offer you probably many things that re not necessary and are more like a luxury the main thing is to run the filter daily use chlorine weekly scrub and vacuum at least once a week and keep the ph levels balanced you can buy self test kit or you can just take a sample of the water to the store they usually gives you a small container and then you write your number and name and they will keep your info in their systems so they know the size of the pool and how much chemicals you have to use to balance the ph you also need to shock the pool and should keep the calcium levels good the shock is to help the chlorine the calcium is to help maintain the walls and floor again the local store will help you with all that don t forget if you leave the pool unattended and you don t have the necessary equipment to run everything automatically it will turn green in no time it takes only to hours to go from clear to a swamp good luck Swimming pool Thermal power station Carburetor Chlorine Water purification Sewage treatment Solar power Hard disk Brewery Hydrochloric acid Carbon dioxide Customs and etiquette of Japan Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Marine aquarium Windows 2000 Syphon Filter Fountain Apollo Command/Service Module Energy development Neopets Air conditioning Dialysis Japanese tea ceremony Soil pH Dairy Vacuum cleaner Ozone depletion Action potential Explosive material Survival skills Bristol Grammar School Supply and demand $ale of the Century Acne Nuclear reactor Sodium hypochlorite Organic food Extreme Programming Marathon (sport) Sea-Monkey Hybrid vehicle Ozone Community emergency response team Bong Ozone hole William Poole Kidney Menstrual cycle Swimming Pebble bed reactor UK Singles Chart Sento First aid Disinfection Use of poison gas in World War I Dundas Square Insulin Cannabis cultivation The Chemical Brothers Pools of Darkness John McDouall Stuart Sterilization (microbiology) Welding Craps Hardware random number generator Electrophysiology Surveillance Storyteller System Fancy rat Tank Tag Digital photography Mineral Drip irrigation Glossary of firefighting equipment Elevator MMORPG Stopping e-mail abuse Sauna Ultraviolet Textile manufacturing STS-50 Imperial stormtrooper Hypoglycemia Haloalkane Biodiesel The Ark in Space Human skin color RuneScape locations Hamster NTFS Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Octopus card Cell (biology) Water Sears Holdings Corporation Siphon Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Long-term potentiation
