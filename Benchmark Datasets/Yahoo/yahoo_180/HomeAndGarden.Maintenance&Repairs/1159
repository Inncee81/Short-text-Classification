dryer cord the same as range cord also question about grounding we just inherited a very old electric dryer probably years old not really sure but still working well it had a three prong cord whereas our apartment has a prong outlet i did a little online research and found we could just change the cord i went and bought one and tried to plug it in and it looks like it should plug in but just barely doesn't fit then i noticed it said it was a range cord on the packaging i was under the impression they were the same cords also when i screwed in the three wires black white and red to the dryer there was the fourth wire green that i know is meant to be grounded the dryer had a green wire coming out of it that was grounded but that was not attached to the prong cord we removed does this make sense do i need to ground both green wires or can i unscrew the green one that is attached to the dryer please help the cord you bought is rated for amp stove the cord you need is a amp prong dryer cord take it back and exchange it the new dryer cord will need the white wire hooked to the middle and red black wires to each side the remaining green wire will be bolted to the dryer grounding screw green Domestic AC power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Fuse (electrical) Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Snooker Electrical wiring (UK) Jack plug Electrical wiring Screw Residual-current device Resistor Enigma machine Circuit design Spark plug Tire STS-61 Telephone exchange Colours, standards and guidons National Electrical Code (US) Glossary of climbing terms Rigging Artificial pacemaker Mouse (computing) Flag Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster English longbow Advanced Technology Attachment Action potential Earring Power cable Tobacco Motor oil Transformer Ground and neutral Guitar Black pepper Extension Cord Sling (weapon) D-subminiature Urinary incontinence Dairy Climbing equipment Distribution board Universal Serial Bus Telephone switchboard Ground (electricity) Violin Lawn mower Strap-on dildo Wood fuel Seismometer Gender Floyd Rose Bass guitar Seismic retrofit Power line communication Gender of connectors and fasteners Electric guitar Reading spark plugs for racing Stave church Leukemia IPod Oscilloscope Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Iowa class battleship Electricity meter Radio controlled airplane Fan (implement) Space Shuttle external tank Ampere Lineman (occupation) SCART Circuit breaker Trapping Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Ammunition Zanpakut__ Parachute Xbox Third rail Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Masque of Mandragora Common electrical adaptors in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom Wire Mattress Hearing aid Audiophile Ulna Falsifiability Coffee Textile manufacturing terminology Upholstery Carbon dioxide Power cord Vacuum cleaner Trombone Telephone numbering plan Operational amplifier Lighting Anchor
