how do you free up a stuck diverter in a spigot i removed a spigot from my tub shower about months ago the diverter was working fine then however i can not get the metal post to pull upward to divert the water from tub mode to shower mode i have soaked it in vinegar to try and loosen any hard water deposits any suggestion when you say spigot i assume you are talking about the spout where the water comes out sometimes parts break inside those spigots and jam if you already soaked it in vinegar or clr then that is probably the problem you might think of just replacing the spigot a standard spigot is just or so Textile manufacturing Dishwasher Swimming pool Pottery Knife AT-4 Spigot Tofu Japanese toilet Laundry Automatic teller machine Casting M16 (rifle) Hedgehog (weapon) Naval mine Mortar (weapon) M1 Garand Vinegar Glossary of climbing terms Domestic water system Brazing Hot tub Water supply Iron Water (molecule) Otitis externa Tire Borehole Electrophysiology Violin High explosive anti-tank Manicure Tanning Seismic retrofit Mouse (computing) Manganese Aluminium Money Onsen GunZ The Duel Menstrual cup Tap (valve) Poker jargon Glossary of wildland fire terms Hard water Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Microsoft .NET Opportunity rover Neutrino Niagara Falls Heckler & Koch G3 Heckler & Koch MP5 IPod The Inside Drill bit M60 machine gun BMD-1 Top-bar hive Alkane Jewish cuisine 24 Hours of Le Mans Guitar The Dalek Invasion of Earth PIAT RollerCoaster Tycoon Medicare (Canada) Rice Knight Rider Diving Hard disk Internal ballistics Composting toilet Water purification Sega Dreamcast Customs and etiquette of Japan Land mine Tooth Novelty (locomotive) Glacier Tom DeLay Dredge Typewriter Big Brother (USA TV series) Mattress Gilding Katana Treehouse of Horror VII Oscilloscope Bulk vending Furnace Haloalkane Hemp Firearm World War Three (Doctor Who) Bathing Cruising (maritime) Coir Economy of Russia Brewery Pickling
