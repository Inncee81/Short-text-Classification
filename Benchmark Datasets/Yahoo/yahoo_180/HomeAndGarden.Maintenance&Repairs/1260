does any body know what a compasator on a heat pump unit does many electric motors that are run from single phase power like you would have at a house or small business require a capacitor it could be classified as a starting or running capacitor the motor has a couple of windings of wire which form a magnetic field which is what drives the motor by connecting a capacitor to one of the windings you cause an electrical phase shift which causes the motor to run in the correct direction a starting capacitor is switched off once the motor starts either by using a switch operated when the motor gets up to speed or by a relay which switches off when the motor current drops to a normal running level if the capacitor fails the motor will not start or will be too weak to get up to speed it will draw more current than normal and eventually either a thermal overload in the motor trips these usually reset in a couple minutes and keep trying an external overload unit trips these are usually manual reset but could be automatic or you blow the fuse breaker for the circuit a capacitor will normally last many years and is relatively inexpensive Electric motor Circuit breaker Capacitor Transformer Circuit design Fuse (electrical) Relay Residual-current device High-voltage direct current Oscilloscope Thermal power station Tesla coil Antenna (radio) Carburetor Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ceramics Switch Three-phase electric power Alternating current Electronic amplifier X10 (industry standard) Central processing unit Flux Electrical generator Thermostat Power factor correction Hydraulic machinery STS-61 Loudspeaker Energy development Phase-locked loop Switched-mode power supply Ford Ranger EV Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Transistor Rail terminology Printed circuit board Automobile self starter Locomotive Digital circuit Solar power Overhead lines Wind turbine Elevator Variable Frequency Drive Split phase Logic gate Electrophysiology Series and parallel circuits Floppy disk Short circuit Toyota Prius Hybrid vehicle Railgun Battery electric vehicle Power factor Fire alarm control panel Aircraft engine controls Microphone TGV Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Ring circuit Magnetic core memory Gas metal arc welding Transducer Lawn mower Electric vehicle Electrical network Electrical wiring Inductor Capacitor plague Operational amplifier Dynamic random access memory MRAM Impedance Autonomous building Plasma (physics) Telegraphy Automatic transmission Hybrid Synergy Drive 2003 North America blackout Hall effect BS 1363 Railway electrification system Power station Gliding Service life Jet engine Movie projector
