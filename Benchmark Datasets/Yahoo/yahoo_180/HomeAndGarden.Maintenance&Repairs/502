double lugged breaker we recently moved into our house and the inspector said in his report that we have a circuit breaker that is double lugged he said it is an easy fix but we can't figure out what double lugged means help it is very common to find this in a panel the easiest fix is to wire nut the two wires together along with a inch length of the same size wire then install that new single wire to the circuit breaker connecting or more wires to a lug or screw is a violation of the electric code unless that lug is listed and marked for more than one wire it has been found that the wires tend to loosen up when more than one is connected Circuit breaker Switch Distribution board Tire Electrical wiring Fuse (electrical) Residual-current device BS 1363 Three-phase electric power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Wrench Rigging Bicycle frame Circuit design Violin Electrical wiring (UK) Ring circuit Relay Spark plug Drill bit Enigma machine Ground and neutral Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Bass guitar Resistor Electrician Ethernet Linux Hydraulic machinery Ground (electricity) Apollo Command/Service Module Wire wrap Floyd Rose Burglar alarm Double bass Barbed wire Alternating current D-subminiature RS-232 Elevator Overhead lines Telephone DVD Lightning rod Jack plug Gas metal arc welding Short circuit Potentiometer Aluminium Digital circuit Solar cell PDP-11 Guitar Earthing system Thermostat Professional wrestling throws Teleprinter Oscilloscope Glossary of climbing terms Wire Conductor (material) Apollo Guidance Computer Linux User Group Loudspeaker Integrated circuit Fencing Welding Screw thread Seismometer Electrical network Knife Advanced Technology Attachment Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Voltage drop Strap-on dildo Fire alarm control panel Cryptanalysis Capacitor Seismic retrofit Rotor machine Computer bus Printed circuit board Voltmeter Electrical generator Tesla coil Shotgun Split phase Lineman (occupation) Hall effect Transformer Electrical breakdown Vacuum tube Field-programmable gate array Geodesic dome Central processing unit Electrical engineering
