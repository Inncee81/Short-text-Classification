can anyone tell me why my toilet is doing this saturday morning when i left my house there was nothing wrong with my toilet when i returned that afternoon it is not flushing properly i have looked at several qustions dealing with toilet problems and couldn't find one similar to mine i think it is clogged but my wonderful husband begs to differ when you flush it it starts to bubble you know like it's stopped up then it starts acting like it's gonna over flow then it seems like it takes it for ever to some what flush then all of the water or what ever is in there does not go all the way down i told my husband it was either stopped up or the toilet needed replacing he again argued with me so does anyone know what might be the problem and by the way we are on city sewage btw i have used a plunger several several several times and nothing happens it just seems to be getting worse with each flush it sound like there is an obstruction in the drainage pipe additional do not use a plunger all you are doing is moving the obstruction closer to the toilet or lodging it tighter in the pipe you actually need to push the obstruction down out of the pipe or break it apart so that it will go down the pipe snaking the drain might accomplish this Flush toilet Japanese toilet Plumbing fixture Toilet paper Autonomous building Sewage treatment Carburetor Sewer Toilet humour Bong Urinal Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Menstrual cup Domestic water system Escape from New York Shaggy dog story Drainage Water resources Septic tank Squat toilet M16 (rifle) Sin City Married... with Children Thermal power station Irrigation Basement M4 Sherman Whitewater Qur'an desecration controversy of 2005 Piccolo Junior Saga Sewage collection and disposal Hard water Heinkel He 112 River Coriolis effect 2005 Maharashtra floods Rebreather Operation Market Garden 24 Hours of Le Mans CPU cache Urinary incontinence Dairy IRT Flushing Line Dialysis Tampon The Family from One End Street Brewery Poker jargon Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Washroom Operation Petticoat Home repair Scrabble (game show) Airport (film) Conker's Bad Fur Day Plame affair Hey Jude Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Canoe New England Patriots Blood on the Tracks 2000 Australian Grand Prix Psycho Great Lakes Gowanus Canal Joke Mach kernel 2005 United States Grand Prix Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Jam (TV series) 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Dennis Nilsen Dam The Amazing Race Composting toilet Trombone Mute (music) The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Continuation War Homer Simpson Four square E85 Avenue Q Sewage Dundas Square Texas hold 'em Drain cleaner Turner syndrome Sea water Pinball Seismic retrofit Divorce Finding Nemo Trail Cat The Contender (television series)
