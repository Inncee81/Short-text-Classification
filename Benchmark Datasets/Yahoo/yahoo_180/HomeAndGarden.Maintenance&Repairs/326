what is the best way to repair the inside of my kitchen cabinet i have two kitchen cabinets one is under the counter top and the other under the sink both have floors made of some type of wood that has gone bad over the years it was there when i moved in they look like they got wet and feel damp sometimes the parts that are dry feel velvety and when i use my duster i can brush some of it off i don't know what this kind of damage is called i just want to repair it and changing all the cabinets would not be worth it we rent and we will be moving soon we want to repair them in a way that can isolate the whole cabinet under the sink and counter top as if we had installed new cabinets i hope i have been clear not sure how to explain it better thanks the first thing to do is to fix whatever leaks you have this can be a small leak so check thoroughly cabinetry is basically box building the floor or bottom is part of the structure that holds everything together this is put in place by the use of dado cuts otherwise called grooves you will need to remove the bad material completely if you are able to remove the material in the groove then you can install nailer strips into the grooves using wood glue and screws if you can't remove the material in the grooves then place the nailers at the joint line and attach with glue and screws then you can insert a plywood bottom in place and screw down on the nailers note this sounds easy but will require some patience cutting everything to fit drain pipe etc Screw Seismic retrofit Tire Drill bit Upholstery Elevator Table saw Boat building Kitchen Knife Bong Poker jargon Plywood Clinker (boat building) Radio controlled airplane Naval mine Hamster Drainage Glossary of climbing terms Manifold Soldering Wood Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Urinary incontinence Electrical wiring Cello Woodworking Refrigerator Harp Pump It Up Roof Violin Anchor Casting Internal ballistics Thermal power station Menstrual cup Equine conformation Textile manufacturing Fecal incontinence Bullet PCB layout guidelines Timpani Portsmouth Block Mills Gramophone record Beatmania IIDX Rigging Parquetry Clarinet Fire extinguisher Wind turbine Humerus In The Groove (game) Fire fighting Timber framing Glossary of firefighting equipment Guitar St Albans Cathedral Plane (tool) Rail terminology Bassoon Dinghy Billiards Lighting Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Floyd Rose Wrench Lathe Hand grenade Cruising (maritime) Bicycle frame Residual-current device Wood carving Diving suit Vermicompost USS Tunny (SS-282) Paper Wire wrap Frame and panel Mattress Straw-bale construction Propeller De Lorean DMC-12 Light-frame construction Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Floppy disk Oscilloscope Universal Serial Bus Punt (boat) Computer virus Skateboard Rail tracks Armored Core Harmonica Spark plug BS 1363 Motor oil
