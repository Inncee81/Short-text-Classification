my jandy lite natural gas above ground pool heater won't continuously heat despite the pilot staying lit the preassure is fine and the filter cartridge is clean as is the skimmer and pump baskets i can sometimes get it to fire up by turning it off and then on but it goes out shortly thereafter any ideas on what i can do thanks also the thermostat is turned all the way up it is the kind that only shows hot anc warm etc not temperature in any case the pool is definitely much cooler then the setting and the heater should be and always has heated in these conditions right up until today check the water temperature against the setting on the thermostat it could be possible that the water is already at the temperature the thermostat is set at it shouldnt heat all the time it should only heat if the water temperature drops below the thermostat setting if it has heated until today and the water is not warm enough to cause the thermostat to kick it out then there is a few possible reasons it is not heating bad thermostat bad gas valve flame roll out detector could be bad if it has carbon monoxide detector built into it this might be bad if it has an electonic box that controls the pilot and main burner this control could be bad even if it keeps the pilot burning if you arent capable of troubleshooting this system the safest thing to do is call an hvac tech that is familiar with gas furnaces to come and work on it Furnace HVAC Carburetor Thermal power station Aquarium Autonomous building Hot air balloon Bi-metal Burglar alarm Thermocouple Carbon monoxide Fossil fuel power plant Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Refrigerator Motor oil Air conditioning Internal combustion engine Diesel engine Combustion STS-62 Fire fighting Heat Glossary of firefighting equipment Coffee Process control Tap (valve) Brewery Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Spectroscopy Ironing Water Basement Spark plug Tire Temperature Control system Sun Welding Town gas Pebble bed reactor Steam engine Space shuttle main engine E85 Water (molecule) Glossary of wildland fire terms Steam locomotive nomenclature Renewable energy Fire Marine aquarium Carbon dioxide Automobile emissions control Radiator Swimming pool Incandescent light bulb Hydraulic machinery Greenhouse gas Ocean thermal energy conversion Turbojet Nuclear reactor Energy development Central heating Coal Tier One Rail terminology Fire extinguisher Barbecue Carbon dioxide sink Slow cooker Phase change heat pump Stirling engine Deep lake water cooling Methanol Oxygen sensor Dry cleaning P-38 Lightning Petroleum Greenhouse effect Carbon Charcoal Kitchen Soldering iron Dialysis Hydrogen Volcano Laser Glossary of firefighting terms Hydrogen economy Water vapor Sewage treatment Nuclear meltdown
