can i mount a microwave on a shelf above of a range hood i am looking for a combination microwave hood but i need it in i cannot find that specification anywhere the standard is so i was wondering if i can mount a microwave on a shelf above a regular range hood i found a range hood that is and a microwave that is but just not the combination of both thanks because most range hoods vent upward it is not likely you will be able to mount the microwave above the range hood if there is sufficient space behind the range hood and it has the option to vent horizontally then you might be able to do what you want have you looked at the appliances that are used in travel trailers sometimes they have items that are a bit smaller than standard household appliances Kitchen Microwave Mount St. Helens Cosmic microwave background radiation Transistor Major appliance Microwave oven Chevrolet Camaro Dodge Charger Ford Cortina Amateur radio Domestic AC power plugs and sockets RFID Tier One Radar Loudspeaker Mercury Cougar Cosmic Era Superweapons Appliance Glossary of firefighting equipment Refrigerator Mount Adams Mount Hood M16 (rifle) Imperial (automobile) Artillery IEEE 802.11 Ford Thunderbird Big Bang Travel trailer Battery (electricity) Solar power Internal combustion engine Autonomous building M60 machine gun Satellite television Observational astronomy Volcano Rail terminology LIDAR Seismometer Space elevator Cavity magnetron Permittivity Heinkel He 112 Embedded system Furnace M4 Sherman Chevrolet Nova Diablo II Automotive lighting Diving suit Solar power satellite Wi-Fi Fume hood Pyroclastic flow Dance Dance Revolution Scramjet Screw SETI Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets View camera Wind turbine De Lorean DMC-12 Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Volkswagen Golf Plate tectonics Rocket fuel Instrument Landing System Striker Pack Combine (Half-Life 2) Headlight Ford Mustang Heckler & Koch G3 Dark matter Railgun Sewing machine EIA-708 Amateur astronomy Solar panel Power line communication Leica Ford Torino Intercooler Universe BS 1363 Nottingham Parachute Burglar alarm Himalayas Passenger car Traffic light Electromagnetic radiation P-61 Black Widow Directed-energy weapon Items in the Metroid series Space Shuttle external tank Carburetor Kilauea
