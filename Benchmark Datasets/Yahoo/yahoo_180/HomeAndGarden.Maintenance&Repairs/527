connecting one antenna to two tvs how do i connect one hd antenna to two tv's i think i may need a pair of diplexers but don't know why i need them or how to use them you need a splitter which is available at most electronic parts stores radio shack and probably where you bought the antenna pay attention to the markings on the splitter so that the antenna is connected to the right connector on the splitter or it won't work very well be aware though that if you live in a fringe area using a splitter will further reduce the signal strength since the power is split between two television sets in this case it may be better to use a wide band amplifier with multiple outputs Television Antenna (radio) SCART Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Coaxial cable Cable television Crystal radio receiver Decibel Oscilloscope Transmitter Satellite dish Impedance matching Software-defined radio Amateur radio Electronic amplifier Transformer Radar Digital television Wi-Fi Digital Visual Interface S__CAM Communications satellite Digital Subscriber Line Cavity magnetron Universal Serial Bus Low-noise block converter Jack plug Global System for Mobile Communications VFO Operational amplifier Electronics Amplitude modulation Phased array Low-pass filter TV-FM DX Diode Microphone Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Amstrad CPC TGV XLR connector Citizens' band radio Circuit design DVD Receiver (radio) VHF omnidirectional range High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program Instrument amplifier Electronic filter RS-232 Direction finding Bluetooth History of radar Very Long Baseline Interferometry Advanced Technology Attachment Ethernet Theremin Transistor S-Video Longwave RFID IEEE 802.11 Central processing unit Air traffic control Frequency synthesiser Phase-locked loop Mixing console WWVB Satellite television STS-61 Television licence Original Amiga chipset Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Vacuum tube Kenwood Electronics Amplifier Digital camera Michelson-Morley experiment Mediumwave Atari 8-bit family Low-power broadcasting Radio Ultra high frequency Electrophysiology Capacitor Set-top box High-definition television Galileo spacecraft MPEG-4 Part 3 Apollo Command/Service Module Xbox Effective radiated power Home Box Office RCA connector Scanner (radio) PID controller
