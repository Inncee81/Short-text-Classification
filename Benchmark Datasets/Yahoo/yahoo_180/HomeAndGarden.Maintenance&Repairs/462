why are my light switch plates bowing outwards i have several light switch cover plates that are bowing out there doesn't seem to be any pressure on them as if i overtightened the screws it seems like heat or something else is causing them to bend out i did find a way to straighten them though place them in the oven at degrees for about minutes or so flat now but why did they bend in the first place you stumped me in years of electrical work i have never run across this one i have seen them burned and melted in places from loose connections and arcing but never bowed do they feel hot if they feel hot call an electrician but the chances of having a bad switch or connection in more than one switch at a time is like winning the lottery not likely leave some comments which way did they bow in or out interesting good luck Spark plug Welding Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Equine conformation Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Tire Incandescent light bulb Oscilloscope Aluminium Solar power Gas metal arc welding Carburetor Tesla coil Wok Cookware and bakeware Rail terminology Vacuum tube Movie projector Seismic retrofit Canoe Stove Fluorescent lamp Circuit breaker USS Tunny (SS-282) Solar system Ironing Violin Professional wrestling holds Casting BS 1363 USS Thresher (SS-200) Hydraulic machinery Mattress Thermostat Residual-current device Woodworking Glass Particle accelerator Tank Fabrication (metal) Customs and etiquette of Japan Mouse (computing) Jet engine Mercury Atlas 6 Light switch Diode Gesture STS-61 Sundial Aerial (dance move) Arc welding Archery Drill bit Kitchen Luck Salute Avalanche Explosive material Upholstery Spacecraft propulsion Motor oil Corona Fan (implement) Switch Hot air balloon Fast bowling USS Trigger (SS-237) Gas tungsten arc welding Steam engine Fire fighting Overhead lines Titanium Steel Glossary of climbing terms 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Screw William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Terminal ballistics Stage lighting Drill Cheating in poker Softball Professional wrestling throws Galileo spacecraft Heat Cavity magnetron Hand grenade Relay Transformer Agar plate Mercury-vapor lamp Venus Internal ballistics USS Wahoo (SS-238) Campfire Aurora (astronomy) Knife Rail tracks
