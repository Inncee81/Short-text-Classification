removing aquarium salt deposits from wall my boyfriend's dad used to live in our house and had a saltwater aquarium against the wall and now there's all this stuff on the wall that my boyfriend says is from the salt we are getting ready to paint and we have tried to dry sand it also have tried to dampen the wall then sand it and even scrape it off but nothing is working when we scrape it it peels the wall any tips or suggestions we're thinking about getting an electric sander but as a last resort because i know that will mess the wall up rather then take away from the wall i would add a skim coat of drywall compound over the area and then when completely dry you can sand the edges to blend it into the existing surface it's real easy to sand and nothing electric is necessary Drywall Aquarium Casting Drill bit Sewage treatment Marine aquarium Seismic retrofit Pottery Stucco Fishing Paint Desert Hamster Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Titanium Soap Aluminium Sandpaper Wallpaper Knife Clownfish Explosive material Salt Leather Spark plug Dishwasher Water (molecule) Opportunity rover Dune Death Valley National Park Woodworking Fire extinguisher Tobacco Plaster Radio controlled airplane Impact crater Plastic Dairy Surrealist techniques Volleyball Salt Lake City, Utah Carbon dioxide Shrimp Desertification Skateboarding trick Spidey Super Stories Sand casting Water purification Straw-bale construction Thermal power station Glass Lake Dry cleaning Glossary of climbing terms Powder metallurgy Sulfur Masonry Irrigation Uranium Petroleum Wok Toilet paper Stalag Luft III Wall Europa (moon) Mars Iron Manganese Textile manufacturing Tar sands Surface mining Electrophysiology Fly fishing Manicure Aquifer Fancy rat Shroud of Turin Hard water Friends Cruising (maritime) Zuiderzee Works Wood Wood finishing Teen Girl Squad Swimming pool Drawing Zinc Edible salt Antlion Sea ice Tilapia Fan (implement) Shaggy dog story Epoxy Top-bar hive Cerium Weathering Oceanic trench
