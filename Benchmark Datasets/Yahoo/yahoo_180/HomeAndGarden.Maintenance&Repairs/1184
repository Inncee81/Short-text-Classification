what would cause a water heater with two functional thermostats functional electric to stop heating water my water heater has stopped heating water both thermostats are working and there is a good electrical current to the heater but there is no hot water coming out of it a water heater has parts to it the tank of course then on a std house unit it will have thermostats top and bottom then heating elements top and bottom now when u first turn on a water heater power is sent to the top element heatingp the top half of the heater since that is where the hot water comes from now when u pull water from there the new cold water comign in goes to the bottom of the tank thru a diptube mang the bottom return on first making it run more so most likely it is ur bottom element that has gone out but since ur going to have to open the panels to replace it might as well do both while ur at it so u wont have to do the next one in a month or two Thermostat HVAC Apollo 13 Furnace Solar power Autonomous building Refrigerator Water heater Thermal power station Radiator Samovar Fossil fuel power plant Heat Hot air balloon Solar panel Bi-metal Vacuum tube Process control Ironing Carburetor Steam engine Mars Exploration Rover Rail terminology Town gas Heating element Water (molecule) Energy development Diesel engine Fan (implement) Energy Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Wood fuel Marine aquarium Brewery Soldering iron Renewable energy Ford Ranger EV Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Phase change heat pump Thermocouple Three-phase electric power Transistor Toyota Prius Wind power Seismic retrofit Fire fighting Solar collector Welding Basement Torpedo Electrical element Passive solar Peltier-Seebeck effect Deep lake water cooling Electrical wiring Sento Cruising (maritime) Transformer Cold fusion 1957 World Series Hydrogen economy Bong Bread Coffee Central heating Standard enthalpy change of fusion Spacecraft propulsion Three Mile Island Injection moulding Gas turbine Kitchen Slow cooker Nuclear reactor Hysteresis Cyclic process Canal lock Titanium Alternative fuel Waterbed Diving suit Elevator Spark plug Armoured warfare Motor oil Washing machine Chevrolet Corvair Rice cooker Railway signalling Heat pump Fuse (electrical) Tesla coil Temperature Electricity meter Hydropower Quicksort Relay Hydrogen vehicle B-47 Stratojet
