we have a hayward above ground de filter everytime we start it up is shuts down and pops the circuit breaker any ideas of what this could be is this recent occurrence on an existing system or a new pump or system if it s a new pump it could be it is drawing more current on start up and that s tripping the circuit breaker you would need the check that they wiring can handle the load and the circuit breaker is the correct rated for the pump if it s the correct then you may need a time delay breaker this would allow the initial start up high current draw to pass with out tripping but still give to proper protection is there something blocking the pipes this could cause the mote rot over work and over heat causing the circuit breaker to trip could be also blockage in the filter if a sand filter have you backwashed it lately try bypassing the filter if your system has a bypass if this is an existing pump could be several things the impeller could be jammed is there any thing blocking it the bearing could be gone dose the impeller freely turn by hand there could be short circuit some where in the system there could be a failure in the winding again part of a short circuit if Circuit breaker Thermal power station Carburetor Circuit design Short circuit Hydraulic machinery Capacitor Low-pass filter Fuse (electrical) Seismic retrofit Switch Oscilloscope Pump Water purification 2003 North America blackout BS 1363 Relay Federal Standard 1037C Loudspeaker Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Ground and neutral Electronic amplifier Thermostat National Electrical Code (US) Distribution board Electrical generator High-voltage direct current Ground (electricity) Printed circuit board Phase-locked loop Armored Core Sewage treatment Glossary of firefighting equipment Alternating current Switched-mode power supply Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Solar power Apollo Guidance Computer Wind power Apollo 13 Radiation hardening Electric motor CPU cache Jet engine X10 (industry standard) Turbocharger Vacuum Static inverter plant Mooney M20 Action potential Inertial guidance system Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Cavitation Diesel engine Nuclear fallout Welding Digital circuit Renewable energy E85 Solar cell Diode Earthing system CPU design Lightning rod Gas metal arc welding Tesla coil Operational amplifier Electrical wiring Stopping e-mail abuse Incandescent light bulb Fossil fuel power plant Vacuum tube Space shuttle main engine Electrical breakdown Hydrogen economy CDC 6600 Paragliding Ignition system Borehole Ocean thermal energy conversion STS-61 Aircraft flight control systems Steam engine Yohoho!
