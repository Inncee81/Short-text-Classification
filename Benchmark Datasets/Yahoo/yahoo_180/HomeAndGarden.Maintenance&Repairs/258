my windowe mount air conditioner spits out water and makes a flapping noise after it's been on awhile ideas your a c is full of water and the outside drain hole must be cleaned with all the rain humidity we have been experiencing your a c has not had time to drain it may be that the drain hole is dirty or plugged with debris the water that the a c takes out of the house must be drained or evaporated outside in some fashion most of the water will drain automatically but if you are getting more water than the drain can handle your fan will touch the water and make the flapping noise and send in bits of mist into the inside of the room the newer models of a c's are using some of the water from evaporation to cool the a c unit on the outside so the drain does not eliminate all of the water as it would in an older model the drain hole is smaller and can become clogged look around the outside of your unit and find the drain hole take something that will fit inside the hole and gently work the hole to see if you can get whatever it is that is blocking the area out of the hole if you can get the unit to drain wait until all the water is drained out and then take a water hose and squirt into the unit and clean out the debris you will see through the fins and be able to see if you need to get out larger leaves or limbs from inside the unit cage this clean up should be done a couple of times a year Thermal power station Glossary of firefighting equipment Air conditioning Bong Black hole M16 (rifle) Swamp cooler Carburetor Basement Hard disk Home repair Tire Houseplant Irrigation Heinkel He 100 Domestic water system Frogman Piccolo Junior Saga Climate of the United Kingdom Ozone depletion RISC Jet engine Customs and etiquette of Japan Japanese toilet Sento First aid Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Toilet Diving regulator Spark plug Heat exchanger Automobile emissions control Ozone hole Fire fighting Toilet humour Vacuum cleaner Whitewater Water Diving suit Transformer Water vapor Electrophysiology Opportunity rover Kitchen Full Metal Panic?
