can i put a volt element in a volt water heater i have gone off grid and dont have power from utility company anymore but cant supply enough power yet for volt i want to convert my water heater to volt can i put a volt screw in type element in place of a volt element do i also need to change thermostat too do not listen to any one of these people who say that you can't do this they do not know about electricity or water heaters you will not have to change thermostats the only change that will have to be made after the element is changed is the breaker in the panel you will have to change it to a single pole breaker single pole amp and one of the wires will have to be connected to the neutral bar also make sure that the element that you get is not larger than watts it will take longer to heat the water but it will work a watt element at volts will draw amps is your generator large enough for this Three-phase electric power Solar power Circuit breaker Circuit design Transformer Solar panel Fuse (electrical) BS 1363 Electrical generator Volt Electricity meter Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Electricity distribution Operational amplifier Oscilloscope Incandescent light bulb Wind power Electrical wiring Distribution board Apollo 13 Solar cell Fossil fuel power plant Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets HVAC Vacuum tube Refrigerator Loudspeaker Electrical element Residual-current device Ampere Thermal power station Overhead lines Fan (implement) Autonomous building Bi-metal Alternating current Capacitor Diode War of Currents Variable Frequency Drive Electric power transmission Tesla coil Switched-mode power supply Relay Electric motor Fluorescent lamp Vacuum cleaner Water heater Energy Diesel engine Renewable energy X10 (industry standard) Split phase Lineman (occupation) Potentiometer Switch Electrical wiring (UK) Oxygen sensor Decibel George Westinghouse Energy development Aquarium Wind turbine Linear particle accelerator Electrical resistance Battery (electricity) Soldering iron Thermocouple Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Nernst lamp Furnace Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Impedance matching Piezoelectricity Lighting Heat Hybrid vehicle Carburetor Process control Electrical network Particle accelerator Electricity Heating element Bass guitar Spark plug Hydropower Central processing unit Ford Ranger EV Mains electricity Spark gap Ground (electricity) Logic gate
