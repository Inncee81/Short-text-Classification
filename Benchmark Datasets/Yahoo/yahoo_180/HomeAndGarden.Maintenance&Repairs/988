heat pump return suction the return suction on my heat pump ac is so strong it literally pulls the filter out of its frame what causes this and how do i fix it the ac guy installed another return to help with the airflow but it still pulls one or the other out of place both air returns are x and the unit is a ton thanks the unit is pulling to much air the most likely problem is that they did not calculate the cfm of air needed for the unit and the motor is blowing to much air does it blow air out of the vents very hard if yes then motor is running on to high a speed if no then there is to many cold air vents for the system and it is not allowing the unit to build any back pressure have them come back and check the cfm of the air and set motor accordingly Vacuum cleaner Jet engine Thermal power station Air conditioning Solar power Diesel engine HVAC Vacuum Stirling engine Fan (implement) Bong Furnace Glossary of firefighting equipment Swamp cooler Turbojet Fuel injection Hydraulic machinery Axial compressor Fossil fuel power plant Locomotive Manifold vacuum Wind Hard disk Glider Autonomous building Saturn V Bicycle brake systems Suction Timeline of steam power Siphon Ocean thermal energy conversion Gliding Pump Explosive material TGV Heinkel He 100 Motorcycle Geothermal exchange heat pump Phase change heat pump Internal combustion engine Parachute Aircraft engine controls Combine harvester Hot air balloon Dodge Neon Electric motor Mooney M20 Renewable energy Novelty (locomotive) Equine conformation Variometer Cavitation Diving suit Brewery E85 Dialysis Initiation (phonetics) Space Shuttle external tank Drill bit 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Three-phase electric power Spacecraft propulsion Mitsubishi 3000GT Turbocharger Newcomen steam engine Three Mile Island Movie projector Aerodynamics Paragliding Anchor Fire fighting Automatic transmission George Westinghouse Abortion Lift (force) STS-61 Energy development Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Tire Infusion pump Lung Sewage treatment Glossary of firefighting terms Aircraft engine Tier One Glossary of wildland fire terms Chevrolet Corvair USS S-32 (SS-137) Welding Drowning Gas compressor Wind power Messerschmitt Bf 109 Ford Ranger EV
