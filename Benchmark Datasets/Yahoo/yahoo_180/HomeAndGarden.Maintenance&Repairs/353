backyard faucet won't turn off completely can i fix it myself please remember i am fairly inept at repairs around the house any idea how much a plumber will cost me probably inside under the house there should be another shutoff on the hose bib that's what it's called line pipe if you can't find it you have to shut off all the water to the house first there's a screw that holds the handle on undo it and take the handle off under it there's a cover screw ring iirc that holds the valve body in pliers or wrench will take it off it's been awhile but i'm thinking the valve body is also screwed in and has a flat area that a crescent wrench will fit on easily to unscrew it regardless on the underside of it there'll be a thick tapered cone shaped rubber washer held on with a screw if you've got a leaky faucet it'll be in bad shape take it off and take it to a good plumbing supply shop or an ace tru value hardware store they've got everything everything goes back together the same way it came apart plumbers cost an hour your call Wrench Screw Glossary of firefighting equipment Hydraulic machinery Tire Bong Samovar Home repair Diving regulator Tap (valve) Clinker (boat building) Siphon Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Domestic water system Thermal power station Flush toilet Sento Oxyacetylene Carburetor Seismic retrofit Motor oil Glossary of climbing terms Apollo Command/Service Module BS 1363 Japanese toilet Equine conformation Irrigation Fountain pen Pliers Drill bit Volleyball Professional wrestling throws Violin Spark plug Diving suit Poker jargon Anchor Mattress Knife Strap-on dildo Lathe Floyd Rose Plastic Earring Diving cylinder Stage lighting Screw thread Scuba set Propeller Welding Mercury 4 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Wood carving Taps and dies Japanese tea ceremony Rebreather Gas compressor Punt (boat) Cheating in poker Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Team Fortress Classic Trombone Ammunition Amateur telescope making Rail tracks Machine tapers Combine (Half-Life 2) Space Shuttle external tank IPod Basement Siebe Gorman Salvus Leaf Screwdriver Cruising (maritime) Novelty (locomotive) Jam (TV series) Pottery Water supply Dialysis Rail terminology Professional wrestling holds Solar power IBook CPU cache Marathon (sport) BMW M5 Timpani USS Tunny (SS-282) Upholstery Shoe Dollar store Thermostat Incandescent light bulb Car handling Shotgun Archimedes Battlebots Floodgate
