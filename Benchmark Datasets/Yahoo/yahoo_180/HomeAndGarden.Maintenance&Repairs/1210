buzzing in wall every few months when i close my laundry room door you can hear a loud buzzing it goes away when you open or shut the door again it has gone and returned several times it sounds almost like a dryer buzzer do i need to fix this is it dangerous well i don't think it is the dryer buzzer just sounds like it i don't think it's bees i only hear the noise every few months i wonder if it's a wire loose or something to determine what needs to be done you must first identify the source of the noise are you ever in the room when it makes the noise you say the noise sounds like the dryer buzzer but goes away when you open the door to the room if your dryer buzzer is the noise the only way opening the laundry room door would effect it would perhaps be a slight change of air pressure to the room causing the dryer door to be pressed in a little or even puled out a little the dryer buzzer is not usually effected by the door but rather it is effected by the timer start the dryer and as it runs push and pull a little on the dryer door and see if you can cause the sound to appear if this doesn't work i keep trying to identify the source i can't think of anything else with what you've posted Microphone Scrabble (game show) Hurdy gurdy Quizbowl Sound Hearing aid Loudspeaker Whose Line Is It Anyway?
