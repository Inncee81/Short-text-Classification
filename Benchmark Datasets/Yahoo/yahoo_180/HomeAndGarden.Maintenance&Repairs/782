two washing machines have gone bad in one week one was spinning out just died with water in the bottom no power does this g e speed have a reset switch the other one a whirlpool blackface has quit agitating and spinning but it has power and the timer works and it fills drains pumps out would this be the spin tube or a broken belt and if it is the spin tube can it be accessed from the slip off top or does it have to be serviced from the back thanks a bunch for any help http appliancequickfix com is a more user friendly website but i can tell you that there is no reset switch if no power try plugging it in someplace else with an extension cord and if nothing works then its the timer that is defective if the whirlpool has an access panel in the back its real old and the belt is probably shot and its a real pain to replace junk it and get a new one otherwise if the motor runs but will not agitate or spin then it has a coupling instead of a belt and its not too difficult for somebody that is handy to replace go to http appliancequickfix com and they will tell you exactly how to do it Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Embedded system Textile manufacturing Pinball The Price Is Right Oscilloscope IPod Elevator Thermal power station Diablo II Brewery Motor oil Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Radiation hardening Tire Whirlpool Dishwasher Burroughs B5000 Paintball marker Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Electrical generator Electric motor GunBound Dry cleaning Relay Siphon STS-61 Seismic retrofit Equine conformation Bicycle TGV Programmable logic controller Port Authority Trans-Hudson Timer Motorcycle Lawn mower Fast bowling Computer Dialysis Lathe Fossil fuel power plant Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Hendrick Motorsports Automobile Diesel engine Fire alarm control panel Cruising (maritime) Carburetor Strap-on dildo Enigma machine Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Motorola 68000 Billiards Wheel of Fortune Windows 2000 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Television Manual transmission Apollo Command/Service Module PowerPC E85 Final Fantasy magic Galileo spacecraft Wave power Internet Knots Landing Hard disk Dance Dance Revolution Match Game Naruto jutsu Shotgun Web browser Commodore 64 Professional wrestling throws Proxy server Toyota Prius Common Unix Printing System In The Groove (game) Indianapolis 500 Coffee Two-stroke cycle Robot Wars Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) World Wide Web Vacuum tube Beatmania IIDX USS Tunny (SS-282) Laundry Locomotive Combine harvester Rifle X86 Skype Table tennis Vortex RuneScape Mini-Games Tractor
