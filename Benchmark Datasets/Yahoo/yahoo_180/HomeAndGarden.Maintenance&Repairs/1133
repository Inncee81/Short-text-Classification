how do i oil a singer touch tronic sewing machine the manual doesn't give any relevant details and i know my machine should be oiled regularly anyone know how to do this i'd be most grateful for any help after looking at the manuals all of the gears appear to be nylon and in this case should not need to be oiled instead i would suggest a small amount of gear grease applied with a q tip and i believe if you remove the top cover on the machine you can get to all of the gears right there Thermal power station Lawn mower Combine harvester Lathe Radio controlled airplane Wind turbine Disc brake Manual transmission Metal Gear (video game) Drill bit Floppy disk Fencing Ammunition Firearm Printmaking Elevator Hydraulic machinery Drill Climbing equipment Mooney M20 Sewing machine Heinkel He 100 Casting Plastic M-209 Hot air balloon Glossary of climbing terms M16 (rifle) Diving suit Machine tool Dungeons & Dragons Sewage treatment Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Compiler optimization Tattoo Motor oil Porsche 911 Filling station Grease (lubricant) Ecco the Dolphin Violin Flax Retcon Internal ballistics Fuel efficiency Carburetor Turbocharger Textile manufacturing terminology M3 Grease Gun Salute Kilt Harp French fries Gear B-47 Stratojet Oxyacetylene Carbon dioxide Metal Gear Upholstery Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Classified information Screw Panzer II Land mine Glossary of nautical terms Metal Gear Solid United Kingdom corporation tax Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Milling cutter Tractor Cruising (maritime) Fixed-wing aircraft Sinclair ZX81 Knife Bush v.
