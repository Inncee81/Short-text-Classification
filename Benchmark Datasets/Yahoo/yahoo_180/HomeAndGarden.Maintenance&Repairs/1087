how do i get rid of and prevent paper wasps that have taken over my porch i have already killed five nests and found three more today i also have one that is unreachable underneath my porch is there a way to kill the wasps and prevent them from coming back i killed four nests and found three more the next day what works i'm being attacked and so are my dogs while i am willing to share my yard with them i would prefer them to not be causing any harm to myself or my animals i've been killing them with raid wasp and hornet spray i've also heard that using a two litter bottle with either soapy water and the top upside down in the bottle would lure them in and they would die but i don't know how well it will work since i just read of this tonight i've also heard mt dew with soap added will do the same thing i was just wondering what has worked for people in the past the spray is killing them it just seems never ending the raid spray will kill the ones you can see make sure you get the nest and destroy it then dispose you will have to repeat the process as some of the insects are foraging and don't return to the nest area until later there are hanging bags and traps available that can be baited and capture some of the insects as the others have said look for water in your area and dry it up a wasp only needs a milliliter or two they can survive on the condensation of a glass of ice tea good luck Diseases of the honeybee Hamster Gypsy moth Hornet USS Wasp (CV-18) Milk Dairy Champagne (beverage) USS Anderson (DD-411) Blood (computer game) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) USS Wasp (CV-7) Bee Coffee Biological pest control Hong Kong-style milk tea Ant Wasp Paper wasp Fishing Phoebe Halliwell The Caves of Androzani USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Anthrax Redundant array of independent disks Breastfeeding Battle of Leyte Gulf Carnivorous plant Tea The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Gray Wolf Brewery Water Oddworld Animal Crossing Trapping Spider One Piece minor characters Fecal incontinence USS Thresher (SS-200) USS Hornet (CV-8) Textile manufacturing Battle of Shiloh Food preservation USS Tunny (SS-282) USS San Francisco (CA-38) USS Zane (DD-337) Dishwashing Bedbug USS Wedderburn (DD-684) The Dalek Invasion of Earth Animal communication Seabird Fox hunting Fire fighting Waste management Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Glass Plastic Battle of Jutland Bong The Death Gate Cycle Ninja Scroll Battle of the Philippine Sea USS Yorktown (CV-5) American Black Bear Car washing techniques Captain Thunderbolt Piccolo Junior Saga Knight Rider Vermicompost Resident Evil (video game) Domestic rabbit Apocrita Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Nalgene Africanized bee Red imported fire ant Agar plate Timon and Pumbaa Homunculi of Fullmetal Alchemist Beehive (beekeeping) Great Teacher Onizuka The Lovely Bones Angling Thermal power station Ecco the Dolphin Beast Wars Air pollution DDT Christmas tree Cruising (maritime) Survival skills Planet of the Daleks Zerg USS Pompano (SS-181) USS Washington (BB-56)
