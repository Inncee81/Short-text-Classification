btu air conditioner makes power go down all the time why every minutes i have to go to the fuse box to restart power this is very annoying any solution guys it s too hot these days thanks as the ac runs it is probably not defective or drawing too much current check the current rating on the ac and the rating of the breaker the breaker may have too low a rating for the ac current if the ac ever worked without operating the breaker perhaps the breaker is defective they are not expensive so you could have it changed if the breaker rating is too low one with a higher rating could be installed first though you need to know the safe current for the size of the conductors from the breaker panel to the ac if all this sounds beyond your abilities you need help from a more knowledgeable person Circuit breaker Fuse (electrical) Residual-current device Domestic AC power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Relay Three-phase electric power Solar cell Thermal power station Alternating current Capacitor Ground and neutral Circuit design National Electrical Code (US) Electrical wiring Solar power High-voltage direct current Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Jet engine Oscilloscope Nuclear fusion Electrical breakdown Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ring circuit Lightning rod Distribution board Wind power Short circuit Renewable energy Transformer Vacuum tube Gas metal arc welding Nuclear reactor Solar panel Spark plug Loudspeaker Booting Split phase Incandescent light bulb STS-61 Coal Alcohol fuel GunZ The Duel Universal Serial Bus Fusion power Railway signalling Voltage drop Electrical wiring (UK) Lac operon Virtual memory Electrophysiology Nuclear fuel cycle Pebble bed reactor Axial compressor Electric power transmission Manitoba Hydro Contact breaker Blue screen of death Tidal power Air conditioning Paintball Welding Thermostat Wood Electrician Ground (electricity) Embedded system E85 Space Shuttle program Ampere Central processing unit Seismic retrofit Hall effect Anthracite coal Autonomous building Wind turbine Fossil fuel power plant Spacecraft propulsion Literacy Inflation Flat tax Transformers: Cybertron Pyramid (game show) Conductor (material) Soap opera Defense of the Ancients Audiophile Titanium Energy development Power (physics) Nuclear power CPU cache CPU design Doomsday argument Horsepower Gas tungsten arc welding Appliance classes Dorama
