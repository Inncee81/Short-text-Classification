copper pipe should i replace it with what i have copper piping in my year old home i've noticed blue areas along the horizontal surfaces where the pipe is corroding i haven't noticed any leaks yet i had a plumber out today doing another job he said he has seen this type of thing in our area i'm trying to determine if i should replace all my copper pipe put clamps on the spots that are pitting or what lastly if i do choose to replace the pipe how do i decide if i should go with copper again i don't want to be replacing the pipe again in another years but i don't know if the corrosion has been caused by defective pipe a bad installation job or something else here's the thing i'm no plumber i actually discovered these spots on the pipes years ago and assumed it was from condensation on the outside of the pipe causing the problem the plumber that was here said the corrosion started on the inside i don't know how he knows this he wants to replace all of the piping how do i determine if this is problem caused by leakage from the inside or this is just corrosion on the outside if it is coming from the inside would you replace with copper perhaps it's a problem with the water you may not need to replace anything or maybe worst case a few sections all copper pipes will eventually get that bluish corrosion in any spot that leaks or at one time had a leak just because you have these doesn't mean it needs replacing often if there is a joint with a small leak the corrosion itself will seal it and you won't have any more problems until you move the pipes around in that area if you are going to replace i like copper because it's easier to install in my opinion and experience then pvc however pvc is cheaper and does last a long time there is nothing wrong with it copper should last over years Corrosion Thermal power station Welding Plastic Seismic retrofit Soldering Spark plug Hydrogen economy Bong Carburetor Electrical wiring Furnace Hard water Stainless steel M16 (rifle) Dairy Shipwreck Pump Aluminium Novelty (locomotive) Cruising (maritime) Electrophysiology Kitchen Wind turbine Action potential Coaxial cable Ammonia Urinary incontinence Farthing (coin) Elevator Laserdisc Solar power Containment building Hydrochloric acid Brazing E85 Nuclear power Copper Motor oil Nuclear weapon design Chess strategy and tactics Fire extinguisher Irrigation Cray-1 Renewable energy Fossil fuel power plant Copper extraction 2000 Australian Grand Prix Screw Transformer Hydraulic machinery Blue Man Group Eifel Aqueduct Reading spark plugs for racing Equine conformation Printed circuit board Ethernet Rocket fuel Solder William Murdoch Water supply Cookware and bakeware Faster-than-light Rust Diving suit Internal ballistics Flush toilet Geodesic dome Loudspeaker Borehole Cathodic protection Galvanic cell Wario Terminal ballistics Sleeve valve Roof Thermostat Butte, Montana Stage lighting Metallurgy Sulfuric acid Electric motor Glass Prisoner's dilemma Reinforced concrete Theory of conduct Vacuum 24 Hours of Le Mans Light switch 1957 World Series Capacitor plague Light-emitting diode Teller-Ulam design Apollo 13 STS-61 Rifle Anchor Plame affair
