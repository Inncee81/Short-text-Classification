heavily textured walls please help the walls and ceiling in a fixer upper i bought are heavily texture coated someone said that i could skim coat them my question is would i try to sand them down to lessen the deep lines from the texture and then skim coat if i had your problem i would would hammer out all the texture wall board and replace them with new sheet rock you will spend more time and effort sanding off the texture or spackling and sanding to smooth it out then if you simply ripped off the current wall board and replaced it believe it or not spackling and taping is the hardest part of sheet rocking not to mention if you try to smooth it out with spackle it will probably wind up cracking if you never worked with sheet rock before it might seem scary to do what i have suggested but here are some tips to cut the sheet rock all you need is a box cutter and a chalk line both of these you can buy at home depot or lowes to cut sheet rock you simply use your chalk line to mark where you need to cut it and then go over the chalk lines with the box cutter knife then you tap the sheet rock and it will crack right where you scored it with the knife Drill bit Woodworking Casting Drywall Glacier Plastic Stucco Seismic retrofit Violin Glass Drawing Wood Glossary of climbing terms Wood carving Volleyball Opportunity rover Pottery Knife Upholstery Metallurgy Table saw Powder metallurgy Black Sabbath Europa (moon) Erosion Mattress Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Welding Collecting fossils Sand casting Radio controlled airplane Naval mine Ice core Repouss__ and chasing Great Pyramid of Giza Surrealist techniques Aluminium Toilet paper Straw-bale construction Poker jargon Curling Die (manufacturing) Art rock Table tennis Brazing Tofu Fast bowling Doom engine Weathering United Airlines Flight 93 Duplicating machines Clothing Donovan Bassoon Billboard Hot 100 Anchor Sedimentary rock Textile manufacturing Pachypodium baronii Genericized trademark Utility knife Desert Metalworking Archery Atari 8-bit family Dog Sailing Polystyrene Ice hockey Asbestos Plate tectonics Bulk vending Plane (tool) Rigging Diamond cut Lava St Albans Cathedral Textile manufacturing terminology Kitchen Fenway Park Eggerland series AC/DC Sandstone Solar cell Future energy development Geology of the Moon Glossary of partner dance terms Floppy disk David Bowie Pebble bed reactor Gramophone record Sea ice Printed circuit board Sound effect PlayStation 2 Dam United States dollar Geology of the Alps Inspector Gadget
