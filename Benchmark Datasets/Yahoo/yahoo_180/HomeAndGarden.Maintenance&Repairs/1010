eliminating noise from the floor above does anyone know how you can eliminate noise coming from the floor above you every time the neighbor walks upstairs you can hear a wood noise very loudly different people have suggested different things but none of them are sure it will work i'm thinking if it's possible to add an extra layer of ceiling since i have high ceilings with the same material they use for music studios any suggestion would help thanks i own my floor and cost is not an issue actually yes there is im thinking you own the unit below get the land lords permission and or plan to remove it when you leave etc two choices ask them to do somthing like add carpet and padding which they will liklely be taken aback appalled and will not do or you can add a suspended ceiling which is like everything you see in mall stores squared or rectangular metal grids with usually white flat indent looks spongy on one side aluminum like on the other the metallic grid is laser leveled to give it a neat appearance wires attach to the original ceiling then snapped and twisted to hold the grid in addition to buffering the noise the fiber insulated rolls used in the walls can be laid on top ive seen this in legal offices where whats said in a room is kept in the room by this method of insulating the secondary ceiling by soundproofing it Mattress Transformer Solar cell Stairway Mouse (computing) Seismic retrofit Electrical wiring Printed circuit board Vacuum tube Basement Microphone Spark plug Oscilloscope Drill bit Compact disc Fire fighting Solar power Lighting Screw High-voltage direct current Wind turbine Optical fiber IPod Gramophone record Asbestos Loudspeaker Overhead lines Straw-bale construction Radar Textile manufacturing terminology Integrated circuit Electric power transmission Compact audio cassette Knife Glass Welding Sento Holkham Hall McMansion Plastic Carbon nanotube Radio controlled airplane Stucco Gas metal arc welding Doom engine Xanadu House Volleyball Naval mine Explosive material John Cage Laser Light-frame construction Chatsworth House Hydrogen economy Door Kitchen Tent Aluminium Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Epoxy Inertial guidance system The Dalek Invasion of Earth Sailing Bristol Grammar School Thermal power station Combine (Half-Life 2) Leaf Space elevator Cable television Hamster Toronto-Dominion Centre Overhead powerline Ultraviolet Floppy disk Bicycle frame Electrical breakdown Aerial (dance move) View camera Chair Timber framing Casting Stereoscopy Semiconductor Surface-mount technology Christmas tree Diode Wallpaper group Haloalkane Taikyoku shogi Window Irish Houses of Parliament Pebble bed reactor Insulation Echo chamber Knitting
