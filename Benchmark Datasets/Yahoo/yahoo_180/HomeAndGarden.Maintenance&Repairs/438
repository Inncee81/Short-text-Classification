electrical problem i started to vaccuum and part of my lights went out we checked all the outlets and fixtures connected to that outlet and can't find a problem that is we don't see anything disconnected or burnt we have no juice going to it at all i thought and still think it could be the breaker but they checked the breakers and said there is juice coming to the breaker i'm going crazy please help any suggestions just to let people know it only affected a quarter of the lights i still have electricity in the rest of the house if it is affecting only your lights and the breakers are all working that leaves a bad connection in a junction box or an open wire it will take a litttle time to locate it but it is possible to find if your search is thorough and done in an orderly manner Residual-current device Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Distribution board Switch Circuit breaker Ring circuit Relay 2003 North America blackout Fuse (electrical) Ground and neutral National Electrical Code (US) BS 1363 Incandescent light bulb Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Three-phase electric power Carburetor Light switch Spark plug Earthing system Thermal power station Poker jargon Ignition system Transformer Stage lighting Northeast Corridor STS-61 Ground (electricity) Armored Core Electric motor Cruising (maritime) Overhead lines Circuit design Capacitor Oplan Bojinka Aluminium Prostate cancer Green Line (MBTA) Short circuit Expert system Breaker Morant Champagne (beverage) Collision detection Random walk Daylight saving time Electrician Railway signal Electrical generator Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Bass guitar Ethernet Battery (electricity) X10 (industry standard) Boston and Providence Rail Road Lighting ADV Films Jumpstart 3rd Grade Professional wrestling throws Dublin Area Rapid Transit Alternating current Futurama (TV series - season 5) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Lawn mower Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Glossary of graph theory The Shining (film) TGV The Doctor Dances History of rail transport in Ireland Oscilloscope Electrical wiring (UK) Asperger syndrome Enigma machine Apollo Command/Service Module Kitchen Docklands Light Railway Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) BitTorrent HMS Warspite (1913) Glossary of firefighting terms Fluorescent lamp Back to the Future Fan (implement) Seismic retrofit Lightning rod STS-59 Mercury-vapor lamp Logic Power strip Light pollution Cryptanalysis 21 July 2005 London bombings Diode Computer bus Burglar alarm Satchel Paige Dualism (philosophy of mind) Dyslexia Breakdancing Plastic Semiconductor device
