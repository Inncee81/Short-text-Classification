what sort of paint should i use to paint an old dresser with it's one of those old girls white and pink dressers and i want to re paint it scuff sand the dresser wipe with mineral spirits to remove dust and paint with a porch and floor enamel in a gloss or semi gloss sheen porch and floor enamels are more durable as they are made to withstand foot traffic and wall paint is not the sheen is important because it will create a less porous surface so it will be more durable also if you plan on placing items that have rubber bits on the bottom like some lamps you may want to use an oil based product as the rubber and the latex will want to stick to one another on the negative side oil based paints will yellow over time pick the one oil or latex that has the side affects you can tolerate and use it couple of things to point out acrylic is another term for latex based paints which are water borne paints and you can definitely paint over oil based paint with latex as long as you prep the surface properly putting a thin layer of wax on the bottom of the items that you put on the dresser is a good idea as it does inhibit adhesion you can use the car polish or you can also use a furniture polish that contains wax like pledge note to sreshowtime if you want a really cool oops get few green black and brown colors in both oil and latex pour some of each on the surface and go to town brushing it the oil and latex will repell but you will get coverage it leaves a really cool texture and appearance let dry it takes a while and then cover with a shellac the natural amber of the shellac will add depth to the coating its a major no no and i cringe because of how wrong it is to do it but the end results while not stable or durable are cool Casting Plastic Pottery Diving suit Acrylic paint Gramophone record Lacquer Glaze Leather Vitreous enamel Stucco Mattress Tooth enamel Drill bit Chewing gum Strap-on dildo Menstrual cup Motor oil Manicure Seismic retrofit Glass Laser engraving Light-emitting diode Printmaking Tattoo Varnish Desert Fire extinguisher Petroleum Billiards Surrealist techniques Dundas Square Rubber Knife Woodworking Drawing Thermal power station Titanium Upholstery Tooth Top-bar hive Lighting Turquoise Alkane Sand casting Japanese tea ceremony Lionel Corporation Traditional animation Friction Cookware and bakeware Brewery Diamond Tuff Opportunity rover Textile manufacturing terminology Transformer Tofu Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Heinkel He 100 Carnivorous plant Glacier Amateur telescope making Epoxy Vulcanization Printed circuit board Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Hemp Bong Wassily Kandinsky Snooker Houseplant Curling Cast iron Wood finishing Color theory Plaster Fluorescent lamp Ceramics Campfire Equine conformation Tire Ultraviolet Gesso Double bass Radio controlled airplane Painting Sunglasses Label Wok Cosmetics Paper marbling Chromium
