how to fix my shower diverter i have a rohl shower fixture with a diverter valve that wasn't diverting much water to the shower head so i took apart the fixture to reveal the valve to see what might be wrong in the process the diverter spindle became completely detached from the valve clearly it wasn't well attached to begin with but now i don't know how to reattach it there's a small hole on the valve that appears to be where the diverter goes it's about mm in diameter and is mostly filled up by some white plastic material i don't it see a clear break anywhere the diverter spindle has a screw inside am i supposed to use that somehow what should i do it's single lever the diverter is a button below the lever so it's not a part of the spout the button is connected to a spindle that's some how connected to the valve but that part is broken well first of all i am not familiar with a rohl faucet or what the internal components are let's start here is it a three knob faucet single lever two handle what makes the water divert to the shower head is it a pull down piece on the tub spout or is it a button of some kind when you say spindle i assume a piece that turns in one direction when you push it you have got to let a plumber see it or take it to your local supply house if all else fails go on line and search for the name brand and parts breakdown sheets there is very little that keeps any brand of faucet from diverting to the shower head it 's either a push button or a pull spout of some kind there are sometimes washers or cup and springs that go behind some turn knob type handles if it is a single handle faucet and possibly the same with three handle valves bottom line is every faucet can be very different you need a breakdown or a plumber period Tap (valve) Diving regulator Carburetor Flush toilet Drill bit Plumbing fixture Glossary of firefighting equipment Siphon Screw Textile manufacturing Floppy disk Trombone Stage lighting Seismic retrofit Sento Mitosis Poker jargon Thermostat Diving cylinder Drill Knife Elevator Samovar Lathe Hand grenade Hydraulic machinery Diode Bong Manual transmission Lathe (metal) Japanese toilet Micrometer Gramophone record Borehole Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Urinal Rigging Tire Oscilloscope Trapping Naval mine Wire Wood router Curling Pottery Fountain pen M16 (rifle) Guitar Domestic water system Plane (tool) Second Battle of the Atlantic Spark plug Menstrual cup Apollo Command/Service Module Space shuttle main engine Two-stroke cycle Sleeve valve Light switch Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Transistor Wrench Glacier USS Tunny (SS-282) Chevrolet Corvair engine Motorcycle Irrigation Handloading Semiconductor device Timpani Scuba set Woodturning Bicycle frame Die (manufacturing) Mouse (computing) Fire hydrant Mattress Panama Canal Locks Harmonica Motility Club (weapon) Motor oil Paintball marker Dishwasher Rail terminology Shotgun De Lorean DMC-12 IPod Four-stroke cycle Toilet paper Transformer Sailing Switch
