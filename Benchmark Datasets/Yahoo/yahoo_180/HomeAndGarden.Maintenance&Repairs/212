what is the anatomy of a bathroom floor with tile i have to repair a hole in a bathroom floor that is upstairs there was some leaking around the tub and the wood is rotted the joists look good but the wood that is laid across the joists need to be replaced there is also a layer of plywood i think i would like to patch the floor and then install tile over the entire bathroom there was carpet in the bathroom that i ripped up are there particular types of wood that i should use for the floor before i put the cement board and the tiles down i don't want to use anything that may rot through over time i want the fix to be permanent and the floor to be level so i can proceed with the tiling thanks in advance for your input as most have said plywood is the best sub floor just remember that all wood products will rot when exposed to water for long enough with that said after you have cut out the old plywood replace it with the same thickness as the existing and use a flooring grade plywood it does not need to be tongue and grove though as you won't be able to match into any existing tongue or grove flooring plywood that is not laid down as tongue and grove the whole floor needs to be blocked at the edges that means you will need to add solid framing lumber on all four sides of the patch securely attach them into the floor joists with nails this is important because by cutting the plywood you will have soft spots at the edges which will cause your new tile to crack now for the water part once you plywood sub floor is sturdy again you need to protect it put down a layer of min building paper over the entire floor hold it down with staples but not too many next put down a cement board tape the joints as stated earlier and on the instructions and finish with the tile and grout do not rely on the tile the grout or any sealer to protect your wood grout is porous water will go right through cement products like cement board are also porous water will be an issue down the road unless you protect the wood good luck Wood Plywood Basement Upholstery Drill bit Stairway Casting Knife Drywall Roof Woodworking Parquetry Light-frame construction St Albans Cathedral Platform framing Tile Carpet Kitchen Deck (ship) Masonry Boat building Timber framing Tessellation Lumber Dominoes Mattress Welding Architecture of the California missions Electrical wiring Straw-bale construction Tire Hamster Geodesic dome Fire fighting Dam Plane (tool) Oriented strand board Textile manufacturing Terrazzo STS-114 Pavement (material) Portsmouth Block Mills Campfire McMansion Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Ra (board game) Radio controlled airplane Screw Windows XP Climbing equipment Bassoon Rail tracks Strake Glossary of climbing terms Hemp Compact disc Disc brake Ridge Route Gramophone record Brewery Ceramics Saw Floppy disk Atari 8-bit family Table tennis Naval mine Poker jargon Chatsworth House Wood carving Sento King Khalid International Airport Tongue Bathroom Parachute Collecting fossils Wallpaper group Asbestos Sydney Opera House Elevator Culture of Korea Clinker (boat building) De Lorean DMC-12 Windows 2000 Stucco Anchor Violin Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Jute
