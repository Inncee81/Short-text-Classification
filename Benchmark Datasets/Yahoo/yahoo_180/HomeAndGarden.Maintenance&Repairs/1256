how do i make my hot tub heater into a plug in i have a coates kw volt amp heater salvaged from my old hot tub id like to use it for a small outdoor pool it has large wires coming from the element and smaller wires coming from the high med low controls as well as white ground wires can the large wires be wired to a separate plug and the small wires wired to another plug i already have a filter and pump for this little ft pool but need a heater to warm it a bit since it is way to cold to swim in now i do not intend to run either the heater or the filter pump when anyone is actually using the pool and my electrician friend will rewire it if he knew what to do your 'electrician friend' isn't a electrician if he doesn't know what to do but you need to put it on a amp rcbo with a isolator switch using mm square cable at least my advise is pay somebody to do it you cant put a price on a persons life its not worth the risk Residual-current device Domestic AC power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Three-phase electric power Thermostat Swimming pool Electrical wiring (UK) HVAC Electricity meter Spark plug Vacuum tube Carburetor Thermal power station Transformer Diesel engine Fossil fuel power plant Apollo 13 Circuit design RS-232 Programmable logic controller Incandescent light bulb Gas metal arc welding Motor oil Solar panel Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Oscilloscope Poker jargon Transistor Diving Bathing E85 Ring circuit Tesla coil Electrician Brewery Solar collector Operational amplifier Universal Serial Bus Electrical wiring Koi Overhead lines Sauna Ethernet Enigma machine Split phase Electronic amplifier Audiophile Lighting Reading spark plugs for racing Ground and neutral Capacitor Earthing system National Electrical Code (US) Firefighter Spark gap TIA-568A/B Aquarium Jack plug Xbox Fountain Wire Alternating current Loudspeaker Wire wrap High-voltage direct current Radio controlled airplane Digital Subscriber Line Marine aquarium Nintendo GameCube Electrical element Coffee Drill bit Electrophysiology Telephone exchange Television Power strip Dimmer Modem USB flash drive Knife Customs and etiquette of Japan Hot tub Hot air balloon Pebble bed reactor Samovar Printed circuit board Electric motor Sento Musical Instrument Digital Interface Energy development Lineman (occupation)
