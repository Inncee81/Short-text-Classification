low water pressure in the home very odd i have replaced all plumbing in the house with pex including the shutoff valve the incoming line from the meter is inch copper city says its reading psi at the meter can the meter be bad restricting flow so that leaves it the line between the house and the meter which is a quarter mile long i have another house that probable has the pipe in the same trench and its pressure is working fine no leaks underground is there a way to test the line and can a copper line be full of deposits the most obvious thing would be a pressure regulator downstream of the meter either at the meter itself or at the house but i assume you've already checked this if there's no pressure regulator or you've verified the pressure downstream of it i'd suggest fitting a hose faucet before the main shutoff valve so you can test the pressure before it goes into the house system if you're seeing the drop before the house shutoff valve i'd then fit a valve out at the meter to verify you're really get psi before the run up to the house if that checks out i'd suspect a leak but there's certainly something going on between the meter and the house edit this is based on the assumption that you actually have a pressure drop at the house and not just low flow if you did a homerun install the shouldn't be an issue maybe to a tub shower but will suffice and if you've got low flow faucets and shower heads is more than enough also you mentioned that you started the pex before the main house shutoff valve or at least that's what i think you meant with pex including the shutoff valve this is all inside right pex can not be installed anywhere with direct uv exposure the mfg's specify a maximum tolerance of days exposure to sunlight during distrubution and installation beyond that it goes brittle and will quickly fail Flush toilet Diving regulator Hydraulic machinery Siphon Carburetor Glossary of firefighting equipment Irrigation Rebreather Thermal power station Dialysis Diving cylinder Tap (valve) Fuel injection Plumbing fixture Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Water supply Domestic water system Containment building Panama Canal Tire Vacuum Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Scuba set Spark plug Manifold vacuum Space shuttle main engine Fire fighting Renewable energy Thermostat Air brake (rail) Oxyacetylene Home repair Novelty (locomotive) Solar cell Three Mile Island Welding Electrophysiology Glacier Opportunity rover Pulse jet engine Solar power Dishwasher Jet engine Coriolis effect Circuit breaker Energy development Apollo Command/Service Module Furnace Hydraulic ram Broadband Internet access Trombone Dam Nuclear power Sleeve valve Dodge Neon Space Shuttle external tank Residual-current device Bell's theorem Diode Fire hydrant Electricity meter Fire extinguisher Soldering Fuse (electrical) Dead Sea Cartridge (firearms) Vacuum tube STS-61 Heat Sento Electrical wiring High-voltage direct current Mobile phone radiation and health Plastic Poker jargon Fluorescent lamp Drill bit Many-worlds interpretation Casting Airbus A380 Dundas Square Oceanic trench Gold standard Debugging Universal Serial Bus Glossary of wildland fire terms Atrial septal defect
