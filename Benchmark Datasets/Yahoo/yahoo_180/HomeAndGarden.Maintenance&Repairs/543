electrical wiring question adding a dimmer switch to a three way circuit hi i would like to add a maestro dimmer switch to a three way circuit my current setup is that i have two switches that control one receptacle i would like the finished job to have the receptacle be controlled by only the dimmer switch and have the second switch be inoperable this is what i currently have for my wiring setup switch one wanting to add dimmer to and keep red and white wire connected at top of switch white connected at bottom two black wires connected to each other switch one wanting to make inoperable black connected at top red and white connected at bottom receptacle white connected at top black and white connected at bottom two black wires and one white wire connected to each other i understand somewhat how the two switches work but am baffled at the receptacles wiring i am no electrician by any means so if someone could explain in simple terms i would greatly appreciate it on the line switch you have one hot wire and two travelers on the load side you have the other end of the two travelers and the wire that goes to the light the light works by switching from one traveler to the other one either end you need to figure out which wires are the travelers and which one is the hot in the first switch box line side check the directions on the dimmer and wire it as instructed using one of the travelers as the wire to the nd switch box which you will connect to the black wire to the receptacle on the brass colored screw the white goes on the silver colored screw and the ground goes on the green colored screw Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Dimmer Antenna (radio) Switch National Electrical Code (US) Rail terminology Residual-current device Thermostat Universal Serial Bus Electrical wiring Oscilloscope Three-phase electric power High-voltage direct current X10 (industry standard) Electric motor Railway signal BS 1363 Carburetor Telephone exchange Computer Light-emitting diode Enigma machine Wire wrap Electrical wiring (UK) Light switch Tesla coil Apollo Guidance Computer Loudspeaker IPod Overhead lines Lighting Lineman (occupation) System/36 Screw Transformer Wire Gas metal arc welding Solar cell Spark gap Lightning Computer bus Drill bit Amateur telescope making Seismic retrofit Relay Potentiometer Hydraulic machinery Snooker Digital circuit RS-232 Circuit breaker Magnetic core memory Colours, standards and guidons SCART Sun Impedance matching Seismometer Logic gate Elevator Rail tracks Railway electrification system Suspension bridge Programmable logic controller Headlight Split phase Central processing unit Fluorescent lamp Railway signalling Ethernet TIA-568A/B Circuit design System/34 Transmission line Series and parallel circuits Electrical element Thyristor Electrical generator Jack plug Sinclair ZX81 Alternating current Electrophysiology Nonblocking minimal spanning switch TGV Electricity distribution Shogi Billiards Barbed wire Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Welding
