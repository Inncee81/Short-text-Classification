has anyone given any thought about the bacteria that may be present in the water line of refrigerators i'm moving up in the world yes i have my first fridge with an automatic ice maker i live alone i don't use that much ice a thought occured to me the water from the plumbing in the kitchen goes through a flimsy plastic tubing that runs to the fridge i know there is a vaccum effect but the water remains in the line until there is a demand from the icemaker some of it may be there for weeks in my case is there a condition of vaccum sufficient enough to keep bacteria from breeding is it the same as buying bottled water considering shelf life and all that what do you think i would also like to hear from people who also know and their sources just one more thing to worry about in our overly cautious and neurotic society lol thanks you do sound a little neurotic here there is chlorine in the water that will prevent most bacteria from developing there is also no air in the water that the bacteria can thrive on unless it is anaerobic bacteria but in any case once the water hits your freezer the cold temperature will kill anything in it so stop worrying and start enjoying your ice Refrigerator Sewage treatment Air conditioning Water purification Food preservation Foodborne illness Water Ice cream Escherichia coli O157:H7 Swimming Bacteria Ozone Tofu Botulism Autonomous building Acetic acid Agar plate Solar power Compost Sulfur Swimming pool Milk Ozone depletion Bong Coffee Domestic water system Carbon dioxide Ammonia Intravenous therapy Ozone hole Sea-Monkey Ice Energy development Vacuum Food storage Disinfection Brewery Sea ice Chlorine Permian-Triassic extinction event Dairy Kitchen Acne Pneumonia Ice core HVAC Anthrax Carburetor Soil life Geyser Motility Photosynthesis Sterilization (microbiology) Planet of the Daleks Aquarium Alkane Diseases of the honeybee Renewable energy Haloalkane Alternative biochemistry Plumbing fixture Drowning Equine conformation Carnivorous plant Siphon Rum Anaerobic digestion Stirling engine Cruising (maritime) E85 Fire fighting Plastic Bottled water Urinal Fog Refrigeration Slow cooker Water (molecule) Wine making Lake Exploration of Mars Organic food Cellular respiration Cholera Dialysis Halitosis Common cold Microwave oven Vermicompost Hard disk Methane Body piercing Hong Kong-style milk tea Paleoclimatology Mars Abiogenic petroleum origin Severe weather terminology (United States) Menstrual cycle
