how do i tell if a motor's start winding has failed our dryer stopped working the other day when i press the start button it starts running but as soon as i let go of the button it stops again i've done a bunch of investigating and the usual causes for this don't seem to be the problem one expert told me that the start winding on the motor has probably failed and the motor needs replacing before i spend the to buy a new motor though i'd like to be sure that that's the problem is there some way to test a dryer motor's start winding to see if it's failed i have the dryer almost completely disassembled so i can access the motor easily thanks for any help you can give me my wife is about to kill me for not just hiring a repairman or buying a new dryer test the motor for continuity across the leads since you have to pull the motor anyway just go ahead and replace it Toyota Prius Electric motor Knots Landing Indianapolis 500 Chris Amon Mouse (computing) TGV 2005 United States Grand Prix Elevator 2003 United States Grand Prix Carburetor The Amazing Race Cadillac Traffic light Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Outsourcing 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix Irrigation 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Inspector Gadget Iditarod 2004 San Marino Grand Prix The Midnight Sun 2005 Canadian Grand Prix 24 Hours of Le Mans Movie projector NeXT Pedestrian crossing Extreme Programming British American Racing Fault tolerant design Jordan Grand Prix Pioneer Zephyr Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cheating in Counter-Strike Toronto Subway and RT Thermal power station Armoured warfare USS S-38 (SS-143) Motor oil Spidey Super Stories Cruising (maritime) New World First Bus Airsoft Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina R46 (New York City Subway car) USS Tunny (SS-282) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina 2005 French Grand Prix 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix John F.
