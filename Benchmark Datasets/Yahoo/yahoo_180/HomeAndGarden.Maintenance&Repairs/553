fix this washing machine ge or replace my ge wlse model washing machine has stopped spinning if i put it into a slow spin it may spin for a few seconds and then stop i have removed the drive belt and the motor pulley spins just fine with no load when i spin the transmission pulley it resists me and makes a few grinding noises when i let go it spins back i'm sure that i need to buy a new transmission gear box at the cost of about plus shipping i haven't seen any evidence of what may have caused the problem no soot brown stuff rust water etc in the bottom pan for anyone who knows should i replace any other parts while i'm at it i'm leaning toward just finding a washer on sale and replacing this one a second opinion would be nice sorry to tell you this but it sounds like the transmission has gone out so your best bet is to replace the washer i just spent just for labor transmission was under warranty but labor was not it took the so called repairman trips to repair it and it is still not right if i had known this before i would have replaced the washer Manual transmission Motorcycle Automatic transmission Bicycle Tractor Washing machine Transmission (mechanics) Motor oil Wind turbine Elevator Textile manufacturing Tire Dry cleaning Machine gun Crane (machine) Industrial Revolution Gear ratio Electric motor Diesel engine Phonograph De Lorean DMC-12 Portsmouth Block Mills Chevrolet Corvair Differential (mechanics) Electrical generator E85 Hard disk USS Tunny (SS-282) Fossil fuel power plant Lathe BMW M5 Heinkel He 112 Robot Wars Outsourcing Hydraulic machinery Airsoft Ford Ranger EV Conveyor belt Screw Laserdisc Chevrolet Corvair engine Ford Motor Company Rope Atari 8-bit family Panzer I Shaggy dog story Table saw Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Dodge Neon Combine (Half-Life 2) BMW E34 Recumbent bicycle Hybrid vehicle Transformer Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Disc brake Automobile Slot machine Lawn mower Land Rover Mitsubishi 3000GT Mars Exploration Rover Ford Mustang Suspension bridge Floppy disk Clinker (boat building) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Douglas DC-8 Wheel of Fortune Wind power Mattress Model aircraft Tank Porsche 993 Upholstery Freewheel Helicopter 2000 Australian Grand Prix Spark plug Porsche 911 Commodore 64 GM 60-Degree V6 engine Oscilloscope All-terrain vehicle Internal ballistics Galileo spacecraft Coffee Mazda Miata Ford Thunderbird M60 machine gun Cookware and bakeware Honda Prelude
