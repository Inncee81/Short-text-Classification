how do i empty water from my immersion heater i wan't to change the element in my immersion heater the immersion heater is the tall round cylinder type with two mm pipes going in and out from the central heating and two mm pipes one on the side and one on the top the mm pipe on the side as a valve that i can turn and that turns off the supply to the hot taps immediatly but i can 't seem to emty the tank whenever i loosen the element water starts to come out and i feel as i let water out the tap the cylinder is just filling back up i assume the immersion heater is on the top of the tank st shut off the cold main coming in to the house gate valves like the one you turned off at the side of the cylinder are noted for not shutting off fully as they get limescaled over the yrs don't seal properly then open all hot taps in the house until they stop running afraid you'll loose what hot water you had then put an old towel round the top of the tank as most immersion heaters are not at the highest point on the tank a small amount of water will come out quite normal then take out replace with new one ps if water still comes out without stopping then your indirect tank itself is burst inside will need renewing don't touch your radiator bleed screws as someone suggested as they have nothing to do with your job in hand best of luck Carburetor Thermal power station Thermostat Water heater Diesel engine Apollo 13 Fire fighting Solar power Autonomous building Glossary of firefighting equipment Furnace Diving regulator HVAC Rail terminology Tap (valve) Hydraulic machinery Steam engine Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Diving cylinder Newcomen steam engine Novelty (locomotive) Spark plug Siphon Dishwasher Radiator Vacuum tube Screw Two-stroke cycle Scuba set Ammunition Irrigation Rebreather Oxyacetylene Seismic retrofit Bong Renewable energy Sento Drill bit Sleeve valve Central heating Basement Canal lock Fossil fuel power plant Internal ballistics Internal combustion engine Flush toilet Armored Core Domestic water system Hot air balloon Nuclear power Chevrolet Corvair Fire hydrant Motor oil Poker jargon Glossary of firefighting terms Energy development Tank Stirling engine Apollo Command/Service Module Fuel injection Glossary of partner dance terms Boiler Solar panel Chevrolet Corvair engine Brewery Marine aquarium Portable stove Upholstery Fujian tea ceremony Diving Motorcycle Manifold vacuum Transformer Containment building Baptism Circuit breaker Incandescent light bulb Betting (poker) Dundas Square Ocean thermal energy conversion Washing machine Home repair Wrench Indianapolis 500 M16 (rifle) Plumbing fixture Three Mile Island Oxygen sensor Tire Hydropower Pebble bed reactor Transistor Thermocouple
