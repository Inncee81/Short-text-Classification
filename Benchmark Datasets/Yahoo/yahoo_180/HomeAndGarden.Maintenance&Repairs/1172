what should the press be on the high side low side at dredges out side air temp on a ton unit it depends on the efficiency of your condenser but probabloy somewhere in the range of from psi like i said it depends on the efficiency of your condenser it doesn't matter that it's a heat pump older air conditioners run up to psi that's not excessive most technicians would check a thing called subcooling to determine if the condenser was actually doing it's job correctly the low side pressure should be somewhere around psi that equals saturated temperature of the refrigerant again i say it deepends on the efficiency of the unit the temperature of the house and the relative humidity of the house most technicians would check a thing called superheat on this side of the system a good technician would also check the relative tumidity and temperature of the house and use a superheat charging chart to determine a good superheat for those conditions it's not all about pressures too many people think they can determine the operating conditions by using pressures a good technincian would also check to see if you had a good temperature difference of the air across the indoor coil difference give or take would be too low and would be too high again it depends on the present conditions in your house of course if everything was perfect in your house you probably would not be asking if it has been on and cooling the house for a while then those pressures would be acceptable Air conditioning Thermal power station Steam engine Water vapor Ocean thermal energy conversion Fossil fuel power plant Explosive material Carburetor Thermostat Phase change heat pump Relative humidity Turbocharger Heat Spark plug Phase (matter) Temperature Hydraulic machinery Transformer Jet engine Gas compressor Circuit design E85 Swamp cooler Solar power HVAC Stirling engine Humidity Welding Carbon dioxide Superconductivity Motor oil Microphone Diesel engine Vacuum Furnace Diode Superheater Inflation Refrigerator Hydrogen Houseplant Dirac equation Brewery Oxygen sensor Internal combustion engine Adiabatic lapse rate Turbofan Hydropower Axial compressor Thermoregulation Weather lore Autonomous building Heat equation Gas absorption refrigerator Water (molecule) Identical particles Two-stroke cycle Nuclear fusion Hydrogen economy Nuclear explosion Three Mile Island Water purification Turbojet Ammonia Climate of the United Kingdom National Weather Service Fuel injection Spacecraft propulsion Solar cell Hot air balloon Supply and demand Alkane Dairy Quantum computer Bleed air Renormalization Pressurized water reactor Incandescent light bulb Wind power Big Bang Equine conformation Frost STS-62 Peltier-Seebeck effect Heinkel He 100 Boiling Microeconomics Diving cylinder Pebble bed reactor Cold fusion Insulation Mooney M20 Evaporative cooling Heat index
