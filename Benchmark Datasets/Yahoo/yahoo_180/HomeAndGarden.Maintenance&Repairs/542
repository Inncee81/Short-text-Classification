sliding glass door help alright i have a solid wood not sure what kind anderson door that was installed somewhere between and it is double paned a dog chewed on it previous owner and i patched it with wood filler no structural damage hardware needs replacing and i think the weather strips they are hard may need replaced if i can figure out how it is a standard footer one stationary side we can afford to spend no more than dollars on a replacement can i just repair this door do you think and all or should i go down to a vinyl on the anderson website the series looks like ours and it is like so no way we can rebuy the same door i just live in iowa and it gets cold as all heck here and so i need to do something before winter if i can repair it that is that goes towards my kitchen so you see why i want to if possible it seems the andersen web site is down at the moment so i can't give you links to the specifics but a few notes you can get any part you need for this door there are pictures with part numbers on their site under service to help you identify what you need in the way of weatherstrip if memory serves correctly the weatherstrip on these units is a rigid vinyl so unless you see parts broken off it may be ok if you do need to replace it is not difficult the replacements will have instructions that are easy to follow with minimal skill replacing the panel is the most expensive part of your problems a new panel will be in the range of depending upon the type of glass in the panel and the discounts offered in your region andersen hardware has a year warranty if the door was purchased toward the end of the range you mentioned it may still be covered the hardware warranty does not cover finish wear nor would it cover damage but if the hardware is otherwise broken it is worth looking into you should find a local dealer to help you with parts when you call or visit them you will need the visible glass size of the unit measure just the part of the glass you can see the exterior and interior colors and the information etched around the andersen logo in one corner of the glass with the logo information they can tell which type of glass is in the unit and the year it was manufactured repairing the door would be much preferred to replacing it with vinyl the andersen door will perform much better than a vinyl slider and will add to or in this case retain the value of your home the parts especially the panel are expensive but replacing parts is much easier than changing the whole door i would not under any circumstances try to fit a generic weatherstrip to an andersen door the factory parts will do a much better job and look much nicer a bit more expensive but worth it in the long run the andersen site is back up now so have a look at http www andersenwindows com homeowner pdfs frenchwood gliding pdf caution pdf file may take a few minutes there is a diagram on page showing each of the weatherstrip pieces it would be helpful to print this page and circle the parts you need also looking there i see that most of the weatherstrip is rigid with rubber pieces inside so it is normal for the outside pieces to be hard there should be a softer rubber piece inside if this is missing then you do need new weatherstrip Mattress Gramophone record Drill bit Plastic CPU cache Laserdisc Tire Floppy disk De Lorean DMC-12 Compiler optimization Billiards Redundant array of independent disks Casting Digital photography Ford Cortina Seismic retrofit Natural Selection (computer game) Virtual memory Beatmania IIDX Commodore 64 Windows 2000 Inflation Pump It Up Apple Computer Microeconomics Atari 8-bit family Windows Vista Solar power C programming language Toyota Prius Color Computer Motorcycle Bicycle lighting Imperial (automobile) Stereoscopy Violin Digital circuit Autorack Car body style World Wide Web Strap-on dildo Welding Car handling BASIC programming language Vinyl roof Stairway Computer virus Linked list Condom Transformer Japanese tea ceremony Dance Dance Revolution Electrophysiology Common Unix Printing System Radio controlled airplane Bus models used in New York City Transit Compact disc HTML element Arcade cabinet Central processing unit View camera Circuit design Marching band Digital rights management Mac OS X Elevator Volkswagen Type 2 Diving suit Amstrad CPC STS-114 Dog agility Sento Universal Serial Bus Wallpaper group Incandescent light bulb Warranty Ford Mustang Musical Instrument Digital Interface Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Porsche 911 Mainframe computer Cube (film) E85 Overclocking Phonograph cylinder IPod
