how do i hard wire an under cabinet light if it has a plug can i cut the plug and hard wire it to an existing box i stubbed out or should i install a receptacle and plug it in i would rather hard wire it because the stubbed box will be covered up in a cabinet i don't want an exposed receptacle hidden in my cabinet you need to install a receptacle and plug the light in as designed or get a different fixture lamp cord is not designed to be directly connected to rough wiring the heat rating of the insulation is not sufficient also the wire is usually a very fine stranded type to allow the cord to be very flexible this generally does not work well when connecting to solid or a heavier stranded wire Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Electrical wiring BS 1363 Spark plug Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Transformer Stage lighting National Electrical Code (US) Tire Lighting Extension Cord Enigma machine Distribution board Thermal power station Category 5 cable IPod Solar power Gender of connectors and fasteners Dimmer Coaxial cable Jack plug Three-phase electric power Ground and neutral Alternating current Residual-current device Antenna (radio) Electrical generator Power cable Incandescent light bulb Barbed wire Aluminium Strap-on dildo Telephone switchboard Carburetor Ammunition Advanced Technology Attachment Electrical wiring (UK) Electricity meter Solar cell Circuit design Laptop Welding Power cord Vacuum tube Textile manufacturing terminology Rail terminology Xbox 360 Street light Relay Radio controlled airplane Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster DIN connector Computer bus TIA-568A/B Ring circuit High-voltage direct current Geodesic dome Mattress Earthing system X10 (industry standard) Headlight Plastic Sand casting Asbestos Hydrogen economy Transistor Pebble bed reactor Japanese toilet Reading spark plugs for racing Xbox Seismometer Ford Crown Victoria Ignition system Mercury-vapor lamp Screw Box Switch Kitchen Spark gap Gas metal arc welding Light switch Polystyrene Printed circuit board Bicycle lighting Telephone exchange Mouse (computing) Rope Light rail Brewery Sound recording Europlug Trench warfare Hearing aid Arcade cabinet
