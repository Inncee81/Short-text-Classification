i need help with my sink erator usually when i flip the switch the water goes down the sink but nowadays the water comes up out of the sink when i turn on the ise sink erator does anyone have any ideas of why this might be happening thanks the blades spin but the water comes out many garbage disposals do a fair but not good job of grinding the partly ground garbage passed through the disposal's screens and have collected in the trap under the sink take everything out from under the sink everything unplug the disposal so no one turns it on get a bucket and place it under the trap the u shaped line with screw on mounting fittings get at least one if not extra buckets nearby as you may need them use a flashlight for light not electric powered light as you may have water to contend with open one of the fittings on the trap and let the water drain into the bucket switch buckets as needed it is better to do this slowly and let the water drain rather than open it fully and have water all over the place once all the water has drained empty the buckets but leave one bucket under the trap and ultimately replace the bucket with an empty bucket although the water may be foul smelling you can dump it in on the lawn if it has ground garbage in it do not dump it in another sink as it will plug it now fully remove the trap and let the trap fall into the bucket put another bucket under the open line remove the vertical line all the way back to the garbage disposal take the trap and all of the drain line you removed outside and clean it completely rinising it with a garden hose can do the job let this drip dry outside now back under the kitchen sink look into the disposal from the vent line flash light needed and see if there is garbage in it if so remove the disposal take it out and rinse it completely clear do not get water on the disposal motor let things dry now reassemble everything and check for leaks if you have rubber gaskets on the drain line replace them if they are worn or you will have leaks all should now be ok Plumbing fixture Lawn mower Irrigation Tire Autonomous building Dairy Thermal power station Sento Motor oil The Dalek Invasion of Earth Carburetor Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Sewage treatment Menstrual cup Oxyacetylene Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Dialysis Landfill Domestic water system Dredge E85 Yohoho!
