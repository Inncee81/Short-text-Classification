carpet cleaner chemically lightened carpet i have a tan white colored carpet its a normal carpet the threads are about inches long one time i used a carpet cleaner and didnt read the directions and sprayed the carpet and left it to soak there for a few minutes now the carpet spot is yellow any way to fix the unfixable other than getting a new carpet i personally prefer woolite spotshot for those little carpet mishaps but not sure if that would fix your problem i have seen martha stewart use oxiclean to whiten and remove stains from antique table linens when doing so she allows the item to soak in the oxiclean for as long as hours i don't think oxiclean would harm your carpet and at this stage how much harm could it do i would apply it liberally and reapply from time to time to keep it damp until the stain disappears up to several hours or even a day if no cleaner works is covering the stain with a rug or piece of furniture an option there might be some way to cut out the stained area and replace with a remnant of unstained carpet if necessary taking the unstained piece from a closet floor or from under a large piece of furniture but i don't know how you would secure the patch down maybe your carpet supplier could suggest a method or be willing to do it for you hope something in that helps you somehow Carpet Upholstery Vacuum cleaner Roomba Drill bit Woodworking Tooth enamel Chair Stairway Fire fighting Mattress Plastic Patch (computing) Textile manufacturing terminology Hydrogen peroxide Shroud of Turin Staining (biology) Bedbug Bloodstain pattern analysis Diamond enhancement Pottery Animal Crossing Gramophone record Hamster Hemp Jute Casting The Adventure of the Second Stain Leather Basement Tag Bong Color Clothing GunZ The Duel Mario series enemies Microscopy Bulk vending Gypsy moth Japanese tea ceremony Screw Paint Glass Wood carving Fancy rat Diseases of the honeybee The Human Stain Photography Tattoo Peanut Urinary incontinence Niddah Persian rug Home repair Drawing Manicure Stage lighting Cannabis cultivation Lighting Shoe Gram staining Billiards Laundry detergent Wood Symmetry Oasis (band) Psoriasis Lathe Fuel injection White noise Surveillance Knife Table saw Common bean Ultraviolet Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Medical prescription Sterilization (microbiology) Fluorescent lamp Berkshire Hathaway Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Malignant melanoma Electrostatic precipitator English plural Drug test Eight ball House dust mite Poker jargon Strap-on dildo Agarose gel electrophoresis Cocaine Dai dai shogi Advertising Space Shuttle program Single Transferable Vote Airport Tai shogi Weed control Seismic retrofit
