got shocked touch the fridge and stove at same time ouch my neighbor has a very old stove gas and an old fridge pretty close together i opened the fridge with left arm and leaned back against the side of the stove and immerdeiatly got a huge shock i felt glued to the door handle for a second even the pain shock went all the way to my feet i mean it hurt pretty bad i had been swimming about an hour before and my hands and body were dry my suit the part that touched the stove and shorts were damp however my elderly neighbor said it was because i was wet but i don't think so this was one heck of a jolt my arm still hurts several hours later kind of tingly too would this be a bad ground he touched them together and felt nothing well it sounds to me like either the stove or refrig have a hot wire contacting the casing of the appliance either directly or even just slightly and im assuming that the appliances and the wiring in the house are fairly old that they possibly do not have a ground at all as a ground is not needed only a nuetral most older houses had no grounds so if this is the case you have a appliance with a hot casing sitting there waiting for a quicker path to ground other than its nuetral path so you came along along wet and making good contact with the floor and the casing of the other appliance and you became the ground this is what i think anyway Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Residual-current device Stove Fire fighting Seismic retrofit Volleyball Refrigerator Equine conformation Aerial (dance move) Kitchen Car handling Diving suit Electroshock gun Menstrual cup Solar power Basement Milton H.
