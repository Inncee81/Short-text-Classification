what's an easy and inexpensive way to stop rain gutters from leaking at the seams i thought there'd be some kind if gutter sealant in the hardware store but when i went there to inquire the guy said they didn't carry any and besides they don't work that well any opinions on this or suggestions about repairs yes there is a caulk made for gutters flashing etc get it at lowe's etc should do the trick but on a side note you might want to look into why they are leaking at the seams if the gutter is not sloped properly water is just going to stand in the gutter which will cause it to leak whereas if the water was flowing freely it would be less likely to leak Basement Deck (ship) Soldering Roof Fast bowling Geodesic dome Road Glossary of nautical terms Ice dam Home repair Energy development Double bass Plame affair Welding Apollo 8 Autonomous building Solar power Irrigation Aerial (dance move) Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Digital circuit Vacuum tube Tire Fuel cell Menstrual cup Knife Skateboarding trick Boat building Seismic retrofit Bicycle lighting Plame affair timeline Trusted computing Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Avalanche Gore-Tex Equine conformation Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder Ionizing radiation Rail terminology Floppy disk IBM PC compatible 24 Hours of Le Mans Commodore 64 Laserdisc Sears Holdings Corporation Milton H.
