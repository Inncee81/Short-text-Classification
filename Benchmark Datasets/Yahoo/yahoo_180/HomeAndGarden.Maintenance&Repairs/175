i have a portable amcor air conditioner no matter what i set the temp for the compressor goes off at idea that's not cool enough for us the compressor isn't supposed to go off until it hits whatever temp you set it for i set it for but it still turns off at and won't go back on until the room hits any ideas i don't know how cool you like it but is pretty good it's natural for it to have a bit of a differential it could have a low limit setting in the thermostat of read the book my question to you would be this if you set it at will it still turn back on at if it goes up to then i would say it's a good chance that your thermostat has a low limt of in the ac mode you may be able to override it it may have a high limit default setting of in the heating mode you have to read the manual for the thermostat but i would say in this kind of weather your air conditioner is working pretty good if it keeps yor house at finally it could just be a broken t stat if all else fails just replace it you could jump the t stat out if your house get's below then your ac is rocking and rollin just be careful not to f anything up lol Thermostat Embedded system Gas compressor Theory of conduct Jet engine Carburetor HVAC Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Solar power Air conditioning Phase change heat pump Axial compressor Armored Core Turbocharger Ocean thermal energy conversion Refrigerator Heat Central processing unit Heinkel He 100 Volleyball Anchor Limit Break GunBound Welding Turbofan X86 Poker jargon DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Pebble bed reactor Baseball Stars Gas turbine Explosive material Apollo 13 Cray-1 Negative feedback Toyota Prius Drill bit Turbojet Temperature Tire Quake III Arena The Cure X86 assembly language SR-71 Blackbird Diesel engine Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Gas absorption refrigerator Halo: Combat Evolved Dodge Neon Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers RuneScape DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Unreal Thermal power station GURPS Equine conformation Extreme Programming Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Autonomous building Advance Wars: Dual Strike Bi-metal Have I Got News For You Theodicy Supercharger Virtual memory Wind power Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Mercury Atlas 6 Roxette Guilty Gear Tennis Wind PNG Fan (implement) E85 Atmospheric circulation Compiler optimization Halo 2 Fair use Audio level compression Tank Mars Exploration Rover Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Ethernet Hydrogen economy Thermoregulation CPU cache Zoning Pretty Good Privacy ITunes DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Final Fantasy Legend III Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Baseball Diving cylinder Counter-Strike Final Fantasy XI Bubble Bobble Motor oil
