i'm rewiring my old house the exterior walls have firebreaks between the studs and i can't pull the wire the interior walls were no problem most of them i could just tie the new wire onto the old wire and pull it through the exterior walls all have some type of firebreak between the studs i absolutely cannot pull the new wire through and i also can't get the snake wire pulling thing fished through there either at this point i'm about to have to knock holes in the concrete and sheetrock my walls have layers of each to get the wire pulled any ideas of how to make this easier i thought about going up from the crawl space but i'm worried about the code here i don't know that that is acceptable maybe you can go behind the baseboards with receptacles in the baseboards or maybe you could fish up from the baseboard to where you want receptacles and switches on the wall Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Electrical wiring Screw Geodesic dome Masonry Basement Distribution board Drywall Seismic retrofit Wall Drill bit BS 1363 Thermostat Poker jargon Tire Wildfire Welding Black hole Parachute Barbed wire Ethernet Sail-plan RuneScape quests National Electrical Code (US) Wire Overhead lines Social rule Switch Spark plug Fuse (electrical) Bedbug Naval mine Knife Stress (physics) The Doctor Dances Elevator Retaining wall Computer Timber framing Climbing equipment Glossary of climbing terms Spidey Super Stories 10 Downing Street Japanese toilet Skateboarding trick Apollo Command/Service Module Enigma machine Wire wrap 30 St Mary Axe Le Corbusier Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Transformer Printed circuit board X10 (industry standard) Mach kernel Textile manufacturing Rigging Mattress Light-frame construction Apollo 13 Suspension bridge TARDIS Three-phase electric power Medieval fortification Electrophysiology Aluminium Cerebellum 10BASE-T 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Soap bubble Swimming Opportunity rover Perl Air-raid shelter Electric motor McMansion Futurama (TV series - season 5) Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Central processing unit Dam Hamster Backstroke Planetary orbit Happy Tree Friends Modchip Antenna (radio) Passenger car Breaststroke Asbestos Epistemology Residual-current device Sydney Opera House B-47 Stratojet Straw-bale construction Trapping Rotor machine Casting Arc welding Milton Keynes Stucco
