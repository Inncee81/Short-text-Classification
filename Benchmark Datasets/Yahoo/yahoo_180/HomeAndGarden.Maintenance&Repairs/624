two sets of track lighting went out in the bedroom at the same time fuse is fine outlets in room work i am assuming the problem is with the light switch any other thoughts on what might cause both sets of lights per set to go out at the same time i also checked the bulbs they are fine it is probably the switch but you need to remember that the tracks are the wiring that transmits the electricity to the lights also the outlets may be on a different breaker if you are an electrician or know how to test electrical circuits you could test to see if there is current leaving the switch after the switch is energized then you should test the connections and the tracks themselves also test the connections where the lights connect with the tracks you should do this with a continuity tester if you are not used to working with vac if you are not experience with electrical circuits call someone who knows how to test them do not electrocute yourself Residual-current device Switch Three-phase electric power Relay Circuit breaker National Electrical Code (US) Electrical wiring (UK) Oscilloscope BS 1363 Lineman (occupation) Alternating current Electrician Digital circuit Vacuum tube Distribution board Electric motor Overhead lines Electricity Incandescent light bulb Transformer Tesla coil Power strip Diode Ring circuit George Westinghouse Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Battery (electricity) Logic gate Railway signal Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Fluorescent lamp Dimmer Telephone exchange RS-232 Thermal power station High-voltage direct current Light-emitting diode X10 (industry standard) Electrical network Transmitter High-voltage hazards Split phase Fire alarm control panel Electrical wiring Central processing unit Mouse (computing) Transistor Short circuit Circuit design Burglar alarm TGV Thomas Edison Light switch Enigma machine Headlight Ohm's law Spark gap Thermostat Lightning Ethernet Ground (electricity) Inductor Electric power transmission Charles Wheatstone Integrated circuit Electrodeless lamp Ground and neutral Hall effect Switched-mode power supply Loudspeaker Electrical generator Nikola Tesla Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Electric chair Capacitor Musical Instrument Digital Interface Maxwell's equations Circuit switching Bombe Apollo Guidance Computer Wardenclyffe Tower Telephone Audiophile Digital Electrophysiology Green Line (MBTA) Field-programmable gate array Impedance matching Voltmeter World Columbian Exposition Printed circuit board Amateur telescope making Lighting Earthing system Rail terminology Particle accelerator Directed-energy weapon
