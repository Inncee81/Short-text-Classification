how to remove rust i've got an old tin like a biscuit tin which i really want to look nice again is there a way to get rid of the rust rust is iron oxide some of the iron on the surface of your tin has been chemically converted to iron oxide that rust therefore contains some of the iron which was once your tin however you try to remove the rust if you succeed then you will therefore also have removed some of the iron which was once your tin the surface of your tin may then be rust free but you cannot expect it to look as if it was nice and smooth and shiny and new because some of the surface has now been removed at best you can mechanically remove wire brush wire wool etc but the surface will be pitted due to loss of the iron material you cannot put that back there again this pitted appearance may give character to your tin p s i do not recommend chemical rust removers as they never live up to their claims of making flakes of rust back into new metal also they can permanently stain the surface Iron Corrosion Stainless steel Pottery Tin Knife Steel Soldering Redox Rust Cookware and bakeware Glass Brazing Phosphoric acid Sulfuric acid Wok Wire Primer (paint) Hydrochloric acid Copper extraction Copper Plastic Metallurgy Metal Gilding Mattress Tooth enamel Magnetism Blacksmith Industrial wastewater treatment Mining Sterilization (microbiology) Plating Sand casting Hydrogen peroxide Motor oil Pickling Dental caries Woodworking Mineral Iron(III) oxide Chromium Cathodic protection Welding Galvanization Hand grenade Magnet Weathering Shoe polish Explosive material Coulometry Textile manufacturing terminology The Tin Woodman of Oz Nuclear fission Catalytic converter Water purification Titanium nitride Gas metal arc welding Spark plug Incandescent light bulb Nuclear weapon design Solar cell Carbon nanotube Tin Woodman Tire Sewage treatment Tooth Fire Powder metallurgy Acne Nickel-cadmium battery Textile manufacturing Ozone depletion Vitreous enamel Reinforced concrete Casting Industrial Revolution Technetium Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Zinc Ceramics Brush Drill bit Floppy disk Carbon dioxide Solder Bullet Industrial process Earring Ozone hole Indigo dye Manganese Upholstery Urnfield Mylar Hydrogen sulfide Lionel Corporation Transformer
