i put gas in my lawn mower's oil tank and ran it for seconds accidently it isn't running right anymore is there any hope for it drain the oil out by putting gas in the oil it thinned it out which isnt good and can damage berings inside the motor lawnmower engines are typically a 'sling' type meaning they 'sling' oil onto the major bering surfaces unlike vehicles that have oil pumps to put oil under pressure where needed continually running the motor on the tainted oil will cause failure of the motor from no lubrication id use a heavy weight motor oil like sae and an engine oil additive like lucas oil i use it if its making metallic noises well then its a matter of time before it destroys itself rebuilding it isnt an option at that point its better to locate a donor motor kidd Motor oil Internal combustion engine Gasoline Diesel engine Thermal power station Lawn mower Turbocharger Two-stroke cycle Heinkel He 100 Manual transmission Transmission (mechanics) Automobile Hydraulic machinery Diving cylinder Carburetor Spark plug Terran (StarCraft) Radio controlled airplane Motorcycle Locomotive Steam engine Petroleum Jet engine Siphon Tank M60 machine gun Rocket fuel Fire fighting Mooney M20 Fluid bearing Battery electric vehicle Filling station Space shuttle main engine Glossary of firefighting terms The Lawnmower Man Hydrogen economy Model aircraft Solar power Oil platform Hybrid vehicle Aircraft engine controls Friction Natural gas Pump Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Honda Prelude Radio controlled car Toyota Prius Internal ballistics Hydropneumatic Combine harvester Handloading Continuously variable transmission Sling (weapon) Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 Engine cooling Gas turbine Weapon Glossary of firefighting equipment Oil refinery Saab 900 Tire Wind turbine Fire extinguisher Toyota Camry Spacecraft propulsion Portable stove Displacement on Demand Saturn V Thermostat Energy development Glossary of climbing terms Turbo-Hydramatic Texaco Gas compressor Porsche 911 Scramjet Ford Thunderbird Space Shuttle program Vacuum Alcohol fuel Headlight Engine Drill bit Bicycle frame Bullet USS S-36 (SS-141) Knife Auto racing USS S-37 (SS-142) Nuclear power Biodiesel Pebble bed reactor
