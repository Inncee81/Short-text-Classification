season episodes of an old television show please don't make rude comments on this this question is more geared toward parents or present teenagers i was hoping to show one of my younger relatives some of the barney and friends episodes i used to like from season year was when the show came out did anyone tape any of these episodes onto vhs tape when they came out if yes do you still have the tape and could you email me about it using yahoo answers thanks for an answer if i get one for some reason i also have an interest in seeing some of these episodes for very old times sake thanks again actually recently i was looking over some of the questions asked on yahoo answers about this subject and noticed a specific episode that was mentioned it was titled i just love bugs and was from season episode as the questions say i don't really remember this episode but if anyone has this also please contact me through yahoo answers thanks again the reason i am asking people if they taped it is because pbs and their producers who made the videos for the shows say that very few episodes from the first season were made which means having that taped episodes seem to be the only way to watch some of the older ones never put on vhs tape and sold ebay check it out The Star Wars Holiday Special Ren and Stimpy Ken Jennings VHS Seinfeld The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Red Green Show Code: Lyoko The Apprentice 2 Happy Days Social rule Television in the United States The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Only Fools and Horses Megan Griffin Wheel of Fortune Knots Landing Roswell UFO incident Mixtape SmartAsk Hollywood Squares Public Broadcasting Service Tony Hancock The Brady Bunch Laserdisc The Amazing Race War of the Worlds (television) Have I Got News For You South Park Twin Peaks SMTV Live Full House The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) The Joker's Wild Mission: Impossible Surveillance Dorama Paris Hilton Little Britain You Don't Know Jack Jumping the shark Motion picture rating system Douglas Adams Our Gang Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Doctor Who missing episodes Ghostwriter (television series) Direct-to-video Family Feud Robotech SpongeBob SquarePants Sailor Moon Internet fraud Plame affair Philip J.
