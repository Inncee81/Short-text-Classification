why do some women have things against men as a whole has the media changed the way you look at us there is always women on t v and stuff having a go at us as if we as a whole are animals and wrong all the time and that you are always hard done by please tell me this is only a minority of ladies today in america tv is geared towards mainly women and tv shows cater to women and frequently depict men in a bad light basically with the exception of a few channels specifically for men tv is a big vagina with rabbit ears this reflects a larger female bias in american society where there are many double standards and inequities that favor women over men on the majority of tv shows men are usually depicted as hapless jackasses that can't do simple everyday things for themselves like cook or clean they are insensitive unable to care for their children and just overall useless slobs while women are portrayed as calm collected smart and always having to step in and get things done when their slob husbands fail see everybody loves raymond as a prime example of this another common element in tv shows is how the women are usually more attractive than their husbands see the king of queens everybody loves raymond and 'till death as prime examples of this advertising routinely uses this distorted view to sell products that are marketed towards women examples of the use of common male stereotypes that men can't cook won't do housework or won't repair things around the house are to numerous to mention again art reflects life and in a society that is heavily biased in favor of women it isn't too surprising that television would be the same to jillian h no entire group or gender automatically deserves respect respect is earned on an individual basis when you talk about people respecting women what does that mean why are all women somehow deserving of respect in your mind i know plenty of women that deserve absolutely no respect at all to kovasmomma your husband does more than you realize for you and your family do you realize that all of you and your children's material needs are provided to you you do not pay rent utilities pay for groceries pay for clothes shoes or car and insurance payments all the necessities of life are provided to you i don't think that ensuring that he comes home to a hot meal folded socks and living children is such a bad tradeoff considering what you get you even admitted that when you both worked he helped out around the house he doesn't now because once you stopped working keeping the house became your job i don't mean to belittle what you do because it is a lot of work but you have to compare what you do and what benefits you get another non monetary benefit is that you have the opportunity to experience firsts with your children that your husband will have to hear about secondhand or on film being a stay at home mom you will most likely be on hand to see your kids first steps hear their first words watch them get on the school bus for their first day of school his working at the office everyday affords you the opportunity to see those things and this benefit should not go unappreciated as for dealing with rowdy children you went into that with your eyes open you knew before you had them that you would be caring for them after the first one you had a pretty good idea what caring for a child would entail and if you thought that it would be too much work for you to handle you should not have had so many kids women have the final say in whether they have a child so that is completely on you Microeconomics Economic inequality Theory of conduct Advertising Insurance Transsexuality EastEnders Japanese tea ceremony Law of value Capitalism Pitaten Poker jargon Strap-on dildo Gender role Social rule Human sexual behavior Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Blackjack Hillary Rodham Clinton Milton H.
