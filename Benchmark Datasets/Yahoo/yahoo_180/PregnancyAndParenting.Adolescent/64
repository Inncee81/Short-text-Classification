should i be worried that i have never had a girlfriend i'm and i am going into high school so far i'm not extremely worried about it but i am also wondering if this will affect me later in my life thanks a lot for the answers so far like i said i wasn't worried a lot but now i barely care at all i'm and i haven't had a boyfriend yet it won't affect you in your later life because you have all of high school i know some year olds that don't have girlfriends and have never dated they just want to get to know the girls around them first and then ask them out you should definitly get to know the girls first and then if you really want a girlfriend then go ahead and ask them out have fun in your freshman year One Tree Hill (TV series) Avenue Q EastEnders The O.C.
