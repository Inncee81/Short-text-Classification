how can anyone care soo much about what other people are doing i have a white bf and dont appreciate people pre judging us i mean i really hate it i dont care what other people think but it still frustrates me when random people give us dirty looks or even have the nerve to say snide remarks seriously if it nots hurting anyone how can people care so much about what other people are doing because a lot of people dont like change or things that are 'different' just turn the other cheek and soon enough they'll shut up if you keep responding to it they'll just keep doing it to get a rise out of you everybody has their own opinions about the way the world should work but it takes a mature person to realize that life is not burger king and you cant 'have it your way ' so only hang out with mature people and return those snide looks by kissing your boyfriend very publicly in front of them ever seen save the last dance great examples there Jennifer Lopez Beavis and Butt-head Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Capital punishment Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Kim Possible Mary Jane Watson Theory of conduct Kodocha Anger management Everwood Rose (Doctor Who) Past teachings of Prem Rawat Pitaten Rei Ayanami Eddie Guerrero Teen Girl Squad Chris Jericho Characters in the Smurfs Justification (theology) Social rule Embedded system ROC presidential election, 2004 Smallville (Season 4) Shaggy dog story Gothic metal American Idol Karen Horney Chicago Cubs The Death Gate Cycle SpongeBob SquarePants Shawn Michaels Page widening Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Richard Nixon About a Boy Saved by the Bell Things in Atlas Shrugged Characters of The Sandman EastEnders Stone Cold Steve Austin Hip hop rivalries Alignment (role-playing games) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Charmed Notting Hill Carnival Boston Public Angel Sanctuary The Empty Child Ranma __ characters Atomic Kitten Green Goblin John Howard Yoder Hillary Rodham Clinton Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Oh My Goddess!
