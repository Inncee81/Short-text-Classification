why are kids so worried about what to wear for their first day of high school i see all these questions on yahoo answers about what to wear for the first day of high school whats up with that what you can't make an impression or make friends wearing non brand name clothes i remember thinking for days about what i would wear to the first day of class it wasn't so much about brand name but more about setting the tone for the whole year i guess i used to think that i could find the perfect outfit that would show how mature and beautiful i had become over the summer lol it just seemed like if i found the right clothes the year might start out perfect and yes i know it is silly to think an outfit can do that and i knew it then too but for girls at least sometimes we think there can be magic in our apparel i e cinderella's ball gown and the wedding gowns we spend thousands of dollars on i agree though that you can still make a great impression wearing non brand name clothes in fact some of the coolest kids i knew wore vintage stuff but i am guessing that even they spent a little time worrying about what to wear Teen Girl Squad Prom Vegeta The Magic School Bus Recess (TV series) Black Cinderella TLC Barbie Shaggy dog story Clothing Little Britain Infantilism Skirt and dress Kimono Hilary Duff Springfield Elementary School Piccolo Junior Saga SMTV Live Legion of Super-Heroes The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Social rule Academia Avenue Q Son Gohan Empire Burlesque Court dress Good Times Michael Jordan Anne Boleyn High school subcultures Doug Friends Corset Whose Line Is It Anyway?
