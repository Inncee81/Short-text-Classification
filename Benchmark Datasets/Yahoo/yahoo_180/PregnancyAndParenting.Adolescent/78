were you a bed wetter if so at what age did you stop my son is and wets the bed quite often is this something he'll grow out of i am going to discuss it w his doctor on wednesday as he has a physical the last time he prescribed him pills that seemed to work continued to work there after until recently will he have this problem for a long time to come missthang do you have kids have you seen how common it is for kids to wet their beds if you want to tell me my child is stranger than the average teenager just because he soils his sheets every now and then than you can take your crap else where i asked the question obviously to get some advise not to read a stupid assumption such as yours you are the strange one on top of being an idiot w your reply thanks for nothing p s you're a jerk i was on a nightly basis until i was but unfortunately continued to have occasional accidents for a long time afterward this happens to a lot more people than you would think usually it's just a case of the bladder not developing quickly enough to keep up with the rest of the body and will go away with time as his body catches up with itself although it could be a very frustrating couple of months or years if you simply wait for that to happen at his body is growing and changing rapidly in many ways and if his bladder hasn't kept up with the rest of his body's growth spurt bedwetting could be a very common symptom this would also explain why the pills might have stopped working even though they worked previously although teens with this problem will usually grow out of it it's unfortunately not a certainty perhaps to of those who bedwet into their early teens will still wet the bed at least occasionally as adults there's no real way to know for sure whether this could happen for your son based on the odds it probably won't perhaps if you get a referral to a urologist they could do tests to check out your son's bladder development and such things and let you know how big a deficit there is for him to grow out of though teens' bodies do grow rapidly and there's no foolproof way of predicting when or if it will happen if you want to try to treat the problem more aggressively the best option according to medical research to this point is to use one of those alarms that senses the first instant of urine hitting the mattress and wakes him up at that point so that over time he will learn to feel it when he needs to urinate at night and wake up and use the bathroom these do not work overnight they usually take several weeks or months of constant use before his body will start to make the adjustment but if he ultimately stops wetting the bed it would be well worth a little investment of time and lost sleep these alarms can be bought online for less than at http www bedwettingstore com good luck to both you and your son i know this is a very difficult and frustrating problem but keep trying the odds are good at least that he will grow out of it in time Prostate cancer Bedwetting Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kimberly-Clark Corporation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Traumatic brain injury Mattress Shaggy dog story Sleep Hypoglycemia Stomach cancer Child sexuality Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Housebreaking Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Medicine Multiple sclerosis Insomnia Chronic fatigue syndrome Clinical depression Autism Ben Johnson (athlete) Guinea pig Narcolepsy Craps Roswell UFO incident Daylight saving time Sin City Infantilism Jam (TV series) Fecal incontinence Breastfeeding The Shining (film) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sleep apnea Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cancer Poker jargon Hyperinflation Growth hormone treatment Pregnancy Social rule Diaper Extreme Programming Pitaten Lucid dreaming Dream Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Menstrual cycle Human height Sharon Tate The Venture Bros.
