friend trouble my friend alicia and i have been having a rocky patch for the last three weeks i am one of those people where i only have two best friends and a few friends i like to have it this way well we were fighting for two of those three weeks and she made best friends with my other friend morgan now they do everything together on myspace she even left a comment like i hope you have fun tonite with a wink lmao since alicia was with me i feel excluded espeically since i introduced them to each other years ago when we were in middle school we are seniors and now i think they exclude me because i don't like to do crazy things and that i am mellow i thought alicia would know how to be a real friend since her and morgan are constantly posting best friend comments pictures and quotes on their myspaces any suggestions thoughts ideas help they leave myspace comments suggesting that i'm weird morgan also left a comment saying i dont like to fight like someone even though morgan had no buisness being in the fight should i just tell her how everything makes me feel i've tried before should i ask why she doesnt take me or what i feel seriously i am starting to think i am too mature for them or anyone my own age wow if they are leaving comments on each others page and they know you will read them then they are trying to hurt your feelings and thats not what friendship is about at all they should not be talking about you and they would come to you if they had any respect for you dont stoop to there level be nice when you see them around but distance yourself keep a smile on your face it will hurt them to know your not botherd by there unkindness also yes you are way too mature for them good luck Social rule Have I Got News For You Atomic Kitten Sharon Tate The Catcher in the Rye Pitaten MySpace LiveJournal Shaggy dog story The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Humphrey Bogart The Apprentice 2 EastEnders Notable lines in the Star Wars series Ann Coulter Honey and Clover Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Cindy Sheehan Undergrads God Emperor of Dune Spice Girls Piccolo Junior Saga Rod Stewart Squidward Tentacles The Emancipation of Mimi FoxTrot The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Kodocha Jon Secada Care Bears Spidey Super Stories Cliff Richard AFI 100 Years series The Shining (film) Sinfest Douglas Adams 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Contender (television series) Nine Inch Nails Edward R.
