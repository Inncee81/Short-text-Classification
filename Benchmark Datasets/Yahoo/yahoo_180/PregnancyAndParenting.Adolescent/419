i'm and i don't have a cell phone okay i'm and all my friends have phones except for me they're younger than me too i could easily afford a prepaid cellphone i babysit water plants for people watch pets and get a week for allowance my parents think i'm responsible and many other adults have told them i have a good head on my shoulders whenever i bring up the subject of getting a cell phone my mom says sure okay i don't care if you waste your money in a mean tone my point is if i can afford the phone why not have it how do i work things out so i can convince my mom i can responisbly have a phone my dad will go with what she says oh and i was forgetting that i go to a barn to ride horses often i have to ask people to use their phones and it's embaressing i don't want to waste other people s minutes to call my mom okay understand this i live in a fairly rural area and i can walk miles to the nearest walmart or convinience store and i have a really good relationship with my mom so i pretty much drop the subject when she says no cuz i don't want her to get mad my daughter had a cell phone when she was paid for by my ex that helped bring her up she had it for about years and then went without until i got her another for christmas last year i use it to keep tabs on her sometimes she gives me the lame excuse that it wasn't turned on or charged or something though if you have a birthday coming up soon drop the hint about how nice it would be to be able to keep in touch with your mom and dad when you're out and wait to see what happens if no birthday is coming up and you really want a cell phone then start saving your money and when you have enough for at least months of payments approach the easiest parent and discuss it with him her think up many reasons such as them being able to contact you or the people you babysit for being able to call you if they need you the most important thing when negotiating is to never ever get upset or raise your voice or whine just show complete maturity good luck Shaggy dog story The Fairly OddParents Milton H.
