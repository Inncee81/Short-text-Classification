yellin mom how to handle her she still treats me like a kid i am and i know all she never allows me in private and hates me with friends it sucks from dressing parties friends to even drinking she yells i am sick why is she not allowing me on my own i know my limits she likes my bf but still never allows me to stay with him alone it hurts us both of all she speaks to my bf's mom too and she also yells at him and some times at me too if they suspect but there are nothing big gone wrong at times how to fix these moms i think the only person who can claim to know all is magenta from rocky horror rather than ignore her or scream back at her listen to what she is saying and try to act a little more responsibly try to show her that you are capable legally you're still under mom's care and will be until you're eighteen its frustrating stressful and at times can be unfair instead of looking at it that way take up some chores get them done before asking for favours and keep doing little things like that get a routine and at the very worst you'll be sixteen before she lets you out totally alone keep in mind though she may just be worried about you coming home pregnant or experimenting with drugs and may i say in no way should you be drinking at fifteen it can seriously impair your judgement and you could make some life altering decisions more than likey for the worst while your judgment is hindered Sin City Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Marshall Mathers LP Avenue Q Treehouse of Horror V The Adventures of Pete & Pete Fathers' rights Jam (TV series) The Contender (television series) Rent (musical) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Big Brother UK series 6 Calvin and Hobbes Shaggy dog story KaBlam!
