how do dvd players scan dvds like make them work a dvd player is very similar to a cd player it has a laser assembly that shines the laser beam onto the surface of the disc to read the pattern of bumps the fundamental job of the cd player is to focus the laser on the track of bumps the laser beam passes through the polycarbonate layer reflects off the aluminum layer and hits an opto electronic device that detects changes in light the bumps reflect light differently than the lands the rest of the aluminum layer and the opto electronic sensor detects that change in reflectivity the electronics in the drive interpret the changes in reflectivity in order to read the bits that make up the bytes the hardest part is keeping the laser beam centered on the data track this centering is the job of the tracking system the tracking system as it plays the cd has to continually move the laser outward as the laser moves outward from the center of the disc the bumps move past the laser faster this happens because the linear or tangential speed of the bumps is equal to the radius times the speed at which the disc is revolving rpm therefore as the laser moves outward the spindle motor must slow the speed of the cd that way the bumps travel past the laser at a constant speed and the data comes off the disc at a constant rate DVD CD-R Hard disk Laser Gramophone record Radar Floppy disk Speed of light Holography Laserdisc Blu-ray Disc CD recorder Welding Inertial guidance system CD-ROM Galileo spacecraft Electric motor Movie projector Diode Directed-energy weapon Faster-than-light Sound recording DualDisc Cyclotron Tank Particle accelerator Laser engraving Universal Century Technology Super Audio CD Oscilloscope Mars Exploration Rover LIDAR Sensor MP3 Volleyball Piezoelectricity Tribes 2 Photon Early IBM disk storage Black hole Laser diode Carburetor DVD-R Headlight Magneto-optical drive Mass spectrometry Planetary orbit CPU cache Car handling Redundant array of independent disks Antenna (radio) Optical fiber Jet engine Loudspeaker Disk storage Sega Dreamcast Vacuum tube Nintendo GameCube STS-62 Aluminium Diffraction Digital photography ATLAS experiment Solar cell Inertial confinement fusion Seismometer Solar sail R-Type Amateur telescope making VHS Confocal laser scanning microscopy Light Gamma ray burst Photolithography Technology in the Stargate universe Digital recording Nanotechnology SETI Action potential Maxwell's equations Coriolis effect General relativity Dynamic random access memory PowerBook Super Nintendo Entertainment System Digital Sun Project Orion Compact audio cassette Printed circuit board Gravitational radiation
