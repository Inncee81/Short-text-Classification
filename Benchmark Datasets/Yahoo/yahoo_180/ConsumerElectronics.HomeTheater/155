surround sound how does a stereo receiver take a surround sound signal from a dvd player which includes left right front and left right rear and a center speaker audio through a cable that goes to the receiver that only has left and right how does the receiver take a signal and is able to figure out that a sound like a jet flying is going from the front left to the back right otherwise the jets sound would come from all the speakers at the same time no rose it's you what you are describing is pro logic surround which is a faux surround in order to obtain true channel surround your dvd player would be connected to your receiver using a single digital coax cable or an optical digital cable with real surround the single digital cable contains separate signals for each of the five surround channels with pro logic surround a mathematical algorithm is applied to the stereo signal and a digital processor decides when looking at different sounds within the soundtracks place in the stereo sound field left and right as well as phase a sound out of phase is sent to the rear what speaker each sound will be sent to pro logic surround has mono rear speakers meaning that both rear speaker are sent the same signal it may seem that a sound is coming from the right front and going to the left rear but the fact is that when the sound is in the rear it is coming from both speakers equally the illusion is made because the left front speaker is also making the sound giving the appearance of sound generating from the left rear Dolby Laboratories Dolby Digital Surround sound Loudspeaker Sound Blaster High fidelity FM broadcasting Dolby Pro Logic Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Microphone Multitrack recording DVD Stereoscopy Modem MP3 Stereophonic sound Laserdisc Sound recording IPod Synthesizer Audiophile 8 mm video format Television Decibel Mixing console Cable television Impedance matching Frequency modulation Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Effects pedal Quadraphonic Xbox NTSC Home cinema Subwoofer Sound effect Logic MiniDisc Jack plug SCART Super Audio CD Receiver (radio) Atari ST Digital audio workstation Color Sound reinforcement system MPEG-2 HD Radio S/PDIF DVD-Audio Radio Remaster Sound card Ethernet Digital audio broadcasting Oscilloscope Complex number Telephone exchange Universal Serial Bus AES/EBU Car audio Anamorphic widescreen Amstrad CPC Digital circuit RS-232 3D audio effect Sega CD Telephone Xbox 360 Bluetooth One-time pad Radar Transformer Digital Natural deduction Digital audio Audio data compression Central processing unit NICAM D-subminiature Original Amiga chipset DVD player Nintendo GameCube Super Video CD Cray-1 Phase-shift keying Single-sideband modulation Circuit design Game Boy Real number
