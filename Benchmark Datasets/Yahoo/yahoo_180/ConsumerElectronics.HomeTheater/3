can i use older speaker cable i own a pair of ft long gauge speaker cables that have oxidized so the insulation while clear several years ago has turned green since they haven't been used in quite some time are these cables still serviceable thanks for any advice hi james i would replace them with new cables to maintain the audio signal from the power amplifier as i feel the old ones may deteriorate the signal good speaker cable is reasonably priced and i would replace them every couple of years because contamination is not always visible Audiophile Coaxial cable Oscilloscope Transformer Cable television Optical fiber Apollo Command/Service Module Audio system measurements Transistor Electronic amplifier Loudspeaker Rail terminology Circuit design Motorcycle TGV Action potential Car audio Xbox Vacuum tube Railway signalling William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin Impedance matching DVD XLR connector Amplifier D-subminiature IPod Bluetooth MOSFET Electrical wiring Subwoofer AM broadcasting Static inverter plant Mattress SCART Category 5 cable Diode Gas tungsten arc welding Radar Glass Phonograph Capacitor Submarine communications cable High-voltage direct current Bicycle brake systems Universal Serial Bus Repeater RCA connector Ethernet Jack plug Power Mac G4 Cube Satellite television Kenwood Electronics Sound reinforcement system Media in Canada Broadband Internet access Home Box Office Digital television Electronics Traffic light Wi-Fi Digital audio Electrophysiology Mixing console Spark plug Light-emitting diode Twisted pair DIN connector Nintendo GameCube Television The Ark in Space Audio crossover Resistor Corrosion Radio Digital Subscriber Line High fidelity Long Island Sound Input impedance Power cable Musical Instrument Digital Interface Decibel Mediumwave Modem Royal Assent Headphones Polar Bear Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Magnetic cartridge Phantom power NTSC Transatlantic telegraph cable Speaker of the British House of Commons FM broadcasting Echo chamber Nuclear reactor United States House of Representatives TIA-568A/B Audio power
