my epson photo stylus printer has stopped recognising compatible ink cartridges any hints on fixing this was printing just fine for months on compatibles last week it decided to reject a black cartridge then as i pressed the ink button and inserted another it decided to 'not recognise' all four catridges help with regard to the above answer i don't understand how epson can do this with an existing printer are you quite sure that all cartridges are not empty have you tried cleaning the nozzles also check there's no dust or muck on the electrical contacts at the back of the cartridge go through the printer troubleshooter in windows xp go to start help and support when the help page appears type 'troubleshoot printer' in the search box and follow through the questions as a last resort try system restore type 'system restore' in the help search box and when the calendar appears select a date when you know or hope the printer was ok the computer restarts with the settings applicable to the earlier date hope the above will help Computer printer Common Unix Printing System Dot matrix printer Epson Seiko Corporation Blue screen of death Atari 8-bit family System/36 Nintendo DS Windows XP Domain Name System Cartridge (electronics) Game Boy System/34 Windows 2000 Embedded system Nintendo Entertainment System Fountain pen PostScript Photography AmigaOS Laser printer Read-only memory PlayStation Portable Mac OS X Killian documents TRS-80 Color Computer PHP Commodore 64 Konica Minolta Unicode Sega Saturn Visual Basic Mac OS Windows Vista System 7 (Macintosh) Gramophone record ZX Spectrum Printing press Apple Macintosh Typeface Apple Newton RS-232 Macintosh Finder Bluetooth Floppy disk Magnetic cartridge Opera (web browser) Palm OS Expert system Enigma machine Computer virus ITunes Portable Document Format Microsoft Windows BBC Master Windows API Hello world program GDI Thermal printer D-subminiature Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Apple typography Personal computer History of computer and video games USB flash drive AppleTalk Gregorian calendar IBM PC compatible Emacs Mouse (computing) Mach kernel MIPS architecture NX bit Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Windows Me DVD Novell NetWare IBM PC keyboard Adobe Acrobat Screenshot Gmail Cyprus dispute WordPerfect Newline Printing Windows Server 2003 HTML element Plan 9 (operating system) Game Boy Advance Mac OS X v10.4 Btrieve Tattoo Mozilla Firefox ALGOL 68
