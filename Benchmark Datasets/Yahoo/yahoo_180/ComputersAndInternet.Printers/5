my printer wont print black both cartridges the tri color and the black are not empty thats for sure if i print a text in black sometimes it prints it in color or sometimes the cartridges move during the printing process but nothing actually is printed on the paper i have tried cleaning the cartridges manually and via the clean option of my printer but nothing worked its an hp thanks duh i dont think i need to buy a new printer just because the black cartridge wont work besides i just bought this a couple of months ago it may look with ink but maybe is empty or if you are really sure about the ink just buy a new printer try this removed all the tape from the catridges reinstall and print a test page make sure it is the default printer Computer printer Typewriter Inkjet printer Printing press Dot matrix printer Laser printer Atari 8-bit family Fountain pen Common Unix Printing System System/36 Ink Cartridge (electronics) CMYK color model Book Photocopying Printmaking Color printing Printed circuit board Magnetic ink character recognition Dots per inch Commodore 64 Mimeograph machine Sega Saturn Konica Minolta TRS-80 Color Computer PostScript Printer Control Language Copy protection System/34 Screen-printing System 7 (Macintosh) Thermal printer Adrian Frutiger Epson Seiko Corporation Publishing Cascading Style Sheets Exidy Sorcerer History of computer and video games Game Boy Control character Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PHP Digital photography Paper WYSIWYG ZX Spectrum United States dollar Traditional animation Xerography Color Photographic film Windows XP Typesetting Printing Xerox Commodore VIC-20 Nintendo Entertainment System Mac OS X Cartridge (firearms) Autograph Gamut Fax Esperanto orthography Offset printing Tattoo PDP-1 2D computer graphics Loss leader Book collecting Label Ukiyo-e Game Boy Color BASIC programming language Killian documents Typeface Drawing Enigma machine Etching The Guardian Movie projector Upholstery Gramophone record Krag-J__rgensen Chester Carlson Media preservation Commodore SX-64 Tab Ammunition Plotter TRS-80 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Hello world program Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Subtractive color Postage stamp Johann Gutenberg Duplicating machines Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Medical prescription
