inkjet or laser for detail and color i need to replicate art pictures with the uttermost detail with still a lot of concern to correct color should i choose inkjet or laser when choosing one what should i look for dpi resolution type of ink or toner what's best for micro printing anything that can print micro text or numbers should be fine capturing the details of the art colors should match up well too of course practically all color laser and monochrome laser printers print razor sharp text color lasers can print color charts and two dimensional graphics pretty well but they don't match what an ink jet printer can do with a photograph ink jet photos are downright beautiful but most of them will produce somewhat fuzzy and jagged font test it just cannot reproduce the fine line detail of line art or graphics the best way to determine print quality and speed is not by looking at the resolution specifics instead just print out a sample and see for yourself this is because most any inkjet on the market can print a beautiful x photo that is how good the modern printers have become fairly modest resolutions for laser printers suffice for printing sharp text and simple graphics Dot matrix printer Dots per inch Konica Minolta Inkjet printer Pixel Digital photography PostScript Typewriter Gamut Color printing Typeface Raster graphics Laser printer Photocopying Stereoscopy Drawing Printer Control Language WYSIWYG Plotter LaserWriter 2D computer graphics Printmaking Mouse (computing) Screen-printing Photographic film Computer Amstrad CPC Apple typography Printing ASCII art Atari 8-bit family Epson Seiko Corporation Killian documents Color Magnetic ink character recognition Atari ST Portable Document Format High-definition television Halftone Typesetting Common Unix Printing System PNG Laser engraving QuickDraw Graphics Monochromator Xerox Printed circuit board Color Graphics Adapter Xerography Panoramic photography AMD Nintendo 64 Offset printing TRS-80 Nintendo BBC Micro Image scanner TrueType Light-emitting diode Digital camera Traditional animation CMYK color model Ink Road-rule enforcement camera Anti-aliasing Agfa-Gevaert Laserdisc Acorn Electron Rendering (computer graphics) Color space Mac OS X Apple II family System/36 Xerox Star Laser Hewlett-Packard Toner Apple Macintosh Unicode Cartridge (electronics) BASIC programming language Video Graphics Array United States dollar Ebook Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IPod Aliasing MEMS Printing press System/34 Tattoo Automatic number plate recognition Compact disc
