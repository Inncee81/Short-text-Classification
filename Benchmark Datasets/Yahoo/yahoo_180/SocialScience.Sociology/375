apart from the obvious physical differences are men and women really that different in perspective i personally think we are experiencing a cultural collective hangover from the strict mores of polite victorian society rules she certainly didn't apply to herself i won't be around much over the next couple of days look forward to reading any replies tho cracked up laughing luminous must admit i wasn't born then i'm an archaeologist historian evidence shows that strong divisions very probably didn't exist at all until comparatively recent history prehistory nor does it appear to have been an issue in many recent civilisations such as the minoans indus the celts anglo saxons emerging evidence about the vikings i really could go on a different story emerges if one casts aside prejudicial views undoubtedly there have been times when both sexes have been the more dominant in polite society both still managed to make their presence strongly felt tho the more populous lower classes have always been the least affected by this in real terms too survival was their issue i too have researched many studies in depth mike h what stands out to me despite our current cultural conditioning is how close we are on all the traits you mention the average variation is pretty small in fact crossover traits are inclined to dominate also being academically able is definitely not the only proof of intelligence it does seem that girls were deliberately marked down in the past and have always been high achievers academically an educational bod of the 's 's and 's in england admitted on national tv that if girls had been marked the same way as boys boys grammar schools would have been full of girls too intelligence to me is the ability to take in inwardly digest and interpret information productively yep hippie victorian mores had a massive effect on western society fullstop much evidence of more equal cultures abound in german history tho lol and naff orf pataodelamuerte time to get vegetarianist now is it on your bike mister hmmm i absolutely do not agree that women are more emotional think in our current cultural climate women are just allowed to express and be comfortable with their emotional side more than men are that's a product of our culture not inherent tendencies because of these influences i would say if anything women are more pragmatic currently more able to stand back and assess objectively as opposed to men currently being more reactive erm it's mea culpa bletherskyte and although i don't agree with either zeb's or your answer at all i don't see why you think his reply is your fault perhaps you are his mentor swami guru joking aside human nature and sexuality are so much more complex than answers such as these show such views belong to the culturalised populist men are from mars women are from venus school of thought representative of the current culture we do seem to be slowly recovering from at last if current evidence is not viewed prejudicially it does appear that the women nurturers men providers view is a newish one the more we discover about humans from archaeological evidence the more we find the likelihood of both sexes sharing roles women only playing a quieter role while pregnant or rearing young children the beginning of the change from goddess to god worship seems to have given rise to problems in some civilisations but most were little affected until the age of empires began the men want sex women want love school of thought is a very new phenomenon in our history both enjoy purely recreational sex and penetration is only one aspect of it the term foreplay doesn't exist in my book some of the worst abuses of women occurred because of some cultures believing all women would be nymphomaniacs if not controlled examples being the athenians basically sequestering high born women on marriage until several children had been born it was believed that women were uncontrollably promiscuous and insatiable by nature wild with the need for multi orgasms and the horrendous mutilation known as female circumcision and look at the roman christianised view of women that we were all carnal temptresses intent on luring sweet innocent men to our beds or wherever and hell it's actually only a few western cultures nations that have such unrealistic views about human sexuality the profusion of eastern middle eastern ancient erotica indicates most had have a more balanced view cracked up laughing barney i did do well here mister for one who wouldn't be around much this is an interesting post it kept me well entertained until i went out i personally really like the answers of hippie luminous patodelamuerte and k marx leaving this post open for a while yet tho and i like pickles answer this won't be an easy choice before i choose best answer i'd like to apologise to bletherskyte previously i had only read you opening comments in your answer having now read it fully i must say it was a pretty decent answer cracked up laughing don't you fear for poor li'l defenceless women we definitely have our fair share of the physically aggressive actually i'd say that female on male violence is a much underrated problem our current culture doesn't take it seriously violence is wrong to me whatever the source aaarrrgghhh bill's answer is excellent too this is hard men and women are human beings first and foremost and there are no real differences in the mental make up it's not just the victorian society where all these hang ups come from we have them in germany too it's an old thing and it's
