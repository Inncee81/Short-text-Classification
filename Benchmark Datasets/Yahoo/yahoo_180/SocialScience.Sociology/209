is this a family i know this couple their gonna have a baby in december their not married and only have been dating for about years or so i asked them if their gonna get married and they said they talk about it casually which probably means no now my question is this a family or a temporary convince now don't get me wrong in no way am i trying to come off judgmental or be the moral coach here but is this not a good question this is folks is this not the age of convinve and the easy way out is it not modern culture i mean look around so it makes wonder is about family or a tempoary convince once again i am not trying to judge just curious don't get me wrong i believe very much in marriage but a family is certainly not built on simply that being a family to me isn't about a marital bond or what's on paper it's about the love and respect that you accord each other that you can communicate and that you are willing to be there for someone else a marriage is nice to have and stops the neighbors from chattering but there are married couples that don't communicate or show each other respect that are less of a family than what your friends are going to potentially be as to whether it's temporary that is up to your friends again even full marriages can be temporary best not to worry about it and don't change how you feel about them because of this Human sexual behavior Polyamory Theory of conduct Marriage Humphrey Bogart Knots Landing Goodness and value theory Polygamy Homosexuality and Judaism AFI 100 Years series Same-sex marriage Friends Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tina Turner Birth control Shaggy dog story True Crime: Streets of LA Jennifer Lopez One Tree Hill (TV series) Sexual orientation Days of our Lives Jean Grey Same-sex marriage in Canada Theodicy Social rule Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Milton H.
