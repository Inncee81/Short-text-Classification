seperated from soceity wanna you ever feel like just wanting to seperate yourself from the masses you know soeciety pull a cast away people often tell me that i dwell too much on things and society if you look at my of my questions on here you'll see what they mean some have even to me if i don't like it i such just become a hermit or something or go live on a mountain now i know they mean it to insault me but often times i think maybe i should because as they say if don't like something do something about it and no i haven't been bullied and picked on there's no mental disfunction here trust me its just that i feel like i'm sicking of people now the way modern culture is the way it functions granted though i'm only so take that for whats its worth thoughts society is to blame for everything we see wrong with our nation homelessness killings racism and believe me when i say this its society not you now by solely looking at the definition of society which can be defined in several ways but most often is used to speak of the overwhelming majority of social groups divided by region we see similarities in the way people think the way people act the things they do and so on now if everybody thinks alike and everybody is into the same things we have a small group of a larger society a society within itself categorized by the people that make it up outcasts like yourself are a result of societies inability to understand the complexities of perspective and opinion they automatically shut down your ideas because they don't understand the reasons behind your actions and your arguements nor are they smart or independent enough to even try to understand they are a self centered majority groupfof people whose beliefs are not easily swayed and because they belong to a society whose opinions are all alike they belief they are right they often come off as arrogant to us outcasts and smart to their social groups it is hard not to dwell on society when you can see all the things wrong with it which they fail to see because they are so blinded by what is obvious to us they see us as arrogant and stupid but really by definition they are all the same they act the same they think the same they are the stupid ones not us unfortunately this will never change and those outcasts will never belong to the masses because of the damage caused by being an outcast not to mention the differences in logical thinking does this make sense Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Asperger syndrome Religion Sexual orientation Philosophy The nature of God in Western theology Meme Autism Evil Culture Utilitarianism Philosophy of language Atheism Caste Social psychology Criticism of libertarianism Deconstruction Stupidity Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ten Commandments Philosophical skepticism Franz Boas David Hume Free will Ideology Ethics Economics Indian caste system Strategic management Simone Weil Determinism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Power (sociology) Social rule Max Weber Scientific method Scientology beliefs and practices Coercion Cyberspace Neuro-linguistic programming Intelligent design Human nature Reality Guns, Germs, and Steel Human Alcoholics Anonymous Autism rights movement Sociocultural evolution Predestination Reparations for slavery Value system Discordianism Rudolf Hermann Lotze Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Political correctness Consensus decision-making Liberalism Social justice Brave New World Freedom of speech Bernard Williams Cultural relativism Transsexuality Religious Society of Friends Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fundamentalism Extreme Programming Ontological argument Immanuel Kant Homophobia Pseudoscience Rape Patriotism Gandhism Hikikomori Serial killer Procrastination Pedophilia Pacifism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Existence of God Black (people) Moral relativism The Catcher in the Rye Biblical inerrancy Nicomachean Ethics Moral Politics Democracy Karen Horney Evangelicalism Islamic philosophy
