what is your opinion on abortion keep this in mind political views religious views views from each gender what if the doctor says giving birth to the baby would kill the mother and the baby who agrees with this theory if people give up there children for adoption or just throw them away somewhere these unwanted and uncared for children will grow up to become the next generation of criminals nobody taught these forsaken children any better so as a result these children will bring the crime rate up world wide or what about god is very angry that we are murdering inocent children that is why he brought hurricane katrina and this war in the middle east upon us my opinion is that it is a very difficult decision that a woman has to make it should not be used as a form of birth control and the woman should have access to counseling before and after to deal with the trauma this decision may cause her a woman's body is her own to make choices with and this should not involve any males Domestic violence Abortion Democracy Transsexuality Gender role Religion and abortion Mother Teresa Androgen insensitivity syndrome Partial-birth abortion Fathers' rights Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Roe v.
