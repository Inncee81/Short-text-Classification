apple ipod gb with video vs microsoft zune gb i had an ipod and i had so many problems with it it sucked like i loved the ipod itself but it was always breaking and shutting down i had the gb with photo not video i was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on the difference of the two i need someone who has a zune to comment and someone with a video ipod or someone who has used both which one do you like better which one holds up better i have a microsoft computer by the way i don't know if that makes a difference i have had a gb ipod video for over a year now and i have never had any problems with it there is a reason the ipod is so popular from itunes it is incredibly easy to put all or just a few of your songs and videos on it even if you have a windows computer and once on it the videos look great and the music sounds awesome i understand why you loved your old ipod on top of everything it looks fantastic quote dwight schrute from the office a great show by the way the zune is just like the ipod except chunkier and more solid so basically if you care about chunkiness the zune is the way to go aren't its colors all shades of brown but if you want a sleek shiny pretty music player that works wonderfully go for the ipod i have almost never heard of an ipod breaking down like yours did so that shouldn't really be a concern the only upside of the zune is it can transfer song between players but this is a minimal point compared to all of the reasons to get an ipod IPod ITunes Music Store Apple Computer ITunes Digital audio player Podcasting Apple Macintosh IPod nano Digital rights management IPod photo FairPlay Creative Zen Vorbis MP3 IPod shuffle Redundant array of independent disks Disc jockey IPod mini Online music store QuickTime Napster (pay service) Walkman RealNetworks Gramophone record Paul Is Dead Advanced Audio Coding ILife IMac IBM PC compatible Atari 8-bit family Madonna (entertainer) FireWire Video game music In The Groove (game) U2 (band) Extraordinary Machine X Window System We Belong Together Theory of conduct Roxette Apple II family Rhapsody (online music service) Laserdisc Windows Vista IPhoto Computer and video games Computer VH1 Mixtape Commodore 64 MiniDisc Cool (song) TRS-80 Oasis (band) Spice Girls Jon Lech Johansen Steve Jobs Color Universal Serial Bus Screenshot History of Microsoft Windows The Shining (film) Halo (video game series) Dance Dance Revolution Mac OS X v10.4 Jon Secada Kylie Minogue Atari ST Microsoft Windows Whose Line Is It Anyway?
