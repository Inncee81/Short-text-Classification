ipod won't connect with itunes a few weeks ago i hooked up my ipod nano to my laptop to download some new songs onto my ipod i left for a bit and came back to find that itunes wasn't connected to my ipod despite the fact it was plugged in and the ipod nano was turned on then i noticed that the toggle was popping out like it was going to explode i grabbed to take it out but it just burned my fingers i got mittens and unplugged it apple had me mail in my ipod nano and they just shipped me back a new one today i plugged in my new ipod nano and itunes still won't recognize my ipod my new ipod won't even turn on when i plug in my ipod it doesn't show any indication of it charging either what is going on with my computer itunes ipod i don't know what the problem is anymore help try some steps by steps if this could help uninstall your itunes completely from your computer then reinstall it be sure it is completely deleted even from your registry before reinstalling then update it plug your ipod and restore it so it could be like in a factory setting update your windows too and any security settings on your computer say antivirus as there might some bugs if all of the above doesn't work out call apple store and tell them their ipod is not working don't forget there are tendencies that even if they gave you a new one as replacement of the previous it's not an evidence that this new ipod is really new and no defect since your computer is a laptop you could bring your laptop too and show it to them so they would be able to figure out where the problem lies sometimes i do it if something goes wrong with my pc and brought it to the computer shop so same thing you would do with the apple store so that your ipod will be fixed Apple Computer ITunes Music Store IPod shuffle IPod nano Apple Macintosh Podcasting Windows XP IPod mini Online music store Digital audio player Computer virus Digital rights management IMac Steve Jobs FairPlay Spyware History of Microsoft Windows USB flash drive MP3 Advanced Audio Coding Mouse (computing) QuickTime Anti-virus software FireWire Windows Vista ILife Gramophone record IBM PC compatible Surveillance IPod photo Virtual memory Vorbis Computer security Personal computer Laptop MDAC Domain Name System Billboard Hot 100 U2 (band) RealNetworks Napster (pay service) Microsoft Windows Mac OS X v10.2 The End of the World (Doctor Who) SonicStage Atari ST E-mail Mozilla Firefox Mac OS X Rootkit Flash memory Floppy disk We Belong Together Universal Serial Bus Mac OS X v10.4 Cheating in Counter-Strike Wi-Fi Computer forensics Gmail Rhapsody (online music service) Modem Piccolo Junior Saga Disc jockey Walkman PowerBook Commodore 64 Apple II family Macintosh Finder Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Enigma machine H.264/MPEG-4 AVC AmigaOS Dialer System 7 (Macintosh) The Inside Common Unix Printing System Non-native pronunciations of English Slashdot subculture The Emancipation of Mimi Windows 2000 Pretty Good Privacy Uninstaller Hash table
