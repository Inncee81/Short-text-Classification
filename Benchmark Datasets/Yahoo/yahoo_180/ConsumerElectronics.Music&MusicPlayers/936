my bro and i share an itunes so i cant delete the songs from that but how do i take songs off my ipod nano set the ipod to manage music manually on the front tab of the preferences then just select what you don't want on the ipod right click and select delete then set up some playlists containing only the songs you want and sync to them manually or drag drop them onto the ipod's name then you'll only ever have the music you like on your ipod even though you share the same library with your brother ITunes IPod ITunes Music Store IPod nano IPod shuffle FairPlay IPod mini Disc jockey Online music store ILife Apple Computer Gramophone record Mouse (computing) Walkman Mixtape HTTP cookie SonicStage Apple Macintosh Apple typography Classic rock Digital audio player Creative Zen Digital rights management Rhapsody (online music service) Playlist Rhythmbox RealNetworks Napster (pay service) U2 (band) Madonna (entertainer) IPod photo Macintosh Finder Podcasting IPhoto Black Eyed Peas Steve Jobs Redundant array of independent disks Lip sync Aerial (dance move) PlayStation Portable History of the graphical user interface QuickTime Virtual memory Billboard Hot 100 Grateful Dead Winamp SQL Mozilla Firefox Twm Video game music Music radio Warner Bros.
