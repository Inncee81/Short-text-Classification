mp player is it possible a while back i went to a certain store and my brand new mp player just died while i was paying for my stuff at the register since then i used my warranty to replace that mp player with a new one exactly the same it was working fine until i took it with me to that same store and sure enough while i was standing in line to pay for my stuff the new mp player died too is it possible that the scanner at the store may have caused both my mp players to demagnify or something what do you think could have caused this to happen and how can i stop it from happening again by the way i swear i will never enter that store with an mp player again maybe you should stop going to that store yes it is possible as anti theft systems have a high magnetic field that's why they tell you not to put credit cards on them Automatic teller machine RFID Credit card IPod Grand Theft Auto (game) EFTPOS Year 2000 problem Smart card Citigroup Slot machine Topps Apple Computer The Caves of Androzani Citizens Bank Park Magnetic core memory Windows XP Magnet IBM 700/7000 series Volleyball Futurama (TV series - season 5) British national identity card Electricity meter Gramophone record Sears Holdings Corporation Punch card Cray-1 Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) GSM services Craps Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
