ipod trouble cant turn off i usuall hold down the play option to turn it off but it didnt work today is there a sinmple solution to this or should i send it in for repairs i freaked out when i had this problem with my first ipod many years ago don't panic its probably as simple as needing to reboot when it first happened to me i let the battery drain which also worked but you don't have to do that the manual that came with your ipod will show you how to do it but basically you have to hold the center button down and menu at the same time for a few seconds the screen will go blank you'll get the apple logo and your ipod will reboot and you'll be good to go hopefully you might have noticed that sometimes if you leave your ipod alone for several hours and you go to turn it on it takes a while to come up the screen will be dark and you'll see the apple logo that's all this is your ipod is rebooting no big deal if this doesn't work though you probably have other problems that would require you to get it serviced good luck hope this helps IPod Apple Computer IPod nano IPod mini Mouse (computing) Apple typography X Window System Apple Newton IPod photo Screenshot ITunes ITunes Music Store IMac Windows XP Winning Streak Poker jargon IBM PC compatible Gramophone record IPod shuffle Touchpad Halting problem Embedded system Walkman FairPlay System 7 (Macintosh) Atari 8-bit family Oscilloscope Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Digital audio player Windows 2000 Wheel of Fortune Visual Basic Podcasting Creative Zen AmigaOS PlayStation Portable Floppy disk Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Advance Wars: Dual Strike Dance Dance Revolution Pump It Up Ecco the Dolphin Chrono Trigger Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Objective-C Gmail Universal Serial Bus Domain Name System Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX PowerBook QuickTime Terran (StarCraft) Danger Hiptop Game Boy Advance Betting (poker) Logo Online music store Cheating in Counter-Strike 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara EXpanded MultiPlayer C64 Direct-to-TV Blackjack Jumpstart 3rd Grade Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Dominoes BlackBerry Social rule Futurama (TV series - season 3) Oh My Goddess!
