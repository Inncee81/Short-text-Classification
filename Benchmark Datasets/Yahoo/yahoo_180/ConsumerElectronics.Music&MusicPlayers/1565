zune or ipod i'm confused which is better someone stole my zune and i get the chance to get a new one from the kids parents which one is better and why u dont have read it all srry about all this info well okay ms is making an mp player they are a little behind don t you think just because ms makes something does not mean it will be good competition for an already dominating product ipods are perfected at this point the nano is an amazing smaller ipod zune will only be offered in a large size the zune wireless sharing aspect may be succesful the larger screen size is a plus the zune design is very simplistic and we will find out if the controls are better then the ipod ipod controls take getting used to and are simple with only one large defect the defect is volume now while in the ipod s menu displaying the song that is playing the user can change the volume with the wheel but when the menu displays something different like artist s list or settings the user can not change the volume the user must navigate all the way back to the song that s playing or just wait a few seconds without moving the wheel in order to change the volume this is the only flaw with the ipod controls if zune defeats this flaw and makes volume accesable at any time and at any instance then it may be better then the ipod after all ipods and mp players are made primarily to listen to you listen to music volume is very very very important in fact volume is what the whole thing is about with no volume you have no music volume control is key this looks like a cool alternative ta an ipod if this lets you put music in the mp without having to add the song to itunes i keep my songs away from the family personal reasons then i m bought but i m only gonna buy it if it has a large storage say more than gb space is very important oh yeah you stupid ipod lovers the ipod is not the greatest inventiomn in the st century it has heaps of annoying stuff the people always never upgrade it enough see new search engine for g hopefyly the programers on this will be more considerite to us buyers than the ipod people ipod wonderful ipod programers horrible zune good programers i m bought the ipod heve been a lot of time those morons tha like to criticize the things the zune have and ipod dont well that becausethey realize that they waste their money in the ipod because ipod do not have radio or wi fi and do not came in bron color they can not stop talking about the stupid ipod nano well thas an other excuse because they now that zune will have a nano dont can you see that zune is not out yet and already have beter things than the ipod and the ipod in years came wiht the same things and they make you pay more for a radio so you can have radio in ti and zune for less money than the money you waste in the ipod it have the radio and wi fi the questions are what ipod have included that zune dosent the estupid itnus what zune have included that ipod dosent radio wi fi http www macworld com forums ubbthreads showflat php cat number an page http www cliczune com ipod vs zune index html im gonna be honest ipod has been out way longer zune is fresh something new plwase get a zune especially if its free no device is perfect did u even like having a zune if u didnt then get the ipod if u did get the zune best wishes which ever one u pick i hope u enjoy it someppl like the zune some ppl hate it some ppl like the ipod some ppl hate it i have nothing against either Apple Computer IPod nano ITunes Music Store IPod shuffle Podcasting Apple Macintosh Windows 2000 Windows XP Redundant array of independent disks Gmail Creative Zen ILife Atari 8-bit family Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Online music store Web design Digital rights management USB flash drive CPU cache Wheel of Fortune Mac OS X v10.4 Digital audio player Walkman Wireless Application Protocol Jennifer Lopez Web crawler Poker jargon IMac IPod mini Domain Name System Apple typography Gramophone record Spam (electronic) Ajax (programming) Steve Jobs AmigaOS Pump It Up HTML element Neopets RISC FairPlay Mach kernel Apple Newton Opera (web browser) IBM PC compatible GameFAQs Rich Mullins RuneScape cheats Digital photography Transmission Control Protocol Extreme Programming MP3 Palm OS Cascading Style Sheets Microeconomics World Wide Web Supply and demand Computer Civilization III CPU design Macromedia Flash Spyware Bluetooth MSN Messenger Disc jockey Little Britain English grammar Cross site scripting MMORPG Windows Vista Linux kernel IPod photo Last.fm Social rule System/36 Objective-C PlayStation Portable Unicode Emacs RealNetworks Search engine optimization The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Video game music Cruising (maritime) Slot machine Password Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Software engineering Major League Baseball television contracts Jack FM Lisp programming language Screenshot
