recording a cd for my friends hey i want to record a cd for my friends but i need some ideas on writing music write about things you know about mention local areas streets events people etc in your songs if possible try writing from another point of view perhaps a local character keep a small notepad with you and jot down things people say or headlines or billboards etc that hit you try to make up melodies in your head for inspiration get away from music go to a museum or a film or read a new book this can sometimes get the creative edge going read a music biography break up with a loved one always a good source of inspiration haha do not wait for inspiration to strike if you can make a habit of sitting down everyday if only for minutes with the sole purpose of writing music you'd be surprised what you can accomplish listen to your favorite songs and try to analyze why you like them finally steal other's ideas and make them your own lol it's done all the time best of luck to you Hey Jude Roxette Billboard Hot 100 I Want to Hold Your Hand Red Hot Chili Peppers Chicago (band) The Velvet Underground Time Out of Mind Boyz II Men She Loves You Sampling (music) Spice Girls Mixtape Grunge music Tony Bennett Sheryl Crow Meteora (album) Jennifer Lopez Whitney Houston The Times They Are A-Changin' Primus (band) Sly & the Family Stone Cool (song) Avenue Q Nashville Skyline The Beatles' influence Hall & Oates American Pie (song) Anne Murray The Beatles discography Bradley Nowell Roy Orbison Layla Guns N' Roses The Rutles The Emancipation of Mimi The Isley Brothers The Chemical Brothers OutKast No Doubt Something John Cage Bonnie Tyler The Monkees The Wall Three Stooges Beastie Boys Paul McCartney Beatles for Sale Boards of Canada I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Garth Brooks Empire Burlesque The Beatles Dave Matthews Band Led Zeppelin Situation comedy Kylie Minogue Emotions (album) Quarashi Luck Pantera Louis Armstrong Good Vibrations The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan 10cc Joni Mitchell Toni Braxton Blonde on Blonde Jon Secada Blood on the Tracks The Ashlee Simpson Show The Cure Shaggy dog story Sigmund Freud Hot 100 Airplay Asha Bhosle Popular music Film soundtrack H.
