can't add file to library using itunes i am using itunes to try to load some podcast to my ipod shuffle i use the add file to library option but the file never shows up on the itunes program what am i doing wrong i have a couple ideas as to what might be wrong the first is probably too obvious but i'll point it out anyway just in case i'm not entirely sure if you're looking under music or podcast libraries but i would check the whichever one you're not looking under just to make sure it's not being imported differently unless of course you've checked both in which case just ignore that also if it's a video podcast which i doubt since you have a shuffle be sure to check the movie library can you import other files into itunes like say a song if you can then itunes is working properly so the problem must be with how the file is marked and thus where it's importing to or with the file itself being corrupt or something similar if you can't import a song file then you probably need to reinstall itunes what might be easier if the podcasts are listed on the itunes music store is to subscribe to the podcasts you want or to download the episodes you want through itunes rather than downloading them elsewhere and trying to import just go to podcasts and click the arrow next to podcast directory in the lower right and once it pulls up the music store do a search for the podcasts you want IPod ITunes Music Store Apple Computer ILife This Week in Tech Online music store SonicStage IPod shuffle BitTorrent Digital audio player QuickTime Library (computer science) Blog MP3 Digital rights management RSS (file format) Walkman Redundant array of independent disks File system Digg Perl Objective-C Minesweeper (computer game) Video game music Adam Curry Virtual memory Macromedia Flash Advanced Audio Coding We Belong Together FairPlay Open access AmigaOS WebObjects Windows Vista Jon Lech Johansen Computer virus Mozilla Firefox Dance Dance Revolution RealNetworks Debugging Vodcast Aggregator Copyleft Windows XP Mach kernel Gmail Microsoft .NET Windows registry Apple Macintosh Windows 2000 Warez Gramophone record Spyware CPU cache File format File sharing Linux Pretty Good Privacy Billboard magazine Shake It Off IPod photo Spring operating system IPod nano Napster (pay service) Barack Obama PHP Linked list International Phonetic Alphabet Emacs Rootkit Floppy disk Python programming language Option key Blackjack Object Desktop Commodore 64 TLC Vlog ZX Spectrum PlayStation Portable Napster Halting problem Collation Web crawler IPod mini System 7 (Macintosh) Mac OS X Java programming language Blue screen of death Digital photography Macintosh Finder America Online File Allocation Table
