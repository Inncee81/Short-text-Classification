how do i transfer music from lp's and cassette tapes to mp format for use on my pc the best way may be just to go buy the actual cd's transferring lp's cassettes takes some extra hardware which alone could cost more than cd's then there is the time spent doing the transfer work when you are done you will still end up with a quality you are not happy with you will need some sort of interface to plug in your cassette deck your record player may need a special preamp as well as the interface there are record players that have usb out for and up if you still want to do it yourself first transfer as standard audio files cd quality or better then do whatever editing you want before you convert to mp 's this process will take hours per individual lp tape you could easily spend about to have mp 's that still have some lp pops tape hiss so getting the actual cd's is still my best recommendation sorry not really what you want to hear Sound recording Compact audio cassette VHS Musical Instrument Digital Interface DV Magnetic tape Videocassette recorder Walkman IPod Sound card Secure Digital card Multitrack recording 8 mm video format Laserdisc Floppy disk Atari 8-bit family Universal Serial Bus Mixtape Gramophone record Compact disc Betacam High fidelity Cassette deck Audio tape length and thickness PlayStation Portable ZX Spectrum DVD Enterprise content management Disc jockey Reel-to-reel audio tape recording Federal Standard 1037C Boards of Canada MP3 Tape recorder High-definition television Cassette culture USB mass storage device class Amstrad CPC Sony Digital cinematography MOS Technology SID 8-track cartridge Sinclair ZX81 WAV Digital photography Sound Blaster Apple II family Common Unix Printing System Apple Macintosh Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Betamax Digital Audio Tape Hard disk ITunes Windows XP Serial ATA Nakamichi Copy protection Digital rights management Karaoke PlayStation 3 Telecine Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 2" Quadruplex videotape USB flash drive Video game music Videotape NTSC Dolby Laboratories Computer forensics Gross domestic product Electronic journalism Digital video Disk magazine Remaster FireWire Creative Zen Digital audio player S-VHS Audiophile Embedded system Pump It Up Audio mastering Xbox Digital8 Redundant array of independent disks Dither Computer bus Acorn Electron Morse Code Cubase Xbox 360 Mac OS X Bluetooth CD-ROM Linux
