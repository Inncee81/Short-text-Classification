anyone who owns an ipod i would like your advice i dont own an ipod i never have my question is can you only download songs from itunes or are there other sites you can download from also how much does it cost per song i know nothing about this and i'm considering purchasing one any suggestions are welcome overall what was your experience with your ipod are you glad you bought it thanx i own ipods so i can tell you the songs on itunes are cents per song unless the song is higher quilter drm free and then it is you can use your own cds to put songs on the itunes you can also get free songs from limewire com but keep in mind that it is not legal i would not suggest you get the ipod shuffle i have one it has no screen and all it can do is play music in alphebetical order unless you have it on shuffle mode i also have the ipod nano the nano is great it has a screen games clock tons of storage space it also has a calander notes and you can lock the screen i have the gb so i can hold songs based on minutes per song if you get the gb you can hold songs do not get the gb nano because it costs the same as a gb video so you get tons more storage space for the same price the ipod video is the one that can hold videos also if you want to put more than the four games that come on it then you need to get the video my nano was the best thing i ever bought and worth the the gb is and the ipod video is for the gb there is an gb for but my friend told me not to get one because they are huge and take up so much room they can barely fit in your pocket the shuffle is like but do not get the shuffle you will not have a good experience the only time you should get a shuffle is if you don't want to choose what song is coming next and you will only use it to exercise another good thing about the nano is there is now something called nike ipod you need the nano for this you need to buy a certain nike shoe and then buy the nike ipod they are available at finish line stores an ipod is a great thing to get and really easy to use if you have anymore questions about it or encounter any problems in the future you can contact me through my profile ITunes Music Store ITunes Apple Computer IPod nano IPod shuffle Digital rights management FairPlay Digital audio player USB flash drive Podcasting Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME IPod mini Redundant array of independent disks IPod photo Walkman Creative Zen Jennifer Lopez Warez MP3 Nintendo RealNetworks Video game music Blackjack Vorbis Gramophone record Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Advanced Audio Coding Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 IMac Dance Dance Revolution Digital photography Pump It Up ILife Madonna (entertainer) Solar cell Commodore 64 IBM PC compatible DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX PlayStation 3 Steve Jobs DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Shuffle Xbox 360 DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Game Boy Advance QuickTime We Belong Together Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Microeconomics Karaoke Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Atari ST Floppy disk U2 (band) System/36 Hydrogen economy PlayStation Portable FireWire Apple Macintosh Napster MAME MGM Studios, Inc. v.
