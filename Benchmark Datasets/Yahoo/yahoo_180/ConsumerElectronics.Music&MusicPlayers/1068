will my ipod play avi's when i play them on quicktime they are always white and you hear muffled sounds but that is because quicktime doesn't play avi's will it play the movie without having the same turnout as quicktime thanks avi format is not compatable with ipods as far as i know however you can convert avi files to mpeg or mp i'm pretty sure both of them work with ipod but i'm more sure with mpeg you need a program to convert them QuickTime ITunes MP3 AVI Apple Computer ITunes Music Store FairPlay Macromedia Flash IPod Podcasting H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Streaming media PlayStation Portable Video codec Vorbis Creative Zen Comparison of media players Windows Media Video File format Winamp Ogg DV AmigaOS ILife Apple Macintosh Musical Instrument Digital Interface Sega Saturn Super Video CD Walkman Advanced Audio Coding ImageMagick Digital audio player MPEG-4 Part 14 DivX Moving Picture Experts Group Digital rights management AviSynth DirectShow Windows Mobile IPhoto MP2 (format) Online music store Ebook NeXT Disc jockey Audio data compression IPod shuffle WNNX (FM) MPEG-4 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines System 7 (Macintosh) Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital camera Internet pornography Betacam Jack FM Mac OS X v10.4 FireWire Flash memory RealNetworks Gramophone record Mac OS X Common Unix Printing System IMac Apple typography Macromedia Director GP2X CamelCase TV tuner card Wine (software) MiniDisc Audio file format HyperCard Harmonic series (music) Rhapsody (online music service) Mac OS OS/2 Iriver Karaoke FFmpeg Filename extension Nine Inch Nails Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) OGM Big band Top 40 High-definition television Digital audio broadcasting Pretty Good Privacy Dolby Digital Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows Presentation Foundation Internet Explorer for Mac SonicStage Knoppix Quest for Glory Compression artifact X86 assembly language ASCII art
