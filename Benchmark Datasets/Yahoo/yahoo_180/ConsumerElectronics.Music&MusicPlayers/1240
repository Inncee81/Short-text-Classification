i want to buy and ipod but i don't know if i should i have a gb mp player now but i want to upgrade since it was to much of a hassle to use itunes with my mp i normally used windows media player but ipods can't use wmp so i wanted to know if there's a way around it so i can put the songs i bought from wmp onto the ipod there are many mp players that are better than ipod as the fm radio talk show said apple designs the ipod that will break down in a year and the life of the battery is the life of the ipod and replacing the battery costs almost the same as getting a new one unless you replace the battery yourself i am using insignia mp player from best buy it has gb enough for me it also has a memory card slot so you can add extra memory its only it has phone jacks so people can listen to the music instead of sharing headphone it can watch video fm radio record mp music audible books and view photo and the lithium batter is replaceable and lasts hours of playback i suggest you to get a mp player around and use the remaining money to get a good headphone most mp player even ipod gives shitty headset i just bought the bose round ear headphone and its damn great wmp takes a lot of memory convert it to mp gb can hold much more than songs so far i have songs and some videos in my mp players and i still have gb left ITunes ITunes Music Store Headphones Walkman Creative Zen Digital audio player Apple Computer Podcasting Gramophone record IMac Apple Macintosh Nintendo DS IPod shuffle IPod mini Disc jockey PlayStation Portable IPod nano Tungsten Handheld FairPlay Digital rights management Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Windows Media Player QuickTime Online music store Game Boy Advance SP MP3 Vorbis Xbox 360 Copy protection Xbox Advanced Audio Coding Archos High fidelity ILife Rhapsody (online music service) Jack plug Game Boy Advance Audiophile Napster (pay service) Computer and video games Laptop Loudspeaker Apple Newton Apple IIGS PowerBook MiniDisc Atari ST Amstrad CPC Mac mini Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME IBM PC compatible PC Engine Atari 8-bit family Game Boy Binaural recording RealNetworks Musical Instrument Digital Interface Mac OS X Windows XP Handheld game console Computer bus Compact disc TLC Digital photography Neuros MTV DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Tapwave Zodiac Microphone Bluetooth Mobile phone Sound Blaster Baseball Steve Jobs Bose Corporation Apple II family H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Video game music Herbie Hancock The Sims 2 The Ashlee Simpson Show IBook Winning Streak Television Stereophonic sound $ale of the Century Rhythmbox Cruising (maritime) Amiga The Emancipation of Mimi Karaoke The Joker's Wild
