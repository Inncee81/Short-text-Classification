i pod i tunes problem hi last night i was updating my i pod and when i tunes notified me to disconnect it because it was finished i did strangely though and in two years this has never happened i noticed a little lock on the top left corner of my i pod now i can't access any of the options music pictures etc i can't even turn the light on on it when you roll the menu it's completely frozen i don't know how this happened and i have no idea how to fix it i'd be very grateful if someone could help me out thanks thanks so much guys the switch didn't even occur to me because i have a thick case over it that i never take off i appreciate your answers yea first toggle the hold switch back and forth a few times then hold the menu and center button for around ten seconds until the apple logo appears then your ipod should be fine but if that doesn't work just plug your ipod into your computer IPod Mouse (computing) Windows XP ITunes Danger Hiptop Apple Computer Mercury Atlas 6 AmigaOS B-47 Stratojet ITunes Music Store IPod nano Drag racing IPod mini Floppy disk Ecco the Dolphin PlayStation Portable Embedded system Armored Core Microsoft Windows Ocean's Twelve USB flash drive Gradius IMac Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Atari 8-bit family Gmail FairPlay Switch Disc jockey STS-61 Mozilla Firefox Walkman Pinball Common User Access System/34 IPod shuffle Gramophone record Apple Macintosh System/36 Team Fortress Classic Toyota Prius Apple typography Mac OS X v10.4 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Super Metroid Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory P-38 Lightning Hey Jude System 7 (Macintosh) Light switch Podcasting GoldenEye 007 Computer virus Mac mini Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Wheel of Fortune IBM PC keyboard Weebl and Bob Windows Vista Option key Episodes of Lost (Season 2) SMTV Live Reading spark plugs for racing Windows 2000 Perfect Dark Jack plug Macintosh Finder Pump It Up Bob and George Super Mario Advance 4 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Steve Jobs Telephone exchange Prank flash Modem Vertical service code Game Boy Advance Cheating in Counter-Strike Escape from New York DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Apple IIGS Logo Screenshot Aerial (dance move) Tungsten Handheld Digital rights management Object Desktop IPod photo Syphon Filter H.264/MPEG-4 AVC GunZ The Duel Bubble Bobble Domestic AC power plugs and sockets American Pie (song) Domain Name System 2005 United States Grand Prix CPU design Mac OS history CPU cache Digital audio player
