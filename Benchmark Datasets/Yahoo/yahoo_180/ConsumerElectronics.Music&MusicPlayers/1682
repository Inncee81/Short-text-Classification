a buddy of mine says there is a program out there that fixes scrached cd's it like analizes the cd and fills in the part that it skips on the cd and you download the cd and then you burn it and when you burn it it comes out clean no skiping or anything this is for music cd's what is it if the scratching is minor to middle you can probably use a physical disc cleaner they sell them at electronics stores and you just rub some liquid that comes with it onto the cd and then buff it out real good it actually fills in and buffs the scratches out and i've been able to recover most of my old cds this way Gramophone record DVD Compact disc Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Movie projector ITunes ITunes Music Store Nintendo DS Windows XP UK Singles Chart Lee "Scratch" Perry Mixtape Hard disk Online music store Strap-on dildo Coal Future energy development Digital rights management Laserdisc Hip hop culture Floppy disk Disc jockey Audiophile Single (music) Dry cleaning Diamond Phonograph Phish Karaoke Gilding CD-R ALGOL 68 Digital audio player Phase (matter) Carburetor Mattress Cat MiniDisc Hip hop music Compact audio cassette Natural gas Money supply DualDisc Record label Vacuum cleaner MAME MP3 Nuclear power Marillion Walkman Casting Peter Gabriel Sulfur Drum and bass Music Vacuum LiveCD Ammonia Helium Turquoise Fuel injection Diamond enhancement Windows registry Waste management Musical Instrument Digital Interface Tesco Copy protection EverQuest Motor oil Digital photography Remix Disc brake Periodic table Video CD System 7 (Macintosh) Gold standard Electronic commerce Anal sex Pok__mon Ruby and Sapphire Soldering Shake It Off 3 Feet High and Rising Economic growth Classical music era Guinea pig Apple Newton Energy development High fidelity IA-32 Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation Disk image Orthogonal matrix Pottery Warp Records Linux Circuit design Hydrogen Uranium
