are ipods worth buying i am a little iffy on buying an ipod all of my friends have it and i would like to have one but i'm just not quite sure that it's a smart buy is it worth every single penny and why i already have mp on my cell phone but sometimes it doesn't like my music it an ipod still a good buy top reasons to get an ipod instead of a zune i must say that i have not been particularly impressed by the zune this is my top list of reasons for sticking with apple was simply not enough the ipod has more accessories the ipod offers better integration with cars itunes offers seamless podcast support unlike the zune which requires third party software apple has a clear personal digital media strategy that goes beyond the ipod as demonstrated with products such as airport express and the upcoming itv itunes is the best software to manage digital media itunes is multi platform windows and mac unlike the zune software that is windows only and still does not work on vista airlines are starting to offer ipod integration with their in flight entertainment systems ipods can play and buy games hard disk drive models the itunes store offers more songs than any competitor ipods are smaller and lighter apple offers worldwide support for the ipod the songs bought on the itunes store can be used more liberally from my experience when i had a zune it had a problem and contact the store and also microsoft they wouldnt even bother to help me so i emailed them but no reply later on i bought an ipod sure it freezes sometimes and can get easily scratch buy what the hey u can just buy cheap clear film to protect the ipod from scratches and whether i have a problem w it just call apple and they help u instantly not like other stores the only problem why people say ipods has a low battery life is because they dont read instructions the manual said for the first time charge your ipod for about hours to get better results but people are too excited they charge it about an hour or so its there own fault so what do you think did i forget something hope this helps Podcasting IBM PC compatible Digital rights management IPod shuffle FairPlay USB flash drive IPod nano Online music store IMac IPod photo IPod mini Hard disk Windows Vista Redundant array of independent disks Digital photography Digital audio player QuickTime Creative Zen Computer Windows XP Vorbis Computer virus PlayStation Portable Atari ST MP3 Pretty Good Privacy Mach kernel Mouse (computing) NeXT Mac OS X Gmail Atari 8-bit family ILife Advanced Audio Coding Mac OS X v10.4 Nintendo Copy protection Microsoft Microsoft Office Mobile phone Enterprise content management Disc jockey History of Microsoft Windows RealNetworks Linux System 7 (Macintosh) Apple II family Apple typography PlayStation 2 WebObjects FireWire Steve Jobs MMORPG Mozilla Firefox Windows 2000 Timeline of computing 1990-forward AmigaOS HyperCard DVD Xbox Blog X Window System Computer and video games Java programming language Screenshot Loss leader H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Operating system Virtual memory RISC Universal Serial Bus Apple Store Compact audio cassette Game programmer Jon Lech Johansen SonicStage Ashton-Tate Surveillance Nintendo GameCube Laserdisc DOS Flash memory Customer relationship management Sega Stardock Computer role-playing game
