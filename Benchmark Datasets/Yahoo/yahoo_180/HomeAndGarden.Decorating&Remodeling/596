can anyone estimate how much it might cost to take down two walls we want to combine a small living room with an adjoining bed room to make it larger neither wall is load bearing as requested by louie floors same hardwood in both rooms and i realize i will have to spend extra to fill in or somhow repair didn't consider the ceiling however we move into the house in weeks so i don't have the measurements of the walls but it's a traditional 's style ranch if that helps it would still be around the same to remove walls and cap electrical when i say cap electrical that would mean to take the wiring out to the last plug or switch left before the wall to be demolished so figure for that then to repair your ceiling would require a sheetrock taper to float in your ceiling basically fill in the missing piece this would probably be in the dollar range but could be more depending on size of patch needed last you will need to paint and i suggest you paint the whole ceiling as one not just the patched area hope this helps you out good luck on new house jason Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Seismic retrofit Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Sento Wilton House Asbestos Bungalow Stairway Japanese tea ceremony Antenna (radio) Upholstery Carburetor Pebble bed reactor Casting Super Mario 64 Xanadu House Wood carving Poker jargon BS 1363 Wood McMansion RISC Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Thermal power station Internal ballistics Champagne (beverage) Doom engine Screw Drywall Jack plug Electrical wiring Hamster Heinkel He 100 Naval mine Fire fighting Fan (implement) Electrophysiology Bubble Bobble Oscilloscope Switch Wind power Strap-on dildo Rathfarnham World Trade Center Blenheim Palace Incandescent light bulb Fuse (electrical) Loudspeaker Airbus A380 CPU cache Iowa class battleship IAR 80 Gas metal arc welding Mattress Sewage treatment United States dollar Welding Wallpaper group Vickers Valiant Radio controlled airplane Audiophile Fancy rat Mach kernel Trombone Betting (poker) Electrical wiring (UK) Piano FoxTrot Bullet Elevator Semiconductor device Ship Panama Canal Locks Redundant array of independent disks USB flash drive Enigma machine Jumpstart 3rd Grade Angkor Wat Wind turbine Shell (projectile) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Cellular network Second Battle of the Atlantic Animal Crossing Autonomous building Contra Costa County, California Wayne Corporation Combine (Half-Life 2) Residual-current device Sailing Cube (film)
