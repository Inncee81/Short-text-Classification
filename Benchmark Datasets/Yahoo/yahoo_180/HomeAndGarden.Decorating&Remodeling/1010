i'm thinking about re doing my room are there any places where you can get things of a pink and black theme i love the colors pink and black together and i would love to do my room in these colors i have tried looking on the internet for different ideas but i can't seem to find anything well i would go with home depot or lowe's for borders and or wallpaper i think it looks really cool if you do a dark pink room with a solid black strip about a foot tall all around the room in the middle of the wall target has cool lampshades that are pink and black i have one and i spray painted a lamp pink to match it you can also find a black lampshade and put painters tape going around or down it in strips and paint the rest pink and then take off the tape it gives it a really cool look spencer's has some cool stuff too normally you can't really find stuff thats pink and black already so you will have to paint stff but its kinda fun and you can say 'i made that and you can also paint little black or pink stars or crossbones on your wall or the stip of color have fun and if you need any more ideas im up for helping lillizzybug yahoo com Syd Barrett Color Dundas Square Paint Lighting Super Mario 64 Fluorescent lamp The Wall Blood on the Tracks Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Snooker Garfield Green Day Pink Panther Dragon Booster Wallpaper group Grace Cossington Smith Rococo Color theory Xanadu House Care Bears Stained glass Avenue Q Pink Floyd Light-emitting diode Wassily Kandinsky Wilton House Bus models used in New York City Transit Sulfur Hoover Dam The Emancipation of Mimi Fire fighting Interior decoration Wallpaper The Ashlee Simpson Show Jumpstart 3rd Grade Opportunity rover James McNeill Whistler Fischer Random Chess Black Homestar Runner Transformer Silent Hill Dark Side of the Moon Rainbow Brite Professional wrestling match types Painting Sundial Bassoon Sinfest Douglas Adams Piet Mondrian Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Tag Mario series enemies Vacuum Dodge Charger Rembrandt The Inside Escape from New York Plastic Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Antimony Volleyball Fan (implement) Empire Burlesque Rich Mullins Quake III Arena FoxTrot My Little Pony Union Pacific Railroad KaBlam!
