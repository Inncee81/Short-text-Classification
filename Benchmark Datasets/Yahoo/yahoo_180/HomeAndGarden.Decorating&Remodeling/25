do anyone know how i can paint or dye a a canvas drop cloth to make it out of a rug i have been looking for a rug for about months to go with the theme in my front room but i could not find that perfect one so i thought of how can i get a rug to go with my them so i put my creative mind to work and decided to make a rug out of a canvas drop cloth which painters use to catch paint but my question is how can i dye of paint the canvas so that it will stay and if water is wasted on it the paint will not was away paint you will need to stretch the canvas out and apply a coat of gesso available at any art store make sure to coat the canvas evenly and well but do not let it get too thick once dry you can then use acrylic paint dye wash the canvas and then use fabric dye follow directions on the package i would suggest the first method as it will make the canvas water proof and easy to clean just do not apply the paint or gesso too heavy as it can flake off Textile manufacturing terminology Gesso Paint Textile manufacturing Canvas Painting Upholstery Leather Carpet Surrealist techniques Shroud of Turin Francis Bacon (painter) Watercolor painting Plastic Dry cleaning Art Casting Knitting Printed circuit board Cloth Clothing Panel painting Strap-on dildo Japanese tea ceremony Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres Indigo dye Hat Emily Kngwarreye Mattress Oil painting Edvard Munch Textile Wood carving Drawing Sento Acrylic paint Camouflage Frans Hals Table tennis Solar cell Light-emitting diode Abstract expressionism Tattoo Dinghy John Cage Rembrandt Kirby: Canvas Curse Piet Mondrian Soap Willem de Kooning Weaving Art forgery Han van Meegeren Impressionism Raphael Wassily Kandinsky Kimono Batik Cochineal Stucco Georges-Pierre Seurat Deck (ship) The Last Supper (Leonardo) Caravaggio J.
