electrician advice needed asap i got a new outdoor floodlight socket to replace the old socket and the old component had wires from the ceiling white and black going into each socket the new socket came with just one black and one white to tie into the existing wires of the house i clipped all four of the old wires and just connected the white w white and black w black giving me three of each tied up i turned the power back on and nothing any suggestions thanks now im not sure exactly how the wires were placed when you took it out and since im not the one taking it out and able to diagnose it what i would do is following what you do is take your neutral wires which are the white ones coming out of the ceiling and connect them together then take your black ones that are left and connect them one to the black and one to the white what is sounds like to me is it is connected to another circuit and that is completing a run in the wires to make sure that this is correct twist the white wires out of the ceiling and cap with wire nut seperate the remaing black wires and turn on the switch take a volt meter attach one to each wire and check to see if you are getting current if you are just connect the two black wires to the black and white wires from your floodlight again since not there to actually test the wires you could blow a breaker if the wires are not connected properly oh yeh i myself before doing any above would obviously check the bulb and also check and see if the new socket you bought works just cause its new doesn't mean it works you can use a test light or if you know what your doing just a regular light bulb just one wire on bottom contact and one on side doesn't matter really which wire goes where or you can take an old cord from a lamp or such and attach it to the wires on your new floodlight plug it in to a good working outlet this will let you know for sure if your light works or not Domestic AC power plugs and sockets BS 1363 Electrical wiring (UK) Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Incandescent light bulb Relay Three-phase electric power Fluorescent lamp Lighting Distribution board Dimmer Universal Serial Bus Jack plug National Electrical Code (US) Switch Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Stage lighting Electrician Power strip Oscilloscope Vacuum tube Ring circuit Overhead lines D-subminiature Thermostat Christmas lights Transformer Electrical wiring Light-emitting diode Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster X10 (industry standard) Circuit breaker Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Extension Cord Spark plug Compact fluorescent lamp Wire wrap Lineman (occupation) Enigma machine Seismic retrofit Mattress DIN connector Electricity meter Spark gap Series and parallel circuits Apollo Guidance Computer Socket Strap-on dildo Alternating current Ethernet Telephone exchange Ground (electricity) Ground and neutral Christmas tree Headlight Mains electricity TRS connector Solar cell Street light Digital circuit Earthing system Screw Fan (implement) SCART Security lighting Europlug Schuko Electric motor Automotive lighting Microphone Thermal power station Tire Apollo Command/Service Module Gas metal arc welding Common electrical adaptors in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom Impedance matching Printed circuit board Canon T90 RS-232 Motor oil PC motherboard Telephone switchboard Diode George Westinghouse Electrical element Aluminium Bubble Bobble Fencing Poker jargon Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Houseplant Textile manufacturing Television
