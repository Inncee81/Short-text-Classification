can someone recommend a range hood for a tall person i am ' and we are remodeling our kitchen i am going crazy trying to figure out what range hood to get so that a it works it's deep enough and powerful enough we are getting a jenn air pro gas range prg np b i can see what i'm cooking this will not be the case if the range hood is deep and mounted at above the range top c it costs less than i am not a certified kitchen designer but i would recommend contacting one there are certain requirements to meet code which you probably already know hoods need to be mounted at their lowest height to maximize capture while still complying with manufacturers recommended minimum height typically above the cooktop the depth of the cooktop should cover a minimum of of the rear burner and of the front burner i can see where you are having a problem you need just to clear the top of your head i don't know how high your ceiling is but if you raise the hood up you should increase the hood width and or depth to compensate get the highest cfm that you can while still being quiet so maybe get a wide it will go beyond your range on either side but consider trying to balance out you base cabinets you may have to have a custom hood made they have vents that are high to fit a custom i don't know if an island hood would work for you they are typically used for islands and pennisula's i would check with jenn air if you only considered the typical hood then other companies like viking gaggenau bosch and miele i don't know if you know any designers but you could try to get a letter to gain access to a design center to look around or if you are working with a kitchen designer they could get you a pass for the day but a high end kichen designer will know you are into the professional line of cooking good luck with your kitchen and maybe some kitchen designers will see your question Stove Tire Kitchen Tank Carburetor Bicycle lighting De Lorean DMC-12 Car handling Stairway Thermal power station Spark plug View camera Equine conformation Diving suit Bicycle frame Scramjet Fume hood Cookware and bakeware Turbocharger Solar power Portable stove Hard disk Ford Thunderbird Volleyball Solar cell Betting (poker) Tax Internal ballistics Elevator Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Diving cylinder Panzer I Incandescent light bulb Drill bit Scuba set Jet engine Floppy disk Classified information Motorcycle Sento 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Cascade Range Flag of India Panzer II Diving Automobile Dog agility Motor oil Fuel injection E85 Credit card Leica Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Airbag Mount St. Helens Wind power Extreme Programming Software testing Steam engine Mountain bike Microeconomics Headlight Chevrolet Camaro Appeal Wankel engine Mutual fund ISO 9000 Dodge Charger Airsoft Hot air balloon Refrigerator Grade (education) CPU cache Recumbent bicycle Table saw P-61 Black Widow Ocean thermal energy conversion Mount Pinatubo Eyepiece Bunsen burner Turbofan United States Postal Service Lake District Compact fluorescent lamp Natural monopoly Wayne Corporation Krag-J__rgensen Volcano Thermostat Mazda Miata Bicycle helmet Boeing 737
