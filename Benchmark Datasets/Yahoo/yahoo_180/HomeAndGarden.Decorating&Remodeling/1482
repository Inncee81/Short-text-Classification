is vinyl backspash ok and safe in te kitchen my husband and i would like to paint our kitchen and spice it up with a vinyl backsplash it's easy cheap and there is a lot to choose from is it safe behind the stove have you done it how was it thank you vinyl used anywhere has many adverse effects it is heat sensitive it will melt or warp near hot surfaces and emits toxic offgassing i would say it is both safer and more efficient to go with some other material depending on what quality of vinyl you use you might even have problems with it peeling off due to becoming warped from heat or excessive moisture Plastic Gramophone record Fire extinguisher Microwave oven Sewage treatment Stove Solar cell Heat Welding Incandescent light bulb Aluminium Disc brake Energy development Nuclear weapon design Casting Polyvinyl chloride Spark plug Nuclear power Mercury (element) Fluorescent lamp Cookware and bakeware Spacecraft propulsion Gas metal arc welding Coffee Corrosion Laser engraving Dairy Light-emitting diode Waste management Environmental concerns with electricity generation Vacuum tube Perfume Diving suit Solar power Tattoo Fire Vermicompost Temperature Pottery Pebble bed reactor Fusion power Brewery Kitchen Nuclear fallout Ammonia Nickel Slow cooker Nutrition Diode Friction Air conditioning Linoleum Langmuir probe Rebreather Wood fuel Coal Hydrogen economy Drill bit Sun Wok Wood Cold fusion Beryllium Trichloroethylene Water Carbon dioxide Plutonium Hand grenade Digital photography Thimerosal Jet engine Compiler optimization Bong Ice Protein Project Orion Loudspeaker Vinyl chloride Laser Gravity Iron Portable stove Red Hot Chili Peppers Cheese Japanese cuisine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sulfur Shell (projectile) Water purification Floppy disk Xenon Seismic retrofit Aspartame Galileo spacecraft Black hole Glass
