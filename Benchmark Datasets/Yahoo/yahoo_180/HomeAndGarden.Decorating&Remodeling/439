what happens if i dont pay for a bill that i don't feel is right my neighbors uncle put in his sprinkler system when we were having our driveway poured we called and told them what day they would need to have all of their lines marked they didn't mark it till a few days after the driveway was poured now my neighbors uncle said we buried the sprinkler heads and sent us a dollar bill when we asked him for an actual itemized bill he called us and threatend a lein against our house he would just yell and scream and not answer any of our questions what happens if we dont pay we want an itemized bill showing what we are paying for also our driveway is right on our property line so if anything the heads could be on our property first they can't put a lien against your house unless they supplied you with materials or labor for your house without filing suit first actually i suppose they could file a lien you can file anything you want if you are willing to sign the paper but it would be very easy for you to get it nullified based upon your description of the circumstances you do not have any liability here unless your driveway is on their property if it is not on their property why would you feel the need to have them mark the lines are their lines on your property for certain tell them to fly a kite no itemized bill no further discussion the worst that could happen is they could sue you which may require you to pay an attorney but they would loose again this is based upon your description of the situation Plame affair Public domain Roswell UFO incident Taxation in the United States Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Viva La Bam Fred Phelps 2005 trial of Michael Jackson SCO-Linux controversies Karl Rove Tort reform Tom DeLay Insurance Bill O'Reilly (commentator) The Game (rapper) Copyright Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fire Sprinkler The Price Is Right Intellectual property 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Slander and libel Concurrent estate The Amazing Race Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mortgage Medical malpractice Trademark Software patent debate Wal-Mart Milton H.
