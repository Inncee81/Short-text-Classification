can chair rail be too high my wife and i are putting chair rail in various places of our new home we have seen a few pictures of rooms in magazines in which the chair rail was quite a bit higher for instance about feet up on an foot ceiling than usual and liked the way it looked my dad told us that we probably shouldn't do this anyone have any opinions well it depends on what you want the chair rail for if it really is to protect the walls against chairs well in those rooms you need it at chair height but in the rooms where it's decorative don't call it chair rail call it decorative moulding and do exactly what you like putting it about a third of the way down would be pretty the proportion is nice exactly half way is kind of static so i would not do that Stairway Wood carving Chair Sento Scale model Poker jargon Skateboarding trick Theory of conduct Have I Got News For You Norbert Wiener Shaggy dog story Wilton House Milton H.
