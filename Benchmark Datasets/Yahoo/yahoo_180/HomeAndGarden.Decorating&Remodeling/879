i have a household organizational question we are going to be moving from a sqft house to a sqft house i have kids husband animals does anyone have any ideas how to make this work i know of my kids will be sharing a room but the rooms are pretty small so if you have any ideas on how to downsize and make it livable please share my husband is kinda freaking out about the size thanks it can work unfortunately at one point i had to go from a sq ft apt to a sq ft one not easy first off you have to be ruthless in purging and letting go of all items you don't really need and haven't used in the last year have a garage sale and make some money let the kids know what toys they sell etc they can keep the money and use it for the new house one huge item we never think of is photos especially with kids we have tons i had so many albums and boxes i scanned them all and burnt them on a disc copied the disc and gave a copy to a friend for safekeeping in case of fire good idea anyway and then i shredded the photos and sold the albums i can reprint photos any time i want them but sure freed up a heck of a lot of space i donated a lot of books to a charity shop clothes not worn in the past year were donated as well i sold what i could as far as extra plastic ware tupperware that i never really used and things like that i also got rid of a lot of knick knacks i kept mainly because they had been given to me by people i cared about that were now deceased that was hard to do but i had to realize that my memories of them are in my heart and not in a piece of crystal taking up precious room basically i kept the bare minimum of everything i sold my upright freezer knowing eventually i'd get another if you have one maybe you can sell yours and downsize your freezer as you go about the house packing be level headed and if you are having a very emotional day don't pack take a day off you won't get rid of things when you are like that you can keep a maybe category but eventually it must be packed and whatever goes has to go it's hard on everyone but the benefits of moving into a new house decorating anew and not dragging the photo frames we end up putting up over the years is worth it and once settled you should try to keep to the one in one out rule if you buy a new pair of boots get rid of another pair you have same with toys the kids get at christmas they should pick some they have had for a while and give them to children who could really use them that helps keep clutter to a minimum it is soooo sad when we have to do this but unfortunately life deals us hands we don't always want maybe with money made at the garage sale you can buy rubbermaid storage containers for closets under the beds etc use all room you have and get high bookshelves for the children's rooms good luck in your purging and your move i wish you well in your new home the key is to make it an adventure and something to look forward to not dread Poker jargon New York Knicks Theory of conduct The Star Wars Holiday Special RuneScape quests Floppy disk Animal Crossing UK Singles Chart Garth Brooks Plastic The Apprentice 3 Time Out of Mind Wheel of Fortune Star Trek Customizable Card Game RISC Wayne Corporation Japanese tea ceremony About a Boy Pitaten Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Windows XP Blood (computer game) Compact disc IBM PC compatible Surveillance Monopoly (game) Friends K' Sento Gaia Online TLC My Little Pony Atari 8-bit family The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) Calvin and Hobbes Hard disk Johnny 5 Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Sega Dreamcast Pottery Bon Jovi Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Contender (television series) Social rule Sin City Bulk vending RuneScape economy Beavis and Butt-head Betting (poker) Knife G.I.
