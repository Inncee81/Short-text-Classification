i like the new oil rubbed bronze faucets would it look ok to use them on a stainless steel kitchen sink the kitchen will have stainless steel appliances and mahogany cabinets with the oil rubbed bronze hardware i put in an antique copper faucet a stainless steel sink and stainless double ovens and cooktop some of the cabinets are cherry and some are glazed cream some of the cabinets have copper hardware some have bronze all of the different things really add interest to the room it looks fantastic and the place where i bought the cabinets actually asked me to come to work as a designer because they liked it so much so you're not just taking my word for it the sink does not have to match the faucet at all because when you're standing back you don't see into the sink just the lovely faucet if you're really into the matchy matchy you can get a bronzed drain and basket but i thought that would stick out too much so i just went with stainless be fearless it will look great Cookware and bakeware Kitchen Tap (valve) Knife Steel Sento Stove Passenger car Dishwasher Washroom Drill bit Bronze Glass Copper Jewish cuisine Plumbing fixture Cruising (maritime) Dairy Thermal power station Casting Brewery Repouss__ and chasing Customs and etiquette of Japan Internal ballistics In-N-Out Burger Vacuum Welding Bacon Blacksmith Aerial (dance move) Salad Fingers Professional wrestling match types Nickel Siphon World War Three (Doctor Who) Retronym Frankfurt kitchen In The Groove (game) Fossil fuel power plant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Major appliance Japanese toilet Refrigerator Screw Things in Atlas Shrugged Axe Bass guitar Tavistock Timpani Aliens of London RuneScape skills Tellurium De Lorean DMC-12 Empire Earth Wok Appliance Turquoise Hydrochloric acid Electric motor Vinegar Basic English Hryvnia Donald Rumsfeld Humphrey Bogart Bidet Culture of Korea Korean cuisine Blood on the Tracks Guitar Nintendo GameCube Memorial Stadium, Clemson RuneScape quests Hansel und Gretel Harry Harrison Sears Holdings Corporation Dinghy Motor oil W.
