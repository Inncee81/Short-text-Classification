thin semi transparent glaze over bath tiles to give them a slightly different tint we're re tiling our bathroom and picked out most of the tiles but we also want a particular accent tile and we found sheets of the square tiles that we like only they are slightly more gray in tint than we would like these are the thinner thick type tiles made in china like you'd find at lowes or home depot and they don't have a gloss finish it's like a beige stone type finish it's bearable it doesn't look that bad but i'm wondering if it is possible to get and apply a non glossy surface glaze over the tiles to give them a slightly more yellow tint to match the rest of the wall tiles something that wouldn't need to be fired afterwards just applied on with sponge brush and it basically leaves a thin permanent stain on the surface is there anything like that i don't think you're gonna find what you're looking for most if not all ceramic tiles are already glazed and fired and are non porous so will not accept a new finish epoxy paint will stick to ceramic or anything else it touches but i don't think that look is gonna work for you and it's potentially messy if you can work with the other surfaces in the room to change the gray tone to a warmer tone ie painted surfaces etc you may find that the tile is fine don't be afraid to paint the ceiling a soft warm color that's a great way to change the overall tone of a room esp a bathroom light bounces off of all the surfaces and reflects the color Glass Pottery Glaze Wallpaper group Paint Casting Cookware and bakeware Tile Brush Drawing Knife Nacre Dundas Square Tessellation Bomberman Color Wood carving Architecture of the California missions Violin Ammolite Ceramics Vitreous enamel Korean pottery Masonry Drill bit Korean tea ceremony Turquoise Japanese tea ceremony Spark plug Wassily Kandinsky Color theory Volleyball Alhambra Seismic retrofit Piet Mondrian Kitchen Mahjong Window Solar power Plastic Leaf Ra (board game) Tofu Diamond Uranium Diamond enhancement Asbestos Carpet Abydos, Egypt Combine (Half-Life 2) Welding Carbon nanotube Bassoon Textile manufacturing terminology Bathroom Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Material properties of diamond King Khalid International Airport Lead Impressionism Mirror Rendering (computer graphics) Electrophysiology Circuit design Bong Metal leaf Tempera Cubic zirconia Fan (implement) Blood Simple Brewery Table tennis Equine conformation Carburetor Glacier Fiberglass Sydney Opera House Korean art The Legend of Zelda series enemies Blood (computer game) Mattress Varnish Gong Jan van Goyen Liquid crystal display Genericized trademark St Albans Cathedral
