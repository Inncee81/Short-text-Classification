ikea wardrobes pax collection hi there im looking to purchase some wardrobes from ikea in the pax collection basically you choose the base then the doors how you want the interior and then little things like the handles etc does anyone have these are they strong ax we bought a triple pax wardrobe a few months ago i must say i'm impressed and pleasantly surprised at the quality i half expected it to wobble but its quite sturdy we chose drawers and a shelf with rail and the mirror doors its a bit scarey waking up in the morning and i don't think its very fung shui but it makes the room appear bigger and stops the wardrobe dominating the room plus you don't have to buy door handle as they come with the doors quite simple to put together too PaX The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Shaggy dog story Feng Shui IKEA Upholstery Swingout Ethical consumerism TARDIS Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Craps Ocean's Twelve Poker jargon Mattress Wayne Corporation Grace Cossington Smith NX bit Television in the United States 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sham Shui Po District Vivian Stanshall KCR The Shining (film) Bretton Woods system Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Passenger car I Want to Hold Your Hand Blur Furniture Star Trek Customizable Card Game World Wrestling Entertainment Japanese tea ceremony Closet Francis Bacon (painter) Milton H.
