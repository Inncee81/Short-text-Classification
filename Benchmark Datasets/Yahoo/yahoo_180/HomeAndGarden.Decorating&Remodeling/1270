we are removing wallpaper by steaming it we plan to paint the walls is there anything that needs to be done to the walls before we begin painting thanks from the professional painter in my living room first note he giggled when i read this to him now his answer is i hope that your walls were properly primed painted before this wallpaper was hung if it was you need to take a sponge a plastic scraper use tide laundry detergent about part detergent to parts water apply with sponge use plastic scraper as needed wash the wall really really good to remove paste residue the tide residue is safe to pain over so use tide allow wall to dry thoroughly a day or two if this is a bathroom try to avoid steaming showers for a couple of days to allow drying then lightly sand the wall with grit sandpaper suggest to re prime again if bathroom use oil base after the appropriate cure time you can then paint if your walls were not properly primed then unfortunatly by steaming off wallpaper you have just opened up a can of worms you will notice gauges in your walls sheet rock mud the paper that covers the drywall gypsum will most likely be peeling heavily damaged because of the removal of the wallpaper if you are in this situation the suggestion would then be to hire a professional if you have further questions e mail me i will ask raymond the pro in my house whos work has been featured in southern living magazine Wallpaper Sewage treatment Casting Drywall Fecal incontinence Dishwasher Sandpaper Seismic retrofit Lionel Corporation Tattoo Laundry detergent Paint Car washing techniques Menstrual cup Washing machine Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Woodworking Painting Genericized trademark Basement Cruising (maritime) Japanese toilet Sea level rise Kitchen Toilet paper Sento Wallpaper group Hydrotherapy Soap Drawing Sponge Knife Gypsum Printed circuit board Upholstery Laundry Printmaking Vermicompost Wilton House Pottery Fire extinguisher Urticaria Acne Animal Crossing Essential oil Solar power Chatsworth House Tide Paper Wok Tofu Fire fighting Bathroom Multiple chemical sensitivity Thermal power station Toilet Procter & Gamble Motor oil Sulfuric acid Sauna Tobacco Anchor Scientology beliefs and practices Shroud of Turin Textile manufacturing Masking tape Sewage Renewable energy Compost Industrial wastewater treatment Coffee Soldering Leather Kosher foods Sterilization (microbiology) The One With the East German Laundry Detergent E85 Glacier Stomach cancer Floppy disk Blood Simple Dymaxion house Carlsbad Caverns National Park Computer virus Masonry Work breakdown structure Delaware Basin Nuclear fallout Eczema Dormitory Oil painting The Shining (film) Brazing
