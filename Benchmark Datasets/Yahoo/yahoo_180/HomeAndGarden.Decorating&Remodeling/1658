i have a picture that is in a frame coverned in glass it was put in a storage bin and had sat there for several years and the glass broke and now when i try to pull the glass off of the pic the picture sticks to the glass is there anyway to seperate the photo from the glass without damage to the pic is this a regular photograph if so you may be able to wet the photograph to get it loose from the glass if it is a print from some other type of process water may be a bad idea but it sounds like it may be a lost cause good luck Stereoscopy Digital photography Photography Photographic film Textile manufacturing Patricia Ford Photograph Fiberglass View camera Camera Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Naval mine Luck Screen-printing JPEG Compact disc Technicolor Philosophy of space and time Edward S.
