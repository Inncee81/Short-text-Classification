re bath company utah franchise any opinions from those who have dealt with this company i signed a contract yesterday with them to install a liner and new shower walls the contract is for almost five thousand dollars i put down the contract allows for a three business day buyers right to cancel i'm having some serious buyers remorse at this point since i gave them down can't find them listed anywhere with bbb they advertise heavily in the utah area so i'm sure they are legit it just seems after the fact that this a lot of money for what is essentially a bath liner and new shower walls the price range is about right depending on the options you picked there are main companies doing this type of remodel luxury bath re bath bath fitter luxury bath is the highest quality by a long shot it also has a product called microban microban is a antimicrobial product that actually kills mold and mildew it also comes with the best warranty www luxurybath com re bath would be my second choice the reason being is they like luxury bath have a one piece dog leg the area on the wall in front off the tub the dog leg goes from the top of the tub rail to the floor the reason i would not recommend bath fitter is because of the dog leg this is the area that is most prone to leaking and they piece it together here as far as other options there is tearing it out and starting over ceramic tile re glazing with tearing it out you will be forced to use a fiberglass tub which is very porous making it very difficult to clean for those that are reading this thinking how nice your fiberglass tub is go in there and rub your fingers over it it may look o k but it will be greasy that s because the porous material is literally sucking the soap scum in fiberglass surrounds are also known for cracking and being spongy when you stand in them ceramic tile is definitely attractive but unfortunately the grout is the weak point after all its sand and sand sucks in the water making it a perfect surface for mold and mildew grout also needs maintenance once a month but before you do the maintenance you need to clean it with a toothbrush re glazing is when they paint the tub this is more of a band aid if your trying to sell the home but don t care how it will look in months to year it also doesn't address the walls or fixtures Casting Pottery Strap-on dildo Drill bit Sento Plastic Violin Customs and etiquette of Japan Mattress Textile manufacturing Ceramics Bulk vending Fecal incontinence Equine conformation Glass Asbestos Spark plug Microeconomics Toilet Contract Wallpaper group Roof Social rule Bong Swimming Warranty United States Postal Service Soap Hamster Dishwasher Dymaxion house Privatization Loudspeaker The Apprentice 2 King Khalid International Airport Gay bathhouse Seismic retrofit Diving Sears Holdings Corporation Dairy De Lorean DMC-12 National Kidney Foundation Singapore Bathroom Upholstery Lionel Corporation Naruto jutsu Fast bowling Option Tooth enamel Wood Pebble bed reactor Taikyoku shogi Economics Washroom Volleyball Wind turbine Masonry Beretta 92F/FS Richard Chase Skateboarding trick Diamond Ra (board game) Heinkel He 100 Internet fraud Let's Make a Deal Annuity Brewery M60 machine gun Ford Thunderbird Childbirth Plumbing fixture Heinkel He 112 Plame affair Mahjong The Inside Solar power Chevrolet Corvette Indus Valley Civilization Los Angeles Clippers RuneScape quests Professional wrestling slang Knife Trademark Cremation Make money fast Magnetism Citigroup Boat building
