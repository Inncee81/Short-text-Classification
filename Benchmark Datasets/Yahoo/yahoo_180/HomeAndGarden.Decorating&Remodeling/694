okay so i just painted my room a pale yellow i don't know what color scheme and decorations i should get i m redecorating so my room is blank just yellow walls i just need help on what colors i should get like comforter ya know please hellp mee pictures please the first thing i would suggest is to identify what your style is i love soft florals with pale yellow i'd go shopping for a comforter and see what interests you personally i'd look for one with a soft yellow background with white as a contrast and small to medium size flowers of many different colors then i'd use those colors as accents in my room deep pink mauve light green a deeper yellow all those will give you plenty of color contrast and a restful bedroom i also like the idea of using the black accents such as candleholders for good contrast the important thing is to find what you like best place to start is the comforter and go from there Color Blue Light-emitting diode Buckingham Palace Drawing Diamond Wood Color blindness Wassily Kandinsky Flower Lighting Pysanka Wood carving The Wall Red Vincent van Gogh Yellow Potato Human skin color Rococo Cascading Style Sheets Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Grace Cossington Smith Vehicle registration plate Discus (fish) Hair color Chatsworth House Koi Sodium Blenheim Palace Rose Wilton House Plame affair Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Technicolor Piet Mondrian Political colour Gamut Colours, standards and guidons Funeral Leopard Chromium Super Chief James McNeill Whistler Black Sulfur Floristry CMYK color model Chinese architecture Primary color Black (people) Alhambra Clover Welsh language Gold Color space Milton H.
