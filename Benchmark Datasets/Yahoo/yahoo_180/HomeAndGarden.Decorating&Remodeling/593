decorating help i'm planning how to do my room and i've decided already that i want a metal bed you know chrome platinum brass yeah and i have a bed in mind although i can change it it's chrome platinum but i don't know what furniture to match with it i'm hopinh i can get something with metal accents so i don't throw off the metal bed with having too many wooden things and i want my room to be blue so the furniture must match with that i know a lot about decoraint but when it comes to myself i'l completely baffled help if someone could recommend a good blue for me that's not too light i hate light and not too dark i hate too dark or furniture to match my bed preferrably the chest nightstand dresser and mirror thank you there's a really cool blue grey colour that behr paint makes called rhino it's available from home depot there's no rule written to say you can't mix wooden items with metal and if done right it can look amazing i would recommend darker stains though including maple and darker brushed chrome in my opinion would look awesome on your bed with maple dresser etc with brushed chrome knobs on the drawers dark denim blue curtains would look great you may need to add some warm colour accents to balance the room like throw pillows or blankets Furniture Upholstery Color theory Lighting Color Professional wrestling match types Shaggy dog story Colours, standards and guidons Milton H.
