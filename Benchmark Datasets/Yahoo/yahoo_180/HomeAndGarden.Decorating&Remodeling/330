how do i mask ugly tile we have decided to lease out our home and rent something smaller for a year the home we picked is cute but the master bathroom has tile and the cap rail on the tile is alternating pastel colors what can i do to hide this for two years while we rent without re tiling the bathroom some decorating shows paint the tiles but if you are only renting this might not be a good idea you could ask the landlord if it's ok with them check your paint store they have paint that will cover tiles and not peel off there are wallcoverings that look like tile maybe you could find one that has tiles the same shape as yours and just cover them Tile Tessellation Leasehold estate L.
