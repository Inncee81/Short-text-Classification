how can i keep my bedroom looking neater i am painting my room greeen and white stripes does anyone have any ideas to make it look less busy with the stripes and all i'd appriceate it thx try putting the stripes only on one or two walls and then painting the others solid green this will give you an accent but not take over the walls or try doing a tone on tone thing using just one color first paint the wall with a flat paint and then mark your stripes and us a gloss for them this is a very good look and it tends to tame the stripes down a bit another thing you can do is just do the stripe on the bottom of the wall and use a chair rail or wall paper border around the room and paint upper part a solid color Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Billiards Colours, standards and guidons Paint BNSF Railway Flag of Azerbaijan The White Stripes Lane The Wall Bassoon Wood carving Rococo Eight ball Camouflage Rail Blue Lighting Heraldry British Rail Class 317 Wassily Kandinsky British Rail Class 47 Dodge Charger Flag of India Flag of Italy British Rail Class 86 Skinhead Tone (linguistics) Drawing Flag of the United States Chatsworth House Blue Light-emitting diode Hamster Traditional animation British Rail Class 50 THX Stucco Casting Striped bass The Warriors Leopard Southern Pacific Railroad Brush Shelby Mustang Koi Door Flag of Belarus Japanese tea ceremony Doom engine Jack White (musician) Tooth enamel Alhambra Union Pacific Railroad Drill bit Clarinet Molding (decorative) Rainbow flag Taekwondo Georges-Pierre Seurat Milton H.
