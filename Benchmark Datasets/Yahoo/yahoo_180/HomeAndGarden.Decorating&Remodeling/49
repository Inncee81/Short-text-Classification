what type of flooring real wood or laminate i have just moved in to a brand new property and there is no flooring the lounge is currently concrete and i am trying to decide whether to have laminate or real wood flooring what are the pro and cons of real wood and laminate also the skirting board is mdf and has been glued to the wall will this be a messy job to remove my worries are that the plaster will be damaged when removing the skirting board any feedback would be greatly appreciated laminates are less expensive easier to put down and wear better assuming you don't get the cheap stuff wood has a nicer tone is warmer and can be sanded so you can get a longer life if your floor is cement to lay real wood you will probably have to lay a subfloor vapour barrier and cushion to stop the dampness from warping the wood as well you will need the subfloor in order to provide a nailing support for the wood you can lay a floating laminate floor on top of a combined barrier and cushion right on the cement if you use laminate because it is thinner leave the skirting board base board pull off the quarter round lay the floor right up against the skirt with the clearance of course and reinstall new quarter round since the laminate is usually inch or so you don't need to pull off the old skirt Upholstery Seismic retrofit Textile manufacturing Stairway Violin Mattress Straw-bale construction Wood Fire fighting Billiards Equine conformation Table saw Diving suit Light-frame construction Tank Boat building Stucco Screw Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Glass Baseball Cello Skateboarding trick Plastic Hamster Plaster Naval mine Skateboard Mouse (computing) Guitar Bicycle frame Clinker (boat building) Dundas Square Plywood Temporal bone Diving Printed circuit board Wind turbine Golf Wire wrap Aerial (dance move) Combine (Half-Life 2) Ridge Route Piano Christmas tree Knots Landing Lawn mower Guqin Disc brake Casting Dinghy IPod Strap-on dildo Floppy disk Chlorophyta Tire Platform framing Hard disk Roof Concrete Langstroth hive St Albans Cathedral The Wall Buckingham Palace Radio controlled airplane Panama Canal Locks Undergarment Social rule Architecture of the California missions Squash (sport) Passenger car Acoustic guitar Drywall Woodworking Great Teacher Onizuka West Side Highway M16 (rifle) Reinforced concrete Timpani Volleyball Spidey Super Stories Basement Manual transmission Timber framing Naruto jutsu Transformer Menstrual cup Snooker Swimming pool Ship model Clarinet 64-bit Blood (computer game) Pavement (material) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets MapleStory
