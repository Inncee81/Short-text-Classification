i'm renting so i can't do anything permanent and i've heard of those stick on things but being an artist myself i'd like to create my own fake stained glass look that would still allow light through the windows and can be easily removed later any ideas easy and fun project you can buy paint for this purpose and leading paint at the craft store you transfer the design to the glass with a sharpie marker then use the leading paint to create the lead lines and fill in the lines with the stained glass paint if you are an artist you will create a beautiful design and will probably fool anyone looking at the window into thinking it really is stained glass when you move simply razor blade the design off of the window and wash it off no permanent damage ps being a landlord i would have no problem with this project being done in one of my rentals and might even leave it there if it was good enough Upholstery Casting Louis Comfort Tiffany Paint Sharpie (marker) Knife Drawing Floppy disk Glass Grand Central Terminal Computer virus Renting Ultraviolet Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mercury 4 Textile manufacturing Art Home repair Stereoscopy Door Staining (biology) Screen-printing John Hancock Tower Extreme Programming Mouse (computing) Lawn mower Genericized trademark Traditional animation Alcoholics Anonymous Stopping e-mail abuse Fenway Park Confidence trick Harry Clarke File system Naval mine Fan (implement) Anchor Bong IBM PC compatible Pysanka Gothic art GunZ The Duel Edward Burne-Jones Arianne The Apprentice 3 Intelligent design Glenn Wayne Corporation Lighting Shroud of Turin Monopoly (game) Carl Barks Coffee ITunes Plastic RuneScape skills Wood carving Hand grenade Surveillance Fluorescent lamp St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque) RISC Pools of Darkness Vacuum tube Computer Hereford Cathedral Ontological argument Marc Chagall Blood Simple Soldering Digital rights management Mach kernel Wilton House Airsoft The Time Machine Lionel Corporation About a Boy ASCII art Circuit design Wassily Kandinsky Tent Timeline of alternative rock Pretty Good Privacy Crop circle John LaFarge De Lorean DMC-12 Mattress Solar power Leasing The Shining (film) St. Peter's Basilica Porsche 993 Campfire Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Potton William Morris The Young Ones (TV series) Doom engine
