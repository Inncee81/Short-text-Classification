assimilating laminate flooring i bought traffic master laminate flooring at the big orange box yesterday thursday today is the one day for a while that i will have the time to install it it says to let it sit in the room for hours now i understand that is the best thing to do i'm just curious if anybody has installed it within hours of bringing it home and if so what were the results i assumed it had no wood product in it when i bought it so there wouldn't be any shrinkage or expansion but i guess the fiberboard material inside will adjust a bit if i do this what kind of problem could i expect to see and if there was wouldn't it be somewhat easy to fix given it's not glued or nailed the area is a small hallway about sq ft it is a very humid area it is currently sitting in there stacked up any response is greatly appreciated thanks won't speak to the choice of retailer or product as we are not a big fan of the product but as far as acclimation we cannot advise you to anything the manufacturer does not approve of however on many occasions we have installed laminate flooring in humid conditions without acclimation the real possible result is the floor may expand more than usual if you have it locked together properly the entire floor will move in unison my advice is simply slightly increase the size of your expansion area at the walls be sure your trim will still cover it and then if the floor takes on additional moisture after you install it it will have plenty of room to move and no harm done good luck support us and watch us grow at http www flooringprofessor com Poker jargon Upholstery Microeconomics Drill bit Solar power Hard disk Wood Fast bowling Explosive material Equine conformation Hamster Violin Floppy disk Betting (poker) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Inventory Inflation Double bass Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Mattress Radio controlled airplane Cello Manifold Tire Table saw Weather forecasting The Brady Bunch Illegal drug trade Theory of conduct Solar cell Casting Time Out of Mind Menstrual cup Piano Capital accumulation Tank Bad Wolf Carnivorous plant Japanese tea ceremony Japanese toilet Star Trek Customizable Card Game Economics Bretton Woods system Humphrey Bogart Free trade Haibane Renmei Thermal power station American and British English differences Horseshoe Eaton's Domestic rabbit Straw-bale construction Economy of Russia Volleyball Gramophone record G-Man (Half-Life) Chair Rise of Nations Handloading De Lorean DMC-12 X86 assembly language Fire fighting Shaggy dog story RISC Pump It Up Comanche Pottery Keynesian economics Guitar Bulk vending Blood (computer game) Plastic Jumpstart 3rd Grade HVAC Parquetry Loudspeaker IBM PC compatible Otakon Wind power Ethernet Professional wrestling match types Star Wars: Galaxies Craps Alcohol fuel 24 Hours of Le Mans Wal-Mart Stairway Clarinet Piccolo Junior Saga MTR Nuclear power Modem Textile manufacturing Artificial neural network Tesco
