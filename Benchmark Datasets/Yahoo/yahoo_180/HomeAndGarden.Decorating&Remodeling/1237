painting a bedroom i want to paint our bedroom and i need a little help my bedroom is a long rectangle my bed sits under the only window and partially blocks it so i can't do alot for window treatment should i paint all walls one color or should i have an accent wall with a different shade the color is a honey yellow if so which one should be an accent wall i can't paint the ceiling floors are hardwood i appreciate any help anyone can offer i wasn't asking anyones opinion on my color choice yellow is not to busy if you pick the right shade i also can't move my bed its huge queen size captains bed and only fits in the one spot i think you should think about how you walk into the room and take that into consideration about which wall to paint an accent color just from the sounds of it the wall with the window and your bed up against it seems like a good possibility for the accent color it will make that part of your room the architecural detail and focal point in my old home i had a weird shaped master it was like you walked in at a diaganol on one corner of the room it had a curved wall to your left when you walked in i painted that curved wall to my left and the adjoing wall to the right in the deeper accent color and the farther adjoining walls a different brighter color it was neat it's like the room opened itself up going from the darker to lighter again i think it's how your room's entry is situation that's why i mentioned you should take that into consideration another suggestion would be to paint the accent color on of the walls at a wainscotting type of heighth and then paint the th wall that same accent color or do you've go a lot of options best of luck toyou Lighting Buckingham Palace Wilton House Xanadu House Microsoft Paint Chatsworth House Upholstery Billiards Passenger car Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Wallpaper group Out-of-body experience Basement Molding (decorative) Opportunity rover Abbey Bubble Bobble Drawing Wood carving Glossary of partner dance terms Dodge Charger The Ersatz Elevator Light-emitting diode Sento Piccolo Junior Saga Stairway Bungalow Norbert Wiener Sundial Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Mario series enemies Grace Cossington Smith Rococo Color theory Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Chaos Emerald Sistine Chapel Piet Mondrian Equine conformation Kitchen Christiansborg Palace The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Customs and etiquette of Japan Wassily Kandinsky Joel and Ethan Coen Unicode Palladian architecture Sicilian Baroque Malaria Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance Impressionism Irish Houses of Parliament Traditional animation Rathfarnham Hangul Raphael Rooms The Shining (film) Eggerland series Volleyball Salad Fingers Bratislava Castle Blenheim Palace Kedleston Hall Leica The Haunted Mansion Frans Hals Diacritic Drill bit G-Man (Half-Life) Carpet Quake III Arena Tile McMansion Diamond cut Pennsylvania Railroad Propylaea Comanche Atari 8-bit family Columbine High School massacre Masonry Snooker Cheating in Counter-Strike Autostereogram Saxophone Keyboard layout Palazzo Vecchio Classical music era Camouflage Jumpstart 3rd Grade Projection screen Mies Sin City Human skin color Compton Wynyates Leaf Color The Dalek Invasion of Earth The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
