can a slide in range have a backsplash behind it i like the look of the slide in range as opposed to a freestanding or drop in however i am concerned about the backspash we are planning on a new countertop with a inch backsplash and then tile between the countertop and the cabinet does a slide in have any counterspace behind it or can it to allow for a uniform backsplash along the whole back wall if not then i'll either do a drop in or think about a countertop without the inch and just do tile thanks so there is countertop behind it you'll be able to have one continuous piece of backsplash with a slide in however if you're talking about countertop that's a different story that will depend on the dimensions of the range vs the countertop see pics below with countertop http www bybb com images products fes eb jpg without countertop http www frigidaire com images images models plgs ec plgs ec jpg they're both different in countertops behind them but they both have seamless backsplashes HyperText Transfer Protocol Drill bit Digital photography Wallpaper group Asbestos Stereoscopy Arcade cabinet Uniform Resource Locator Dishwasher Plastic Tessellation Trombone PlayStation 3 STS-114 Slide rule Symmetry Softball Nacre Table saw ImageMagick Sega Saturn Mattress Kitchen United States Air Force Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Fractal Bass guitar Beretta 92F/FS V-2 rocket Sydney Opera House GLOCK Flute Friction Combat Mission (computer game series) Uniform Resource Identifier Super Nintendo Entertainment System Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace Mercury Cougar World Wide Web Erotic art in Pompeii The Brady Bunch Mosaic Ra (board game) Tai shogi Curling Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Floppy disk PlayStation Portable Patricia Ford Nautilus (Verne) L-system Alps O scale Harmonica California Wood Super Mario Kart Harley-Davidson DaimlerChrysler smart Stairway Violin Computer animation Skateboarding trick Dundas Square Web server View camera Final Fantasy II Pixel JPEG Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow Pottery Web crawler In-N-Out Burger Lighting Common Unix Printing System Kimberly-Clark Corporation Geographic information system Seismic retrofit Cellular automaton Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Microwave oven Light-frame construction Alhambra Software engineering Opportunity rover Traditional animation Meccano Euclidean plane isometry Wood fuel SR-71 Blackbird Xbox 360 Refrigerator Guitar Adobe ATLAS experiment Game controller Electronic commerce Antenna (radio)
