vinyl planking verses laminate floors my husband and i are planning on putting in new floors we would love to have hardwood floors but we have small dogs and it is not recommended so we have narrowed our choices down to vinyl or laminate both have many beautiful selections pro's con's please note we live in texas have no children at home we are not looking to move anytime in the near future and i am all about easy maintenance i dont know what kind of dogs you have but i have oak floors and large dogs and i have no problem with my floors i love them i have no idea why they told you that i also own a cleaning service and while laminate floors look okay when first installed after a while they begin to look like laminate floors the panel joints will show they do scratch they do wear and lose their shine every house that we clean with laminate floors has scratches or wear marks under the chairs at the dining room tables when i hear a customer is putting these in i cringe one of my customers just put in a pecan floor over a year ago and its still beautiful she also has dogs hers is individual tongue and groove slats and comes in other woods also if cost is a factor have you considered tile i can only suggest wood tile or carpet you are wasting you money with laminates and vinyl everyone i know is disappointed in them after a year or two except when they have them in rooms that they dont use Upholstery Kitchen Gramophone record Sento Wood Drill bit Chair Vacuum cleaner Mattress Wind turbine Carpet McMansion Lighting Table saw Domestic rabbit Temporal bone Chatsworth House Dog agility Scottish Parliament Building Japanese tea ceremony Dog Parquetry Plastic Stairway Basement Elevator Japanese toilet Asbestos Randomness Ship model Professional wrestling match types Wood carving Fancy rat United States House of Representatives Transformer Neighbours Bulk vending Energy development Home improvement Cat Boston College Door Radio controlled airplane A Day in the Life Shaggy dog story Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Hamster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Brady Bunch Wilton House Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Linoleum PLATO Berkshire Hathaway Equine conformation Buckingham Palace Cello Jumpstart 3rd Grade Clothing Fall Out Boy Plywood New Morning Inflation Poker jargon Seismic retrofit Passenger car Pittsburgh Steelers Solar power Harrow School Simone Weil Combine (Half-Life 2) Health insurance The Dalek Invasion of Earth Woodworking RuneScape quests Jennifer Lopez Acoustic guitar Glacier Tram Montgomery Burns Fricative consonant Wal-Mart Piano Congress of the United States Epcot Disc jockey Glass Act of Parliament Xanadu House Tai shogi Animal Crossing Blonde on Blonde Epoxy The Apprentice 2 Canadian Senate Cable television Oral sex The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy
