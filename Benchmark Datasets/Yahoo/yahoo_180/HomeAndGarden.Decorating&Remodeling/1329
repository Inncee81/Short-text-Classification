having remodeling work done while working full time we have a few more remodeling jobs to finish in our pre owned new home i just got a full time job so we now have the money to hire someone to do the master bathroom however i'm a bit baffled by the logistics if both my husband and i are working full time do we just give the keys to the contractor and let him handle things we are both a bit leery to just let strangers have access to our home and to do work when we are not here to supervise and make sure things are done to our specifications that is a bit of a problem having been in the design industry for over years i can say not being there to supervise construction work often results in unanticipated surprises if you hired a general contractor or designer he she is supposed to be the one supervising all of the subcontractors unfortunately when contractors juggle several jobs at the same time there are long stretches of time that the sub contractors could be working in your home unattended i never let that happen either in client's homes nor in my home although the contractor's i hired were licensed bonded and insured disasters still happen things get broken subs misinterpret instructions etc a few suggestions have a friend or relative drop in from time to time to check the progress of the work i do this for my neighbors who are working and having contractors remodel their home i never come by at the same time so that they cannot become secure with a schedule i get to know who is working there and have an idea from the neighbor's what work is supposed to be done and by when i phone my neighbor's just as i would a client right while i am there if any problems arise if there is any way you can also drop by at lunch it will keep the contractors on their toes too at the very least maintain telephone contact twice daily with the general contractor to make certain that the schedule is being maintained and problems that arise are resolved in a timely manner generally speaking theft isn't your biggest problem i've seen unauthorized use of the telephone to make long distance international calls in my own home when i left to pick up lunch in appreciation for the workers remodeling my own kitchen lesson learned protect yourself do not leave personal documents valuables or access to anything you cannot risk being violated Insurance Classified information Construction Wal-Mart Plame affair Social rule CPU cache Ocean's Twelve Karl Rove Avenue Q Modem Public domain Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Windows 2000 CPU design Medical prescription Password Identity theft Telephone numbering plan Space Shuttle program Crew Exploration Vehicle Intellectual property Business continuity planning Unemployment Wi-Fi Attorney at Law Software engineering Theory of conduct Reliability engineering Digital rights management Pretty Good Privacy Probation officer 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Call centre Roswell UFO incident Driver's license Bank fraud Property (ownership right) British national identity card Capitalism Year 2000 problem Taxation in the United States Matthew Brettingham Knots Landing EastEnders Domestic violence Air traffic controller L.
