how do i get latex paint to stick on oil paint i'm painting the walls in my house and apparently the previous owner used oil based paint besides sanding which i'm not crazy about doing because it makes the wall rough is there anyway to make the latex stick better thanks you can use one coat of kilz primer pita but easier than sanding without the primer even though it appears to be sticking now it will not adhere very well over time and will roll off of the wall everytime it is bumped or scratched Paint Casting Stucco Handloading LaTeX Volleyball Primer (paint) Menstrual cup Leather Strap-on dildo Condom Chewing gum Radio controlled airplane Pottery Plastic Primer (molecular biology) Anal sex Vitreous enamel Arcade cabinet Internal ballistics Amateur telescope making Rubber Nunchaku Gesso Paper marbling Manicure Kirby: Canvas Curse Aerial (dance move) Painting Sundial Tile Fenway Park Opportunity rover Syd Barrett Bread Compact disc Carpet Golf Domus Aurea Lead Doctor (Doctor Who) Craps Indianapolis 500 Drill bit Rembrandt Shot of Love John Collier Polymerase chain reaction Printmaking Heraldry Happy Tree Friends Glaze Dinghy Billiards Sand casting Motor oil Vulcanization Safe sex Sequencing Chinese painting Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Soap Super Mario 64 The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Roomba Blue Man Group Ice hockey Explosive material Mattress Golf glossary Eczema Gansu Jennifer Connelly Marie Vorobieff Wok Friction Goldfinger Norbert Wiener Tire Fire fighting Egyptian mythology Toilet paper Oil painting Ork (Warhammer 40,000) D__ner kebab Sand art and play Kottayam Heinkel He 100 Brush Minor league baseball Greatest Hits: My Prerogative Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Masonry Model aircraft Art forgery Caracas Alaskan husky Club (weapon)
