is it stuck in our blood the very people who say they are not prejudiced have a little in them lol whoa what is stuck in our blood let me rephrase your question the way i think you meant to ask it is it really in our blood still sounds dracula ish to declare ourselves not possesing any prejudice and yet exhibit prejudice in our actions anyway whew if that was what you meant then my answer is yes all of us have prejudices it is best to not say anything when in conversation about prejudice at all let me cite an example an accident on the road in front of my house i did not see what happened just heard the zooming speeding howl of a car where the accelerator was maxed out and then kaboom crashing sounds i see a young boy on the ground holding his hurt ankle girlfriend looking bored on his side two older adults bleeding across the street sitting quietly there were parked cars damaged my prejudice tells me it is the young boy driving the car that crashed into the normal older adult driver was my prejudice correct Road traffic accident Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Motorcycle Manual transmission Sport utility vehicle Car safety 2005 United States Grand Prix The Shining (film) Rain Man Motorcycle helmet Automobile Shaggy dog story Ayrton Senna Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Indianapolis 500 Champ Car Car handling The Inside Father's Day (Doctor Who) One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule 24 Hours of Le Mans Paul Is Dead Driver's license Professional wrestling match types Hearing impairment Auto racing Airbag Wile E.
