what can conquer the darkness with darkness i mean here all the weak wrong and violent impulses of the mind or soul of another person or in ourselves my son asked me that question as he sometimes gets this thoughts in his head to do something bad although he in his heart does not want to do it he is just a few days ago a young woman told me about the same problem that she feels that dark bad impulses or ideas in her head get a hold of her and she finds it hard to conquer them it shows itself in her case in an eating disorder it is not me i personally find this also with myself in terms of if some other person around me is in a very bad mood this can get a hold over me although i do not want it what conquers darkness and if you say something like love could you just explain it a bit more in detail thanks the only solution to darkness is light and loving what is hurting in us or in another heals every hurt as only what is hurting in us cause us to hurt another as we can only do t others what we are feeling or doing to ourselves judging or denying only causes temporary suppression and not a permanent solution and then we are preparing ourselves for explosion or backfiring of our darkness as that which we do not bring forth destroys and that which we do saves us so bringing our darkness into light airing our secret thoughts and desires gives them and us an opportunity to heal otherwise we only end up fighting its reflections all around as all live is only an experience of who we truly are as what we recognize in others is what we carry within this recognition leads to freedom and once we accept our darkness unconditionally we learn to do the same in others as well and what we embrace we heal with light of our love when we begin to love all that we are completely that is when all our darkness transmutes into love darkness is to be transcended thus and not conquered or fought against as we end up fighting with who we truly are a mixture of darkness and lightness even if you cannot accept your own darkness or that of someone else simply asking for divine assistance makes our intentions come true as we are only as strong as our prayers the divine light then helps us see the darkness in its true light and reveal its hidden gift of wisdom and thus transcension becomes easy when we begin to see every weakness as an opportunity to create a new strength in ourselves we are only here to recognize our darkness and our light and we do it by introspecting over our actions reactions and our relationships with fellow beings as our relationships reflect the best every bad habit or behaviour pattern is just an outward expression of our inner darkness or the part of us that feels so unloved that it has to act out its pain darkness to get our attention so instead of judging hurting shaming denying or abusing it we need to embrace it as we'd embrace our child who picks up a bad habit from somewhere the more we focus on it the more it will grow and the more we offer positive reinforcement the more easily old paths in our mind will grow over with fresh grass of our love so when a child acts out we need not judge him or punish or banish him away from our love but love him more embrace him for who he is and who you know he can be as what you focus on grows same is the case with our inner child who acts out when it gets scared of the darkness within so only thing we need to do is what every mother knows and does with her hurting child soothe it with our gentle and kind words like its ok focussing on our light and embracing our darkness is what makes us whole again as we are a composite of both just as the divine is accepting our humanity helps us transcend it and allow our divinity to descend into our physical being as darkness is but a splinter of our personality that is acting out it feels it wants power but what it really wants is love that is also the solution to every addiction or obsessive compulsive behaviour love A Course In Miracles Simone Weil Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Eastern Orthodox Church Narcissism Transactional analysis Stoicism Socrates Human Theory of conduct Evil Kain (Legacy of Kain) YuYu Hakusho Human nature Force (Star Wars) Summa Theologiae Theodicy Past teachings of Prem Rawat Rastafari movement Serial killer Sin Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Nicomachean Ethics Alcoholics Anonymous Urantia Goodness and value theory Anger management Sant Thakar Singh Autism Addiction Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Milton H.
