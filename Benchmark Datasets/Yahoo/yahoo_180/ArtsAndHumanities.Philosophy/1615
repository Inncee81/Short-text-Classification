what does it mean to say that mental events are ontologically dependent upon the physical world but conceptually are irreducible to mere physical events how accepted is this view of the mental its from davidson basically what doanld davidson if its not him you meant he did at least present exactly the same theory and as i know of no other davidson that did i assume i'm right meant is that mental events do not exist within a mental realm as descartes and other substance dualists would argue they are in fact part of the physical world thus they are ontologically dependent upon the physical if there was no physical world there would be no mental events however davidson believes that the mental beliefs desires intentions etc can not be reduced in concept to purely physical events i have in the past taken this to mean that mental properties or events are the result of a number of physical events and as such mental event x can not be reduced to purely physical event y and z according to davidson this reduction can not be made and as such mental events are conceptually distinct from physical ones perhaps something like composite properties would help as an analogy this view is quite popular and seems to find at least in slightly modified forms much support from all those philosopher's who attempt to argue that the mind is more than just the brain or the nervous system human beleifs aspirations and desires can not just be biochemical processes jaegwon kim argued with donald davidson extensively in a series of articles and his views are far from wholly accepted but it is one of the biggest supported theories within the philosophy of the mind Dualism (philosophy of mind) Philosophy of mind Donald Davidson (philosopher) Dualism Philosophy of language Reality Supernatural Ontology Philosophy of mathematics Metaphysics Ontological argument Determinism Naturalism (philosophy) Philosophy Artificial consciousness Intelligent design Where Mathematics Comes From Free will Willard Van Orman Quine Reduction (philosophy) Human Occam's Razor Soul Mind Cosmological argument Immanuel Kant Friedrich Schleiermacher Causality Philosophy of perception Logic Quantum mind Epistemology Falsifiability George Lakoff Psychology The nature of God in Western theology Music Category of being Rudolf Hermann Lotze Interpretation of quantum mechanics Objectivist philosophy Phenomenology Person Connectionism Cyberspace Goodness and value theory Social constructionism Existence of God Ontology (computer science) Belief Human nature David Hume God History of psychology Materialism Monism Trinity Science Cognition Hindu philosophy Philosophy of space and time Deconstruction Victor Cousin Maurice Merleau-Ponty Philosophy of religion Many-worlds interpretation Age of Enlightenment Addiction Time Sigmund Freud Louis Althusser Philosophical skepticism Religion Ghost in the machine Existence Ken Wilber Creationism Phenomenalism Al-Ghazali Atomism Mechanism (philosophy) Psychosis Critique of Pure Reason Color Speed of light Cognitive science Animal rights Sociocultural evolution Mental illness
