what is the first thing you notice about someone when meeting them why do you notice that first if it's a man i notice the way he shakes my hand or if he tries to 'slap' it or 'give me five' when i extend my hand to him it lets me know how seriously he takes our meeting and how he normally establishes his contacts relationships it also shows what type of person he normally introduces himself to and is a good indicator of maturity the same is true for women though i must admit that i often watch her left hand to see if it has a ring or if she is using it to brush back her hair in both cases i notice if the person makes good eye contact with me or not and i notice the language he or she uses if they say what's up dude i know i am meeting with a 'kid ' if they say nice to meet you sir or mr k or richard i know i am dealing with an adult or a well raised child The Inside Motion picture rating system The Shining (film) Social rule Ocean's Twelve Infant baptism Asperger syndrome The Contender (television series) The Keeper of Traken Appeal StarCraft Episode VI The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Professional wrestling attacks Avenue Q Mao (game) About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Curling Volleyball Kimi Finster Handshake Customs and etiquette of Japan Narrator The Subtle Knife Sin City Rei Ayanami Dog Clown The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Left-handed Escape from New York Conspiracy (TNG episode) Fathers' rights Milton H.
