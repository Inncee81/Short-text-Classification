can science or philosophy exist without the underlying assumption of logical deduction i'm not sure but my guess would be that logical deduction is necessary but not sufficient hard science physics has led us to quantum insights that tell us with almost certainty that our notions about reality are not only wrong but that reality may be beyond our imagination reality is what we choose to observe deduction is tough when there no cause and effect we are at the edge of a cliff and the logical deduction bridge isn't long enough to reach to the other side the reductionist mechanistic bridge has already failed i think there are a lot of people hopeful for a bridge of mathematics but it is likely that its going to need to be spliced to something else a good example might be the standard model a theory with a incredible track record of making accurate predictions but considered less than fundamental not only because of its inherent limitations but also because its too clunky lacks parsimony to be considered elegant and expanded upon with theories of supersymetry which makes me wonder if some aspect of aesthetics will increasingly be needed to add to the splice Scientific method Theory Quantum mechanics Physics Science Logic Randomness Philosophy of science Mathematics Epistemology Economics String theory Falsifiability Determinism Philosophy of mathematics Probability Multiverse G__del's incompleteness theorem Natural deduction Gravity Interpretation of quantum mechanics Causality Religion Pseudoscience Reality Bell's theorem Induction (philosophy) Francis Crick Modernism Postmodernism Goodness and value theory Empiricism Normal distribution Aristotle Black hole Luminiferous aether Model (economics) Creationism Social sciences Game theory Law of value Immanuel Kant Age of Enlightenment Quantum gravity Metaphysics Quantum chromodynamics Many-worlds interpretation W.
