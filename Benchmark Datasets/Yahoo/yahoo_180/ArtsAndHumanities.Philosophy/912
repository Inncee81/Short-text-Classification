money vs happiness what would you choose and why if you were asked to choose between having an endless supply of money or pure unspolied happiness in every area of your life which would you choose and why people have often said that you can and or cannot have both money and happiness at the same time but what do you think which of the above attracts you the most and why adam in response to pepzi bandit if you read my question properly you would understand it and therefore it would not be dumb to you people say 'money doesn't buy you happiness' but i think this statement is too general and therefore disagree because without money we wouldn't be able to eat or drink or receive medical attention and therefore we'd all have our own space in the ground i believe a certain amount of money brings us happiness enough money to feed ourselves and our families and pay for medicines without money there is no happiness if you are stricken by poverty would you be happy watching your little brothers and sisters struggling their ribs clearly visible would you be happy watching your parents working their backs off every bone in their body aching just for a bowl of oats i also think that the kind of money celebrities receive can bring you happiness i love making people smile whether that's surprising them with a bunch of flowers or a nice little poem money does enable you to do that money allows you to travel too and meet people experience and see new things so i don't think there's happiness without money but i only think money plays a small role in happiness the main source of happiness for me is my family and friends and also achievement therefore i would want happiness with enough money to feed those around me and keep them happy anyway thank you adam Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Friends Insurance The Catcher in the Rye 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Current teachings of Prem Rawat Avenue Q EastEnders Shaggy dog story Economics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Meaning of life The Amazing Race Pitaten Marilyn Monroe Paradise Lost Poker jargon Happiness Funeral Knots Landing Simone Weil Microeconomics Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Publicly funded medicine Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist American Psycho The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sharon Tate Original sin Nicomachean Ethics Goodness and value theory Paradox David Hume Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Political economy It's Walky!
