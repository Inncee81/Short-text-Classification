is the regretting a part of confessing because after commiting a fault i feel of regretting over it and i ask whether it is forgiven without conducting a process of confessing and what balance will be when a sense of regretting is stronger than confessing i believe it is because as soon as you begin to realise the error in your ways will you ever be able to admit and be ashamed of what you have done and hopefully you will be forgiven because many believe that if you bury this feeling of regret deep within your mind and soul that it will go away but in the end it will come back to bite you therfore realising your error is the first of three steps to recovery realise admit accept Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Friends of the Western Buddhist Order Repentance Contrition Confession The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Alcoholics Anonymous Infant baptism EastEnders Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Parsifal Eastern Orthodox Church A Course In Miracles Scientology beliefs and practices Risk Soul Forgiveness Mind control Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Read my lips: no new taxes Baptism Israel ben Eliezer Sin Prisoner's dilemma Neville Chamberlain Salvation Kat Moon Responses of Germany and Japan to World War II crimes John Berryman Francis Hutcheson (philosopher) Summa Theologiae Zohar Pardon Father's Day (Doctor Who) Original sin Big Brother UK series 6 Sigmund Freud Digital circuit Methos Love Homosexuality and Judaism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Futurama (TV series - season 5) Theory of conduct Abrahamic religion Duties of the Heart Inventory Indulgence Aida (musical) Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Apostasy National Kidney Foundation Singapore Kodocha Henry Lee Lucas 1919 World Series Charles Grandison Finney Nontrinitarianism Software testing Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 NVIDIA Scientific method Christian apologetics Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Mass (liturgy) Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Tenshinhan Panay incident The Parting of the Ways Conscience William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham The Daleks' Master Plan Confessing Movement Twelve-step program Richard I of England Pat Evans Anna Karenina The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde Knots Landing Appeal Kain (Legacy of Kain) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Contender (television series) Sydney Riot of 1879 Obi-Wan Kenobi Vegeta T'Pol Pitaten Guilt John Howard Yoder Lutheranism Catholicism Simon Commission Swami Vivekananda God Emperor of Dune Darth Vader John Lott Angel Sanctuary Sam Hunter Prince Edmund (Blackadder)
