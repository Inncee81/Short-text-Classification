what is your philosophy on dog breeds here is what i want to know why do people hate pit bulls so much i know the media has a lot to do with this but the truth is not all pit bulls are mean i know two pit bulls who are the sweetest dogs in the world one i own and my best friend owns the other i also own three english bulldogs which are also sweet dogs however my bulldogs get on these rambunctious playing kicks i know my pit bull wants to play too but she will just come sit in my lap and watch them play also when it comes to food the english bulldogs act like gremlins while my pit bull waits patiently in her bed for her food all dogs have the potential to bite and hurt people golden retrievers pomerania's chiawawas collies mutts poodles black labs and yorkies bite people all the time but it never gets media coverage my point is that not all pit bulls chow chows german shepard's mastiffs doberman pincher's and rottweillers are mean dogs i am wondering what your guys take on this is actor ving rhames's care taker was supposedly mauled by two of rhames's dogs because there are teeth marks on the dead care takers body police are saying though that they don't know if the dog bite killed this man or if he had a heart attack or some other medical issue rhames has mastiffs and english bulldog i just get so angry about this sort of thing because we don't know what really happened yet the dogs are already guilty maybe the care taker was abusing them maybe the dogs were trying to wake this guy up we don't know what do you think why are people so quick to judge we weren't there society's unjust discrimination on animals of their kind is a horrible problem in our culture whether it's the people who abuse and fight these dogs or the counties and states that actually ban their breed these dogs haven't been appreciated as they deserve it's time to celebrate their loyalty and beauty show people that they can be family dogs and best friends maybe eventually they'll be seen differently i don't see why pitts are the target fatal attacks since have been attributed to over different dog breeds yet all the media can talk about are pit bulls rottweilers dobermans or akitas and other large breeds size alone is not an accurate indicator of which dogs are capable of killing and which dogs are not in october of a baby was killed by the families pomeranian dog in california the average weight of a pomeranian being only pounds and in february of a jack russell terrier mauled a week old baby in tennessee another thing is the dog that just bit someone a labrador golden setter chow mix guess what it will probably be listed as a chow chow bite own a terrier hound bull dog mix chances are good it will be listed as a pit bull recently polled a number of animal shelter workers and this is what they said about dog bites most of the bites they've seen have been by small unfriendly terrier type dogs and cocker spaniels occasionally they have seen a larger dog on a bite case but the vast majority of the bites were from small to medium sized dogs the dog groomers said most of the bites they see are from schnauzers cocker spaniels westies scotties and dachshunds next a number of veterinarians one veterinarian said give me a so called vicious pit bull over a cocker spaniel dachshund or even a lab any day these are the breeds i have the most problem with another vet concurred saying that in years of working at a veterinarian clinic she never once encountered a single vicious pit bull yet had problems all the time with cocker spaniels and yorkshire terriers speaking of provoking an entire category of bites that are reported and shouldn't be are the truly provoked bites the bites in which the person involved was clearly at fault and not the dog the bites that occurred for instance when the person who was bitten was somewhere they should not have been in the first place for example recently in maryland a year old boy was bitten after he was caught leaning over the fence into a person's yard teasing the pit bull contained there prior to the bite incident this boy was warned times to leave this dog alone the dog owner was having so many problems with people teasing and provoking her dogs that she contacted animal control for assistance under advisement from the authorities she ringed her backyard fence with evenly spaced beware of dog and no trespassing signs yet these signs and verbal warnings from an adult witness were still not enough to keep this boy out of this dog owner's yard the dog owner has now lost her dog to the authorities and another bite statistic has been entered yet was it this dog's fault no this dog pit bull or otherwise was simply defending itself and its territory from an intruder the boy needs to be prosecuted for trespassing hand in hand with this is the general failure of parents today to teach their children even the most basic rules of canine safety and good manners day in and day out parents encourage their children to approach and touch strange dogs without a single thought of the consequences or even bothering to ask permission of the dog owner involved they tolerate and encourage their children to put their hands through fences to grab at animals contained inside this is the epitome of irresponsibility fences are there for a reason and that reason is to keep people animals or things in and others out no animal should have to put up with strangers of any size grabbing groping pulling their tails and ears and hitting or poking them yet this goes on daily and people expect that the animal will be some sort of saint in fur in return this is completely unrealistic viewpoint a parent would be outraged and probably screaming for the police if a stranger approached and started groping their child yet they think nothing of doing the same thing to a strange animal to go by statistics alone assumes that the majority of dog bites are reported and that the majority of breeds identified are correct as a long time dog fancier i have a serious problem with either assumption too bad many insurance companies are now refusing to provide home owners insurance to owners of certain breeds and many communities are banning ownership of dogs based on statistics that are dubious at best once again appreciate the beauty of pitt bull's and pitt bull mixes society's unjust discrimination on animals of their kind is a horrible problem in our culture whether it's the people who abuse and fight these dogs or the counties and states that actually ban their breed these dogs haven't been appreciated as they deserve it's time to celebrate their loyalty and beauty show people that they can be family dogs and best friends maybe eventually they'll be seen differently each year are killed by cigarettes are killed in car accidents children are killed in gun related incidents children are killed by their parents and are killed by a pit so where does the real epidemic lie by the way to anyone who complains about it's in the wrong category it's in the wrong category it's in the wrong category get over it just skip the question but do not be an idiot and whine and complain and question if it is in the wrong category of all categories this one would have the most discrepancies because the definition of philosophy does not excist look it up on wikipedia Cat Milton H.
