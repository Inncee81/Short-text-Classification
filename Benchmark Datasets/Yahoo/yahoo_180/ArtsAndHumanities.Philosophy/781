neuroscience or psychology ph d i'm an undergrad psychology student with plans to go to grad school my question is for those who have experience in these fields i'm debating on whether i should look into an interdisciplinary neuroscience doctoral program or a psychology program with a concentration in cognitive or behavioral neuroscience ultimately i want to study the mind brain and philosophical issues aside the brain is where it's at knowing that cognitive psychology will eventually be explained by a robust cognitive neuroscience i'm concerned that not studying the brain on all levels will leave me in more of an area of abstraction traditional psychology and i won't really be in the know or have as many opportunities for understanding how the mind brain works in an academic setting or elsewhere i would appreciate any comments or even questions thanks the neuroscience doctoral program for sure Psychology Cognitive science Cognitive neuroscience Cognition Consciousness Social psychology Neuropsychology History of psychology Developmental psychology Philosophy of mathematics Philosophy of mind Science Brain Cognitive psychology Philosophy of perception Attention Second language acquisition Connectionism Race and intelligence Cognitive neuropsychology Philosophy of language Animal cognition George Lakoff Drew University Psycholinguistics Mind Religious studies Human brain Artificial consciousness Evolutionary psychology Medicine Biological neural network Face perception Franz Boas Journal of Consciousness Studies Emotion Holism in science Mind control Meditation History of science Graduate school Neuro-linguistic programming Intelligence (trait) Reality Neurotheology Philosophy Psychiatry Evolutionary neuroscience Where Mathematics Comes From Sigmund Freud Mental imagery Mind-body problem Behavioral finance Schizophrenia Transpersonal psychology Functional magnetic resonance imaging Person Cognitive bias Cognitivism (psychology) Unconscious mind Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Maurice Merleau-Ponty Meme Parapsychology Human Western philosophy Kundalini Neuroeconomics Free will Dyslexia Hypnosis Indiana University Bloomington Brainwashing Working memory Memetics University of Connecticut The Mind of an Ape Intelligence quotient A Course In Miracles Sex and intelligence Physician Antonio Damasio Cult Mental illness Psychotherapy Memory-prediction framework Epistemology Belief Brain-computer interface
