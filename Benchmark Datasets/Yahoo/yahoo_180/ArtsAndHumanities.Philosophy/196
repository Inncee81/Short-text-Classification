is our meddling with natural procreation birth control abortion etc likely to retard stop further evolution is it possible that all our unnatural practices and preferences have already slowed down the natural process of evolution that ensures survival despite changing environment throughout our history we have seen the ability of man to control our world increase gradually over time the invention of reliable fire making abilities allowed us to cook food change landscapes and even make war or defence the invention of metal tools allowed us to change landscapes to suit our will build more effective hunting and warring weapons however until very recently we have been unable change to ourselves with recent surgical techniques medicines like anti biotics medical and physiological understanding that we have never had before we have been able to lengthen life spans improve quality of life and even provide for most of those who live longer now we have the capacity to change ourselves with non natural selection that is we can create ten embryos and choose the one that is best and healthiest or the one that we like best we are even on the verge of being able to construct what we want in our next generation so in short the argument could be made that birth control and abortions coupled with ivf and genetic technology is the manifestation of our next evolutionary form that being we are the only animal on earth capable of deciding what happens to our species next instead of random chance hope this helps Ecology Extinction Birth control Biology In vitro fertilisation Evolution Reproduction Human Abortion debate Evidence of evolution Evolutionism Cancer Sociocultural evolution Organic farming Abortion History of evolutionary thought Species Plant breeding Biodiversity Creationism Agriculture Technology Medicine Universal Century Technology Tank Livestock Origin of life Shifting cultivation Science Genetic engineering Zerg Tai Chi Chuan The Origin of Species Neolithic Revolution Deforestation Stem cell Macroevolution Multiple birth Sewage treatment Barbara McClintock Natural selection Senescence Infantilism Orgasm Culture Naval mine Life expectancy Puberty Domestication Wealth Information warfare Genetic algorithm Alchemy Whale Technological singularity Optical fiber Immortality Tank classification Evolutionary psychology Patent Hunting Archaeology Anti-aircraft warfare Abortion in the United States Intelligent design Creation-evolution controversy Nutrition Stone Age Evolutionary creationism Insulin Anarcho-primitivism Xenomorph Evolution of sex Urinary incontinence F.
