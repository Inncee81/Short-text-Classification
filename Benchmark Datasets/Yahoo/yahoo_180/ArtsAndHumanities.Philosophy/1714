does the idea of a god or supra intelligent pre existing being scare you irrespective of whether you are an atheist or believer does the idea of a god not frighten you how could this absolute being have come about isn't it easier to accept that nothing should exist but then the idea of absolute nothingness is equally distubing to me if you are a religious person have you thought about this fundamental ontological point even if this supreme being called god does exist he seems to be too dormant to scare anyone to refrain from evil having created it all his being seems to be pointless thereafter absolute nothingness is mind boggling the closest i get to visualize is empty space but that indeed is something and not nothing in my own simple way i think that everything must have come out of nothing just like zero can be split into innumerable plus and minus values which together sum up to zero but then that leads to the most crucial question as to what caused nothingness to manifest like this in other words the original cause beats all my imagination the only logical idea seems to be a continuum that has an eternal existence conforming to a dynamic balance and zero sum equation and its state of constant change gives us the illusion of any beginning or end logical it may be but somehow not at all sitting comfortably in the mind or as you rightly say rather disturbing God Religion The nature of God in Western theology Existence of God Soul Atheism Theodicy Ontological argument Creationism Trinity Origin belief Metaphysics Brahman Friedrich Schleiermacher Goodness and value theory Atomism Ken Wilber Philosophy of space and time Supernatural S__ren Kierkegaard Prices of production Infinity Deconstruction Microeconomics Human Summa Theologiae Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Hindu philosophy Agnosticism Phaedo Complex number Animism Entropy History of creationism Occam's Razor Philosophy of mathematics Existence Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Wedge strategy Victor Cousin Al-Ghazali Moral relativism Antony Flew Gravity Causality Intelligent design A Course In Miracles Dark energy Spiritual evolution Vacuum Dirac equation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Free will Simone Weil Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Scientology beliefs and practices Immanuel Kant Logic Philosophy of religion Aristotle Advaita Vedanta Epistemology Creation-evolution controversy Property (ownership right) Ontology Consciousness Problem of universals Nihilism History of philosophy Age of Enlightenment Deism Quantum mechanics Roman Catholic Church Church of Christ, Scientist Cyberspace Mathematics Ethics Deity Bhakti Human nature Idealism Gottfried Leibniz Zeno's paradoxes Cultural relativism Monotheism Mantra Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Jewish philosophy Determinism Evil
