suicide or not redux i made the mistake of placing this in the religion spirituality category if a man walks out of his house with the knowledge that in is path is certain death is this man commiting suicide or is this possibly something more than just suicide are the facts for his motivation for leaving his house more the subject to debate than that of the path he willingly took knowing that it would lead to his certian death suicide is defined as intentionally taking ones own life has the man commited suicide under this definition if there were conditions and man a lets call him joe left his home with the knowledge that later that day he would die and by knowing this he still commences his routine has he intentionally taken his own life or is it man b lets call him bob who leaves his inhabitance knowing that he will soon face death for he is a soldier in a war but goes about his daily routine with knowledge of his inevitable death wats the diff between joe and bob and is it that the concept of suicide is in the details yes joe knows he will die god told em so kinda actually he is psychic humor me okay in attempt to clairfy joe is a psychic that just saw his death he knows how and when he will die nothing futher is left to chance its the theroy of causation into play bob on the other hand is the mercy of chance but unlike joe is under the theory of uncertianity when he sighed up for his posistion as a foot soldier he did so knowing that he will be in the middle of a bloody war and possibly embarking on the path that held the eventual demise of his self and i hate the limiations on characters to work with does joe actually know he'll die if he could prevent his death that day by staying home and is able to yet intentionally leaves the house regardless i'd call that suicide this is only true if joe is absolutely positive he'll die if he leaves the house there has to be not even the slightest chance that joe could both leave the house and live beyond that day otherwise it's not suicide bob's situation is different from what i can tell because he doesn't actually know he's going to die that day if he's just a soldier in a war then there's definitely a great possibility however from the information given it doesn't seem that bob actually knows for certain and the act of leaving is therefore not suicide edit ok after reading your updates i've come to a different conclusion joe's case didn't involve suicide because he had no choice in the matter as you put it he was doomed either way and was fated to die regardless of his actions you definited suicide as intentionally taking one's own life if joe couldn't choose to keep his life then he certainly couldn't choose to take it either bob's case is tricky and comes down to the likelihood of death in his situation if he went into the war knowing the odds were greatly stacked against him one might call that suicide to an extent if he underestimated the upcoming danger involved then the situation couldn't realistically be seen as suicide if the odds were ridiculously stacked against him then this situation might be likened to someone walking into a room of flying bullets a room with one gun aimed in a particular direction and firing at equal intervals is quite different from a room in which guns are being fired unpredictably in numerous directions Suicide Determinism Poker jargon Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Predestination Causality Free will Epistemology Theodicy Theory of conduct Plame affair Phaedo Socrates Supernatural The Inside Summa Theologiae Escape from New York Derren Brown Abortion debate John Cage Friends Philosophy of space and time A Course In Miracles Infantilism Just War theory 1957 World Series Microeconomics Aristotle Blonde on Blonde Scientific method Paradox Alcoholics Anonymous Simone Weil The Star Wars Holiday Special Doomsday argument Coercion Beavis and Butt-head God Incarnations of Immortality Goodness and value theory EastEnders Animism K' Reality Intelligent design Past teachings of Prem Rawat Iago Baptism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Professional wrestling match types Miss Saigon The Invisibles Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus God Emperor of Dune The Amber Spyglass Seppuku Friedrich Schleiermacher Suicide bombing Deconstruction Divorce Muslim ibn Aqeel Sin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Religious views of suicide Survivor (novel) The Death Gate Cycle Ammunition Human nature Social rule Landing at Anzac Cove Craps Shaggy dog story Philosophy of language Reservoir Dogs Paranoia Agent Pitaten Assassination Slayers Snooker Penda of Mercia Karma Consensus decision-making Euthanasia Religion Murder Economics Religious pluralism Defense (justification) Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.
