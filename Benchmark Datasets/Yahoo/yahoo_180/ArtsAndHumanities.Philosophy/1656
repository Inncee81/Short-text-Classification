polite debate on religion i will present a quote and welcome thoughts and debate i only ask to please keep this civil and no hurling of insults or cynical comments from either side all of which will be reported the quote religion has certian ideas at the heart of it which we call sacred or holy or whatever what it means is 'here is an idea or notion that you're not allowed to say anything bad about your just not why not because you're not ' if somebody votes for a party that you don't agree with you're free to argue about it as much as you like everybody will have an argument but nobody feels aggrieved by it if somebody thinks taxes should go up or down you are free to have an argument about it but on the other hand if somebody says 'i mustn't move a light switch on a saturday' you say 'i respect that' why should it be that it's perfectly legitimate to support the labour party or the consercatice party republicans or democrats this model of economics versus that macintosh instead of windows but to have an opinion about how the universe began about who created that universe no that's holy we are used to not challenging religious ideas but it's very interesting how much of a furore richard dawkins creates when he does it everybody gets absolutely frantic about it because you're not allowed to say these things yet when you look at it rationally there is no reason why those ideas shouldn't be as open to debate as any other except that we have agreed somehow between us that they shouldn't be douglas adams i thought the question was obvious but alright the quesiton do you agree with this quote yes or no and explain your answear i absolutely agree with the quote many writers have pointed out that people are at their angriest and most defensive when they try to defend a conviction for which they have little evidence nobody shouts from the rooftops that the sky is blue and nobody wages wars in the name of geometry i think the psychological emotional force at work in this phenomenon is that of cognitive dissonance we all like to think of ourselves as rational and well informed and even the suggestion that our guiding priciples might be unfounded can be very threatening to this self regard most people would prefer not to justify their convictions when the attempt might prove them to be foundless of course not all people avoid religious discussion for this reason some subscibe to the philosophy of fideism which holds that the things we put faith in are beyond reason and therefore rational discussion has no bearing within the sphere of religion but i think this implies a contradiction i have a real problem with the idea that an all knowing and all loving being would create us with the capacity for rational thought and then demand that we not apply that thought toward the most important aspects of our lives Epistemology Theodicy Atheism Religion Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Democracy Theory of conduct Abortion debate Intelligent design Existence of God Homophobia Creationism Liberalism Philosophy of language Freedom of speech Science Microeconomics Philosophy of space and time Philosophy of mathematics Goodness and value theory Ontological argument Economics Theology The nature of God in Western theology Philosophy of science Separation of church and state Presuppositional apologetics Trinity Objectivist philosophy Supply and demand Simone Weil Artificial consciousness Scientific skepticism Predestination Capitalism God Law of value Teach the Controversy Plame affair Falsifiability Intelligent design movement Human nature Sexual orientation American Conservatism Philosophy Scientific method Philosophy of religion Deconstruction Logic Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Immanuel Kant State Noam Chomsky Victor Cousin Socrates Ethics Postmodernism George Lakoff Fundamentalism Friedrich Schleiermacher Young Earth creationism Sociocultural evolution Coercion Roe v.
