will she kill me my sister's st draft of her first poem i'll have to post it in two parts it's long guarded the faces leaning flat elbows in corners lashed by raw shadows felled by the timbres of forests smiles sealing fissures in fables voiceless to hushed ears that listen in what silent pastures still rooted do wings render flight to the dusk and whispers on thresholds find answers to questions that die here unasked they wait in the sepulchral entrance to lie in the disengaged shadow and ask for the axe to be measured by dry sightless wells of their eyes arrested the throbs in the walls of the temple lungs no longer lift to the weight of their hunger strident the warning exhibit vortex of torn wings descending raping the tired broken harvest the bone from the marrow uncovered do waters still flow in the channels carved by the hard fisted muscle warmed by the noon sun that slumbers cooled by the black rains that follow the soles of old feet find no comfort in following pathways of ashes the bones bend to taste a new blossom and bleed on an earth frozen over sorry i had to split it i posted this in philosophy because it has deep meanings also in poetry i welcome your feelings i have nothing to lose but compare it to her whimiscal affectionate poem about the cat she doesn't know i've done this hiss not yet how amazing she's a published poet there are so many creative people in this section perhaps i expected more insight thanks for the suggestion timberleigh but this is free verse couldn't have been written in haiku beardog thanks for the concern but this wasn't about her it has far more abstract objective meanings i went through the seminar with her but never made it i don't think she ever wrote anything personal alice i meant when she finds out i posted it this is basically about life death all the territory between i'm glad her publishers didn't have this response i wish you'd read her loving poem i posted about a cat hi moon after looking at some of the answers we laughed ourselves silly gave each other a hug my dear tarek c i meant it as a joke like she'd kill me for posting her poem without asking first brintbrunette i'm not at all surprised you couldn't get based the first line nae opinions are always welcome but needn't be insulting moon yes she's not thin skinned meg on a mission very true anticipated the content requires deep introspection or nothing at all now a choice as this is growing old i should entitle it dire absolution graphically and perspicuously outlined one of the prose is like the harvest of the souls all waiting for pardon but engulfed in vague remorse it's deep in a sense that there's a tincture of hope in such hopelessness it's like a bleak light showing through the darkness of the poem it isnt morbid but more of a poignant representation of a prolonged interim close to what a person with a death sentence upholded temporarily or someone whose cancer cells weakened but still has less than a year to live the black rain isnt a symbol of renewal or cleansing more of a black veil lifting itself in one's inner battles a shroud of the unknown to test one's faith or the anonymity of our fate in the hands of time Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Equine conformation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Wolfrider Theory of conduct EastEnders Characters of Naruto Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Resurrection of Jesus W.I.T.C.H.
