can we conceive of universals without visualising them just reading an answer and thought i'd get others opinions jam explain please i personally don't think we can we can conceive the concept of universals however i think when one attempts to conceive of a universal or generic or ideal or form one automatically visualises something with properties taken from experience however universals if i've understood the sense in which you mean universals correctly are a very touchy subject they incorporate notions of identity and the metaphysics of properties for instance which properties are essential to x being x if one conceives of a universal cow does it have to have legs to answer yes implies that either cows with legs are not in fact cows anymore or that legs are not essential to the nature of cows and therefore not part of the universal notion or form of cows i suppose just to include all options it could also mean the universal was in fact not universal attempting to conceive of anything like a cow horse etc draws on what we have acquired from the senses and therefore can not be universal but specific any property you assign to your conceived universal will be a derivative of your senses and therefore not universal however this all depends upon whether you accept the ontology of universals of this type or not to begin with Ontological argument Philosophy of science Epistemology Property (ownership right) Friedrich Schleiermacher Reality Existence of God Problem of universals Philosophy of language Immanuel Kant Deconstruction Logic Philosophy of mathematics Critique of Pure Reason Existence Philosophy of religion God Gravity Victor Cousin Substance theory Phaedo Bundle theory Philosophy of space and time Scientific method The nature of God in Western theology Intelligent design Louis Althusser Goodness and value theory Species Maurice Merleau-Ponty Supernatural Merit Trinity Creationism Abortion debate Ontology Model (abstract) Objectivist philosophy Occam's Razor Frankfurt School Science Free will Platonic realism Hinduism Identity and change Mantra Multiverse Many-worlds interpretation Adjoint functors Atomism Infinity Entropy Law of value Dualism (philosophy of mind) Philosophy Religion Willard Van Orman Quine Abstraction Martin Heidegger Natural deduction Theory of conduct Psychology A Course In Miracles Falsifiability Theology Atheism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Cosmological argument Ontology (computer science) Category theory Trimurti Mathematics Function (mathematics) Lattice (order) Origin belief Bertrand Russell Coercion Clifford algebra Space Postmodernism Moral objectivism Sexual orientation Human Dharma Nominalism Biblical inerrancy Human nature Expert system
