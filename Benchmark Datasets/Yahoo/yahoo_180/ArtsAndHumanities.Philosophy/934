what makes god beleivers have blind faith no god is supposed to be supreme eternal all powerful and created all if he created all he must also know all as well of all time being eternal so he created evil knowing this and the a imperfect world demanding a sinfree one which makes no sense god being all powerful not able to over power god being all knowing and not knowing god being careless but considered caring does not make sense rational people know a sinfree world demands a perfect world he is so supreme that he cannot manage or know how to defeat his creations even though he should know what makes them tick and lets innocent beleivers and good people suffer or die breaks his own commandments and mass murders people if anything this god sounds actually more weak to me because he is a man of many flaws in a sense very human flaws we create problems we don't know the asnwer for we all very powerful but cannot over power our problems and if you ask me he has many major flaws just as much or even more than any regular person and worst ot is that he created all being eternal he should be able to over come any obstacle knowing how to perform all and creating the oppertunities for it he should know how everything works breaks and fixes if humans can create oppertunity why not god we are smaller then him or are we is god even a he what if its a she or some animal or an object my favorite qoute from bruce lee fuc circumstances i create oppertunity why is reasoning about god's existince so wrong if it actually turns up more rational that he doesn't most likely exists faith is not the same thing as just beleiving something with out reason it simply means to beleive i have faith in things but i have faith in it because i reason on why i should have faith its nice that you noticed i did not spell check you have a brain how does this prove gods exitince jeff e yes you want a biscuit for noticing blind faith comes mostly comes from fear and insecurity but not all faith is blind the moment that human beings begin defining deity they necessarily limit that deity to human dimensions and understanding god in a box so often you hear people say well i can't believe in a god who would do this or that formulating a god that fits the needs of individuals that automatically limits deity to the parameters of human scale and that in turn makes the deity less than divine an invention of human need what is more difficult is to acknowledge that to be divine is to be unknowable Theodicy Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism God Existence of God Atheism Religion Trinity Summa Theologiae Predestination Eastern Orthodox Church Ontological argument Athanasian Creed Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Free will S__ren Kierkegaard Abortion debate Merit The nature of God in Western theology Evil Goodness and value theory Ten Commandments Duties of the Heart Supernatural Human Faith Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Tamriel Friedrich Schleiermacher Soul Epistemology Al-Ghazali Demon Immortality Theory of conduct Idolatry Meaning of life Original sin Angel Theology Salvation Intelligent design Determinism Monotheism Jewish philosophy Urantia John Howard Yoder Sacrifice Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Aristotle Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Filioque clause Simone Weil Victor Cousin Alignment (role-playing games) A Course In Miracles Sin Utilitarianism Philo Human nature Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Sola fide Hell Creator God Categorical imperative Reinhold Niebuhr Presuppositional apologetics Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Problem of evil Cosmological argument Alaga__sia Devil Satanism Prayer Islamic philosophy Moral objectivism Microeconomics Phaedo Michel Henry Maimonides Origin belief Extreme Programming Reincarnation Strong atheism God and gender Afterlife Mythology John Wycliffe Occam's Razor Brahman Biblical inerrancy Nihilism
