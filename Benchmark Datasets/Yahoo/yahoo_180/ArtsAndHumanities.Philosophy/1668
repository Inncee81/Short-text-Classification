can you use this logic chain if a b and b c then a c to prove or disprove the existence of god you must use statements equating to the alphabetical letters either you believe in god that exist or not i do not belive that in a mere scientific equattion or theories can human prove that god exist but i do believe that god exist and i do believe that above all creation there is higher creator who made all that are living on this so called earth even man have proven that we existed some kind of matter and etc etc can anybody prove who ever made the all the existing living creatures that are every where around us or even who made you maybe you are going to asnwer me yeah you came from your mother womb because your parents had sex then who made your parents or your parents parents i do not believe that i came from monkey i hate that theory though honestly speaking i cannot prove it in scientific equation i hold on my faith i do believe that he exist and alive try this the omnipotent being who is all powerful and created the universe god is invisible but he is everywhere and he knows everything even our thoughts god hasn't showed up in physical form out in public for at least years longer if you are jewish years if you are mormon god could show up any where at any time in any form if he wanted to but he doesn't god is infinitely wise god knows the future and everything is going according to god's plan well we know that god can come out but he doesn't that means he chooses not to he could write a new updated bible maybe even publish it on the web but he doesn't and he chooses not to god could come out in public but he doesn't therefore he chooses not to people claim to have a personal relationship with god and that god reveals himself individually to people who open up to him but i have observed that those who seem to truly believe they have a personal relationship with god are getting very different messages some are getting a peace and love message while others are being called to arms to fight a holy war against other people who believe god is on their side supporting their cause i therefore have to believe that some of these people if not all of them just think god is talking to them when he really isn't God The nature of God in Western theology Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Predestination Soul Theodicy Meaning of life Free will Ten Commandments Creationism Summa Theologiae Intelligent design Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Causality Supernatural Justification (theology) Agnosticism Origin belief Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Church of Christ, Scientist Cosmological argument Jewish principles of faith Original sin Eastern Orthodox Church Creation science Creation-evolution controversy Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Human Infant baptism Sabbath Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Trinity Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Sin Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Occam's Razor Adam-God theory Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Nation of Islam Falsifiability Intelligent design movement A Course In Miracles Homosexuality and Christianity Opus Dei Biblical inerrancy Omnipotence Prayer Young Earth creationism Names of God in Judaism Reincarnation Angel Strong atheism Book of Mormon Religion Duties of the Heart Monotheism Prophet Christian eschatology Emanuel Swedenborg Day-Age Creationism Religious perspectives on Jesus New Testament Abortion debate Atheism Mormonism and Judaism Determinism Priesthood (Mormonism) Modern geocentrism Existence Religious pluralism DC Universe Binitarianism Time travel Bible and reincarnation Numerology Judaism Deconstruction Ontological argument Book of Isaiah Philosophical skepticism Sant Thakar Singh Genesis Resurrection of Jesus Idolatry The Origin of Species Religious conversion William A.
