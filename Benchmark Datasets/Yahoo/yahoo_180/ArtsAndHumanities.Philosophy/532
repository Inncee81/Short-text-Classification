nietzsche questions can anyone elaborate on what is meant when nietzsche said prayer to men forgive us our virtues thus one should pray to men and also this one not their love of men but the impotence of their love of men keeps the christians of today from burning us i have no idea on the first one the second one he seems to be saying something about christians lack of love for people that keeps them from killing us if that's even close to what he means he doesn't elaborate as to how he came to this conclusion there is a footnote in my book about it that says basically that if christians were concerned for the salvation of others they would still burn those whose heresies lead legions into eternal damnation i don't get what nietzsche is getting at here right that's how i took the whole burning thing but the reason it made no sense was that the bible teaches you not to act in violence so why would a christian do that what they can do is try to convert those who nietzsche thinks they should burn that's the reason it made no sense to me it's against christian doctrine and there are other things a christian could do to save those people from being condemned to hell for a lot of that what nietzsche was trying to get at was that many christians burned or condemned others for their beliefs pagans etc etc in said doing so for their god by this they were i guess in the best possible term upstanding in fighting for or defending their beliefs but in doing so they destroyed others prayer to men beseeching them to have mercy or to not challenge others for theirs forgive us our virtues he believed that men were best punished for their virtues for example yes a man is strong and hard but he will never know the glory of intimacy thus one should pray to men they are the ones that live their lives according to the decisions and actions they take Salvation Predestination Eastern Orthodox Church Sin Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Abrahamic religion Divine grace Merit Roman Catholic Church Trinity Justification (theology) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Purgatory Hell Summa Theologiae Christian eschatology Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Atheism Religious pluralism Nihilism God Friedrich Nietzsche Christianity Sola fide Jewish principles of faith Sabbath Sacrifice Soul Religion Catechism Capital punishment Charles Grandison Finney Christianity and anti-Semitism Idolatry Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief The nature of God in Western theology Infant baptism Paul of Tarsus John Wycliffe Evangelicalism Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Reincarnation Church of Christ C.
