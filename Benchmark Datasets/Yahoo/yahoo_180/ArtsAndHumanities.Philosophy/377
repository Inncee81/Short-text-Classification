is it true that love is only a form of need it seems that all relationships exist based soley on the needs of each counterpart does everyone have a hidden agenda these are all blanket statements that have a technical answer of no but where is the real proof i feel like people girls epsecially are just beings built on conniving using nothing but their own interests to propel them through so called love and everything else in life is there no right and wrong as they say just what is beneficial to me and what is not just as people can lust after someone for their body they can also lust after emotional highs the idea of love that books and movies bring to people gives them a taste for this emotional high which is mistaken as love if one is searching for the emotional highs then they desire lust and the conniving hidden agenda shows up love is not about the self but about the other it is about caring about the person and not the high lust is to put value in a feeling while love is a choice to value the person themself there is love between friends that seems to be higher than the so called love between boyfriend girlfriend and even at times that of husband wife when a friend feels your hurt and sits silently by your side throughout the night during a hardship you are suffering this is love the truth is that few people grasp the true concept of love because they want the feeling without the work it is not easy to think of the other's feelings above your own with so many people bottling up to protect themselves from hurt it is hard to find those who are willing to put themselves in the midst of the battle to protect others but when people see that someone is taking the risk to help them they will be more likely to begin taking risks to help others love is risky and it's hard people want it to be easy so they choose the easier definition of so called love the question is are you willing to work for the real thing or will you settle for the fake stuff One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Love Days of our Lives Sexual orientation The Amber Spyglass Evil Objectivist philosophy Theory of conduct American Psycho Domestic violence Alignment (role-playing games) Infantilism Paradox Polyamory Friendship Sex and the City S__ren Kierkegaard Goodness and value theory Meaning of life Social rule Sant Thakar Singh A Course In Miracles Theodicy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Friedrich Schleiermacher Sin City Rudolf Hermann Lotze Transactional analysis Neighbours Socrates Utilitarianism About a Boy Jon Secada Grief Memento (film) God Phoebe Halliwell Scientology beliefs and practices John Howard Yoder Urantia W.I.T.C.H.
