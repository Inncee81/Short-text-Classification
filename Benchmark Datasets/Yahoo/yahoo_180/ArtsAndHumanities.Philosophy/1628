are you ever just amazed by the world we live in have you ever found yourself in complete amazement about the world we live on and everything on it for example when watching tv shows like the discovery channel history channel discovery health or shows like that i find myself amazed at some of the wonders of the world such as how ice caps form or desserts are created do you even realize how complex your circulatory system is even with simple stuff like sitting outside i sometimes think when i look down and see a small ant crawling along the ground do you know how fascinating they are this teeny tiny ant has such a different world than ours even though we share the same earth a walk that would take me maybe thirty seconds to reach would take this ant ten minutes or that even among us humans somewhere right now there is someone who might possibly look just like you not like a identical twin would but close but has no idea you exist or vice versa isn t that mind blowing or am i the only one who thinks so no i too am amazed by it all the majesty of life in all its forms and shapes each so very fragile yet resilent and self propelling let you and i then appreciate life for what is really is Solar system Emergence W.
