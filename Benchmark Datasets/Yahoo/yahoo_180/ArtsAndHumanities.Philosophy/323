upon which of shakespeare theatrical plays is your life based why no trick answers you gotta be oriented with the plays so needless to say shakespeare ethusiasts only which of his theatrical plays resemble your life why are you the lead role how far in the plot have you gone through who is the stage director and the producer are you expecting the original ending good luck everybody i would say my life is most definitely a midsummer night's dream crossed with taming of the shrew i am hermia and kate all rolled into one if that can make sense to anyone but me as a teen i was most certainly hermia when it came to matters of the heart but when i attracted someone such as a petruchio an undesirable to my mind or if i felt crossed such as what hermia felt once puck had worked or misworked his magic i could become instantly shrewish this is where the phrase hell hath no fury originated so to answer the next question yes i believe i am playing a lead role i've gone all of the way through midsummer since i've married my lysander in my version as soon as i stepped into the picture i got rid of miss helena and we haven t seen her ss since our life has been like a wild dream including a daughter who s crazy into fairies as for taming of the shrew bianca did get married off and she has children her suitor must have come through bill ted s time machine though because he was called shredder and he very much enjoyed heavy metal music and rocking on i ditched petruchio before lysander came along thank goodness because the former was truly no good at least not at the time the stage director would be michael hoffman because unlike many film versions of shakespeare s works i very much enjoyed his version of midsummer the producer would be bill gates because he can finance anything as for the original endings yes and no for shrew no way i am not one to be tamed but to be enjoyed as i am in all my mixed up craziness but for midsummer absolutely A Midsummer Night's Dream The Taming of the Shrew Shakespeare on screen 10 Things I Hate About You William Shakespeare BBC Television Shakespeare Julia Stiles Midsummer Katharine Hepburn Sally Ann Howes The Sims 2 Elf Jon Secada Peter Pan Theater in the United States King Lear KISS (band) United Artists Felix Mendelssohn Deus ex machina Fairy The Merchant of Venice Mary Pickford The Sandman: Dream Country Olivia de Havilland Rock opera Twelfth Night (play) Charles Hawtrey (Carry On actor) Theatre Cole Porter Cliff Richard Avenue Q Elizabeth Taylor Puck (mythology) Kiss Me, Kate Shrew Theory of conduct Beastie Boys Gentleman Jim Steinman Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. Rod Stewart Black Sabbath Filmmaking Knots Landing Pump It Up Romeo and Juliet Johnny Depp Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Sharon Tate Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Blonde on Blonde Titanic (1997 film) Charmed DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Mark Rylance Richard Cromwell (actor) Iago One Tree Hill (TV series) The Fairly OddParents Actor Meta-reference Magic (illusion) Aerosmith Saga (band) DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX The Amber Spyglass The Flintstones Mickey Mouse Rock and roll This Is Spinal Tap Orson Welles Augustan drama DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution EastEnders DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age) Love's Labour's Lost Paul Simon Shakespeare in Love The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Polish theater House music Nirvana (band) Queer as Folk (U.S.) Infantilism Neil Young The Lion King Iron Maiden Oh My Goddess!
