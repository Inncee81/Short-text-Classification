why life sometimes hurt i am hurt many reasons but why life sometimes hurt because life sometimes don't hurt you will not be feeling hurt right now if you haven't felt before the feeling of not being hurt whenever you hurt your subconscious is taking you back to that time when you were not hurting so be aware when this happens it is a clue for your life a clue to where you should be heading and what you should do next when it is just physical pain we instantly know what to do next time for example a child got hurt by playing with fire next time the child will most likely choose not to play with fire but when it is emotional pain the pain sometimes is addicting some people continually subject themselves to this kind of pain just so to feel that they are still capable of feeling and is therefore still alive they know that certain situations will bring them emotional pain but they repeatedly put themselves in those situations that result to pain because they need to feel because it is their way to feel alive although they already know what pain is saying wise people listen when pain comes learn easily from it then move on fools keep feeling pain because they pretend it's not there bless the pain acknowledge that it is there learn from what it is saying then move on Transactional analysis Narcissism Self-harm Pain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Human sexual behavior Alexander Technique Spanking Domestic violence Happiness Diving Addiction Empathy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jon Secada Hypnosis Social rule The Amber Spyglass Breastfeeding Friends Rich Mullins Dualism (philosophy of mind) Goodness and value theory Drug addiction Simone Weil Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Infantilism Unconscious mind Abortion debate Alcoholics Anonymous Theory of conduct Obsessive-compulsive disorder Mortification of the flesh One Tree Hill (TV series) Scientology beliefs and practices Bene Gesserit Traumatic incident reduction Milton H.
