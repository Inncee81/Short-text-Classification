can anybody help me to prove that time does not exist i'm just wondering if anyone else has trouble understanding time can anyone prove it does not exist are there any theories relating to this the only way i can see to prove time doesn't exist is by considering that time is different due to each person's perspective so time is just a consruct of the mind so it's existence is equal to a monster in the cupboard and perhaps even inferior to a scitzophrenic's hallucination depends what you mean by 'time' and 'exist' time in the sense of hours months days etc is a concept created only by man it doesn't exist for animals or even for some primitive people in jungles or deserts something can be said to exist outside of time if it has no beginning or end so we could say that the world is out of time because nobody knows how it began or when it will end Animism Reality The nature of God in Western theology Philosophy of language G__del's incompleteness theorem Philosophy of mathematics Salad Fingers Supernatural Alignment (role-playing games) Causality Psychosis Art Human Labor theory of value Philosophy of perception Supply and demand Hallucination Epistemology Halting problem Creation according to Genesis Culture Atomism Wealth Surplus product Mind Sociocultural evolution Complexity classes P and NP Utilitarianism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Empathy A New Kind of Science Schizophrenia Scientology beliefs and practices Soul Civilization Law of value God Gravity Theory of multiple intelligences The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Scientific method Goodness and value theory Narcissism Predestination Trigonometric function Evolutionary creationism David Hume Summa Theologiae Deconstruction Existence Civil rights Presuppositional apologetics Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Jonestown Meaning of life Surplus value Meme Free will Economic anthropology Imaginary antecedent Qualia Wood carving Cyberspace Calvinism Extreme Programming Witchcraft Technocratic movement Code: Lyoko Clinical depression Phaedo Gaia theory (science) Unemployment Friedrich Schleiermacher Cultural relativism Eschatology Category theory Recursion Miracle The Manchester Regiment Microeconomics Day-Age Creationism Social psychology State Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Substance theory Origin belief Fight Club Monster Hiberno-English Guns, Germs, and Steel Social rule Objectivist philosophy Surplus labour Religion Eternity Parapsychology Immortality Hungarian language Urantia
