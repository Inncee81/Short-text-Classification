i've been struggling with this philosophical paradox people who know descartes well please help me l ok so i've just started reading descartes' discourse on method and meditations and this is actually one of the first classic books on philosophy i've read so bear with my noobish ness if you will please from what i've read descartes infers that from composition comes imperfection and thusly the perfect being or god would have to be void of any form of any sort intelligence mass etc however descartes also strongly believes in the existence of a perfect being from his belief that from imperfection that's us comes dependency upon a higher establishment god but how can an imperfect entity depend upon a void or is this possible because the void can be replaced with any sort of supporting structure that the imperfect entity wishes to conceive of to superrix nope i just picked this book up for the summer descartes or no descartes the relationship between man and god almighty is not what descartes asserts if we try to understand the relationship between mankind and god almighty all becomes clear as per bhagavad gita in hinduism the definition of god almighty is the sum total of all souls atmans in the cosmos in their purified state at any given point of time is what we know as god almighty the definition is simple and logical whether we understand or not depends on our grasp of knowledge and wisdom at the time of big bang it is god almighty that explodes with a big bang the cluster of all purified souls atmans in the cosmos the size of half a thumb god almighty in its prime pure pristine glory due to impact of mother of all explosions the big bang scatter all over cosmos as the rolling ball gathers moss these pristine pure purified souls atmans become impure in their cosmic journey to remove the dross within the embedded impurities god almighty destined all souls atmans to manifest life forms starting the cosmic journey by manifesting the form of an amoeba single cell formation the first manifestation in the cosmic life cycle the soul atman further manifests into multi cell formation then insect life plant life animal life and finally the form of a human being the form of a human being is the highest manifest stage in the cosmic life cycle the sole purpose being eradicating the impurities within forever the form of a human being carries no meaning for god almighty it is simply a means to an end every soul atman manifests a total of million manifestations in the cosmic life cycle only as a human being the soul atman reaches the last leg of cosmic life the millionth manifestation the moment this happens the human being gains enlightenment kaivalya jnana and finally salvation moksha the purpose of human journey being the soul atman within gaining liberation forever from the cycle of birth and death it is the soul atman within and not the form of a human being that carries weight in the cosmic life cycle the entity of a human being vis vis god almighty is of a creator versus the means the form of a human being was destined by god as the highest manifest stage in the cosmic life cycle it could have been the form of a cobra or any other form for that matter as human beings enjoy money as means to an end the existence of human beings vis vis god almighty is exactly the same at no point of time the worthiness of a human being exceeds the purpose it was intended for no doubt in absence of the form of human beings no soul atman can ever regain its prime pristine pure form more on humans beings evolution http www godrealized org humanbeings human being html Advaita Vedanta Religion Reincarnation Moksha Origin belief Big Bang Buddhism Ontological argument Intelligent design Theosophy Upanishad Simone Weil Urantia A Course In Miracles Mantra Origen Cosmology Heaven Sant Thakar Singh Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Al-Ghazali Vedanta Eastern philosophy Animism Original sin Idolatry Atomism Ken Wilber Gnosticism Creationism Immortality Indian caste system Phaedo Adi Da Involution (philosophy) Human nature Trinity Pantheism Eastern Orthodox Church Friedrich Schleiermacher Adi Shankara Atman (Buddhism) Immanuel Kant Fermi paradox Yoga Gottfried Leibniz Age of Enlightenment Brahmanism Divine grace Alchemy Determinism Aum Summa Theologiae Salvation Ramanuja Sikhism primary beliefs and principles Angel Supernatural Merit Philosophy Dharma Taoism Duties of the Heart Sant Mat Swami Vivekananda Hindu Karma in Hinduism Victor Cousin Physical cosmology Deconstruction Ren__ Descartes Hindu deities Sikhism Artificial consciousness Prayer Scientology beliefs and practices Vishnu Islam Rosicrucian Fellowship Monotheism
