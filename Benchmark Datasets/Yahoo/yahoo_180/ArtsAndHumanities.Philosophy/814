what's the difference between nature and god please prove what you say with an appropriate example making a statement isn't going to suffice i agree god is all powerful but then we also refer nature as mother nature doesn't this title itself indicate the supremacy of nature may be both represent the one yurbud the only 'godoscope' i have is faith and i know only that is required god is a knower it is the ultimate knower nature is not a knower it is the totality that always changes they are two distinct ultimate realities however because nature is experienced as always changing under god's laws we may say that god is more fundamental the key question is why god why not just saying nature's law instead of god's laws because when someone has a full inner awakening to the totality of the laws of nature he experiences something that has been reported in the history of mankind as a communion with god so it is natural to refer to god's laws this kind of full awakening is rare but religious people may feel something even with much less awakening there are different levels of awakening in the most basic form we are simply awake within but no details are manifested this kind of experience is easy to obtain this creates positive effects in ourselves and in our environment so it is objectively verifiable make sure you have a technique that is known to work not all techniques are effective for concreteness i propose transcendental meditation it has been extensively studied according to published research it is the most effective it has no religious aspects however if you are religious it may reinforce your religious experience Yoga Sutras of Patanjali God Immanuel Kant Human Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Religion Out-of-body experience Supernatural A Course In Miracles Philosophical skepticism Scientific method Simone Weil Critique of Pure Reason Existence of God Meditation Lucid dreaming Anthroposophy Intelligent design The nature of God in Western theology Anglicanism Eucharist Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Theology Fundamentalism Friedrich Schleiermacher Jewish principles of faith Trimurti Falsifiability Reparative therapy Al-Ghazali Protestantism Presuppositional apologetics Rudolf Steiner Creationism Alcoholics Anonymous Tai Chi Chuan Subud Origin belief Alexander Technique Infantilism Theodicy Idolatry Hindu philosophy Atheism Eastern philosophy Hinduism Science Teach the Controversy Physics Monarchy in Canada Mysticism S__ren Kierkegaard Patent Goodness and value theory Objectivist philosophy Atomism Prayer Causality Meaning of life Consciousness Victor Cousin Morality Summa Theologiae Coercion Religious experience Baptist Predestination Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Charles Grandison Finney Maimonides Soul Mary, the mother of Jesus Roman Catholic Church Buddhism Adi Da Eastern Orthodox Church Sant Thakar Singh Evangelicalism Quantum mechanics Church of Christ, Scientist Guru History of creationism Martial art God and gender Species Graduate school Advaita Vedanta Theosis Michel Henry Justification (theology) Religious studies
