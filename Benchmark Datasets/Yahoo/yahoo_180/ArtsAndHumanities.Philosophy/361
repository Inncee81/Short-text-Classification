what s the resonant frequency of the universe in hz also what's the resonant frequency of our galaxy i know that the earths frequency schumann resonance is hz i'm hoping that there will be a correlation in sacred geometry between our planet the galaxy and the entire universe i would ultimately like to assess the current state of earths collective consciousness by seeing how many steps of sacred geometry are possible in the complete scale the universal resonance divided by the unit measuring each step phi x x would represent the number of steps in the scale what run of the ladder we are currently on i don't know how to do this equation is it universal resonance minus hz divided by x i believe that as the earth and the universe expand the expansion accelerates with every multiple of phi as each alignment slots into place it completes another circuit where superconductive elements resonate with each other in pitches of phi i hope this makes sense to someone nigel im sorry i dont know i failed maths Harmonic oscillator Resonance Big Bang RLC circuit Polarization Gravity Impedance General relativity Transformer Plasma (physics) Gauge theory Magnetic resonance imaging Superconductivity Hubble's law Antenna (radio) Nondimensionalization Maxwell's equations Universe Geodesy Functional magnetic resonance imaging Physical cosmology Helium Physics Circuit design Plasma cosmology Diode Mass spectrometry Many-worlds interpretation Latitude Fermi paradox Timeline of the Universe Axiom Microphone Moon Ionosphere Astrophysics Nuclear magnetic resonance Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Langmuir probe Operational amplifier RC circuit Creationist cosmologies Magnifying Transmitter Synthesizer Permittivity RISC Golden ratio Mathematics Pentagram Central processing unit Guitar Harmonic series (music) Photoelectric effect SAT Planetary orbit Alternating current Musical notation Coriolis effect Equation of state (cosmology) Shape of the universe Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Modified Newtonian dynamics Normal distribution Special relativity Musical tuning Trigonometric function Piano Hilbert space Acoustics Particle accelerator Stairway Tesla coil Explosive material Debye model Frame fields in general relativity Wardenclyffe Tower Solar variation Finite element method Vector (spatial) Non-standard cosmology Gravitational radiation Minor planet Space elevator Frequency Equation of motion S matrix Crystal oscillator EPR paradox Doppler effect Damping Black hole Sound CPU design Pi Astronomy Heim theory Time travel
