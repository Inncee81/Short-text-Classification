if everything was perfect would the world be a better place if everyone did as they were meant to and there was no crime etc would the world be perfect or would it be horrible if everything was perfect would we realise it humanity can never be contented by the scarce resources which this planet provides the distribution of income and wealth amongst society is growing ever further proving that effective demand will always differ between persons due to the varying degrees of purchasing power each holds people strive for more when a person buys a car he or she is no longer content with that car once they have driven it a few times and become used to it they want a bigger faster better car and so people are never content proving so long as we all occupy just one planet perfection cannot exist you must also ask yourself what would happen if your definition of perfection did exist if this were the case we would be living tribally the way we did thousands of years ago if everything was perfect no one person would be in charge so we would all be estranged from one another as we all lived out our perfect lives unemployment would be rife as there would be no need for a police force or armed forces as no crime or war would beseech the planet due to its newfound peace and tranquility the population would spiral out of control as there would likely be millions less deaths every year across the world which would lead to an even lesser subsistence level of foodstuffs and essential products for each global citizen whilst i do not usually try to contradict someone's optimism i do feel in this case it was due i feel that theoretically a state of perfection would in fact cause a non perfect state until an equilibrium came to exist many cultures believe that everything in this world has an opposite your idea of perfection would displace the natural equilibrium we have come to live by and whilst the world would undoubtedly be a better place in the short run it is almost certain in the long run that perfection would deteriorate humanity is not perfect if we were we would not need to study behaviour and the meaning of life and why we are here life would also be a lot less fun i'm sorry if this has become somewhat of an essay i hope i have helped you perhaps to address the other side of the coin i would be glad to continue to discuss this topic with you further via email if you wish Wealth Supply and demand Law of value Economics Capitalism Capital accumulation Surplus value Murder Reality Technocratic movement Evil Economic inequality Monopoly Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Property (ownership right) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tax Overpopulation Species Keynesian economics Indigenous peoples Theory of conduct Labor theory of value Exploitation Famine World government Prices of production Advertising Free trade Economic growth Deflation (economics) Labour economics Biodiversity Globalization Technology Democracy Fermi paradox Guns, Germs, and Steel World War II Computer Infantilism Ethics Entropy Civilization Sexual orientation General equilibrium Federal World Government Theodicy Water (molecule) Anarchism and capitalism Transformation problem Economic anthropology Renewable energy Tribalism Scientology beliefs and practices RISC Summa Theologiae Goodness and value theory CPU cache Anthropology Sustainable development Ecology Friedrich Schleiermacher Brave New World Spanish verbs Abortion debate Sociocultural evolution A Course In Miracles Software engineering Economy of Africa Gross domestic product Monopsony Pacifism Political economy American individualist anarchism Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Nuclear fusion Civil rights Bretton Woods system Privatization Nash equilibrium Arthur Schopenhauer Consensual crime War Urantia Natural monopoly Productive and unproductive labour Kardashev scale
