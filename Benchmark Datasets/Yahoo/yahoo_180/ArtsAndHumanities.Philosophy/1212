what do you make of this quote about faith faith is not equivalent to mere belief faith is the condition of ultimate confidence that we have the capacity to follow the path of doubt to its end stephen batchelor this statement is a good and true statement most people try to twist this and analyze it in a religious context that's where they fail to see the true meaning because they are on the same path of doubt that ends the statement those that dont have faith are on this path of doubt and they can not base their decision and faith off of something they can not possibly know so lets use it in another circumstance love for instance you know your parents love you you have complete and utter faith that your mother and father truely love you there is more than just believing that they love you belief is the ability to base something on fact so faith is not equivalent to mere belief is a correct statement i honestly believe that a man can not jump up from the ground and fly across the sky without the help of a machine there is no way i could have faith that this will happen i cant have faith that a man can fly its impossible i do not believe it can possibly happen there is no way to build a basis of faith on that back to love if you were in a situation that required your father to die for you because he loved you do you think that he would if someone was holding you hostage and they had your dad there and said we are either going to kill your daughter or you can step in and we will kill you and your daughter is absolutely free to go im sure you have absolute faith that your father would step in and die for you you would have ultimate confidence that your father would make that decision because you have faith in his love for you the part about the path of doubt is not for those who have the faith its for those that doubt the outcome the path of doubt in mr batchlor's statement is a generic term covering anything that people would have doubt about those with faith have no doubts and are willing to walk down that path someone from the outside looking at the situation with you and your father and him having to make a decision to give his life for yours would be on the same path toward the outcome however they would have doubts because they have no clue about your past or the possibility of your father's love for you you are the one that has the faith you are willing to go down the path because you know your faith provides you with ultimate confidence in a given outcome since those who are not in the situation can not have faith that your father could possibly love you enough to die for you they cant have faith they could not have a condition where they have ultimate confidence in the decision your father is to make so they will have doubts and are unable to follow the path of doubt to the end with a concrete ability to know the outcome hence they would have no faith here lets wrap it up like this i have a goal that i want to lose pounds i believe i can lose it it will just take a lot of hard work do i have faith that i can nope my lack of faith is based upon my love for food and the fact that i have failed in the past but i still have a belief that if i really worked on it that i could lose pounds there is still no faith there so down my path of doubt to see if i can lose pounds there is no ultimate confidence that my faith of losing the weight is there so there is doubts twist it back again to religion i believe there is a god i believe there is a heaven do i have faith that i will get to heaven no there are doubts there because i do not know the outcome i do not know if my life is good enough to be allowed into the kingdom of heaven however i have ultimate confidence that god is there waiting for us all there are no
