philosophy exactly how many years comprise a generation sorry guys my computer is acting really weird y a doesn't look anything like it did this past year for me now and i deliberately wanted to ask you guys this question but the only way to get my pc to catagorize it in philosophy was to type the word with the question think i'll have to do it like that from now on i don't know what happened but i've tried everything i know of to fix it and so far to no avail i agree with mike twenty years is traditional but one also has to take into account other factors as well for example a generation consists of a parent and siblings and the next generation consists of a child and siblings here's where it gets tricky suppose two brothers are years apart in age the older brother has his first child john at age the year his younger brother is born the younger brother has his first child tom at age the same year john turns john and tom first cousins are of the same genealogical generation but are two generations apart socially speaking if john and tom have children early and late in life then that generation second cousins would be even further apart socially but still of the same genealogical generation it boggles the mind at least i'm boggled how about you Family Epistemology Prolog Heir Apparent Theory of conduct Order of succession Philosophy of language Abortion debate Saint Peter Generation Y Incest 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Origin belief Historical Jesus Muhammad U.S. presidential election, 2008 Young Earth creationism Ludwig Wittgenstein Infantilism Intelligence quotient Victor Cousin Emperor of Japan Miss Saigon Friends Hearing impairment John Searle David Hume Adoption Objectivist philosophy Falsifiability Philosophy Sub-Zero Child sexuality The nature of God in Western theology Arab History Education in Portugal Humphrey Bogart Barack Obama Fiddler on the Roof Soul Kibbutz Noam Chomsky Boggle Karen Horney The Dukes of Hazzard Determinism Louise of Hesse Age disparity in sexual relationships Occam's Razor Shaka Domestic violence Blood purity (Harry Potter) A Course In Miracles Motion picture rating system Henry IV of France Causality Nicomachean Ethics My Life as a Teenage Robot Transactional analysis Modal auxiliary verb The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Wonderland (McFly album) Discordianism One Life to Live Western philosophy Family name Sons of Noah Economics Bernard Williams Taken Skateboarding trick Modernism Ashoka John the Baptist Time Out of Mind Meme Autism Deconstruction Genealogy John Berryman Primogeniture Class (computer science) Bob and George Mary, the mother of Jesus Biology and sexual orientation Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Brian Griffin Allergy Postmodernism Metaphysics Martin Heidegger Wyatt Earp Rais massacre Opus Dei William James Kyle Broflovski Islamic philosophy
