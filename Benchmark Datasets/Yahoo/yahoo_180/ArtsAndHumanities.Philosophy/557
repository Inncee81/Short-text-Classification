if we do not have natural freedom of choice then why do some people like bach or mozart while others hate it some people claimed that our behaviors are biologically determined if that is the case however how do we account for subjective tastes in music food or significant others classical music is my test case in this question because some people love it whereas other people hate it cee i do not believe in the soul as that concept has been traditionally formulated by plato plotinus descartes or most christians it seems to me that consciousness is a result of neurobiological processes even free will is possibly a result of neuronal activity every human is born with a free will as mentioned above by others environment conditions the mind our parents train us but as we grow older we learn to make choices we happen to live in a country that boasts it's freedom if we were to live in some other countries we would not be afforded the freedom to make choices what so ever having behaviors being biologically determined is completely different than having tastes determined behaviors and tastes really aren't the same a genetic disposition would basically control a person's behavior and are usually irreversable but it is rare to affect every seed within the blood line where as tastes can be conditioned as to culture society availabilities religion etc they can also be unconditioned as well Human nature Human Free will Gender role Psychology Cognitive science Sexual orientation Soul Meaning of life Moral objectivism Brain Sociocultural evolution Death Behaviorism Abortion debate Addiction Nature versus nurture Biology Species Theodicy Predestination Meme Culture Sex Evil Social psychology Coercion Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Neuroscience Francis Crick Emotion Economics Emergence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Scientific method Rudolf Steiner Autism Determinism Simone Weil Radical behaviorism Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Eugenics Mind Natural selection Franz Boas Controversies in autism Artificial consciousness Objectivist philosophy Schizophrenia Anthropology Organic food Neuro-linguistic programming Anthroposophy Friedrich Schleiermacher Science Cancer Second language acquisition Community Mind control Philosophy Medicine Victor Cousin Morality Reality Immanuel Kant Marriage Supernatural Social justice Narcissism Altruism Dualism (philosophy of mind) Eric R.
