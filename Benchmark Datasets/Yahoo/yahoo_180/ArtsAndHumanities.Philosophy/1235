do you know what your face looks like in real life how do you actually know what your face looks like if you never seen it yeah you say the mirror but the mirror can show a whole bunch of other images and it is a reflection which means it is not exact you have never seen your face at all how do you know what you like to other people if you have never seen your face i am the only person who can see your face and tell you what you look like but can you tell me what my face looks like and don't say a mirror i want to see the exact image of my full body i want to see my face also as much as you don't seem to like mirrors i know what my face looks like because of my mirror i know what i look like in the mirror because i trust the mirror i inspected it checked for cracks made sure it was completely flat cleaned it all these things i did with my eye so that i could trust what my eye saw in the mirror the mirror may be perverted but if it is i can check the mirror if i find it's perversion i will know not to trust that mirror we have to learn to trust things that we do not experience ourselves if we do not will will miss out on knowledge that we either don't have time to understand or don't have the brain power and require someone to explain it to us if we only relied on the things we have seen and done what would you not know or not understand besides a mirror is an object it has nothing to gain or lose by not telling the truth people on the other hand may lie and distort because that person may have something to gain or lose and also what would you trust more a person telling you what your face looks like or a mirror a person may alter what they tell you depending one what they think of you if they like you you will be prettier if they do not like you you will be uglier but a mirror allows you to see exactly what they see so long as it is clean and fixed and you trust the mirror Mirror Current teachings of Prem Rawat Social rule Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Epistemology Shen Gong Wu Theory of conduct Wallpaper group Lie Stereoscopy Determinism Goatse.cx Scientology beliefs and practices Amateur telescope making Color Point groups in three dimensions Redundant array of independent disks Social psychology Rudolf Hermann Lotze Human Telescope Magic (illusion) Mirror neuron Datalore (TNG episode) Milton H.
