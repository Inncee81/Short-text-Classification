to be better at giving unconditional love do we need to increase our unconditional happiness it seems to me that every test or initiation i've ever had includes a challenge of being happy and harmonious regardless of circumstances what do you think sunman i agree with happiness being dependent on meanings do we carry a list of new meanings with us or are they primally at our core to be drawn up sunman power of action we assign is that also meaning is chi dependent on how we have used our energy including meaning yes definitely for years when i had depression i struggled to become a better person so i could be happy it was so draining and it never worked finally a friend lent me a book called the gospel for everyday life or something like that reading that book changed by life because it gave me the opportunity to be unconditionally happy with myself i had always thought jesus would forgive me when i overcame my weaknesses while reading that book something powerfully told my heart i call it a witness of the spirit that jesus already forgave me for my inadequacies even though i still had them this discovery gave me the power to be happy just as i am and it has increased my love for other people so much unconditional love for self leads to unconditional happiness which leads to unconditional love for others i'm still working on being unconditionally loving not there yet but the goal actually seems possible now that i can love myself just as i am without fear of my happiness deserting me because of some silly thing that i might do A Course In Miracles Trinity Salvation Merit Opus Dei Calvinism Current teachings of Prem Rawat Goodness and value theory Holy Spirit John Howard Yoder Summa Theologiae Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Nonviolence Five points of Calvinism John the Baptist Eastern Orthodox Church Gospel of John Sola fide Ken Keyes, Jr. Ten Commandments Objectivist philosophy Divine grace Meaning of life Acts of the Apostles Gospel of Thomas Charles Grandison Finney Theory of conduct Love Gospel Numerology Book of Mormon Predestination Baptism Unconditional election Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Christian eschatology W.I.T.C.H.
