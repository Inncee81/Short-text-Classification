are living creatures higher dimensional 'solids' intersecting this or dimensional realm a d solid intersects a d plane creating a d object within that plane eg a sphere intersecting a plane creates a circle what would a d object look like when it intersects a d space it would appear to be a d object why could we not be say dimensional creatures for example intersecting this d world d including time giving rise to our d existence in other words all we see is the tip of our iceberg in fact a single d object may appear as several disparate d objects in this d realm for those who believe we are all one this is not spiritual mumbo jumbo higher dimensional solids have been studied by mathematicians and physicists for over a century string theory even predicts the existence of higher dimensional objects im totally with you on this one i agree allot of the things we see could easily be d you know we have just only the ability to see in d's same for colour and everything i think its ridiculous to think what we see is all there is like other animals see thinks differently like sharks can pick up on electricity how does the world look like to a shark surly that is also reality and sharks are limited to how they see the world just like us makes you really think what could be out in space on another planet crazy shit funny how people assume and accept everything around us good question man Regular polytope Manifold Dimension Intelligent design World line Collision detection Science String theory Vacuum Geometry Special relativity M-theory Mathematics Random walk Complex number God Black hole Supply and demand Many-worlds interpretation Supernatural Physics Philosophy of space and time Plane (Dungeons & Dragons) Euclidean geometry Point groups in three dimensions Spacetime Artificial consciousness Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Meaning of life Bah__'__ Faith and Science Numerology Fractal Origin belief Arthur Cayley Philosophy of perception Mathematician Polarization Ecco the Dolphin Lorentz group Sefer Yetzirah 3-sphere Philosophy of mathematics Etheric plane Fermi paradox Topology Microeconomics Aristotle Quantum mechanics Perspective projection distortion Duality (projective geometry) Loop quantum gravity Geodesy Hyperbolic geometry Dynamical system Force (Star Wars) A Course In Miracles Spiritual evolution Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Predestination Infinity Summa Theologiae Multiverse Astronomy Planetary orbit Extraterrestrial hypothesis D-brane Cartesian coordinate system Superstring theory Friedrich Schleiermacher M.C.
