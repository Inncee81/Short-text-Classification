when you do something wrong how important are the reasons why for example you fell off the wagon you hit your little sister you broke a promise you hit someone with a car or took something that isn't yours etc the bad deed is done should the why you did it be an important or mitigating factor what's your opinion yes i think the why can be an important factor it represents what is in your heart and also what caused the event to happen for instance if you are having a bad day or just want to be mean or think its ok for the bigger to dominate the smaller then that makes it very wrong to hit your little sister on the other hand if she is hitting you taking your things or you have asked her to leave you alone then you do it while still not right or good it is more understandable so i think the why often helps us explain ourselves to others and also find understanding for ourselves we cant grow and change and eliminate our wrongs if we dont understand why we are doing them what triggers us what our motivations are Nicomachean Ethics Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Kodocha Pitaten Karma Poker jargon Sport utility vehicle The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Book of Five Rings Bon Jovi Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Aliens of London Phoebe Halliwell Consensus decision-making Current teachings of Prem Rawat Social rule Diving Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Insurance Utilitarianism Social psychology Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gross domestic product Kimi Finster Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Conker's Bad Fur Day CPU cache Causality Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Ozone depletion Chrono Trigger Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Law of value Ranma __ characters Microeconomics Cross site scripting Assassination Escape from New York Contract Meaning of life Goodness and value theory Debugging Theodicy EastEnders Ozone hole Milton H.
