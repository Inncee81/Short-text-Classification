are people confusing absolute truth with ultimate truth i believe in absolute truth but it seems that most people when they say absolute truth are talking about ultimate truth to me absolute truths are truths that are literally undisputable my prime example of such truth is the fact of existence i argue that existence exists the fact of existence cannot be challenged to say existence doesn't exist is a contradiction and supports the fact that existence truly exists any time we use a verb to be we confirm the existence of existence existence is a fact and an absolute truth i use the term absolute truth in the same way that a person might refer to an absolute value when i listen to and read most conversations and debates on the subject of absolute truth it seems that most people are talking about ultimate truth ultimate truth refers to some point of view that is superior to all other points of view god loves you or one plus two is three are relative and disputable facts but everyone knows existence is true you are speaking of real truth or scientific truth also known as concrete truth as you have stated the continuum of perception must exist for it to be discussed absolute truth is a moral concept that states that something is true in all situations and all places this is obviously a false concept because what may be good for you may be bad for me winners and losers the ultimate truth can of course never be know by us because it is infinitely more complex than the human mind can contain this is obviously true because the mind must also understand itself while it is understanding itself the catalog problem Epistemology Reality Truth Philosophy of mathematics Existence of God Theodicy Cultural relativism God Goodness and value theory S__ren Kierkegaard Free will Logic Atheism Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Determinism Philosophy of language Moral relativism The nature of God in Western theology Friedrich Schleiermacher Victor Cousin New Testament Religious pluralism Ethics G__del's incompleteness theorem Creationism Summa Theologiae Relativism Objectivist philosophy Philosophy of science Scientific method Sexual orientation Evil Nihilism Advaita Vedanta Postmodernism Ontological argument Deconstruction Slander and libel Creation-evolution controversy Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Science Philosophy of space and time Supernatural Liberal Christianity Michel Henry Problem of universals Philosophical skepticism Roman Catholic Church Max Stirner A Course In Miracles Religion Philosophy Kitsch Socrates Law of value Infinity Simone Weil Rudolf Hermann Lotze Mythology David Hume Vacuous truth Meaning of life Morality Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Human Ten Commandments Predestination Complex number Moral objectivism Lie Falsifiability Phillip E.
