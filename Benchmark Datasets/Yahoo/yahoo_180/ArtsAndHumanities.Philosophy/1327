why do you think suicide is wrong explain does anyone disagree listen to my perspective for a sec don't get angry try to understand sometimes i don't think suicide is a big deal it's not wrong and other days i think it is a cruel and selfish act i just saw the movie dead poets society the elephant man and i was reading about people who suffer from the fish odor syndrome http abclocal go com kgo story section these are just a few examples forget about religion for a sec it may not exist if someone is miserable then aren't we the selfish ones to tell them not to killl themselves for the sake of others i've been in positions where i thought life was absolutely unbearable you haven't been in my position to understand there were times when i just wanted to end it all i'm just saying if someone wants to die let them die it s better to rip than to be alive and live in hell don t bother answering if you're going to say something without putting it in deep thought additional details seconds ago tomorrow is another day and i might disagree with what i am saying now it all depends on the situation we have been raised in a society which that makes us fear death we need to be the leaders and not the followers think for ourselves hi i do not believe that anybody that is seriously considering suicide has not put in a lot of serious thought how far have you got do you have plans can you rate your mood on a scale of have you attempted suicide before no i have not been in exactly your position to know how you feel only you know that that is why you have to try to protect yourself no matter what anybody says or does the decision is entirely yours and if that is what you decide then no one can really stop you no matter how much we may want to as you have asked the question here are my thoughts as an ex social worker i know how sh life can be i know that people have massive problems that seem to get worse day by day that they see no way forward i do not have a religion so it is not religion that directs my opinion it is experience of working with people who are incredibly low as you are now i worked with a year old boy he was sexually abused by both of his elder brothers and his father from being about years old his entire family including his mother and sister had spent a lot of time in prison he had had dozens of social workers mental health workers child psychology assessments school liaison workers tests and help etc liam was an expert on the system nothing could help liam nobody could help him he was desperate he could see no future there was no peace at home in care at school on the street the police knew the family well the debt collectors and drug dealers hung around him he was moved around by the system but always ran away and returned home he was frequently beaten up liam had no trust nobody trusted him and he trusted nobody if i have made any difference in social work it was with liam and that has been enough for the hell of the job social work was i was newly qualified liam was a hopeless case everybody knew it and all could see his future as clearly as he could himself i worked with him made no impression on him whatsoever just another idiot do gooder that didn't understand at the penultimate meeting with liam he told me i was a sh less whore and that i would never understand fear as he did i agreed liam was only but ' about stones i kneeled on the floor and asked him to trust me he stood above me threatening me i sat on the floor and asked him to trust me he clenched his fists and moved within inches of my face i lay on the floor in the feotal position and told him to put his boot on my nose i was totally vulnerable totally stupid newly qualified and idealist i would have been de registered if anybody in the school or social services had found out about it i was a total fool he could have killed me there was no reason for him not to he hated social workers liam pressed his doc martin against my face this lad was a hard case from a hard family who police would not visit unless in pairs i tried to relax but was too scared i was shaking he held me there with his foot for maybe three minutes it was an eternity then liam reached down put his hand out for me to help me up tears streaming down both our faces he said 'i trust you' that was all it took for liam he still had a sh life but he changed his attitude completely overnight he asked for special lessons after school which everybody was very willing to provide within months instead of truanting liam was coming top in every subject he is an incredibly smart lad his life would have been unbearable for a lot of people liam got a gcse exams all the work was done in that last year he went on to university and now does amazing work with the most troubled kids yep you guessed he is a social worker but liam is a talented social worker far more skilled than i ever was he is greatly respected and i heard he is being fast tracked he deserves it he has a great girlfriend a great car and they are buying a flat together liam is happy he remembers me and lets me know the good stuff in his life for that i am grateful you are not liam but perhaps one day other people will be as grateful that you are alive as the kids who are helped by liam are he does the hardest child protection work that others burn out in years in he is incredible you may be too how do you know what tomorrow may hold hang on in there tonight and see your gp or anybody you can for help tomorrow you may just need a prescription to help you through or a referral hang on just one night til tommorow one day your experience may be the very thing that stops other people from suffering as you are doing now The Amber Spyglass Milton H.
