the nature of balance i think alot about things in fact if your interested with this new idea i have maybe you can click on my avatar and see my last question back to the subject i have been thinking about the balance and nature and how people say humans disrupt this balance but arent we also built into the balance of nature sure you can argue that we mass produce our food so we are constantly growing no matter if there is a drought or famine but i think that our minds are different so we would all polarize to different groups and fight each other i hear people say that they wish there could be world peace but its part of nature we are made to fight each other so we dont overproduce like in this video i saw about an island in the pacific there is an airborne fungus that gets into almost ever species on the island and kills them after the fungus kills them it spreads to the rest of the colony if its an ant i found this fascinating because it was the balance of nature at its purest form there is no question mr pillmd i simply want to know people's views on how we humans fit into the nature of this planet saying that violence is unnatural and is learned is extremely false your reasoning in that i dont get it counters itself if you learn something that is not part of the human nature then where did the person who taught you it get it from please excuse my wacky answer but i didn't wan to tailor it too much my gut said this when i read your question protons neutrons and electrons one whole with a core of positive and neutral and the surrounding negative in a pure form of anything this is what happens violence is a term we give when we don't psychologically appreciate what's happening other life forms might try to survive but when a natural disaster so to say happens to humans we must take zoloft for ptsd nothing wrong with this because we're humans i think violence is a term best used away from nature and better applied when referencing human behavior violent murder violent rape etc i think that using violent to describe nature equates an earthquake with a rape and on many levels that is wrong although survivors of both will likely feel violated then it all goes back to our human understanding of what just happened food for thought take good care sense Theory of conduct Evil Abortion debate Ethics Theodicy Scientology beliefs and practices Rape Human Supernatural Cyberspace Motivation Simone Weil Goodness and value theory Cult Science Religion Determinism Logic Post-traumatic stress disorder Sexual orientation David Hume Social psychology Aikido Alignment (role-playing games) Democracy Gravity Microeconomics A Course In Miracles Supply and demand Morality Peter Singer Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Capital punishment Psychology Intelligent design Economics Soul Meaning of life Happiness Overpopulation Philosophy of language Culture Altruism Radical behaviorism God Philosophical skepticism Meme Free will Homophobia Theology John Howard Yoder Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Disaster Discordianism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Deconstruction Summa Theologiae Immanuel Kant Friedrich Schleiermacher Homosexuality and Christianity Traumatic incident reduction Pacifism Nicomachean Ethics Child sexual abuse Scientific method Community Utilitarianism Mind Property (ownership right) God Emperor of Dune Rudolf Hermann Lotze Serial killer Mathematics War Cultural relativism Obi-Wan Kenobi Famine Victor Cousin Law of value Noam Chomsky Hypnosis Anarcho-primitivism Species Creationism Neuro-linguistic programming Geography
