did god create adam and eve or adam and steve actually god created adam and lillith lillith was an unpleasant woman because whenever adam slept with her she gave birth to demons adam eventually chased lillith away because he wanted to be on top during sex and she refused so then god made adam another woman out of flesh and blood and bones but this process disgusted adam and he rejected this model of female so god waited until adam was asleep and stole a rib from adam and used that to create eve and that made adam happy genesis aludes to this story this at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh notice the phrase at last why would he have said that if eve was god's first try although there are other variations in judaic mythology some ancient jews believed that man used to have a tail and eve was created from adam's now removed tail and hence the reason humans have tailbones another judaic myth supposes that adam and eve used to be back to back with god separating them but that almost certainly comes from a well known greek myth the discrepency is caused by the variations on the creation myths of the jews what we know of as genesis owes much to the sumerian myth of creation where the first woman is made from the rib of the first man ninti her name was literally lady of the rib and sumerian mythology predates judaism by thousands of years the final version of genesis which has persisted to this day was probably written around b c a time when most of what judaism had copied from other religions had been forgotten as being of other origin that is the proper scientific explaination on this silly little story now if you are going to try and use it as a lever to condon hatred and prejudice i can only hope that you will one day burn in hell for being such a base bigot it's a shame that people like you vote Adam and Eve Deluge (mythology) Creationism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lilith Genesis Origin belief Devil Day-Age Creationism God Evolutionary creationism Original sin Satan Religion Fallen angel Young Earth creationism Mythology Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Judaism Creation according to Genesis God and gender Angel Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Hell Gnosticism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Human Sacrifice Sin Ten Commandments Soul Mesopotamian mythology The Amber Spyglass Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Prophet Reincarnation Resurrection of Jesus Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Noahide Laws History of creationism Paradise Lost Demon Pre-Adamite Supernatural Documentary hypothesis Christian views of women Criticisms of Christianity Flood geology Creation-evolution controversy Jewish views of religious pluralism Noah's Ark Rei Ayanami Christian Identity Jews as a chosen people Vampire Bible N__wa Characters of The Sandman El (god) Justification (theology) Mormonism and Judaism Tamriel Creation science The Fall of Man Grimke Sisters Maya mythology Theodicy Resurrection Yeshu Biblical inerrancy Eschatology Moses Norse mythology Zoroastrianism Christianity and anti-Semitism Genealogies of Genesis Jewish mythology Religion and sexuality Atheism Sabbath Hera Eastern Orthodox Church Roman mythology Harrowing of Hell Artemis Kashrut Japanese mythology Jew Names of God in Judaism Garden of Eden Arab Storytelling Mitochondrial Eve Nuwaubianism
