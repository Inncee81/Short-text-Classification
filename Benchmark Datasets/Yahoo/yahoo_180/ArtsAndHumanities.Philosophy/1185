if god asked you do something would it be right because god asked you or would god ask you because it is good basically i am trying to get your thoughts on divine command theory no right answer only better and worse ones some people in debate circles are scared to admit the latter which says that god asks you because it's good this infers a couple of things which are that there is some set of standards morals higher than god and therefore it puts into doubt that god is the highest being and limits god being that is supposed to be infinite this demonstrates these set of standards can exist apart from god therefore negating some theological arguments that morality cannot exist without a god when it comes to number i don't really care about whether or not god is bound to a set of standards or if this set of standards is higher than him that set is not a being and he is still the highest being and who cares if he is limited by this a being can be both limited and unlimited at the same time the set of all integers is limited to integers but it is still unlimited by virtue of the fact that it is an infinite set as for number it would still have to be explained how these set of standards got ingrained into a random species out of all of the various species here on earth my best bet is that god asked you because it is good to ask if something would be right only because god asked you is to in a sense ask a nonsensical question which is a fallacy on the grandest scale you're essentially asking can god make something that is not good i e bad good a thing can not be both a and non a at the same time and for a timeless god if something was bad yesterday and is good today that makes for a self contradiction look if you go to mcdonalds and ask can i get one of your whoppers the drive thru guy can't really answer yes or no because it's a confused question anyway so he has to say we don't sale whoppers so when you say if god asked you to do something would it be right because god asked you it's a confused question also because it infers a self contradictory system where something that was not good yesterday can be good today if there's one thing we can agree upon about goodness is that it must be the same everyday and everytime if you disagree with that proposal email me anyway that's my take on it it may turn out to not be philosophically sound but i gave it a shot i'm no philosopher The nature of God in Western theology Intelligent design Infinity God Victor Cousin Theodicy Free will Theory of conduct Philosophy of language G__del's incompleteness theorem Meaning of life Falsifiability Philosophy of mathematics Religion Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Cosmological argument Creationism Existence of God Ontological argument Ethics Phaedo Supernatural Friedrich Schleiermacher Causality Resurrection of Jesus Origin belief Charles Darwin's views on religion Goodness and value theory Philosophical skepticism Axiomatic set theory Presuppositional apologetics Summa Theologiae Socrates Naturalistic fallacy Doomsday argument Moral relativism Fallacy Biblical inerrancy David Hume Immanuel Kant Determinism Transcendental argument for the existence of God Paradox Evil History of creationism Human nature Truth Creation-evolution controversy Philosophy of science Existence The Origin of Species Kuzari Philosophy Creation science Predestination Species Philo Contradiction Merit Consciousness Young Earth creationism John Wycliffe William A.
