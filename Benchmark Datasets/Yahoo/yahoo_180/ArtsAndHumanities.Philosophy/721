is my boss the enemy or am i my own enemy should i ask my boss if he hates me are my emotions imaginary in my head why would they be b c they feel so real i am interning somewhere and my performance and confidence has plummeted because i strongly feel that my boss hates me he has good reasons to hate me because now i sound like a complete retard when i speak to a customer i know that he is listening to see what i do which makes me even more uncomfortable i begin to stutter and i can't think straight or i say things that don't make sense i am not comfortable i have tried to change and have even asked him for advice but i still feel shiitte he gives me these tasks to get me out of the office really lame the thing is that i know that he thinks i am an idiot should i say something he is going to evaluate me soon should i ask him to be honest with me you guys gave me wonderful advice that you so much the ten point system is unfair because so many of you deserve tens you put your heart and soul into this i thank you realize that to err is human and that all you can do is act for the best outcome effect that you can see is viable at any given moment so the imperative is to pay close attention to every moment mindfulness if you accept that at some point you are likely to make a mistake you can concentrate instead on being mindful of the present moment to decrease the likelyhood of a mistakes occurance you will be alive and well regardless of the outcome of this job nothing can likely happen to you to effect your well being even if you lose your job as there are always more jobs as far as your boss hating you understand that we are reflective creatues it's how we relate to one another right down to our neurophysiology mirror neurons if you are kind to him and mindful then you will be giving everything that could be expected more so let go of your opinion that your boss must like you just be truly kind to him in spite of any caulusness just accept whatever anger he vents as his own delusion after all anger is not conducive to rational thought try to let go of the importance of the job and your boss by realizing there is life after them and in addition to them i would also suggest taking up a practice of breath insight meditation it will help you deal with anxiety and life quality stuff hang in there Theory of conduct Milton H.
