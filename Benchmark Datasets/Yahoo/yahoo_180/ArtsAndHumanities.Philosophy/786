for people like me who believe that humans should really focus should really focus on the fact that species are disspearing we are selfish we are not really trying to help them for example we could build a big cage like a park in antartica and put the polar bears there they might not like it but it is all we can do it's too late to worry about pollution now who agrees and what can we do i for one am all for genetic diversity however meddling with nature to such a dramatic extent that you are suggesting seems like an even greater destruction of natural flow sure it sounds nice saving the animals but in truth all that is doing is throwing the engine in reverse for evolution species are always disappearing less than one tenth of a percent of all species that have ever evolved on this planet are still alive today as the environment changes unfit creatures will die off and new ones will come to replace them that is nature and frankly i'm just fine with sitting back and watching it happen an individual's responsibility is not to preserve the world as it is our responsibility is to try to preserve our genetic information if the manner in which humans are going about this evolutionary imperative is wrong then we will disappear morals have nothing to do with it Biodiversity Extinction Evolution Natural selection Human Species The Origin of Species Meme Ecology Ethics Macroevolution Human nature Conservation ethic Culture Altruism Theory of conduct The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Meaning of life Biology Gene Abortion debate Creationism Evidence of evolution Franz Boas Evolutionary psychology Whale Ozone depletion Game theory Validity of human races Charles Darwin Y chromosome Science Human extinction Sociocultural evolution Objectivist philosophy Transhumanism Evolutionism Fermi paradox Teleological argument Shaggy dog story Seabird Goodness and value theory Ozone hole Dinosaur Creation-evolution controversy Genetics Evil Life Green economics Wealth Sperm Whale Reproduction Theodicy Human skin color The Skeptical Environmentalist Diversity Color Whaling Artificial selection The Selfish Gene Capitalism Human evolution Creatures Conservatism Social justice Animal testing Junk DNA Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Bernard Williams Evolutionary creationism Genetic engineering Immortality Dog Organic farming Earth Shifting cultivation Insect Extraterrestrial life DNA repair Ernst Mayr Common descent Utilitarianism Memetics Humpback Whale Population bottleneck Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Simone Weil Deforestation Free will Molecular evolution Sexual orientation Peter Singer Unemployment Created kind Intelligence quotient Irreducible complexity
