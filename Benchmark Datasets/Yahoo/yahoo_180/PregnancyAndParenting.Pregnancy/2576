rd tri is this the flu or what hey i just called my ob's nurse to ask her about these symptoms i'm having but she has to call me back so i thought while i wait might as well get some other opinions plus i'd rather do home remedies than medicine so if you can help i'm almost weeks pregnant i'm congested and achy everywhere and i've had a sinus headache for days now tylenol hasn't really helped with the headache i'm so easily worn out i can't do much for housework and i also feel sick to my stomach like eating food makes me feel even worse could i have the flu even if i don't what can i do to feel better it sounds like you might have a sinus infection sinusitis since are so congested and having headaches pain and fatigue low grade fever could also be causing your tiredness lack of appetite and general feelings of being unwell the flu would be accompanied by a lot of coughing and would have started with very high fever so you can rule that out you can try nasal spray for the congestion or breathing in hot steam with a towel over your head if it is very severe you might have to break down and see a doctor to get an antibiotic safe for pregnancy i know it seems early in the season to be getting sinus problems but everyone i know including myself has gotten something similar to what you're describing this month weird Chronic fatigue syndrome Common cold Pneumonia Influenza Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Sinusitis Infectious mononucleosis Hay fever Traumatic brain injury Nasal congestion Breastfeeding Group A streptococcal infection Paracetamol Lyme disease Malaria Psoriasis First aid Cluster headache Miscarriage Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Trichinosis Coeliac disease Migraine Urinary incontinence Babe Ruth Pregnancy Prostate cancer Foodborne illness Diarrhea Aspergillosis Aspartame Avian influenza H5N1 Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hepatitis C Folic acid Obstetrics Cephalexin Dialysis Bubonic plague Multiple chemical sensitivity Clinical depression Hyperthermia Decompression sickness Rocky Mountain spotted fever Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stroke Cirrhosis Sleep apnea Reflexology Herpes simplex virus Dehydration Trazodone Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Guinea pig Yarrow Withdrawal Botulism Tuberculosis Paget's disease of bone Syphilis Childbirth Anthrax Leukemia Legionellosis Rubella AIDS Headache Shock Sulfasalazine Psychosis Cancer Medicine Upper respiratory tract infection Ehrlichiosis Hypertension Hepatitis Pandemic Typhus Typhoid fever Gonorrhoea Dog Marburg virus Altitude sickness Hip fracture Hypoglycemia Multiple sclerosis Abortion Methamphetamine Diabetes mellitus Premature birth
