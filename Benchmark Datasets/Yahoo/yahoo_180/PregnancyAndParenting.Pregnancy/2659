what happens if an umbilical cord is not cut off does it dry up and then fall off and what's the point of cutting it off if it does just fall off on its own this is after the placenta is birthed and such cutting the umbilical cord is simply a matter of convenience if left the cord will eventually detach on it own however there are two aspects which make it a great deal more convenient for most people to hurry the process the first is the detachment of the placenta from the mother this is not always immediate and can take several minutes possibly up to an hour not cutting the cord would therefore require that the baby remain attached to the mother until the placenta detaches secondly it can take up to days or more for the cord to dry up and fall off on its own added to this to stop it from rotting a great deal of care and assistance has to be taken by the mother to air the placenta and cord as well as assist the drying process there is an interesting article by a fellow new zealander describing her experience of this natural process referred to as lotus birth i have provided the link below for you to read as you will see it is not a process that the majority of women today would wish to engage in Childbirth Placenta Obstetrics Pregnancy Sexual reproduction Twin Fetus Cord blood bank Cord blood Bone marrow transplant Textile manufacturing Amniotic sac Avalanche Caesarean section Placental abruption Birth weight Spina bifida Space Shuttle external tank Urinary incontinence Comanche Breastfeeding Adoption Umbilical vein STS-51-L Miscarriage Parachute Gemini 9A Wood fuel Sling (weapon) Charles Goodyear Placenta praevia Pregnancy (mammals) STS-61 Knots Landing Circulatory system Flag Naval Station Norfolk STS-114 Diaper Hamster Upholstery Drowning Project Gemini Leukemia Violin Bungee jumping Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Casting Sri Aurobindo Psoriasis Tonality Creationism Battle of France Childfree Cerebral palsy Leather The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Umbilicus Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Dairy Air New Zealand Astral projection Science Midwifery Xbox 360 Urination Jute Mountaineering Paragliding Dead Like Me Fertility awareness Polyethylene terephthalate Diving suit Stopping power Menstrual cup Scuba set Thuja plicata Theory of conduct Mouse (computing) Homunculus Vanilla Abdomen Second language acquisition Cephalic disorder Coffee In vitro fertilisation Hillary Rodham Clinton Microphone Textile manufacturing terminology Power cord Glossary of climbing terms Gettysburg Address Blood type USS Walker (DD-517)
