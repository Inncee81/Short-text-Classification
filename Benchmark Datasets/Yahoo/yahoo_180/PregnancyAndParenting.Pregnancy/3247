really need someone to talk to please what are the chances on friday last week july th i had sex condom broke and i took plan b within hours of it happening i had my period on july rd of last month days after taking the pills this past thursday i began spotting the spotting seemed mostly like old blood i finally stopped yesterday and today seem to have some clear discharge left over it's not much though i'm very nervous i love my boyfriend and used all the protection i can and promise myself i will go on birth control a s a p it's just a matter of hiding it from my mom i'm not ready for a baby at all i don't think it's possible i have no symptoms but during the week i was spotting i kinda felt menstrual cramps nothing really i'm starting to think it was just in my mind from being scared i'm not due for my period till august th and have been praying that i'm not pregnant please tell me the chances when the condom broke he pulled out as he cummed anyway please give me good advice and tell me i'm not preg it's almost statistically impossible there should have been no egg in your body ready to be fertilized we know the route to conception works like this period day one is day one of your monthly cycle during your period the egg is expelled from your body in the fluid that would have supported your growing embryo if there was one like an egg yolk supporting the growing chick several different hormones mastermind this the hormone that ripens an egg can't be present when the hormone that signals that the egg has died begins to circulate etc your bleeding was likely breakthrough bleeding from the plan b which we know works to induce your period chemically just since you had just had your period there was almost nothing stored yet for the next which is why the bleeding is so light it's also probably all old blood because it likely took several days to work its way down due to the lightness of the flow although conception takes place several days after the sexual act there still has to be an egg in place for it to happen at all and this is too close to your period for that to be possible chances are you will not be having a period on the th though as you chemically induced yours to be a couple days ago you might still but it's more likely to come at the end of the month cramps toward the middle of your menstrual cycle can be ovulation but the fact that ovulation is happening now means that you can't be pregnant at all the body doesn't ovulate while pregnant that system is shut down in most women by the flow of pregnancy hormones the outlook is extremely good you got lucky this time but please god use some birth control you can get a shot monthly or every months now nothing to hide nothing to explain Birth control Ovulation Endometriosis Emergency contraception Miscarriage Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) In vitro fertilisation Urinary incontinence Estrus cycle Obstetrics Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Childbirth Niddah Prostate cancer Gonorrhoea Polycystic ovary syndrome EastEnders Sexual abstinence Condom Abortion Ovarian cyst Androgen insensitivity syndrome Progesterone Twin Neighbours Cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infertility Knots Landing Sexual intercourse Friends Endometrium Tour de France Acne Stomach cancer Turner syndrome Ovary Menstrual cup Shark Ectopic pregnancy Ocean's Twelve Sex education Insulin Human chorionic gonadotropin Oral sex Elephant Psoriasis Premature birth Flowering plant Sharon Tate Stroke Herpes simplex virus Hormone Endocrinology Fasting Spina bifida Marriage The Inside Cephalic disorder Depo Provera Orgasm Transsexuality Nutrition Gregorian calendar Chemical abortion Stem cell Sleep Social rule Charmed Ovum Tocopherol Caffeine Pornographic movie Brain Cliff Richard Traumatic brain injury Oasis (band) Shaggy dog story Pregnancy test Capercaillie Brave New World Jon Secada Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Boom Town (Doctor Who) Ovarian cancer Endometrial cancer
