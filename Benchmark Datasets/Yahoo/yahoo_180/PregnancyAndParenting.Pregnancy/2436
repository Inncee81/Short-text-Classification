oh my god and people ask for advice on ya i have just answered a question in the pregnancy section where someone has had unprotected sex the day before her period started she wanted to know if she could be pregnant and i can't believe the amount of people who are saying no don't worry no chance you will be fine and so on i have a year old daughter who is proof that you can get pregnant at this time in your cycle but can't believe that people are so uneducated as to think that it is not possible the fact that this girl could read most of her answers and not worry about it and then end up pregnant is shocking i know that we all say that fertile time is days into a cycle but this is not always the case why do people answer questions when they really don't know i understand that people have opinions but when it is something as major as this let's face it it could be a new life i think people should be more careful about what advice they give in all fairness if it was something that major i wouldn't ask the people on ya but i suppose that others don't see it that way because for some reason or another they think they know i never answer a question unless i know the answer for sure unless it's an opinion question of course i answered one the other day where someone wanted to know how a mother with ab blood and a father with o blood could make a baby with o blood as a biologist i know the answer is that it isn't possible a person with ab blood can only make children with a b or ab blood since it was the mother i told her the likely reasons were that the kid was adopted or the mother is wrong about her blood type so many people think they know it but they are wrong i hope i didn't ruin some big family secret for her in any event the other oh answers said things like it's possible it could be from back in the family or something or it's a recessive trait happens all the time it makes me want to slam my head on the desk i'm not saying everyone in the world needs to know about genetics but if you seriously have no education in the subject don't answer i can only hope that when at the bottom i put in the source box i'm a biologist that they understand i'm the correct one you just have to keep on correcting people sometimes i guess Abortion debate Theory of conduct Friends Pregnancy Knots Landing EastEnders Social rule Intelligent design Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Plame affair Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma God Emperor of Dune Neighbours One Tree Hill (TV series) Adoption Laura Schlessinger Androgen insensitivity syndrome Philosophical skepticism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Menstrual cycle Infantilism Fertility awareness Kodocha Rei Ayanami Birth control The nature of God in Western theology Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Glen Jacobs Sexual orientation Species Goodness and value theory Controversies in autism Transsexuality Shaggy dog story Big Brother UK series 6 Joke Charmed Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Jumpstart 3rd Grade Abortion Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Biblical inerrancy Family Breastfeeding Free will Debugging Twin Biology and sexual orientation Meaning of life Francis Crick Theodicy Avenue Q Supernatural Ontological argument Jon Secada Creation-evolution controversy Childbirth Obstetrics Stomach cancer Origin belief Radio Yerevan Kender Who is a Jew?
