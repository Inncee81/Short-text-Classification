weeks pregnant effaced and dropped i have noticed that i have dropped and so has everyone else around me i have been told to rest because of the effacement i spoke with the doctor and she said that i could go into labor at anytime so i am not to travell anywhere now i havent lost my mucus plug that i know of and i just have a heap of pressure in my pelvis what happens once you get to effacement does that mean that you just have to wait for dialation and your waters to break then you can push do you have to loose your mucus plug before your waters can break how long do you think i have before labor doctors say another weeks and i will have my baby what do you think this is my first baby and i'm a little confuded to whats happening please answer all my questions thanks my cervix is supposed to be cm but it is only cm i would say i am effaced but the report on the u s said effaced i had it done internally as i had no water in my bladder i certainly hope that your drs are mistaken for your baby's sake when you are effaced your cervix starts to dilate hopefully dilation takes its time for you after effaced you can start dilating immediately or there can be some time before you do start it could be hours days or even weeks as you dilate once you reach a certain point active labor will begin which is when the contractions will begin coming regularly and you should be giving birth within the next hours or less this is usually the point where the water breaks you will push once you are cms dilated you will loose your mucus plug during effacement you will have passed your mucus plug by the time your water breaks the drs know best if they say weeks go by what they say i honestly would be getting prepared as soon as possible i would have my things ready for the baby i would also be doing research on premature births do not stress yourself out over it though god is watching you i would also be staying at home in bed as often as possible to be laying down i am actually surprised that your drs dont have you on bedrest god bless you and your baby Childbirth Pregnancy Cervix Breech birth Premature birth Abortion Fertility awareness Miscarriage Urinary incontinence In vitro fertilisation Intact dilation and extraction EastEnders Menstrual cycle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sexual reproduction Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Social rule Melanie Wilkes Coeliac disease Abortion debate Father's Day (Doctor Who) Phaedo Paradox Friends Toilet humour The Curse of Fenric Prostate cancer Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sydney Riot of 1879 Wound healing phases Humphrey Bogart Yom Kippur War Sharon Tate USS Thresher (SS-200) Characters of Lost Equine conformation Sant Thakar Singh Diabetic retinopathy Stomach cancer Jon Secada Abortion in the United States Twin paradox Time dilation USS Trigger (SS-237) Mercury Atlas 6 Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Androgen insensitivity syndrome Theory of conduct Battle of the Bulge Autonomic nervous system Miss Saigon Piccolo Junior Saga Atomic Kitten Trade union Master's degree Operation Market Garden Undergrads Intersex surgery Franz Boas Menstrual cup Oral contraceptive The Emancipation of Mimi Shaggy dog story Strap-on dildo National Football League Boom Town (Doctor Who) Mattress Caesarean section What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
