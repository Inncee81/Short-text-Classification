really worried did i hurt my baby hello ladies the weirdest thing happened to me last nigh it might be nothing but i need to hear your input on this i'm weeks pregnant yesterday i went to get a facial done i told the lady that i'm pregnant but she used some very strong scented creams stuff anyways when i went home i had lots of nausea like i never had before i felt so bad i was gagging all afternoon for that reason i ate nothing but some jello glass of low fat milk i went to bed feeling so bad but then at about am i woke up i had diarrhea so i went to the bathroom then got back to bed then at about am same thing happened again sorry to be gross btw it is so strange since i've been constipated i dont know if the facial creams had something to do but i am kind of worried my dr said las week to go to the er only if one of these things happened vaginal bleeding fever burning sensation while peeing i dont have any what could this be god bless oh i never had morning sickness during my pregnancy lots of it but never at night it's always in the morning or afternoon anyways thanks for all your answers sorry i meant to say i have had lots of morning sickness i would venture to guess that the smells of the facial overwhelmed your sensitive nasal capabilities at this point and made you queasy and having you digestive tract be all screwed up is just common with pregnancy prenatal vitamins have a tendency to constipate you due to all the iron the diarrhea could just be your whacked out system swinging back the other way if you are concerned call you doctor tell them what you told us and they will let you know what to do from there i have never heard of a doctor especially ob's who get bothered by stupid questions since there really are no stupid questions when it comes to the safety of momma and baby i would say everything is fine and this is just the end hopefully of the first trimester crappiness most moms to be experience good luck Obstetrics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pregnancy Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Miscarriage Guinea pig Coeliac disease Ron and Fez Morning sickness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Avenue Q Urinary incontinence Singlish Little Britain Jon Secada Insomnia Toilet humour Vomiting Charles Darwin's illness Friends Vitamin C Joke Social rule Philosophical skepticism Tocopherol AFI 100 Years series Milk Fertility awareness Oral sex Abortion Psoriasis Prostate cancer Futurama (TV series - season 5) Shit Humphrey Bogart Premature birth Sin City The Shining (film) Pasteurization Rei Ayanami Melanie Wilkes Sharon Tate Cat Shaggy dog story B3ta Coffee The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Theory of conduct Fiddler on the Roof Puberty Oh My Goddess!
