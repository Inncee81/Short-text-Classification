epidural question hey i'm almost weeks pregnant and my husband and i have been working on my birth plan when the question of and epidural came up i wasn't sure if i wanted to have one i'm terrified of needles and the thought of having one put in my back send chills down my spine can anyone tell me what there experience was like or if anyone has a fear of needles how you got past it thanks in advance epidurals can be intimidating i am a labor and delivery nurse and have seen many put in and even more women who go through labor i myself have not given birth but i'll tell you it's not a pleasant experience i'm not a fan of needles either and definatly want a natural birth however i'm not planning to be super woman and deal with the pain of going through birth so most likely i would opt for the epidural if you do decide to do the epidural you will be sitting up on the side of the bed leaning forward so that your spine caves out a little bit while you are leaning forward have your husband wrap his arms around you and talk to you about something fun that you did together without making you laugh the distraction will help a lot you will have a local anethetic given so you won't feel the pain of the needle going in the pain of getting an epidural is of the pain of labor and it's over in seconds Epidural Childbirth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obstetrics EastEnders Professional wrestling holds Local anesthesia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
