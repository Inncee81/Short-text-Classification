i need some help hi i just found out a few weeks ago that im pregnant with my first child i am about weeks along i am thinking of breastfeeding dont really know much about it i just would like some advice on the basics i guess you would call it thanks please do not shove your pushy opinions down my throat i care not about what you think about wether i do this or not all i need is some information about it thanks wow i didnt expect to get responses so soon i am going to check out that site it looks very imformative im gonna try it i think if my baby doesnt like it or whatever then we will go from there breastfeeding is not for everyone i know i will probably get a lot of thumbs down for this because there are always people out there that think they know what is right for your kid anyway i nursed for months and had to quit one breast dried up and the other was such a good producer to the point of engorgement but here you go let's start out with the good stuff it is a wonderful way to bond let's face it your baby just needs to eat sleep and be changed at first and the feedings are a wonderful way for him her to see you and only you ok you will leak if not during the day you will when you wake up in fact your boobs make wake you up before your baby does babies get hungry faster formula is heavier than breast milk and more predictable for feedings atleast from my experience you will get full before your baby is hungry rent not buy a hospital grade pump to help relieve the pressure it will be painful at first invest in some lanolin and lather up a few months before you give birth to soften the nipples let your husband fiance boyfriend help with feedings it gives you a break and lets them share in the bonding experience people say that nipple confusion can happen when you use a bottle i didn't have this trouble and it depends on the baby i had to do both because my son was in the hospital and he had no trouble doing both babies are going to get gas whether you bottle feed or nurse invest in some gas drops because their bodies are not used to digesting food and it helps relieve the gas also if you nurse if the food gives you gas like milk cabbage etc it will probably give your baby gas so you have to watch your diet not everyone can nurse don't feel bad if you can't for any reason it's been this way for centuries why do you think there have been wet nurses and just remember it is your body your boobs your baby don't listen to people that make you feel like a bad mother if you don't do everything exactly like they do it good luck Infant Breast Childbirth Fertility awareness Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Knots Landing Nipple piercing Urinary incontinence Social rule Neighbours Milk Little Britain Guinea pig Humphrey Bogart Dog RuneScape quests Brassiere Shaggy dog story Breast milk Baby bottle Nestl__ boycott Nipple Breast pump Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Obstetrics Elephant Hamster Days of our Lives Pregnancy Mastitis Omega-3 fatty acid Milton H.
