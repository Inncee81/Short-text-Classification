are there any methods to help you choose your baby's sex before pregnancy my ob gyn said that if you have sex on the day of ovulation your chances of having a boy are greater because boy sperm are faster than girl sperm so they could swim to the egg quicker girl sperm are slower but generally live longer in the vagina if you are trying for a girl to have sex a day or two before ovulation i've never tried this i don't think that there's any way to determine the sex of your baby for sure unless you do sperm seperation where they seperate the man's sperm artifically inseminate the woman with it that is only about effective i believe or if you have ivf done where they take the woman's egg out fertilize it a lab then insert it back into her once the embryo has developed that's like effective i don't believe all the old wive's tales about foods the man eat or hot showers boxers briefs all that crap In vitro fertilisation Menstrual cycle Infertility Fertility awareness Sexual intercourse Pregnancy Sexual reproduction Birth control Puberty Twin Artificial insemination Ovum Androgen insensitivity syndrome Oral contraceptive Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertilisation Multiple birth Ovulation Ovary Niddah Old wives' tale Abortion debate Female reproductive system (human) Swimming Spider Urinary incontinence Endometriosis Orgasm Obstetrics Spermatozoon Prostate cancer Chimera (genetics) Flowering plant Embryo transfer Sex assignment Phoebe Buffay's songs Pornographic movie Sterilization (surgical procedure) Miscarriage Sexual abstinence Intersexuality Man Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Strap-on dildo Sex Semen Childbirth Drosophila melanogaster Seed Masturbation Grasshopper Little Britain Breastfeeding Douche Ectopic pregnancy Coitus interruptus Swimming pool Ploidy Surrogacy Gamete History of intersex surgery Ovarian cyst Human Octopus Parthenogenesis Herbert Garrison Housefly Human sexual behavior Fetal development Natural family planning American lobster Shark Anal sex Anal masturbation Moss Premature birth Edward's syndrome Stem cell Gonorrhoea History of sex Vagina Egg (food) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Friends Human cloning Drawn Together Chicken Cetacea Earthworm Polycystic ovary syndrome Menstrual cup Gay slang Vaginal lubrication Homunculus
