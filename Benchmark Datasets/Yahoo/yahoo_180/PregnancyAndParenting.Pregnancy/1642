all i want to talk about is the baby and i think my husband is going nuts this baby has consumed me much more than him i am only weeks so while he is supportive and helpful i think it is more difficult for the men to get use to the idea of people pregnant because they dont see it or feel it i realize that for weeks i have only talked to him about the baby and nothing else i dont want to make him crazy and have the baby be the only things that we talk about but it is the only things that i think about any one else pleasant thank you for your kind words first of all how do you come off more pregnant than you are you are either pregnant or your not my husband and my mother are the only two people i have told so no i dont come off to anyone that way this is suppose to be a supportive forum for being to get comfort but i will take the high roadwith my more pregnant than i really am behind and just say thank you for your opinion i know what you mean i havent shut my mouth about the baby since we found out we were having her they get used to it eventually mine just started saying yup uh huh yah okay lol they are men and if they cant stand listening to us then i guess they shouldnt get us pregnant we cant help it its a amazing thing d congrats Friends EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Pregnancy Humphrey Bogart One Tree Hill (TV series) Breastfeeding Shaggy dog story Neighbours One Life to Live Boston Public Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Jam (TV series) Sex and the City Fiddler on the Roof The Inside Milton H.
