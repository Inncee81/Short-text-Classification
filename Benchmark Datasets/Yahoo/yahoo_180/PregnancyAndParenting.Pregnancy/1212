pelvic pain day before and last night every time i went to bed i have been getting these painful pelvic pain and spinal lower back and hip pains also seem to be getting headache and nausea can someone tell me whats going on i tried to use pillows around my back and knees it really hurt when ever i tried to turn over it just happens when i go to bed sometimes when i get up too so much i dont want to walk but during the day im fine i know i will talk to the doctor on my next appoint which is sometime next week but i was wondering if someone can give me an idea im weeks preg thank you for your help people oh my gosh this happened to me only combined with it every time i tried to move my joints would crack my spine pelvis even my pelvic bone would pop i guess it's worse at night because you are in one position for a long time whereas during the day you keep your joints moving just a guess it's caused from the hormones that relax your joints to prepare your body for delivery it's easier for the baby to pass through the birth canal if all of your bones and joints are pliable being that you're getting closer to delivery things are probably really starting to gear up just take it nice easy and slow whenever you go to move whether it's laying down getting up in the morning or just trying to roll over or reposition at night unfortunately my pain and joint popping continued for about weeks after delivery i'm assuming it had something to do with the fact that i was breastfeeding i never asked because at that point i was used to it the headache and nausea could also be due to increased hormone shifts as you near delivery hope this helps good luck congrats and hang in there here is an article i found online for you joint mobility during pregnancy your body produces a hormone known as relaxin which is believed to help prepare the pubic area and the cervix for the birth the relaxin loosens the ligaments in your body making you less stable and more prone to injury it's easy to overstretch or strain yourself especially the joints in your pelvis lower back and knees when exercising or lifting objects go slowly and avoid sudden jerky movements Breech birth Urinary incontinence Childbirth Breastfeeding Pelvis Obstetrics Osteoarthritis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Paget's disease of bone Prostate cancer Puberty Fecal incontinence Professional wrestling holds Traumatic brain injury Abortion Aerial (dance move) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Weight training Chronic fatigue syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome Endometriosis Casualty lifting Mattress Osteopathy Massage Diving Abdomen Hip fracture Human anatomy Backstroke Ectopic pregnancy Psoriasis Chiropractic Theory of conduct Hip (anatomy) Menstrual cycle Swimming Child sexuality Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fibromyalgia Hip dysplasia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cancer Sacrum First aid Menstrual cup Group A streptococcal infection Urination Swingout Radiation therapy Tetrapod Miscarriage Local anesthesia Sexual intercourse Out-of-body experience Oral contraceptive Premature birth Decompression sickness Epidural Haloperidol Deadlift Mandible Polycystic ovary syndrome Iliotibial band syndrome Cerebral palsy Osteoporosis Recumbent bicycle Cannabis (drug) Futurama (TV series - season 3) Spina bifida Social rule Growth hormone treatment Guinea pig Strap-on dildo Anal sex Intact dilation and extraction Tai Chi Chuan Spanking Cryptorchidism Welding EastEnders Bicycle Syringomyelia Ovarian cyst Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Horizontal bar Milton H.
