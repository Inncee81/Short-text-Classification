when did i ovulate i started my last period on july my periods are always very regular down to the time of day i start however my last cycle was days instead of anyway i believe with a pretty regular cycle like mine i would ovulate days before the start of my period also days after the first day of my period if they're always days correct on the night of the th really early the th since it was in the morning my husband and i had sex and the condom completely ripped and we didn't stop this is the first time this has happened in all of the years we've been together and i'm guessing it might have had to do with the fact he'd had a little to drink anyway it would be totally fine if we ended up pregnant we just weren't trying obviously what are my chances of becoming pregnant i know that you can get pregnant anytime in your cycle and sometimes right after my period and right before my period we have unprotected sex because i've charted my cycles and know that i am very infertile during these times but if we had sex the morning of the th i know that sperm can live for several days during this time would i have just ovulated or would i be just about to if the egg had already ovulated wouldn't there be a good chance of it becoming fertilized during this time also i know that womens basal body temperatures rise during ovulation this morning i had a temperature of usually i run somewhere around would my temperature have already dropped after ovulation or could this be an early sign of fertilization as women having a higher bbt for days after ovulation is a sign of conception any thoughts you have on this issue would be appreciated along with anyone who had any similar experiences to share thanks as an nfp practitioner i'd say your odds are pretty good the th was your th day even if you ovulated earlier in the day the egg generally survives hours a little about bbt it remains elevated for days and usually drops the day of your period your current elevated temperature indicates you have indeed ovulated you can actually use the bbt to save money on the pregnancy test too if you get days of elevated bbt it interprets pregnancy if that is the case then congratulations to you Menstrual cycle Ovulation Emergency contraception Infertility Polycystic ovary syndrome Birth control Oral contraceptive Puberty Niddah Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Twin Estrus cycle Sexual reproduction Androgen insensitivity syndrome Human chorionic gonadotropin Abortion debate Miscarriage Sexual abstinence Oral sex Pelvic inflammatory disease Ovum Pregnancy test Ovarian cyst Ovarian cancer Abortion Ovary EastEnders Endometriosis Obstetrics Knots Landing Progesterone Natural family planning Fertilisation Friends Multiple birth Anal sex Turner syndrome Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Religion and sexuality Prolactinoma Neighbours History of sex Gonorrhoea Carpel Tsetse fly Moss Female reproductive system (human) Maya calendar Flowering plant Thermoregulation Urinary incontinence Venus Conifer cones The Children of Men Mojave people Big Brother UK series 6 Ectopic pregnancy Herpes simplex virus Jet engine Pornographic movie Oasis (band) Climate of the United Kingdom 2000 Australian Grand Prix Health issues and the effects of cannabis Cryptorchidism Wheel of Fortune Old wives' tale Iditarod Partial-birth abortion Ocean's Twelve Traumatic incident reduction Rosa Parks Dead Like Me Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Electrophysiology Nuclear power Sauna New Morning Sex education Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Global cooling The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Theory of conduct Circuit design UK Singles Chart Major League Baseball television contracts Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hard disk Solar variation Big Bang AIDS Cat
