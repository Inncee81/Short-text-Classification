i can't breathe is it really normal that at weeks you'll have problem breathing i sit a lot in front of the computer and i put soft pillows on my butt but i stil feel uncomfortable my questions are am i doing harm to my baby by sitting too much in front of the computer i sit for an hour or two but usually gets up because i had to pee what sleeping position is the best so i won't have trouble breathing infinite thanks you're not harming the baby by sitting at the computer too much although i can see how that will scare you but remember millions of women work and sit at their pcs constantly without any problems just get up and walk around every now and again so you don't cut of your circulation too much make sure you have good posture in front of the pc for your benefit more than the baby's they say your left side is best to sleep on but my baby's quite high too and like you i'm really struggling to breathe so i pile a bunch of pillows behind my back and i sleep in an almost upright position it's not quite as uncomfortable as you may think you can still relax in that position but as i said make sure you have loads of pillows this won't harm the baby either my doctor said that even though the left side is in fact best no position can really hurt the baby they're quite well protected in there whatever we usually do in this regard hurts us more than our babies we don't stay still in our sleep and roll around quite a lot so it's not something you need to stress about good luck and hang in there it's almost time Breastfeeding Mattress Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Upholstery Equine conformation Childbirth Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Professional wrestling holds Time Out of Mind Human position Diving Theory of conduct Menstrual cup Sleep apnea Strap-on dildo Aerial (dance move) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tae eul ju Anxiety Meditation Insomnia Breech birth The Shining (film) Pillow The Time Machine Massage Abortion debate Humphrey Bogart Empire Burlesque Friends Singlish IBM PC compatible The Amber Spyglass Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Spanking Characters in the Smurfs Cliff Richard Liquid breathing Rod Stewart Chinese martial arts Aikido Breaststroke Hikikomori Asana Aquatic ape hypothesis Ron and Fez Jon Secada Frankie Laine Chess (musical) Floppy disk F-16 Fighting Falcon Stomach cancer Sento Anger management 2000 Australian Grand Prix Recumbent bicycle Reflexology Fecal incontinence Carpal tunnel syndrome The pillows Horseshoe Infantilism The McGuire Sisters Macbeth Backstroke Milton H.
