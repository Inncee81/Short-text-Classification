false pregnancy advice i had a false pregnancy scare not so long ago i was a bit scared and asked my boyfriend whether i should carry on with the pregnancy if i was pregnant he then told me that if i had an abortion he would finish with me as he doesn't agree with abortion i am still hurt by this as he has always said he would stay with me no matter what would anyone else feel upset i only suggested abortion to him i didn't mean i would go ahead and do it should i respect his view i think i would also be a bit upset and worried about that it's a natural reaction because you've always felt you can rely on him to be there for you but i think the best way to look at it is from his side from your side it looks like he is saying that he would leave you if you disappointed him which is pretty scary and awful but i think that he would actually be surprised to know that you've interpreted his comment that way i think that one of the main reasons he reacted so strongly is that he is genuinely anti abortion which is pecfectly understandable i think he wanted you to understand that he thinks it's never a solution and that he would never condone it so he feels strongly about this issue that doesn't mean that he feels strongly about leaving you if you disappoint him i think this was just the way that he thought of to express to you his strong feelings about abortion now in this situation you say that you both thought you might be pregnant but lets say that you really were pregnant i think his attitude would be less aggressive because it would be a real situation and he would have to deal with it in an adult way because you didn't know for sure it maybe made him feel more free about giving his full opinion at it's full strength if you were actually pregnant i think he would have spoken to you in a nicer way i think also if he is really anti abortion he might have been a little scared at the thought that you would consider an abortion he might have worried that you might actually have an abortion and the thought of that was scary to him both from the point of view of how bad it would be for you to deal with as well as feeling bad about you possibly killing his child now i use asterix to show that i don't think that myself i am just trying to get in his head but i think you should consider that he was not really thinking about your feeleings at that time because he was actually a bit horrified at the thought of you having an abortion for any of the reasons i list above now i just want to say that although i think abortion is a bad idea for many reasons sometimes a woman has to consider it there are genuine good reasons for having an abortion it has to be decided on an individual basis but i know if it affected me personally i would be scared and panic maybe your boyfriend panicked maybe you panicked about his reaction to you i don't think that having a anti attitude to it helps but i'm sure your boyfriend has good reasons for his opinion most importantly it's a good idea for you to talk to him about his reaction tell him you were worried when he said that because you thought you relationship was strong enough to survive something like that tell him that you don't want him to think that the possibilty of having an abortion was in any way pleasant to you of course it would be an awful thing but you needed to discuss your options and you wanted to know if he thought that was an option or not now you know that it's not an option for him but it would certainly be last on the list for you too i don't think you've done anything wrong but make sure he knows how you feel and get the misunderstanding cleared up your relationship will only be better for talking about it ps remember it's your body and you get to decide what happens to it if this situation really occured you should always take him into account but it is always up to you in the end don't live your life according to other people's rules even the people you love Abortion debate EastEnders Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Birth control Homophobia Ethics Abortion God Emperor of Dune The Smoking Room Scientology beliefs and practices Laura Schlessinger Knots Landing Hillary Rodham Clinton Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Kodocha Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Friends Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Child sexuality Plame affair Goodness and value theory Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Everwood The nature of God in Western theology Evil Moral Politics Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Boston Public Transactional analysis Abortion in the United States Philosophy of language Socrates Phoebe Halliwell Roe v.
