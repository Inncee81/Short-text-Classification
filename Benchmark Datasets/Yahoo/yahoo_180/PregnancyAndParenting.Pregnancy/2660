i am going to be a mum to children i have just found out i am pregnant about weeks this will be my fourth child oh crap i have used contraception with all of them apart from the second child i took the pill properly no missed pills e t c what are my chances of my dr allowing me to be sterlized i will be when the th child is born you have a very good chance of your doctor agreeing to a sterilization as you have obviously finished having your family a friend of mine had only one child and somehow managed to find a doctor to tie her tubes and then later give her a hysterectomy at i think she had to shop around for a doctor a lot though i am pregnant with my fourth and the doctors have already discussed what my options are after the birth of this one and have offered sterilization to me i am but i told my husband that as it is a bigger operation for a woman than a vasectomy is for a man plus the fact i have gone through soon to be births that he can have the op rather than me unless i have to have a caesar then i will get it done at the same time best of luck to you Birth control Sterilization (surgical procedure) Oral contraceptive EastEnders Pregnancy Abortion debate Miscarriage Fertility awareness Emergency contraception Knots Landing Endometriosis Heracles Childbirth In vitro fertilisation Neighbours Prostate cancer Margaret Sanger Acne Folic acid Menstrual cycle Twin Infertility Death Comes to Time Romulus and Remus Friends About a Boy Spina bifida Characters of Lost Social rule Sex education Teenage pregnancy Abortion The Contender (television series) Hysterectomy Ian Beale Religion and abortion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Premature birth Big Brother UK series 6 Depo Provera Urinary incontinence Craps Psoriasis Poker jargon Prenatal diagnosis The Daleks' Master Plan Seven (film) David Vetter Married... with Children Mystique (comics) Gonorrhoea Sleeping Murder Jam (TV series) Jacky Ickx Intrauterine device The Mysterious Planet Melanie Wilkes The Five Doctors Maria Korp Sharon Tate Little Britain Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual intercourse Lucille Ball Neopets Scarlet Witch Good Times Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Alanis Morissette Prolactinoma Compulsory sterilization Bowl Championship Series Ovarian cancer Castration Anencephaly Days of our Lives Ken Jennings The Ark in Space Destiny of the Daleks World Chess Championship The Inside Divorce The Caves of Androzani Religion and sexuality Betting (poker) Condom My Parents are Aliens Incarnations of Immortality Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abortion in the United States Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fanny Blankers-Koen Menstrual cup Dorothy L.
