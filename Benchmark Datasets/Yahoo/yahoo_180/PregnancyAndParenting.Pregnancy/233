posterior cervix my older sis who is weeks pregnant dialated at a for weeks now just got out of the docs office and he said that she had a posterior cervix what does that mean is it harmful to the baby could it result in c section this is her rd child in years and she has never been told about a posterior cervix before but with the first she only pushed for minutes and the second she pushed times and he popped out before the doc was completely ready it just means that her cervix is pointing towards the back it's not gonna hurt the baby i have one myself and had natural births it just hurts when they check you because she'll have to put her hands under her butt to lift the cervix so its easier for them to check how much she has dilated everything should be okay Cervix Childbirth Pregnancy Breech birth Miscarriage Intact dilation and extraction Sexual reproduction Obstetrics Breaststroke Menstrual cup Aerial (dance move) Premature birth Fertility awareness Breastfeeding Strap-on dildo Cytomegalovirus Menstrual cycle Gonorrhoea Prenatal diagnosis Characters of Lost In vitro fertilisation Abortion debate Back to the Future Marty McFly Jon Secada Adoption Backstroke Androgen insensitivity syndrome Iris (anatomy) Jennifer Lopez Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Table tennis Spanking Sphenoid bone Diethylstilbestrol Ayyavazhi mythology Recurring South Park characters Temporal bone Partial-birth abortion Time travel Doctor Emmett Brown EastEnders Female reproductive system (human) Palatine bone Back to the Future trilogy Frankie Laine World Championship Wrestling Professional wrestling holds Prior probability Rod Stewart Anatomical terms of location Endometriosis Cephalic disorder Elbow-joint Snake Hall & Oates John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Friends Back to the Future timeline Cher (entertainer) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling attacks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bayes' theorem Butterfly stroke History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Eddie Guerrero Parade (military) Intersex surgery Diaphragm (contraceptive) The Shining (film) Toni Braxton Alois Hitler Eric Bischoff Placenta praevia Knots Landing Maxilla Sexual intercourse Urinary incontinence The Chemical Brothers Incarnations of Immortality Given name Clara Clayton Back to the Future Part II Fetal development Max Martin R.E.M.
