how do you break pregnancy news to coworkers and boss at work i have read that you should tell your boss first so that he doesn't hear it from someone else first but i also have very good friends who are also coworkers do i tell them first but swear them to secrecy do i tell my boss first i even considered getting all in the same room and break the news at the same time what do you guys think well to me i would tell my friends first they are the ones that are going to be happier about it then your boss and i really didnt know that there was a policy that states you have to tell your boss you are pregnant but i guess they do need to know one way or the other i would tell your friends and then tell your boss with your other coworkers present and tell them at once Friends Charmed George Costanza Honey and Clover EastEnders Pregnancy Dilbert Humphrey Bogart Kill Bill Something Positive Knots Landing The Smoking Room Bob Newhart John R.
