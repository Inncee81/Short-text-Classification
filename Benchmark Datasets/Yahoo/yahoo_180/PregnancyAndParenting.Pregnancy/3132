what can be causing this cramping it's right where my c section scar is i had both of my children aged years and years via c section first because she could not come out and second was planned could i be ovulating and feeling it because my period lasted for days and ended yesterday it usually lasts days but the last couple of months it's been that long and weird i just know that right by my scar i'm cramping and i've taken prescription advil and that hasn't worked hours ago what can be wrong in view of what you posted a few weeks back i'd go to a doctor for a pregnancy blood test or do a home test some times very early in a pregnancy cramping can occur and some women experience bleeding or still get their periods while pregnant earlier tests may not have shown a positive result if your hormones were low in any case if this has been going on for a few months see a doctor better to be safe than sorry and they should be able to give you something to help with the pain best of luck and i really hope you're better soon i know how horrid bad cramps are Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Miscarriage Fertility awareness Endometriosis Childbirth Gonorrhoea Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pregnancy test Ectopic pregnancy In vitro fertilisation Emergency contraception Abortion Birth control Puberty Breastfeeding Acne Ovulation Oral contraceptive Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Coeliac disease Polycystic ovary syndrome Spina bifida Prolactinoma Abortion debate Chronic fatigue syndrome Stroke Progesterone Gynecologic hemorrhage Estrus cycle Premature birth Endometrial cancer Twin Cytomegalovirus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pelvic inflammatory disease Days of our Lives Chemical abortion Diabetic retinopathy Myocardial infarction Postpartum depression Diabetes mellitus Growth hormone treatment Infertility Ovarian cancer Human chorionic gonadotropin HIV test Folic acid Prenatal diagnosis Guinea pig Breech birth Multiple sclerosis Turner syndrome Anemia First aid Migraine Blood type Haloperidol Transsexuality Paracetamol Abortion in Canada Herpes simplex virus Hyperprolactinaemia Cramp Episodes of Lost (Season 1) LSD Scar Clinical depression Ben Johnson (athlete) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Pneumonia Cephalic disorder Apollo 8 Paget's disease of bone Intact dilation and extraction Teenage pregnancy Rosa Parks Medicine Marriage Ovarian cyst Roe v.
