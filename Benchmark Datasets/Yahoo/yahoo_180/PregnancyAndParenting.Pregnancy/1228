pregnant with twins weeks low sugar im pregnant with twins confirmed by ultrasound weeks ago i went to walmart today it was getting past lunch time and i starting feeling funny light headed and shakey i made it over to the subway we have one in our walmart here i ate a sub and a soda and after an hour i was ok again but for a bit there i was afraid i would pass out if i stood up im going to call the dr monday but in the mean time did anyone else have this when they were pregnant low sugar problem perhaps oh yes i had major problems with this and every pregnancy my doctor tested me i was just below the glucose intolerant stage i put up with it not knowing how to handle it for pregnancies until my fourth when i had a midwife who had previously been a nutritionist she totally helped me out so i will pass on what has helped me and hopefully you can benefit it is critical that you have protein at every meal i know it's hard to go and eat protein first thing in the morning but it's better to eat it than feel terrible for a couple hours until your blood sugar levels out if you drink coffee or other caffeine in the morning make sure you eat your protein first and try to limit the amount of caffeine as this will make it worse stay away from sweets and especially soda this will just make it worse in the long run i too thought it helped me but once i learned to understand my body a bit better i realized it was actually digging me deeper into the problem now you can certainly have the sweets but make it a hard rule to only have them when you get a good amount of protein to balance the sugar intake you can also get like this when you haven't eaten a solid meal it probably wasn't the soda that helped you when you ate at subway it was the sub so you have low and high blood sugar levels lol basically your sugar levels like to fluctuate alot when you are pregnant like mine and you have to be more careful what you eat so you feel okay getting exercise also helps a little bit in the long run but the major thing controlling it is diet hope that helps Hypoglycemia Breastfeeding Dieting Tooth Stomach cancer Atkins Nutritional Approach Diabetes mellitus Caffeine Folic acid Coffee Veganism Weight training Nutrition Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Chocolate Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fasting Pregnancy Insomnia Hyperglycemia Carbon dioxide Hamster Prostate cancer Adjustable gastric band Vegetarianism Guinea pig Sleep Milk Tocopherol Breakfast Childbirth Gastroparesis Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Soft drink Urinary incontinence Stroke Coca-Cola Humphrey Bogart Miscarriage Coeliac disease 2000 Australian Grand Prix Wal-Mart Anorexia nervosa Hypertension Protein Bread Low-carbohydrate diet Vitamin C Glycemic index Fancy rat Bodybuilding Fertility awareness Food Shaggy dog story Colorectal cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Omega-3 fatty acid Tooth enamel Coronary heart disease Brewery Sugar Mountain Dew Healthy eating Medicine Cheese Blood sugar EastEnders STS-62 Cholesterol Glycogen storage disease type I Tofu Binge eating disorder Insulin resistance Word of Wisdom Theory of conduct Biochemistry Milton H.
