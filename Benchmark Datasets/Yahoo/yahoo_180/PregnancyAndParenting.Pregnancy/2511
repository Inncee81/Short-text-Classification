you really think it could be an evap line if it's pink took a hpt that was negative for the ten minutes next tome i checked about three hours later there is a second line that a very visible pink thin line i am dpo asked about this earlier and most seem to think it's an evaporation line but i thought those are grey or colorless the test is a baby test from dollar general and i never had this before driving me crazy i guess evaporation lines can be colored i got my period today all you girls ttc throw the test out after the ten minute time limit i know easier said the done the color of an evaporation line is generally the same color as the test blue if the test would be blue pink if it's pink it's an evaporation line dpo is still pretty early to detect any pregnancy hormone and a test that's three hours past the timer is completely invalid and cannot be trusted throw it away after the timer is up and do not look at it again even if you really really want to wait until at least two weeks past ovulation and try an early result test i got a positive with a first response early detection test three days before my period was due Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Pregnancy test Color Fertility awareness HIV test Obstetrics In vitro fertilisation Prostate cancer Polycystic ovary syndrome Huygens probe Ovulation Drug test Opportunity rover Prenatal diagnosis Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Puberty GED Tour de France Androgen insensitivity syndrome Driver's license Oscilloscope The Amazing Race Diamond simulant Apollo 8 Urinary incontinence Cardiac stress test Cannabis cultivation Embedded system Light-emitting diode Hypoglycemia Diamond Emergency contraception Human chorionic gonadotropin Incandescent light bulb Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Coffee Breast cancer Singlish Material properties of diamond Jennifer Lopez Diamond color Tide Color theory Clementine mission Debugging Time Out of Mind My Little Pony Abortion CPU cache Comet Hyakutake Cleveland Browns Ben Johnson (athlete) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Niddah Walt Disney World Railroad Billiards Estrus cycle Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Coeliac disease Breastfeeding Toronto Transit Commission Oral contraceptive Color blindness CIE 1931 color space Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Chaos Emerald Childbirth Haloalkane Carbon dioxide Elephant Technetium Haloperidol Cytomegalovirus Normal distribution IP (complexity) STS-51-L Cocaine Scrabble (game show) Gonorrhoea Pretty Good Privacy Black hole Falsifiability Ovarian cancer Vacuum tube Prolactinoma Anemia Breech birth Viva York PC Engine Gamut USS Tunny (SS-282) Final Fantasy magic Collision detection Time Malignant melanoma Diamond enhancement Sex assignment System/34 Turner syndrome
