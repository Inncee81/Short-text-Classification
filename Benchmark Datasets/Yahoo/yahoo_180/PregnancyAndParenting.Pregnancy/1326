why give birth in a hospital why did you choose that option and what interventions did you have there home births are perfectly safe for a low risk pregnancy in fact the death rate for home births is less than that for hospital births so some people around here don't know what they're talking about if you have a good midwife she will know if the baby is in danger and will send you to a hospital also hospitals are not sterile despite what people seem to think you have a higher chance of contracting an infection in a hospital than you do in your own home it's sad but true but as far as choosing a hospital for birth i think people do it for peace of mind or because they are ignorant of the facts and just assume it's the only safe thing to do i am going with a hospital for my first baby but hope to have home births in the future i chose the hospital this time mainly because the doctors that i really wanted to see don't have anyone in their practice that delivers at home i'm not looking forward to all the interventions it's usually hospital policy to strap you to a fetal monitor which restricts your movement and makes labor more difficult you are rather likely to have an episiotomy whether it is medically indicated or not by the way tearing is better than cutting they restrict your eating and drinking usually don't let you eat anything at all and only let you have clear fluids they may restrict the positions you can labor and give birth in which may work against you and your baby's progres they will likely cut the baby's cord and take him her away from you nearly immediately after birth good luck making your decision Childbirth Breech birth Breastfeeding Abortion Episiotomy Caesarean section Miscarriage Birth weight Abortion debate Pregnancy In vitro fertilisation Urinary incontinence Premature birth Midwifery Obstetrics Epidural Intravenous therapy Birth control Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Herpes simplex virus Abortion in the United States Medicine Fecal incontinence Myocardial infarction Folic acid Spina bifida HIV test Anorexia nervosa Intact dilation and extraction Circumcision Cytomegalovirus Prostate cancer Microeconomics Stroke Safe sex Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Elephant Traumatic brain injury Roe v.
