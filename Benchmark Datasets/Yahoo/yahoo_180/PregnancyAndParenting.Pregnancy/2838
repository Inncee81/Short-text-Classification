what are the chances of the e r doctor missing the babys heart beat i am about weeks and days along i went to the doctors on july due to spotting and a little pain i was weeks along at that time when i went they said that i was fine and the baby was healthy i started to bleed a little more yesterday august so i went back to the e r this time when i was seen they said that there was no heart beat all they gave me was some pain pills so i called my doctor and he wants to do his own ultrasound on august i dont want to get my hopes up but what are the chances for them missing the heart beat the first time and how do you go from a healthy fetus one week to it not having a heart beat also if it wasnt healty and its dead then why is it the size it needs to be with my last pregnancy i was in a car accident at weeks gestation and i asked the e r to listen for the heartbeat i was so worried the baby had been hurt or killed they tried for nearly minutes with the dopplar and could get nothing but they did a follow up ultrasound and there was my baby kicking and moving on the screen very vigorously she was born last year and was perfectly healthy my doctor said she just must not have been in a good position sometimes it's really hard to find that heartbeat esp when you are weeks or less and if you are in the e r remember that prenatal care is not their specialty an ob or midwife usually has a better technique for pinpointing a fetal heartbeat even early on i'm sure the ultrasound will give you the reassurance you need all the best to you Obstetrics Breech birth Childbirth Pregnancy Prenatal diagnosis Abortion Prenatal care Intact dilation and extraction Abortion debate Midwifery Breastfeeding Birth weight Fetus Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Stroke Premature birth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Congenital disorder Twin Stillbirth Knots Landing Jon Secada Menstrual cycle Ectopic pregnancy Jam (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Guinea pig Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cliff Richard Cardiac arrhythmia Urinary incontinence Piccolo Junior Saga The Beatles discography Medicine Anencephaly First aid Heartbeat (television) Abortion in the United States Placental abruption Medical ultrasonography Atomic Kitten Tenshinhan Placenta praevia Heart Spina bifida Myocardial infarction Cephalic disorder Father's Day (Doctor Who) Abortion in Canada Azaria Chamberlain disappearance Fetal development Heart rate Theory of conduct Cleveland Browns Cryptorchidism Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Folic acid The Inside House of M Hal Trosky Death Stenberg v.
