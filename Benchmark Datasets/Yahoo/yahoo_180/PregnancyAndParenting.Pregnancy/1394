was childbirth worse or better than you imagined hello ladies i have wondered about this for a long time just because when i had my little boy i had to have a cesarian but i was in first stage labour for days and it was having contractions every mins but i was exicted about it although i was in pain and i feel as though i missed out on a big experience that i had been looking foward to and i missed out the first day with john because i had to go under general anasethia could you tell me a little of your experiences please thanx in honest truth both it was seriously painful and horrible and blood and gunk and doctors looking at you and nurses thinking they have better bikini line than you and rips and needles and nakedness but it was also not so bad really i survived i have forgotten the pain i want another baby and although my son was pound my womanly bits aren't too damaged so just think that in day you'll be out of pain you'll have your new baby and as much choc as you want from your adoring family and friends and everyone will ask you can they help you do say yes dishes washing hoovering tidying all need doing enjoy the moment it doesn't last forever Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada Cliff Richard Pregnancy Social rule Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence U2 (band) One Piece minor characters Fecal incontinence Situation comedy Milton H.
