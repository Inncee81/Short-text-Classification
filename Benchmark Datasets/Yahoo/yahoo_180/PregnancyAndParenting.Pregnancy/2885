will a hair dresser die your if your pregnant ive heard of pregos being turned down anyone have this happend i've never been turned down and i know lots of women including myself who have gotten their hair dyed while pregnant both times i've gone they could obviously see i was pregnant and no one said anything about it except to congratulate me some have speculated that chemicals in the hair dye could penetrate the scalp and enter the bloodstream but there is no evidence yet to support this and even further to prove that even if it did it would adversely affect the fetus so it's up to you but generally it's not considered a risky thing to do just make sure that the salon is well ventilated the fumes can be heavy sometimes Hair Pregnancy Thimerosal Abortion Abortion debate Tobacco smoking Childbirth Anne Boleyn The Inside Kimono Hair coloring Psoriasis Allergy Welding Hearing impairment Aspartame Obstetrics Fume hood Androgen insensitivity syndrome Roe v.
