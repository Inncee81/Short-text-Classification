question about cutting grass when pregnant i am weeks pregnant and today i cut the grass i cut it a few times before i knew i was pregnant and i was wondering if it should be avoided i was using a drive on and i didn't fill it with gas so i didn't expose my baby to that but you know how lawnmowers can be they can give off some fumes its a new lawnmower so it can't be that bad it was a windy day so i got lots of fresh air but still got a little of the fumes i didn't want to cut the grass i was trying to avoid it at all costs but my husband is working and the lawn was like a field and i couldn't look at it anymore it had to be cut did i hurt my baby with the fumes from the lawnmower i don't think mowing the grass will hurt you or your baby especially with the way mowers are made now they are lightweight and don't require a lot of exertion or serious pushing the fumes are not harmful since you are outdoors with plenty of ventilation the only thing to worry about would be if you were on a riding mower that bounced you around a lot depending on the terrain of your lawn i mow my lawn sometimes and i'm pregnant i just stop for breaks and drink lots of water or gatorade Lawn The Lawnmower Man Bong Mower Tennis Fire fighting Transmission (mechanics) Humphrey Bogart Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story Welding Carburetor Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Fume hood Archery Tractor Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Internal combustion engine Hay Worms weapons and tools Autonomous robot Jon Secada Briggs & Stratton Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Mexicools Breastfeeding McMansion Knots Landing 1957 World Series Sharon Tate Laws of cricket Carpal tunnel syndrome The Adventures of Pete & Pete Theory of conduct Crop circle Hyperthermia Motor oil Time Out of Mind Kodocha Pregnancy Two-stroke cycle Whose Line Is It Anyway? 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Mattress Gas metal arc welding Fast bowling Car safety Battles of Lexington and Concord Irrigation Ownership The Contender (television series) Freddy Fender The Apprentice 2 Sami Brady Marilyn Monroe Autonomous building Jennifer Lopez The Beatles discography Samuel Goldwyn Abortion debate Mountaineering The Ashlee Simpson Show Cricket pitch The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Treehouse of Horror IX Cricket Diesel engine Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Adoption Novelty (locomotive) Equine conformation Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Tennis court Childbirth Paragliding Unreal Gatorade Jam (TV series) Batting (cricket) Dead Putting Society Golf Fire extinguisher Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Journey (band) The Emancipation of Mimi Guinea pig New York Giants Arc welding Milton H.
