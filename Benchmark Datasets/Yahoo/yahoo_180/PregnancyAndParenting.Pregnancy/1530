teen girls on birthcontrol pills is it possible that a year old girl can take birthcontrol pills i ask is bc i have a year old friend that takes the pills yes a year old may get a birth control rx even without parental consent teen clinics distribute these for free without parental notification as either birth control or to regulate irregular periods or even as an extra assistance for acne many of these come in cases that look like a powder compact parents never have to know but here's my advice i went to a teen clinic and got birth control just to help regulate my period the birth control they gave me caused a severe allergic reaction that caused all my hair and some of my teeth to fall out i bled for nine months straight even though i quit taking the pill the clinic was good about giving me the meds but did nothing to help me and i nearly died please don't take this lightly or as a quick fix sometimes clinics aren't safe always go to your doctor you're still young it may be uncomfortable and you may be told no but always get parental permission Menstrual cycle Acne Abortion debate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Migraine Birth control Stomach cancer Folic acid Saved by the Bell Psoriasis Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Roe v.
