terrified about childbirth will i be able to cope with the pain first time mother to be everyone is recommending different pain relief i dont know how to make a decision i have a really low threshold for pain i really dont know if i can cope my boyfriend tries to reassure me but i find it hard to accept his reassurance after all men will never know the true experience of childbirth im due in less than a month im running out of time i think a lot of women feel the same way as you do when i was pregnant with my son people would always ask me if i was scared or nervous to go through labor and delivery and to be completely honest with you i wasn't at all i knew it was something i had to do and there was no getting around it i had to have the baby i was really calm about it because i didn't want to be freaking out when i brought my son into the world i thought of it as i did everything else i had to do day to day i had to brush my teeth eat pee work cook dinner and have a baby i never freaked out or stressed out about it while i was pregnant or while i was in labor i just didn't see how it would benefit me to be freaking out try to picture yourself going through it really i think that helped me too i pictured what it was going to be like and i knew i wanted to be able to enjoy every moment of bringing my little bundle of perfection into the world i'm not going to tell you it doesn't hurt i had the epidural and it was wonderful i felt a little bit of burning when my sons head and shoulders came out but that was really it any pain you have is gone the instant the baby is out of you and in your arms good luck and congrats on your baby Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Breastfeeding Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada Ron and Fez History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Shaggy dog story Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Local anesthesia Obstetrics Knots Landing Daredevil Blood on the Tracks Pitaten Epidural Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Premature birth Self-harm Chronic fatigue syndrome Atomic Kitten One Life to Live Friends Social rule Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Time Out of Mind Adoption Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Midwifery Characters in the Smurfs Little Britain Procrastination Hypnosis Pain Prostate cancer Clinical depression Rich Mullins Leo Wyatt The Smoking Room Piccolo Junior Saga Darth Vader Comanche Hera Conspiracy (TNG episode) Postpartum depression Honey and Clover God Emperor of Dune Fecal incontinence Breech birth Tenshinhan Wallflower (comics) Another World (TV series) The Contender (television series) Oral sex Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Neighbours Coeliac disease Sami Brady Blood (computer game) One Piece minor characters Charmed Sin City Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) The Ashlee Simpson Show Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Abortion The Apprentice 2 Jam (TV series) Drawn Together Ranma __ characters Prisoner (TV series) About a Boy Haven (TNG episode) Miss Saigon Guinea pig Series finale Infantilism Hollyoaks Lee Harvey Oswald Sharon Tate Hillary Rodham Clinton Babe Ruth Milton H.
