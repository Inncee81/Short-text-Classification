help why do i keep waking up to having slept on my back at the beginning of my pregnancy it wasn't difficult for me to sleep on my left side now i can't seem to stay on either side i always wake up on my back i'm weeks so i'm sure once i get further along that it'll be too painful to sleep on my back but come on any of you figure out a way to trick your body into staying on the side at night or did you just give in and sleep on your back thanks everyone i've liked so many of the suggestions that i can't pick one you decide its not that it will be to painful but you most likely wont be able to breath when you get further along the baby puts weight on your major vein to your heart causing it to slow thus causing his hers to do the same usually if you end up on your back while your further along you wake yourself up from not being able to breath try using some pillows behind your back while your lying on your side between your legs or prop yourself up Mattress Professional wrestling holds Childbirth Knots Landing Urinary incontinence EastEnders Breastfeeding Insomnia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Suicide methods Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Days of our Lives Obstetrics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Breech birth Sleep Figure skating Pregnancy First aid Traumatic brain injury Dog training Swingout Swimming Backstroke Fetus Apollo 8 The Amber Spyglass Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Air embolism Skateboarding trick Pulmonary embolism Friends W.I.T.C.H.
