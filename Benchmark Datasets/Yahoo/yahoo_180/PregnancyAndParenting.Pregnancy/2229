can i do anything for my mucus plug to fall out i'm weeks and i can't take it anymore mucus plug will only fall out once your cervix starts to dialate this being said chemicals in sperm are said to soften your cervix in effect ripening it to help get you ready for labor also remember that even if your plug does come out it doesn't mean your in labor and it won't help you go into labor it just is another sign that labor is soon it's better to have it there since it protects against bacteria until it's gone Cervix Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Sexual reproduction Tobacco Childbirth Semen Intact dilation and extraction Cystic fibrosis Oral contraceptive Misoprostol Diaphragm (contraceptive) Birth control Asthma Pregnancy Miscarriage Abortion Stomach cancer Strap-on dildo Common cold Obstetrics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ulcerative colitis Premature birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Breech birth Acne Helicobacter pylori Diving Ovulation Immune system Australian Labor Party Hay fever BS 1363 Female reproductive system (human) National Football League Slug Working time Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Trade union American lobster Butt plug Fetal development Mucus Emergency contraception Spark plug Wheel of Fortune Carburetor Dimenhydrinate Pok__mon Live!
