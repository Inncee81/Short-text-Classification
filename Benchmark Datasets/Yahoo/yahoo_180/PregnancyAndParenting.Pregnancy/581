i don't know how to feel anymore my year old bestfriend found out shes pregnant her and her boyfriend decided that she should get an abortion she told me if she could keep it she would but she knows that having a baby this young could make life really hard i know now more then ever she could really use support but i dont know what to think or feel i use to be pro choice towards abortion but knowing deep down she wants to keep the baby well it confuses me and is distancing me from her i want to be there for her through all of this but i'm not sure what to do to put my feelings aside because i can't sort through them to start with i'll be upfront i'm completely pro life yes a baby is an incredibly burden but an abortion is worse i've heard so many horror stories about abortions not only is it a horrible ordeal physically for the woman to go through but psychologically too your friend will have to live the rest of her long life with the weight that she murdered an innocent child that's too much for many women to bear if she honestly cannot raise the child herself consider putting it up for adoption she'll save the life that she's responsible for but without having to have support and raise the child herself Abortion debate EastEnders Abortion in the United States Knots Landing Friends One Life to Live Infantilism Pro-choice Kodocha Miscarriage Partial-birth abortion Prenatal diagnosis Transsexuality Neighbours The Amber Spyglass Anti-abortion movement History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Daredevil Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hillary Rodham Clinton Pregnancy Adoption Laura Schlessinger John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Avenue Q GMA Films Roe v.
