weeks pregnant what do you think you would do just looking for opinions i am weeks today last tues i was admitted to the hospital for induction because the amniotic fluids had been low for a week or so but i wasn't dialated at all and i sat for hrs on the pitocin with no results so i stayed overnight got the fluids back up and went home the next morning only other option would have been a c section but baby was fine and obviously not ready so i decided not to do that now tomorrow i go back to get my fluids checked again at my dr's if they are low again i have options to try and get induced again get my fluids replenished again or get a c section i don't see the point in the induction again as my cervix is still not ready the fluid thing could work but my dr said the fluids would most likely keep going down at this point if they are low again so i'd have to keep going back to get checked fluids replenished i am trying to avoid the surgery but am confused as what would be the best thing at this point baby is very healthy etc i'm just wondering what would you do if in this situation and had to decide between these choices i am trying to decide ahead of time so if the fluids are low tomorrow i know what i want to do i did ask the dr which of these would be the best option he said there was really no right answer because at this point any would work because the baby's health is good and not in danger if i chose to just have the fluids monitored they would keep raising the levels if needed so the baby wouldnt be sitting on low fluids for any long length of time my personal opinion if the baby is doing well why interfere at week chance are you will be having baby soon i would not opt for a c section do some research on low fluid levels what the effects on baby are what is the cause what is the treatment how is the treatment going to change the outcome how did they diagnose you with low fluid what were the symptoms my bigger concern for you is the pitocin please look it up it can cause serious complications generally raises you chances of c section if you decide to try induction i wouldn't recommend ask them to start with less invasive methods there are more gentle methods that will get labor started if your body is close to delivery i would be happy to discuss this further at moms current events gmail com drink lots of fluids starting right now this will raise your fluid levels help keep the dr at bay if you do not want a c section or induction baby is doing fine then stick up for youself baby refuse babies are born when they are ready not when it is convenient for dr 's parents under normal circumstances the amount of amniotic fluid you have increases until the beginning of your third trimester it generally peaks at weeks at which point you may carry about a quart of the stuff after that it gradually decreases until you give birth babycenter com Prostate cancer Obstetrics Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prenatal diagnosis Pregnancy Pneumonia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stomach cancer Hypoglycemia Androgen insensitivity syndrome In vitro fertilisation Intact dilation and extraction Cytomegalovirus Breech birth Dialysis Traumatic brain injury Hyperthermia Birth weight Insulin Folic acid Premature birth Clinical depression Poker jargon Diabetes mellitus Multiple sclerosis Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Decompression sickness Extreme Programming Blood pressure Stroke Autism Drowning Medicine Miscarriage Amniotic sac Microeconomics Spina bifida EastEnders Anorexia nervosa Electroconvulsive therapy Carburetor Intravenous therapy Milton H.
