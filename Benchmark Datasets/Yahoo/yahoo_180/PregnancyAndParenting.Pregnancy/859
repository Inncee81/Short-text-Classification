question ok this may sound really stupid but i was thinking all of the pregnancy tests say that they are accurate from the day of your missed period but this is assuming you conceived around ovulation while i know is the most fertile time but what if you did conceive until a couple of day before you period was actually due how long you after your official missed period would you expect to get a positive test no correct answer here really i mean if you concieved right before your period was due and missed it then you should wait a little bit like weeks at least to test i know with my first pregnancy i didn't test until i was weeks pregnant this time i tested positive days before i was due it all depends on your body Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Pregnancy test In vitro fertilisation Miscarriage Polycystic ovary syndrome Abortion Obstetrics Human chorionic gonadotropin Twin HIV test Birth control GED Drug test Friends Abortion debate Breastfeeding Oral contraceptive Social rule Sexual abstinence Ovulation Multiple birth Prenatal diagnosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gonorrhoea Emergency contraception Niddah Big Brother UK series 6 Estrus cycle Jeopardy!
