what's going on miscarriage i recently took a pregnanct test positive after a period on june th last night tho i started bleeding not heavily somewhat lightly moderate much lighter than my period and had some cramping today i went to the er and they took my blood my hcg level is but since they say i'm only weeks they can't see anything but a fluid filled sack in my uterus he told me to come back on sunday to check my hcg levels again if they are going up then i have a normal pregnancy progressing if they stay the same then it may be ectopic which he doesn't believe is happening if they go down then i am officially miscarrying did this happen to anyone here and if so did you progress to a miscarriage or a normal pregnancy i don't have any clots or tissue coming out and my cramps aren't severe just like dull pains in my lower abdomen no sharp pains on either side some back pain but my back always hurts i have an month old lol thanks for any advice and my cervix is not opening as of today and my cramping started to hurt a little more in the hospital but still not enough for me to say i hurts or be bed ridden i haven't needed any pain meds so far but i'll see what happens well sweetie its really hard to say with my miscarriage i bled for a month and a half before i acually miscarried you may just be bleeding because this is around the time you normally would have had your period or maybe the baby implanted wrong and is readjusting or you may be miscarrying just dont stress because it will make it worse for baby and wait for your blood tests but at weeks they could see my babys heart beat so i am not sure on this just relax pray and keep your mind busy until you can see the blood test and good luck Obstetrics Menstrual cycle Endometriosis Pregnancy Abortion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Traumatic brain injury Stomach cancer Childbirth Urinary incontinence Pregnancy test Prostate cancer Dialysis Premature birth Breastfeeding Endometrial cancer Stroke Breech birth Intact dilation and extraction Cryptorchidism Uterus Fertility awareness Medicine Prenatal diagnosis Cancer Coeliac disease Human chorionic gonadotropin EastEnders Gonorrhoea Hypertension Aortic dissection Myocardial infarction Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Gynecologic hemorrhage In vitro fertilisation Polycystic ovary syndrome Intravenous therapy Coronary heart disease Social rule Diabetes mellitus Ovarian cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Coagulation Von Willebrand disease Intracranial pressure Atherosclerosis HIV test Cervical cancer Pneumonia Vaginal bleeding Morning sickness Decompression sickness Pelvic inflammatory disease Puberty Chlamydia Abdominal pain Equine conformation Time Out of Mind Cirrhosis Cramp Gynaecology Pulmonary embolism Cardiac arrhythmia Chronic fatigue syndrome Antiphospholipid syndrome Hip fracture Knife Folic acid Twin Hemorrhagic stroke Paget's disease of bone Theory of conduct Anal sex The Inside Spina bifida Leukemia Blood pressure Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Diabetic retinopathy Cervix Dysmenorrhea Migraine Blood on the Tracks Atrial septal defect Caesarean section
