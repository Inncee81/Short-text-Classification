anyone have experience breast feeding after breast reduction i had the surgery in january and i wonder if i will be able to breast feed when we have a baby the dr didnt fully remove nipple and said she kept everything in tact so i would hopefully be able to breast feed one day any feedback please note i did not have implants like one of you stated its a reduction they took away not added to most likely as long as the ducts are still intact i doubt they would remove them and even if some are missing or damaged i think it is something in total you have and your breasts will be able to compensate for the lacking or damaged ducts i would speak with your doctor prior to birth to make sure you aren't spending hours trying to feed if their are no ducts Breast Breastfeeding Mammary gland Breast reduction Androgen insensitivity syndrome Brassiere Plastic surgery Breast implant Infant Breast reconstruction Mastitis Insulin Nipple Abortion Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Intersex surgery Gypsy moth Obstetrics Breast fetishism Dairy Publicly funded medicine Sexual differentiation Prostate cancer Jaundice Cancer Penis Fecal incontinence Cirrhosis Prolactinoma Body modification Liver Menstrual cycle Sex organ Obesity Breast cancer Fume hood Taxation in the United States Radiation therapy Folic acid Oral contraceptive Swyer syndrome Baby bottle Prolactin Chagas disease Emergency contraception Acupuncture Adverse effect (medicine) Chicken Milk M60 machine gun Childbirth Sex reassignment surgery female-to-male Human sexual response cycle Nudity Kidney Liver transplantation Hypoglycemia Breast milk Acute pancreatitis Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Bone fracture Thyroid Fertility awareness In vitro fertilisation Epilepsy Aircraft flight control systems Spina bifida Premature birth Psoriasis Ovarian cancer A Day in the Life Seabird Yoko Ono Contract Nipple piercing Pregnancy Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Intact dilation and extraction Puberty Breast bondage Colorectal cancer Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Intersexuality Breast pump M16 (rifle) Fuel injection Tocopherol Cytomegalovirus Stroke Asexuality History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Cracking (chemistry) Hypnosis Hyperplasia Thermal power station Chronic fatigue syndrome Internal ballistics Strogg
