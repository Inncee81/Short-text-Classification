menstruation alright i woke up last friday with some brownish blood to my surprise it was also about time for me to get my period then i had nothing much for a while and then it got heavy it lasted up to sunday and then it got lighter it's not tuesday and i still had some light flow today may i add in the first days i had some clotting and some sticky slimy discharge how long does implantation bleeding last and do you think it was only my period or thanks a ton i didn't grow up talking about all this stuff so yeah sure sounds like a period to me people often panic when their period is just slightly different than what they are used to for example if someone regularly bleeds for days and then for one cycle they bleed for only it doesn't necessarily mean you are pregnant in fact if you have flow that is heavy like a period even if it is only for days chances are you are not pregnant implantation bleeding is normally just spotting of pink to brownish not full flow like a period and you would not be passing clots like a period but if you're worried always take a test if its negative and you're still worried go see a doctor and have a blood test Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Endometriosis Stroke Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Intravenous therapy Bleeding Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Von Willebrand disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Blood pressure Coagulation Jet engine Stomach cancer Rei Ayanami Miscarriage Naruto jutsu Diabetic retinopathy Gonorrhoea Myocardial infarction Endometrial cancer Niddah Bringing It All Back Home Endometrium Natt__ StarCraft: Uprising Gynecologic hemorrhage In vitro fertilisation Jeopardy!
