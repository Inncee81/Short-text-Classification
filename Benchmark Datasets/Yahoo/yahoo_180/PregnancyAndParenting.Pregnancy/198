planned c section or normal delivery i am pregnant with my second baby and my obstetrician has agreed that i can have a planned c section this is because i had a very difficult long labour with my first daughter now and a half i was left with significant pain for some time and post traumatic stress i'm really relieved to be having a c section i never want to go through another experience like my first labour again but now people keep giving me dire warnings about how bad the recovery is and all the things that could go wrong have you had an elective cesearian if so how bad is it do you think it would be better for me to risk a normal birth i would look at it from a different angle hun you went through a bad situation and your labor with your daughter was not normal when people insist on giving you advice on this subject more then likely they are expecting that you will have a normal delivery and yes with a normal delivery it is easier and healthier for you to do a vaginal delivery instead of a c section i wouldn't listen to them since they didn't go through what you went through personally i'm in the same boat as you i've already told my doctor i want a c section this time around since my son's delivery landed me in emergency surgery to stop bleeding i'm also looking at the risk of uterine rupture this time around due to the tearing i had with my son so no i don't think your decision is wrong or bad in any way i can also add my best friend was convinced to have a vbac for her third daughter after a csection with her twins she swears to this day that the vaginal delivery was more tramatic and longer recovery time then with her twins it's a personal decision that you alone can make don't let other people's opinions and fears influence your decisions Caesarean section Obstetrics Breech birth Abortion Pregnancy Miscarriage Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Partial-birth abortion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abortion debate Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Stomach cancer Episiotomy Endometrial cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Menstrual cycle Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Urinary incontinence Radiation therapy Psoriasis Strap-on dildo Traumatic brain injury Prostate cancer Milton H.
