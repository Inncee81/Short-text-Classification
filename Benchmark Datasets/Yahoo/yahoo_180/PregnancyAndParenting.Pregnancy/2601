could i really be pregnant about two weeks ago on the st i had unprotected sex with my long time boyfriend he pulled out before the initial sperm ejaculation however i know there is also alot of pre ejaculate sperm i did not take any after pills at all and i am not on birth control the past couple days my breasts have felt really tender and sore to the touch i normally get my period about now but have gotten it late before i have also been feeling extreemly fatiged even though i have been getting hours of sleep a night do you think i am pregnant i did have light spotting the about two or three days after sex yes there is a chance you are pregnant if you have a lil blood coming out dont just automatically think its a period it could be spotting there is no such thing as a period during pregnancy but alot of people mistaken spotting for periods so they dont think they're pregnant when the actually are during early pregnancy you could have the following symtoms nausea dizziness tiredness cant eat properly and always feel bloated you should get a pregnancy test try to go to the doctors for a pregnancy test as home pregnancy tests arent always accurate and dont be so silly next time get the morning after pill next time if it happens again good luck chic x Fertility awareness Pregnancy Birth control Menstrual cycle Prostate cancer Psoriasis Obstetrics EastEnders Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Urinary incontinence Miscarriage Infertility Stomach cancer Oral sex Sexual intercourse Breastfeeding Abortion debate Folic acid Pornographic movie Safe sex Jam (TV series) Orgasm Endometriosis Puberty Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Abortion Childbirth Sleep Androgen insensitivity syndrome Morning sickness Cytomegalovirus Coeliac disease Prolactinoma Sharon Tate Neighbours Sex education Twin Big Brother UK series 6 Trazodone Prenatal diagnosis Condom Pregnancy test Sexual revolution Sexual reproduction Maprotiline Diabetic retinopathy Coitus interruptus Hypoglycemia Conker's Bad Fur Day Ebola Days of our Lives Sex and the City History of sex Gonorrhoea Sulfasalazine Jennifer Lopez Social rule Soap opera Sexual abstinence Guinea pig Sperm Whale Premature ejaculation Dialysis Friends Spina bifida Ovarian cancer Boston Public Hypertension WCBS-FM Stroke Haloperidol Child sexuality Crystal methamphetamine and sex Penis Teenage pregnancy Jon Secada Clomipramine Premature birth Apollo 8 AIDS Great Teacher Onizuka Abduction Phenomenon Group A streptococcal infection Sexual dysfunction Depo Provera Turner syndrome Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Patrick Star Intrauterine device Billboard Hot 100 Caffeine Testicular cancer Niddah
