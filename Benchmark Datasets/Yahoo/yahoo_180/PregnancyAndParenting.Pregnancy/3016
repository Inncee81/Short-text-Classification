could i be pregnant okay last month i started on july th it's august th today i had alot of discharge this morning and a couple days ago i had heavy discharge also my breasts are a little more sensitive than usual our annual fair is on the th i don't know which days i'm going but i really don't want to be on my period there while at my boyfriends house i rubbed myself up and down on his penis i had shorts a thong and panty liner on and he had boxers and shorts on aka dry sex so i'm freaking out that i may be pregnant and i just want to start before the fair d well if its dry sex and his penis didnt go inside u then u are not pregnant if he touched himself and some of his wet is on his fingers and he put it inside u there is a small chance u can get pregnant always remember having sex on your period can get u get pregnant just a smaller chance of it your period may not have came yet because your too stressed out or there is something going on if your not sure its good to go into the pharmacy and get a test that should clear your mind but these tests arent always right so its best if you go to your nurse and let her do it to get a more acurate answer good luck x Gonorrhoea Fertility awareness Strap-on dildo Pornographic movie Menstrual cycle Birth control Condom Knife Breastfeeding Sex and the City Pregnancy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Undergarment Gender role Urinary incontinence Human penis size Puberty Masturbation Big Brother UK series 6 Human sexual behavior Orgasm Weather lore Androgen insensitivity syndrome EastEnders Capercaillie Psoriasis Obstetrics Equine conformation Anal sex Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Social rule Penis Drawn Together Sex assignment Internal ballistics Neighbours Kurt Cobain Jam (TV series) Brian Close Sydney Riot of 1879 The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Great Teacher Onizuka Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Game show 2000 Australian Grand Prix Stomach cancer Schizophrenia Bottlenose Dolphin Big Brother (Australian TV series) Breast George Costanza Shoe Humphrey Bogart Sanitary towel Sharon Tate Knots Landing Elephant William S.
