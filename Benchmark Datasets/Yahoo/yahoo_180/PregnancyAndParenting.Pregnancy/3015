morning sickness question i am confused over morning sickness i am in my th week and i don't know if i have morning sickness or not i don't think that smells or just seeing food makes me sick i feel fine for the most part the first weeks i had horrid hearburn and have learned to manage that with eating tums and chewing gum now i have just started this week to have a mild funny feeling just after or just before eating i guess my real question is does morning sickness start out full blown and you vomit or does your body kind of ease into it we were trying to conceive for months and i'm a nerveous wreck that something is going to go wrong i have my first ultrasound friday but i think i might go nuts before i see an actual baby there and developing thank you the only real symptoms i have is mildly tender nipples i keep reading that the areolas will darken and you will notice more veins in your breasts but i haven't not every women has the same symptoms of morning sickness what ever you are feeling is normal for you some women have full blown vomiting and some aren't sick at all your breast tenderness is normal and your aerolas will darken over time must be your first baby there are many books out there for you a really good one is what to expect when you are expecting good luck also i just want to say that all of my pregnancies were different and i have beautiful and healthy children Pregnancy Breastfeeding Obstetrics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Morning sickness Androgen insensitivity syndrome Ron and Fez Vomiting Breast Prostate cancer Sharon Tate EastEnders Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Miscarriage AFI 100 Years series Mojave people Menstrual cycle Puberty Joke Nipple Social rule Toilet humour Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
