why induction of labor with oxytocin is more successful in women with preeclampsia than normal women women with preeclampsia have hyperreactive reflexes and muscle tone this causes the uterus to be increasingly irritable which is to say more likely to contract especially with stimulation from a source such as oxytocin in women without preeclampsia their uterus is generally not as irritable as a woman with preeclampsia and therefore not quite as favorable for induction even still that is a generalization and every induction is different it depends on a wide variety of factors including how many weeks gestation the condition of the cervix etc Childbirth Obstetrics Oxytocin Breech birth Abortion Muscle Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Androgen insensitivity syndrome Premature birth Pregnancy Hydatidiform mole Uterus Miscarriage Cervix Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual intercourse Intact dilation and extraction Endometriosis Gynaecology Menstrual cycle Sexual reproduction Induction (birth) Endometrial cancer Fertility awareness Infertility Sexual differentiation Twin Cephalic disorder Cryptorchidism Birth weight Vagina Stroke Caesarean section Progesterone Human sexual response cycle In vitro fertilisation Diazepam Placenta praevia Orgasm Human height Urination Female reproductive system (human) Embryo transfer Strap-on dildo Puberty Dieting Intersex surgery Ovarian cancer Human Epilepsy Anti-m__llerian hormone Hypopituitarism Menstrual cup Clinical depression Weight training Cervical cancer Eye Hormone Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Artificial insemination Welding Prenatal diagnosis Cat Multiple sclerosis Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Motoneuron Hypnosis Oral contraceptive Atkins Nutritional Approach Cardiac arrhythmia Coeliac disease Glucocorticoid Testosterone Irritable bowel syndrome Placental abruption Woman Skeletal muscle Traumatic brain injury Sexual dysfunction Sex Methamphetamine Pregnancy (mammals) Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Acne Coffee Insulin Intrauterine device Intersexuality Inflation Stenberg v.
