choosing a pediatrician okay i have had several recomendations and had hearsay from people about thier babys doctors i want to know how to scheduale an appointment like an interview with several different pediatritions before i just choose one i want to know what questions should i ask to get a well formed opinion about weather or not i want this person caring for my childs health one thing i know to ask since im having a boy is thier feelings on circumsicion some find it barbaric and i dont im not sure how to go about any of this this is my first child also i want to know about if the pediatrition has to come to the hospital to do the circumsicion or if my ob or a staff member at the hospital does it or does it vary from place to place i figured id get some answers here first so i know what to ask when i speak to my own doctor and then interview pediatritons we have a clinic system so actually 'choosing' a single pediatrician in the absense of a serious medical problem is pretty hard you often get whoever is on call which for the most part is just fine my suggestion is to call the office and talk to the head nurse at the office tell her your requirements specifically about the circumcision and how to set up an appointment to inverview one of the problems with selecting a very popular pediatrician is the difficulty of getting an appointment keep in mind that doctors have training in medicine and injury most have no expertise in parenting and few have any training in child nutrition or breastfeeding you're on your own for that if you plan to actively pursue long term breastfeeding join a le leche group locally and find out what pediatricians are supportive of breastfeeding non supportive doctors shove formula at you the first sign of a problem again they have no training in nutrition if you have issues with vaccines either no vaccine or modified schedule you'll want a physician who isn't going to hassle you each and every appointment some physicians actually have changed on some previously rigid policies now happy to delay vaccines when child is ill finally don't forget that you can always change if you don't feel confident about their advice or treatment don't hesitate to change Medicine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nurse Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Medical analysis of circumcision Childbirth Autism Physician Pediatrics Controversies in autism Emergency department Traditional Chinese medicine Publicly funded medicine Alternative medicine National Health Service Medicare (Canada) Pneumonia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Psychiatry Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Folic acid Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Medical record Transsexuality Phimosis Fertility awareness Autism epidemic AIDS National Institutes of Health Circumcision Thimerosal HIV Terri Schiavo Health maintenance organization General practitioner Epidemiology Allergy Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome MMR vaccine Hypoglycemia Homeopathy Nursing Public health in mainland China Chronic fatigue syndrome Tocopherol Cancer Adult attention-deficit disorder Psychiatric hospital Asperger syndrome Involuntary commitment Abortion in the United States Abortion Mental Health Act 1983 U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Urinary incontinence Chinese University of Hong Kong Plame affair Evidence-based medicine Mental retardation Medical malpractice Emergency medical technician Partial-birth abortion Vaccine controversy Malaria Health science Roe v.
