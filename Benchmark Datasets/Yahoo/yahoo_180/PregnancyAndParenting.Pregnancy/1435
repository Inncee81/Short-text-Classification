pain relief ok ive been reading all the stories of women getting all these drugs while in labor and feeling nothing well i have had kids and was never offered drugs i would beg cry scream hold my breathe and all i got was be quiet you'll scare the other patients wtf has anyone else had this happen am i the only one who is refused pain relief and if so i want to know why i had different delivery drs but all were in the same hospital and i am pg with number right now and so terrified of birth i could cry thinking about it my labors are loooong the longest was my rd and that one was hours started on wednesday and had her on friday any idea of how to get over the fear of childbirth now that it has pretty much been ruined for me i hate that i dont get the same beautiful experience that others seem to get ive never had a drug or alcohol problem i've never been on drugs for any mental problems i dont know if this helps you answer or not i am in the us actually the horrid state or should i say commonwealth of ky i have chosen a different hospital and yet again a different dr i have told them the dr nurses ultrasound guy everyone i want pain meds and that i have always been refused before and they seem to sympathize but that doesnt mean much and i dont know that telling them will insure me getting them and it really does nothing to ease the fear i got given the gas pethadine and epidural i didnt ask for the pethhadine or epidural but had to do it for the baby however i'm glad i had the epidural the pethadine made me sick i suggest you should talk to your doctors about your fears tell them that your getting anxious and what has happened in your previous labours tell the doctors that you want drugs during this labour and only accept no if there is a medical reason for not being able to have it eg allergies or if it's too far in the labour make sure they know that if they disagree that you will go to another hospital good luck and remember they are there to look after you not ruin one of the best days of your life Breastfeeding Medicine Traumatic brain injury Obstetrics Epidural Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pregnancy Prostate cancer Anesthesia Caesarean section Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Clinical depression Chronic fatigue syndrome Premature birth Midwifery Alternative medicine Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Asthma Stroke Terri Schiavo EastEnders Anxiety Shaggy dog story Health insurance Humphrey Bogart Abortion debate Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Miscarriage Charles Darwin's illness Transsexuality Panic attack Medical prescription LSD Milton H.
