abortions and teenagers i know this is a delicate subject but this shocked me when i read this article in a paper more and more teenagers are having abortions even though sex awareness is high free condoms available and the morning after pill do you think that abortions should be available on the nhs as some teenagers think this is the easy way out even though abortion should be your last option or do you think it should be made private and only on certain case's on the nhs for example health reasons rape etc maybe if it wasn't readily available teens may take more caution before having sex whats your views on this babeheart an unborn child is not a parasite and these girl are told at the age of at school about sex it only takes a couple of seconds to apply a condom and also what would a young girl do if she contracted an std aids she can't easily get rid of that can she laurawhitby i don't think you understood my question i don't want abortion to be banned im not talking about choice i know its your choice to have one or not what im saying is to make people pay for the treatment and only let people with important needs to have it done free too many young girls are using 'abortions' as their birth control instead of using condoms the pill or the coil etc that is the sad thing about it the so called 'government' needs to address this issue as more serious than they do already and decide on a better way of handling the ever increasing numbers of teen pregnancies and abortions i personally don't agree with abortions unless the girl woman was raped and couldn't handle carrying raising the child who was concieved in that manner or the fetus has a serious medical condition and wouldn't survive once born or suffer alot if it did live Abortion debate Abortion Sex education Birth control Abortion in the United States Roe v.
