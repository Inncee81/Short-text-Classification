does anyone have any opinions on the comfort and look of maternity scrubs i work in the medical field and wear scrubs occasionally i was looking at some in a catalog today and saw some that were the empire waist and tied in the back i have seen maternity scrubs like these are they essentially one in the same i was thinking about getting some of these tops and would like to use them as maternity scrubs down the road has anyone worn these type of tops and are they comfortable my issue with regular scrub tops is that they don't fit me right and feel tight and uncomfortable even if i go a size up i also don't want them to look like a maternity top until i need them to be maternity tops i wear scrubs everyday i am currently pregnant and have found that the only difference between maternity scrubs and empire waist scrubs is that the maternity scrubs cost more because they are maternity there is no difference from what i can tell they are very comfortable and fashionable when not pregnant so don't waste on maternity scrubs Brassiere Corset History of corsets Undergarment Strap-on dildo Mattress Breastfeeding Stocking Scrubs Kimono Pregnancy Upholstery Hakama Leggings Skirt and dress The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Pantyhose Snowboard Roe v.
