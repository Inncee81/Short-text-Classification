is it labor thanks for your advice weeks and days i'm due tomorrow and since pm i've had bad menstrual cramps that came every minutes and lasted a couple of minutes but around pm they went away slightly coming about every mins pm they started up again every minutes no plug lost here's the feeling its a bad menstrual cramp that lasts about seconds followed by my tummy making a tight hard ball and on the right side of my pelvis its a sharp pain the tightening will go away but there's still the pain of my pelvis and menstrual cramps so is this labor baby has also calmed down on activity she barely moved today i drank two glasses of juice and now she's moving slightly more i heard that baby stops moving when labor starts is that true the reason why i ask is because my st pregnancy was totally different i didnt have this menstrual feeling and it came every minutes on top of each other the moment i felt it my back was tingly and tight it sounds like early labor this could progress to active labor or slow down go away and come back call your hospital and ask them if you should come in or stay home until the contractions get stronger and closer together they may want to check your cervix too for dilation what you are describing are contractions and they will get stronger as labor progresses also nd babies usually come faster than st deliveries so if you are a long way from your hospital you should head on in congratulations and good luck Childbirth Pregnancy Premature birth Equine conformation Menstrual cycle Obstetrics Cramp Fast bowling Urinary incontinence Endometriosis Breastfeeding Abortion New York Giants Cervix Babe Ruth Intact dilation and extraction Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jon Secada Poker jargon Gonorrhoea Fertility awareness Weight training Strap-on dildo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dysmenorrhea Caesarean section Prostate cancer Cliff Richard Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Volleyball Traumatic brain injury First aid Glossary of American football Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Speed of light Norway national football team Migraine Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Four square Good Morning, Vietnam Glossary of partner dance terms Endometrial cancer Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Sexual intercourse 2000 Australian Grand Prix Stomach cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Chlorpromazine New England Patriots Xiangqi Myocardial infarction Ben Johnson (athlete) Professional wrestling slang Estrus cycle Coffee Hey Jude Oral contraceptive Indian Oil Cup 2005 Pelvis Knots Landing Time Out of Mind Sydney Riot of 1879 Blood on the Tracks Elephant Pump It Up Electrophysiology Upholstery Sharon Tate Piano The Caves of Androzani Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Marriage Spice Girls Friends Care Bears Fecal incontinence Ectopic pregnancy Minutes Kurt Angle Clown Pitaten Shaggy dog story Social rule Red Hot Chili Peppers Cannabis (drug) EastEnders Dyspareunia Tenshinhan Melanie Wilkes Swingout Mattress Kasparov versus The World Niddah Dialysis The Contender (television series) Deflation (economics)
