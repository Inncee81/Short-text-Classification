i may be pregnant and i'm sick what should i do about the medication i was prescribed i have a terrible sinus infection and i'm having trouble breathing because of it i was prescribed brometane dx and amoxocilin i need the medicine badly but i may be pregnant what should i do i couldn't see my doctor until monday and i'm in terrible agony i saw my doctor last night and i guess it just slipped my mind to bring it up to her that there's a possibility i wouldn't be able to see her again until monday my period isn't due until wednesday i'm certain it's too early to test i agree with dani the amoxicillian is fine but because the brometane has ingredients that may be dangerous to your possible developing baby i'd skip that until you see your doc tussin syrup is ok to use it will loosen up your chest it's the decongestant in the brometane that would worry me the antibiotic will clear up the most of it use a breathing tent to help your sinuses clear heat up water on the stove pour it in a bowl and carefully put your head over the bowl on the table with a towel over your head the steam will open drain your sinuses just be careful it's not so hot you steam burn your face if you have some vick's vapo rub put a bit of that in the water as well as on your chest great stuff there's also some new menthol tablets you drop in the shower that help decongest but really if you call your doc they should be able to tell you what's up First aid Common cold Pneumonia Sinusitis Traumatic brain injury Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Chronic fatigue syndrome Sauna Hyperthermia Cephalexin Breastfeeding Coffee Dialysis Cocaine Pregnancy Sento Medical prescription Kitchen Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cystic fibrosis Malaria Conspiracy (TNG episode) Cardiac arrhythmia History of Test cricket (to 1883) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gonorrhoea Nasal congestion Characters of Naruto Traditional Chinese medicine Customs and etiquette of Japan Eczema Shaggy dog story Characters in the Smurfs Knots Landing Childbirth Japanese tea ceremony Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Professional wrestling holds YuYu Hakusho Chicken soup Gastroesophageal reflux disease Insomnia Menthol Ben Johnson (athlete) Doctor Emmett Brown Fire fighting New York Giants Jam (TV series) Theory of conduct Medicine Tuberculosis The Inside Lyme disease Warren Sapp Major League Baseball television contracts Physical therapy Nitroglycerin Tobacco Atrial septal defect Monday Night Football Methamphetamine Tea Back to the Future timeline Pharmaceutical company Professional wrestling throws Asthma EastEnders Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Stomach cancer Acne Aspergillosis Al Michaels Humphrey Bogart AFI 100 Years series Route of administration Kidney Manicure Coeliac disease Internal ballistics Mesothelioma Brewery Thermal power station Dog Glen Jacobs Milton H.
