rose and the rest who just answered rose just so that you know you are very rude the rest thanks but infortunately here in my country things are diferent we dont get to have a mid wife or a personal doc we get to ask these questions i am asking only when i go to baby check up which my first one will be tomorow so you dont have to be rude and rose know that the first impression is the lasting impression thanks again the rest and by the way thise who is ind to answer tomorow i am going for my first check up is it ok for me to bring my boy friend he is the dad but is it a real good idea for him to acompany me hi keshia i remember you saying you only get check ups and not a regular doctor or midwife must be difficult ask away though and as a collective we preggy women will do our best to answer well most other countries will allow dad to be present for appointments check ups etc and i don't see how it should be any different for where you're based its great he wants to be there and also be involved it might give him a chance to ask a few questions he may have this is probably the view that the person conducting your check up will have my partner has been with me at every appointment i've had for our baby and so far has had nothing but praise for being so interested and caring i'd certainly say go together he's as much a part of your baby as you are i think it's lovely he wants to go with you loulla xxx Socrates Social rule Childbirth Infantilism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Knots Landing Stomach cancer Friends Jennifer Lopez Origin belief Jon Secada Internet fraud Ethics American Dad!
