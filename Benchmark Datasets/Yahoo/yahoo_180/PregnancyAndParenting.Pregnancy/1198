what are side effects of stress during pregnancy just wondering if anyone has been there stress during pregnancy i'm beginning my second tri mester and due to circumstances outside of my control i am extremely stressed out anyone out there know about the effects of stress during pregnancy i'm talking about what the stress can do to you and the baby i know all about relaxation and such that's not what i'm looking for just different ways that stress can take it's toll mainly physically for both baby and me and yes i have an ob and three other kids i'm just putting this out there for all you moms who have been through this and can offer me some information based on reality i guess i'm just curious thanks for your help i've often wondered this myself having had children and been through some rough times i did some research and found that there is a greater risk of miscarriage late in the first trimester and more premature low weight babies if there has been severe stress in early pregnancy but you are in your second trimester and there are also studies that have shown there is more of a buffer for the effects of stress later in the pregnancy although they don't know why so i would not worry so much about it now here's something really interesting to prove that point i found it on dr spock one interesting report surveyed pregnant women in california after the northridge earthquake which registered on the richter scale it found that the earthquake was rated most stressful by mothers in their first trimester and least stressful by those in their third trimester postpartum women showed similar levels of stress to first trimester mothers this pattern of responses indicates that an advanced pregnancy may somewhat protect women from the psychological effects of acute stress personally i think it must be due to hormones which surge in early pregnany and then later during the postpartum time women are more vulnerable at these times interesting question Abortion Obstetrics Miscarriage Postpartum depression Breastfeeding Childbirth Abortion debate Abortion in the United States Roe v.
