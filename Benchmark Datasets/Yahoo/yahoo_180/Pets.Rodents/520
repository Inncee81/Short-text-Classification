getting two rats i've convinced my mom to let me get a rat notice how i say a rat she says i can't have more than one rat i tried sending her articles via email about how rats are much happier with company of their own kind and how it's really not much more trouble having two rats as opposed to just one and just in case you're thinking i'm irresponsible don't worry because i have spent hours and hours researching care and handling and the diet of pet rats and cages and i know basically everything about owning one i am ready to make the commitment of being a rat owner also i've proven myself responsible by taking good care of my guinea pigs for years do you have any ideas on what i could tell her in order to convince her to let me get two rats at least sorry this is so long btw rats do get along better with two esp in case you have a really busy day without much time to spend with them i'm guessing she's worried about the smell here are some facts that might help male rats have a body odor females tend not to so if you go with females that will reduce some of the smell another thing is when you have two rats you must clean the cage at least every three days i usually went with two by doing so the rats will be healthier and the cage less stinky i'm not talking about just scooping the bedding out i'm talking about a complete washdown nod also there have been people who say having two rats makes them love you less not true instead of having one happy wiggly rat eager for you to play with it you'll have two and they'll be more upbeat in attitude because they'll have each other when in the cage good luck Guinea pig Hamster Fancy rat Theory of conduct Cat House Mouse Philosophical skepticism The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Vitamin C Animal Liberation Front Phoebe Buffay's songs Avenue Q Garfield Sin City Ren and Stimpy Rat (zodiac) The Inside Coconut crab Ferret Rat Park Professional wrestling match types Plame affair Infantilism Sleep The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hey Arnold!
