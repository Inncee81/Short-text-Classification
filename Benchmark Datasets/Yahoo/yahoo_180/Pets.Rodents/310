how do i get my gerbil out of the cage i just adopted a gerbil from petco today it came with a cage a dirty one i had to clean it but i cant get it out of the cage how do i grab it it scares me and it's very fast please tell me how i can get to be more friendly toward me please help p s it's also scared of me it sounds like the people at petco really neglected this poor creature if it's already an adult brace yourself this is gonna take some time the first thing to remember is that to the gerbil you are a big scary monster thing that makes deep loud noises and tries to snatch it up for dinner lol as funny as it sounds it's true always wash your hands before trying to reach in the cage if there are any outside scents on you mainly other animals this will only make matters worse gerbils are as a fact quick jumpy creatures that rarely stay still seriously the only time ours ever was still was when it was asleep if you try picking it up by the tail make sure to grab near the base as close to the body as possible if you grab to close to the tip the tail will rip in half o o gross i know i personally go for gently wrapping my fingers around the middle of the rodent and lifting letting the animal rest its feet on the palm of my other hand try to give the gerbil something to put its feet on so it isn't dangling this will help keep it from having a complete panic attack i know this isn't going to be exeptionally comforting but it's practically a fact you must face with neglected abused animals you're probably going to get bitten sooner or later on a bright note i've owned rabbits gerbils rats dogs snakes mice hamsters etc gerbils don't generally bite hard if i recall correctly it's like a quick pinch the worst bite i've ever gotten our rabbit took a slice out of me still've got the scar can just imagine this is where i got in a fight with a gang this scar's from a rabid dog yeah this is my rabbit scar lol seriously don't be scared of this thing the worst you'll get is a quick nip or a few poops on you remember animals can sense fear the more panicky you feel while trying to handle the gerbil the worse it'll react when you do get it out speak softly no quick movements always give treats when you put it back in the cage in time it will grow accustomed to you they're really wonderful hyperactive pets Cat Hamster Shaggy dog story Skateboarding trick Equine conformation Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aerial (dance move) Ferret Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Guinea pig Milton H.
