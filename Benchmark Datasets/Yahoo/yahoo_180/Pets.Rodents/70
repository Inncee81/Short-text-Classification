escaping hamsters to of my hamsters escaped today i found them though one was under the fridge and the other one was sleeping in the broiler on the oven the reason they keep getting out is because theres this little gap in the cage and i lost the thing that covers it i don't want to use tape though any suggestions i dont want to use tape because it would stick to their fur and dont tell me to bye a new cage because i can't aford one weelllllll you could get a new cage but i know that costs money what you could do i've done this is sew the 'gap' with wire somewhat like you would 'lace' a shoe if it's a cage with metal bars then it's pretty easy to do just loop it around so they hamsters can't squeeze out anymore if it's solid plastic where the gap is it's slightly trickier to 'sew' plastic you need to put 'holes' in it first which is easy to do hold a safety pin or small nail with pliers over a flame gas stove works great until it's 'red hot' then 'poke' a hole in the place you want one make holes opposite one another at intervals smaller than a hamster can fit between then loop some wire through problem solved no more escapees i currently have degus hamster a squirrel as well as other 'un caged' animals believe me i know about 'critters' that go a w o l good luck Hamster Textile manufacturing Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Professional wrestling match types Wire Plastic Earring M16 (rifle) Floppy disk Climbing equipment Glossary of climbing terms Textile manufacturing terminology Electrical wiring RuneScape quests Hand grenade Spark plug Bong Kitchen Violin Knife Screw Salad Fingers Welding Seismic retrofit Internal ballistics Stove Punch card Solar cell Diving regulator Tire Ferret John Cage Lace-making Fancy rat Chinchilla Gas metal arc welding Zipper Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Chopsticks Drill bit Tesla coil Comanche Magic (illusion) The Young Ones (TV series) Guinea pig M60 machine gun Knitting Magnet 2000 Australian Grand Prix Floorball Golf Mattress Wok Casting Barbed wire Transistor Land mine Domestic rabbit Sewing machine 24 Hours of Le Mans Glass Naval mine Fire fighting BS 1363 Microwave oven Fire Thermal power station Shoe Horseshoe Shoelaces Poker jargon Incandescent light bulb Traditional animation Atari 8-bit family Cruising (maritime) Drag racing Rail terminology Pebble bed reactor Portable stove Conker's Bad Fur Day Asbestos Electrophysiology Chess strategy and tactics Electric motor Condom Transformer Rebreather Wire wrap Zhao Yun Inertial guidance system Rail tracks Circuit design Parachute Clarinet Wrench Shotgun Fast bowling
