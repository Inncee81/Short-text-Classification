can i introduce new female rats to the i already have well i actually don't already have mine i'll be getting them next week but i was wondering if in the future i could get some more and they could live together peacefully in the cage i think the cage i have could hold up to females comfortably it's a multi level ferret cage also does the size matter much they will all be fancy rats but my local petco sorts them according to size the that i am going to get are large i think but if i added some in that were small or medium would they be in danger from the larger ratties i have asked this question too but first petco has a bad rep for selling feeder rats as pets this is not ok feeder rats have not been properly handled and usually inter bred here are some things to watch for when getting your rats and some tips watch the rats for a while if they are in active dont get them if they look sick matted fur cloudy eyes red feet discharge of any kind dont get them ask to hold your new rats before you pay for them if they say no or make up some excuse its probably cuz the rats are not social when the pet sore person opens up the cage watch the rats reactions if they run away or try to bite they have not been socialized i would suggest looking at local shelters first before deciding to get rats from petco shelter rats are always properly handled now to get to your question sorry for the delay are you planning on getting females sounds like it when you said 'can fit females comfortably' females accept other females alot more than males to make the new rats feel welcome dont introduce one rat at a time if you want to get more get two or three more that are already familiar with eachother it is very dangerous to introduce your rats to any new rats without quarantining keeping in separate cages in separate rooms to make sure there will be no spread of diseases the new rats for at least two weeks before they go into the new cage try introducing them on neutral territory somewhere such as a bathroom so that you can keep an eye on them to make sure they get along have the two cages next to each other so the rats from each cage can see each other and smell each other every other day swap the rats new rats in the old rats cage and old rats in the new rats cage so they get used to each others smells this step is the most important one continue cleaning out cages once a week continue cage swaps for at least weeks and regular play times with all the rats out of the cages cage prep for new rats make sure there are enough sleeping spots this is one of the main causes of cage mates getting into fights so make sure there are lots of hammocks houses pvc pipes etc and always make sure you have full food and water another main cause of cagemates fights edit from above but really you shouldnt have more than maybe rats in the same cage anyways correction you can have as many rats as you want in one cage as long as there is cubic feet per rat if space is used wisely have fun with your new rat clan d Hamster Fancy rat Ferret Guinea pig Domestic rabbit House Mouse Pet skunk Cat Trapping RuneScape quests Chinchilla Canary Social rule Japanese tea ceremony Sin City Kakapo Brown Rat Quarantine Equine conformation Rat Fish farming Pet store Rat Park Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Champagne (beverage) Mattress The Shining (film) John Cage Spider Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Kashrut Dog Seabird Mixed martial arts Kitchen Friends Panama Canal PETCO Park Livestock Bong Sea-Monkey Garfield Skinny Puppy Kangaroo Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dairy Sleep Urinary incontinence Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Milton H.
