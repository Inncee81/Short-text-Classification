my hamster got out of her cage somehow and i don't know where she is please give me advice on what to do i put her food bowl with food in it of course by the bookshelf next to my room door when we get home i'm at work with my dad we're going to put a cardboard box with food in the bottom where the bowl currently is and then put a ramp next to it leading to the top then when my hamster goes up the ramp and drops into the box she won't be able to get out right right i'm desperate alright i'll listen very carfully when i get home but i broke out in tears when i found out she wasn't in her cage also i always close my door at night but it has this realy big crack in it and she could easily squeeze through the first night we got her she got out and the only reason we founf her was because she got stuck in a really old gluetrap it was covered in dust so she wasn't very stuck first remember to be as quiet as possible so as not to scare your hamster into an area unreachable to you if you have a ten gallon bucket stack books to form a stair case in the area you think she may be in drop her favorite food in the bottom and a little peanut butter it's smelly and will attract it's attention if you know what room your pet was lost in close the door this keeps it confined and protects it from other pets in the home who might find a hamster to be ummm tasty hamsters are nocturnal meaning they are more active at over night so you will have a better chance of seeing catching your hamster at night check the bucket in the morning with any luck it'll be munching happily on peanut butter good luck Hamster Poker jargon Shaggy dog story Professional wrestling match types New York Giants The Adventures of Pete & Pete Cleveland Browns Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Dalek Invasion of Earth RuneScape quests Plastic Ferret The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Time Machine The Shining (film) RuneScape Mini-Games Trapping Jon Secada Fire fighting Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Equine conformation Pittsburgh Steelers Grandview, U.S.A.
