both of my dwarf hamsters itch all the time and chew on the cage bars do they have mites they are in different cages because one is taking care of four day old babies do all hamsters itch like this not to worry its pretty normal they like to brush on things to leave their smell just like cats not to worry as for the biting i would not suggest a aquarium cage as it does not give enough ventilation for the hamsters but i would suggest you have a cage that has bars but in order for it to stop biting introduce a chew toy for it to chew on so it will now chew on the bars also hamsters also chew on the bars to let you know it is hungry and it is time for you to feed them not to worry hamsters do not overeat so it is okay to give a little extra good luck sabby Fancy rat Domestic rabbit AFI 100 Years series Ferret Care Bears Social rule John Cage Animal testing The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Canary RuneScape quests Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Marilyn Monroe 2000 Australian Grand Prix Guinea pig Pet The Star Wars Holiday Special Chicken Mange Galaxy Angel Tobacco smoking Diseases of the honeybee The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Dog training Halitosis Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Kodocha Breastfeeding Kim Possible Pok__mon Live!
