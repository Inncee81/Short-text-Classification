pregnant dwarf hamster question okay so i have a dwarf hamster and she's already a mommy of babies they're around months old now so they're able to be away from her so i'm not too worried about the basics of her pregnancy i have separated the females and males into their own cages but since the mommy is now pregnant again i wanted to know if i should put her in her own cage away from her daughters or would it not matter i'm just worried that the daughters will get irritated with the new babies or not get along with them i also noticed my mommy hamster isn't exactly the most defensive or protective mom thanks edit thanks for all the answers i'm planning to move her into her own cage soon i know it's not good for her to have babies again so soon and i'm actually worried that this pregnancy will take a lot out of her i didn't intend for another pregnancy and i did have them separated into separate cages as soon as she had her first litter yes someone in my family felt that mommy and daddy should have some time together so hopefully she'll be alright after this thanks again for the help well its a good idea to separate them mother hamsters as i'm sure your aware get very deefncive when pregnant you don't want mommy attacking the others also the others may either try and kill the babies or take them as they have no young of their own no joke lots of species do this good luck Hamster EastEnders Pregnancy Knots Landing Breastfeeding Elephant Friends Abortion debate Joke Days of our Lives God Emperor of Dune Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Charmed Sharon Tate Guinea pig The Young Ones (TV series) AFI 100 Years series Fertility awareness Baby Blues Melanie Wilkes Miscarriage Elvis and Me Shaggy dog story One Life to Live Mommie Beerest Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Marilyn Monroe Kodocha Father Ted StarCraft Episode VI The McGuire Sisters My Family (television) House of M The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Social rule Roe v.
