cage ideas for two female rats i'm planning on getting a second rat fairly soon to accompany my first rat and once she's ready to be moved in with my first rat they'll need a larger cage does anyone have any good ideas what sort of cage should i get how far apart should the wires be and most importantly how large should the cage be links to specific cages would be nice but it isn't necessary thanks in advance i was hoping i wouldn't have to do this but it looks like it serious answers only please thanks don't worry about the introductions i asked about that earlier and got a nice thorough response so i know what i need to do well first of all make sure the space between the wires is less than inch if the new rat your getting is going to be very young i have a pretty big difference in between the wiring on my rat cage that when i first moved my rat in she escaped three times once she was away from her cage for days before we caught her anyway now she can't fit through so as long as the female isn't too small it should be alright she outgrew her escapades in about two weeks make sure to check http sfbay craigslist org just select the area you live and search for what you want rat cages and hopefully you'll find something and if you want there's always ebay although for me i used to have birds and we got our bird cage from a garage sale so it was very cheap when i got a rat i pretty much turned that cage into a rat cage here's a picture of my cage edit old link didn't work http i photobucket com albums x thelognar mycage jpg t kinda hard to see but basically we used a bird cage we got at a garage sale and i sawed two pieces of wood and then sandpapered them for each story on the side then used duct tape thick layers as the bridges or ramps and amazingly it works and my rat loves to run around and climb more than being with me and the duct tape bridges are still holding after a few weeks so if i were you i'd find a garage sale or look in the newspaper for someone selling rat bird cages and build in your own stuff also ferret cages work well though they are very expensive as rats and ferrets typically enjoy the same things in a cage lots of things to run around and play on and lots of room i also hung a pop tart box off the third level and put another little box up there for her to sit in and one on the bottom my rat seems to prefer to store her treats and poop in the hanging box and relax and spy in the one at the top i also heard that you should have two square feet per rat so i'd aim for a cage a little bigger than the one i have but by adding it multiple levels much easier with an electric tools btw they can have lots of room to run around in you could also add tunnels and soft hanging nests like they have in most ferret cages if you have the room d Hamster Fancy rat Professional wrestling match types Domestic rabbit Trapping Dog agility Gramophone record Radio controlled airplane Blood on the Tracks John Cage Mattress Ferret Violin Guinea pig The Emancipation of Mimi Theory of conduct Floppy disk Textile manufacturing EastEnders Extreme Programming Redundant array of independent disks RuneScape quests Drill bit Skateboarding trick Shaggy dog story Woodworking Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Bong Japanese tea ceremony CPU design Star Trek Customizable Card Game Bon Jovi Have I Got News For You The Inside Ford Thunderbird Wood Solar cell XML Electrophysiology Pet Sounds Compact audio cassette Magic (illusion) Antenna (radio) The Star Wars Holiday Special RISC Embedded system Taikyoku shogi Bass guitar IBM PC compatible Mozilla Firefox Google Nashville Skyline Milton H.
