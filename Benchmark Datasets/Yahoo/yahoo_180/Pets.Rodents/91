my usually sweet month old rat inflicted some serious bites on me last night i have female siamese rats the smallest one appears to be the alpha rat which is fine because her sister dosen't seem to mind too much however last night while out for play time my little alpha rat for no apparent reason nipped my finger and then when i tried to move my hand away she locked onto my finger inflicting a very painful and nasty puncture wound and a bruise from the force of hanging on she then ran up my chest to my face and bit me hard on the lip my husband waited a few minutes while i was bleeding profusely from my lip then picked her up to return her to her cage she then bit him hard on the thumb this is the first time this has happened she is usually a sweet affectionate and spunky little thing but never has she even attempted to hurt either one of us i'm really upset and concerned and would really love to hear from someone who knows about rats how do we handle her and this behavior and what can we do that this dosen't happen again i had a female rat once who did the very same thing she was always very sweet and then one day out of the blue she would run up to me and bite me in my finger and she drew blood it happened very fast and it happened at least once more that she would draw blood from me every since that first incident started she would always go after my hands and fingers very determined and i knew she was out to bite me needless to say i became very scared of her and could hardly handle her i would always hide my hands in my sleeves when picking her up or wearing thick gloves i tried to handle her as little as possible but i wasn't happy and i had no idea why she became so vicious all of a sudden she had female cage mates and was never agressive to them then one day i had enough of this hiding of hands and being scared of her and i figured an aggressive animal might be crying out for lots of loving and attention to turn around i tried to be compassionate for her behavior one day i carefully took her out of the cage hands hiding of course but i would go sit down with her on my lap i carefully started petting her with my hands in my sleeves at first petting her back then her head she would just sit there and soak in the attention then after some time as i was sure she wasn't going to do anything vicious i slowly took out one finger and petted her back her head crawled her ears etc eventually i had my full hands out and was petting her i took a long time with her every day i tried to give her as much one on one attention as i could and guess what the miracle happened because she literally changed over night she ended up being one of my sweetest rats i've ever had she was always eager to see me when i came home waiting by the cage door and whenever i would hold up my hand in front of her instead of biting me she would always very lovingly lick my fingers very gently and she never even so much as tried to nip at me ever again she was such a sweet girl and i ended up loving her very much and had many many nice moments with her until she had to be put asleep from severe respiratory distress at age one and a half i am so glad i took the time to give her the loving and attention she craved so badly and i am glad that i had her she was a pure joy try doing this with your rat chances are she will turn around so long as you show her you love her very much rather than pulling back from her and not handling her your baby is angry she just wants to be loved good luck Milton H.
