allergic reaction about month ago i used dog and cat shampoo on my guinea pig my friend has guinea pigs and she used before so i thought it was alright after putting shampoo on my guinea pig he started wheezing and sneezing until i rinsed the shampoo off and dried him did he have an allergic reaction he's fine now but i'm just wondering and even though he's seems healthy and happy is there still something wrong with him he eats and drinks normally someone please answer if your guinea pig had an allergic reaction to that shampoo he would most likely be dead as their immune systems are not that strong the best explanation i can think of for this is the fact that he got wet which resulted in a body temperature drop causing him to sneeze and wheeze which is what anyone does as a natural reaction to keep the body warm the same as shivering and getting goosebumps once you got him dry and he got warmed up again the problem resolved itself hope this helps Hay fever Allergy Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Guinea pig Asthma Domestic rabbit Shampoo Common cold Pig Dandruff Insulin Taboo food and drink Eczema Fancy rat Sauna Cat Hamster Sento Vitamin C Breastfeeding Thermoregulation Dog Shaggy dog story El Ni__o Urticaria Old wives' tale Weather lore Influenza Chocolate First aid Happy Tree Friends Climate of the United Kingdom Dry cleaning Tattoo Carbon dioxide Water (molecule) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Russian joke Antihistamine Multiple chemical sensitivity Nasal congestion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Flood geology Chimera (genetics) Rocko's Modern Life Chinchilla Characters of Naruto 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Blood transfusion Coprophagia Aspergillosis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sea level rise Water Global warming Climate change Tooth enamel Pliocene Autoimmune diseases Sneeze Futurama (TV series - season 5) Oceania ecozone Nuclear weapon design Lisa the Vegetarian Lycanthropy Stuttering Quang Ninh Province Shark Weather front Hypothermia Drowning Dairy Dean Koontz Richard Lindzen Iron Raw food diet Theory of conduct Negima Nine Inch Nails Myxobolus cerebralis Ecology Toilet humour The Ashlee Simpson Show Multiple sclerosis Conjunctivitis AFI 100 Years series Warm-blooded Basic English Toxic mold Rodney McKay Dead Like Me Guns, Germs, and Steel Diabetes mellitus Ceramics Food Coeliac disease
