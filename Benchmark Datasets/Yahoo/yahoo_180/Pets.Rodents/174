deep sleeping hamster my daughter's hamster instead of sleeping lightly during the day but for about the past three months he only goes into deep sleep he will not wake up unless you poke him around times at teh least he doesn't eat or drink much either this has been going on since april we are in colorado so he is not trying to hibernate i agree hamsters are nocturnal creatures by nature it would be comparable to you going into a deep sleep at night sometimes the vacuum can be running right beside you and you won't wake up maybe your daughter's hamster is naturally a sleepy head are you sure that he is not eating or drinking much are you saying this becasue you don't see him do it or becasue there is no food or water missing if you just don't see him eat or drink he may be doing it at night it also may depend on how many treats you give him if i were a hamster i would prefer treats over regular food anyday maybe cut back on treats and see if he starts eating more of his regular food i also might not want to rule out the possibility of him hibernating is he by an air vent if he is the air conditioning may be too cold and he may in fact be hibernating also check to see if there are any drafts where he is if none of this works or none of this is what you were looking for maybe try seeing a vet especially if he isn't eating or drinking hope this helps and good luck with the hammie Hamster Narcolepsy Thermoregulation Hibernation Fecal incontinence Insomnia Sleep The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The X-Files (season 1) Hedgehog The Amazing Race The Shining (film) Urinary incontinence The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Bob and George Theory of conduct Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kosher foods English grammar The Amber Spyglass USS Seadragon (SS-194) Characters in the Smurfs Fasting Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Genetic engineering Poker jargon Cuisine of the Philippines Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breakfast Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Melonpool Tooth Saturday Night Live Asterix and the Laurel Wreath Spirit rover Domesticated turkey New York Giants John the Baptist Social rule The Big Sleep Fancy rat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Upholstery Pok__mon Live!
