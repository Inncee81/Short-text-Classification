buying hamsters is more than a bad idea here's the deal i've wanted a pet for some time and my boyfriend and i just agreed on getting hamsters we've bought a cage sam and might buy another one and connect it with a tube basically i've read all over that it's a bad idea to buy more than one hamster and that if you do you should keep them in separate cages is this true we are planning on buying all of the hamsters in the cage at the pet store for a certain breed bc we don't want them to be separated so that's about or hamsters i think they are called honey bear hamsters or something is this a bad idea you mean teddy bear hamsters aka syrians which are solitary you cannot keep them together once they are adults as they will fight the cage you bought is likely too small for a syrian it may work for one dwarf hamster i wouldn't buy a bunch of hamsters unless you are able to house them separately in case they start to fight and can play with them daily or they will not be tame please do not buy from a pet store or listen to their care info you can adopt hamsters from an animal shelter or rescue www petfinder com pet stores usually don't know what they are talking about and they buy from pet mills you can read about proper hamster care here http www ahc umn edu rar mnaalas hamsters html http www rabbitadoption org hamstercare html http www hamsterhideout com ailments html Hamster Domestic rabbit Golden Hamster Fancy rat HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Pet Commodore International Pet skunk Domain Name System Warner Bros.
