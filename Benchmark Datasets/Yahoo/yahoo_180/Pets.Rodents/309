my hamster is obsessed with her wheel what should i do my syrian hamster runs constantly on her wheel and she never wants to be handled she lets me pet her no problem its just that when i go to pick her up she runs away either that or she just simply won't come off her wheel and if i do ever get her out i have a special 'play cage' which is just a separate level cage made of metal where i have many toys and obstacles for her to play with however she just chews on the cage bars which i know is very unhealthy for her i want her to run around and play with other toys but she doesn't i have tried a few things but i don't know what else to try please help thank you so so so much in advance hello actually its okay for her to chew on the cage it helps to trim her teeth for proper chewing and prevent overgrowing but to help her it is best to put in chew toys as for the wheel you can take it out for awhile and put in toys see what is her reaction or maybe she really needs you to hold her hamster are generally scared of being grabbed it very normal but after you have held her she will calm down or maybe she is trying to catch your attention give her some treats see if it works good luck sabby Hamster Fancy rat Dog training Chinchilla Domestic rabbit The Fairly OddParents Professional wrestling match types John Cage Skateboarding trick The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Salad Fingers Bulk vending Poker jargon Aerial (dance move) Procrastination Textile manufacturing Kim Possible Chewing gum The Apprentice 2 The Joker's Wild Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ferret Pet skunk Equine conformation The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Drill bit Tooth The Price Is Right Wheel of Fortune Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) Slot machine Kasparov versus The World Twisted Metal Garfield Ferengi Autism Leon White Care Bears M-209 The Critic Codename: Kids Next Door 1957 World Series Tobacco Knife Electrophysiology Bart chalkboard gags Toy Drag racing Maison Ikkoku RuneScape Random Events Shaggy dog story Knight Rider Horseshoe Mouse (computing) The Sims Golden Hamster RuneScape economy One Piece minor characters Galaxy Angel FoxTrot Toy Story Rail transport modelling Tag The Pet Sounds Sessions Greyhound racing Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising Pottery Guinea pig Cheating in Counter-Strike The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Theory of conduct Arguments for and against drug prohibition Combine harvester RuneScape skills My Parents are Aliens MapleStory Lawn mower Trapping Tooth enamel Nuclear power Urinary incontinence The Catcher in the Rye Cleveland Browns RuneScape locations Mixed martial arts Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Plastic Sword making American football Floppy disk Babe Ruth RuneScape quests Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) President (game) Grandview, U.S.A.
