favorite rodent and why just wondering by the way everyone i have two favorites guinea pigs and rats i love them both to pieces rats why because they remind me a little of dogs and a little of cats they'll lick you and let you scratch their ears like a dog and will 'purr' and groom themselves like a cat a bit like a bird too i guess 'cause they'll perch on your shoulder and sit there for a while they're also more intelligent than any other rodent and extremely playful and fun to watch they never bite too unless you get a rat that wasn't hand raised a note to people bunnies aren't rodents they're lagomorphs their teeth grow constantly like rodents and they used to be considered rodents but they're different enough to have their own classification along with pikas Hamster Lagomorpha Mammal Rabbit Fancy rat Kim Possible Pig Meat Domestic rabbit Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Dog Mickey Mouse Taboo food and drink The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Ferret Flea Invader Zim Pet Fauna of Australia Felis sapiens Chinchilla Bird European Rabbit Kevin and Kell Tooth enamel Garfield Sinfest Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Rat Pet skunk Gray Wolf Mammal classification Shaggy dog story Onomatopoeia Arthur (TV series) Tooth Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Kakapo Bat Kangaroo Creatures in Bionicle Humphrey Bogart Murinae Vomiting Chicken Minor Discworld characters Ren and Stimpy Chinese astrology New World rats and mice Island restoration Blesmol Snake Theory of conduct Rocko's Modern Life Dean Koontz Harry Nilsson Vole Taikyoku shogi Homer and Ned's Hail Mary Pass Treecat Domestication Porcupine Tiny Toon Adventures Leopard Academy Award for Animated Short Film Porky Pig Care Bears Chuck Jones Eric Cartman Wood carving Looney Tunes: Back In Action Rat (zodiac) Dog training German Shepherd Dog Squirrel Oceania ecozone Samurai Pizza Cats Hunting Pliocene Feral cat Woodworking "Weird Al" Yankovic Oddworld Exotic pet Cajun cuisine Brown Rat The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Pikachu Egyptian Ratscrew Feral Colugo Narnia Late Night with Conan O'Brien Red Fox Aspartame Gaia Online
