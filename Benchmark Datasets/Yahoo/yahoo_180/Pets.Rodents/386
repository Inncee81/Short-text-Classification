experienced guinea pig owners please well i recently got my little pig a new cage the other one was too small for him now he seems really pissed off and depressed he had the other cage for almost years i try to take him out and he runs away from me i feel like he hates me now also he bit my friend and drew blood he doesn't ever ever bite how do i help him adapt to his new home i thought he would like how big it is also totally besides the subject but do they go through puberty so to speak i don't mean to offend anyone but all of a sudden he has these massive balls i feel bad for him it doesnt seem right for his balls to almost be dragging behind him is this normal i have heard that they will grow to the size of their surroudings is that what is happening to him guinea pigs do not grow to the size of their surroundings if so mine would be lbs if you've had the pig in the cage for almost two years then he is waaaay past puberty boars do have large testicles but if they seem abnormally large it could be that he has an infection or abcess there it could also be impaction i don't think the new cage is upsetting him a larger cage always produces a positve reaction the fact that he is suddenly running away from you seems depressed and is biting is more of a concern any drastic change in behavior may be an indication of pain or illness cavies are masters at hiding illness once you determine they are sick they are usually really far gone you have to educate yourself on the signs symptoms so you can catch illness early give your piggie the best chance of recovery this is part of being a responsible pet owner hold your pig under the stomach area and put the other hand under his bum the testicles should feel soft mushy if you feel a hard ball where the testicles are he is impacted it should be removed immediately by a qualified exotics vet if the testicles feel normal he may just have large testicles watch your pig for other signs of illness such as lethargy inadequate water or food intake or decreased pooping if you see any of these please get him to the vet straight away see this site for more information on impaction http www guinealynx info impaction html to find a qualified vet near you http www aracnet com cgi usr seagull vetfinder cgi best of luck Guinea pig Prostate cancer Babe Ruth Ferret Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hamster Anorexia nervosa Chronic fatigue syndrome Shaggy dog story Traumatic brain injury Psychosis Vitamin C Chicken Equine conformation Stroke Stuttering Milton H.
