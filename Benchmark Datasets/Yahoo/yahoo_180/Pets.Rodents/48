i got gerbil hamster food instead of rat food by mistake can i still use it for my rat it's essentially the same sort of food mix but the protein fat levels are slightly different by about i think also i checked in the bag and there are pumpkin seeds and dried bananas those weren't in the rat mix is it still ok to substitute for a little while until i can get the right stuff it is fine for them the banana chips are good for the rats since they have a lot of protein in them and them pumpkin seeds are good as well the main difference is the fat and protein content so they may need to eat a bit more of it than their regular rat food also i would recommend giving them a bit of fresh fruit and veggies everyday as well not too much or it can cause diarreah i work as a vet tech and also own boy rats and they eat a variety of foods just make sure that the majority of wha they eat is a good quality commercial food Hamster Fancy rat Vegetarianism Veganism Tofu Cheese Banana Fruit Milk Ice cream Peanut Nutrition Guinea pig Watermelon Food preservation Yoghurt Pumpkin Genetically modified food Organic food Food Chocolate Date Palm Insulin Domesticated turkey Peruvian cuisine Potato Sugar substitute Dietary fiber Potassium German cuisine Ferret Muesli Dieting Potato chips Jewish cuisine Hemp Ramen Fecal incontinence In-N-Out Burger Bread Vegetarian nutrition Compost Aspartame Soy milk Flour MRE Vitamin C Maize Hypoglycemia Ham Folic acid Fish and chips Bengali cuisine Genetic engineering Plantain Soybean Omega-3 fatty acid Cuisine of the Southern United States Little Britain Barley Soy protein Comanche Low-carbohydrate diet Tocopherol Cake Kosher foods Raw food diet Vegetarian cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of Africa Breastfeeding Warfarin Wheat Tomato Chicken Curry Cuisine of Brazil Apple Fruitarianism Cuisine of Laos Muroidea Hamburger Squash (fruit) Bong Chinese cuisine Cereal Fast food Coffee Cuisine of Malaysia Egg (food) Peanut butter Sewage treatment Japanese cuisine Pet skunk Acorn Blood (computer game) Black pepper
