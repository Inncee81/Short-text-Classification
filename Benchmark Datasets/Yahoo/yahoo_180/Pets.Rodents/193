roborovski dwarf hamsters the pet store i normally shop at is getting young roborovski dwarf hamsters next week they've been quarentining them for a few weeks and they're ready to sell by wednesday in three weeks i'll be going to that pet store to buy one of those hamsters one for me one for my boyfriend for his birthday we both want females and i intend on buying them at the same time and having them live together for a few days before i give it to him we're hoping to have our hamsters be friends even when living at different houses like bring mine over to play with his is this possible or will they just fight even if they've known eachother oh and also is chinchilla dust okay for roborvorski dwarf hamsters i know you need dust for them to bathe in but i'm not sure what kind to buy many normal dwarf hamsters are allergic to it but since they're a different species maybe it will be okay i'm not sure hamsters are extremely territorial so the likelihood of keeping them together whether temporarily or permanent will probably never work sure they are together in the pet store but they are still young and they are siblings but in time the chances of them fighting gets higher and higher they are meant to live alone as they do in the wild if you do choose to let them visit keep an eye on them really this can cause them to become stressed especially if you do it during the day when they are supposed to be sleeping chincilla dust would work fine for a dust bath i've never heard of them being allergic to it but still be careful they really don't need a dust bath since hamsters are naturally always cleaning themselves like a cat good luck Hamster Domestic rabbit Chinchilla Pet The Ashlee Simpson Show The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Pleiades (star cluster) Cat Urinary incontinence Little Britain Pet store Neopets Galaxy Angel Hello Kitty Red Dwarf characters Fancy rat Allergy Menstrual cycle Pet skunk Infantilism The Death Gate Cycle The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Insulin W.I.T.C.H.
