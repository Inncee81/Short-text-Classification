fleece for bedding what are your thoughts on using fleece as bedding for guinea pigs in particular what materials would you recommend to go underneath the fleece to soak up the urine i was thinking either towles or a matress pad any other advice on using fleece would be greatly appreciated as i only started using fleece yesterday newspaper barely absorbs anything fleece is actually very good from what i have heard what it does is wicks the urine to the bottom of the cage which is why you need an underlay towel for eg to soak up the urine it is far better than most beddings available and alot cheaper contrary to what you think fleece does not smell and as for using hay for bedding that is not a recommended bedding due to pieces having the tendency to getting stuck in little eyes fleece is awesome your guinea pigs will love it you can get the rubber mattress protector stuff not sure of the technical name at joann's back in the home decor area you can probably find it at any fabric store this can be used on the very bottom of the cage and then towels between this and the fleece you can also use the super absorbent pads that they use under people in hospitals and nursing homes but they're pretty pricy i have a hand vac that i use to catch up the poos but some people just use a little hand broom and dust pan do you have a c c cage that's what my piggers have and they have an upper x level that is their kitchen their food hay and water are up there along with a litter box but this is where they do most of their potty business therefore this area needs to be switched out every day or two but the bottom floor can go a week between cleanings there's a whole section on fleece in the www guineapigcages com forum http www guineapigcages com forum bedding fleece project study html highlights fleece you might want to check it out o Mattress Hamster Guinea pig Textile manufacturing Domestic rabbit Menstrual cycle Japanese toilet Chinchilla Fancy rat Upholstery Violin Plastic Urinary incontinence SpongeBob SquarePants Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Bong Sanitary towel Medical prescription Dairy Seismic retrofit Undergarment Kitchen The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bacon Ron and Fez Ice core Vermicompost Menstrual cup Cookware and bakeware Prostate cancer Richard Chase Cat Diseases of the honeybee Baseball Wood carving Illegal drug trade About a Boy World Wide Web Mixed martial arts Roswell UFO incident Dance Dance Revolution Passenger car Strap-on dildo Pneumonia Bed (furniture) Chicken Professional wrestling match types The Shining (film) Dialysis Opportunity rover Tattoo Boxing Coconut crab Breastfeeding Pink Floyd Brewery Caving Kurt Cobain Certified Nursing Assistant Belfast blitz Gaia Online Velvet Acid Christ Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Modem Stuttering Customs and etiquette of Japan American lobster Composting toilet Sento Manicure Toilet Floppy disk Drag racing RuneScape economy EastEnders Water Hera Goaltender John Cage Coffee Hazing Glacier Japanese tea ceremony Shaggy dog story Dog Piccolo Junior Saga Sewage treatment Drill bit Trapping Emergency preparedness Magic (illusion) Tofu Coir Urine Wok The Star Wars Holiday Special
