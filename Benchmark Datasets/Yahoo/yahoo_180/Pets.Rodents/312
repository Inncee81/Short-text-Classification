my hamster's bottom seems to stick out is this normal or is something wrong my hamster is about six months old tonight i noticed that his bottom really seems to stick out on both sides under his tail i did some research and found that syrian male hamsters have testicles that are noticeable i'm not sure if this is just normal or something more i don't really want to pay the vet to find out it is normal anatomy does anyone have any experience or advice to offer i have had hamsters before and what you are describing sounds like hamster testicles if he seems otherwise healthy and is eating playing on his wheel climbing around etc you probably don't have anything to worry about you might take him to a pet store that sells hamsters and ask them to tell you if he is a male and if his tail looks normal etc Hamster Golden Hamster Testicle Fancy rat Tooth enamel Prostate cancer Mouse-like hamster House Mouse Guinea pig Chicken Dog Intersexuality Platypus Stuttering Insulin Internet phenomenon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fugu Discus (fish) Pet skunk Androgen insensitivity syndrome Leukemia Sterilization (surgical procedure) Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Skateboarding trick Neopets Radiation therapy The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Domestic rabbit Poker jargon My Parents are Aliens Hazing Boom Town (Doctor Who) Father Ted Timpani Wheel of Fortune Goatse.cx Taboo food and drink Pet The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Docking Animal testing Galaxy Angel Pet store Sex organ IPod Treehouse of Horror V Manual transmission Hoarding Puma Strap-on dildo Infidels Equine conformation Penis Gray Wolf The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius One Piece minor characters American lobster Manx (cat) Relient K Super Size Me Animal communication Shaggy dog story Breastfeeding Floppy disk Bottlenose Dolphin B-47 Stratojet Child sexuality Vitamin C Russian joke Sento The Marshall Mathers LP Gramophone record The Young Ones (TV series) Therion (band) Pet Sounds The Dalek Invasion of Earth Male reproductive system (human) Sesame Street The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Stomach cancer Conker's Bad Fur Day Cryptorchidism History of anatomy in the 17th and 18th centuries Joni Mitchell Erectile dysfunction Inspector Gadget Billiards Bullitt Killian documents Social rule Decibel RuneScape economy Cheetah Bulk vending Pinky and the Brain Viz (comic) Infantilism Coprophagia 613 mitzvot
