how do i help my timid guinea pig to not be so scared we got out piggie about a month ago when we got him he was at least a year old if not older and he stayed in his hut all the time we have been taking him out and he gets about hours of floor time a day sometimes more depending on when we are home during floor time he commonly stays in his hay loft and doesn't run around when i hold him he shivers and he won't come even for his favorite leafy lettuce any ideas if he was that old when you got him i'm thinking he probably came from somewhere other than a petstore or breeder right d if so it's possible that he was abused or not handled by his previous owner it'll take more time than normal to gain his trust unfortunately just be patient and gentle note i'm just guessing here i can't know for sure where he came from Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Social rule EastEnders Milton H.
