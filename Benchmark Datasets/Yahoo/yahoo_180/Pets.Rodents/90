roborovski dwarf or teddy bear hamster for two girls aged and what kind of first time hamster would be better thanks omg i made the same decision months ago for my first hamster between syrian and robo's i choose syrian because their bigger and slower but you can only keep syrians in ones they will fight other animals to the death also mak sure to get a male as they are calmer and better natured on the other hand robo's are smaller cuter and you can keep then in pairs in the end i chose to get a syrian hamster because i didnt want too much responsability i have tried two hamsters in seperate cages but my hamster acted diferently when the other one was in the room my syrian hammy is lovely and although he took months to get tame now he is gorgeous and he is really calm when buying a hamster handle it in the shop get one that is alert but not jumpy check they have no scabs or discharge make sure they walk ok and dont have any broken bones red eyes are perfectly natural and doesnt effect the animal much it just means they are more albino make sure they are between weeks old if they are older they are harder to tame if they havent previously been handled if they are younger then they arent legaly aloud to be sold also long haired hamsters must be brushed every other day and water changed every other day cleaned out twice a week they live years i chose syrian but a roborofski is good for more than one hamster but not with younger children syrians are sweet and fall asleep on you but roborovskis are cute and more lively make sure you get a nice big cage i have a rotastack and i would recomend it remember they are up all night so have some oil ready for when the wheel keeps you up all night and make sure you check it is all locked up and away from any other animals have fun choosing your new pet s i they enjoy all the happy memorries lolol i hope i have covered all areas but if you need any more information on syrian hamsters just email me d and ill try my best anwser them lorna england Hamster Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Poker jargon The Ashlee Simpson Show Kodocha House Mouse Atomic Kitten Pet skunk RuneScape quests Monster Rancher monsters Girls Aloud Dog Eddie Guerrero W.I.T.C.H.
