is my roborovski hamster pregnant and why is she attacking my other female hamster my boyfriend and i bought two robovorski hamsters two days ago one was bigger than the other and had a meaner disposition but they were both sweet overall we were unsure of the sex of the hamsters but we knew they were both either girls or both boys now the bigger one has grown even larger and there are nipples visible on her belly she's torn up the toilet paper i put in the cage and made a bed in the upper compartment and put food underneath it she's also very active and is constantly running in the wheel in the cage from all the websites i've looked at these things seem to indicate a pregnancy but i'm still not sure her bed nest isn't very big and she keeps attacking the other smaller hamster tearing out bits of her fur is it normal for these two to be this territorial in the pet store the bigger one would chase the smaller one around but never actually attack it she sounds pregnant take other hamster out or she will kill it or the babies as they are born she sees the other hamster as a threat to her young Hamster EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Domestic rabbit Golden Hamster Neighbours Fancy rat Elephant Cat Sex and the City Guinea pig Friends Sears Holdings Corporation The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Knots Landing Pregnancy The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Drawn Together Days of our Lives Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Badly Drawn Kitties House Mouse Poker jargon Married... with Children Kodocha Ranma __ characters Vampire Animal communication Dead Like Me The Empty Child Cheetah Rais massacre Nile crocodile One Tree Hill (TV series) Conker's Bad Fur Day The Catcher in the Rye Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Leopard The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Ron and Fez Comanche Jackass: The Movie Aquemini Internet phenomenon Salad Fingers My Parents are Aliens Humphrey Bogart Masturbation Red Squirrel Prenatal diagnosis Breastfeeding Breath of Fire III Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Canary Chinchilla One Piece minor characters Phoebe Buffay's songs George Costanza Shark About a Boy Condom Dog Eddie Guerrero The Legend of Zelda series enemies Characters of Naruto The Young Ones (TV series) Xiaolin Showdown Hall & Oates Into the West (miniseries) Kirby's Dream Land 2 Mario series enemies Capercaillie Koala W.I.T.C.H.
