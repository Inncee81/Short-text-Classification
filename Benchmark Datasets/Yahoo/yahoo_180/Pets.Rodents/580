guinea pig purring noise i adopted a male guinea pig two weeks ago he is months old and adopted it a male friend five days ago who is weeks old when they get together the older guinea makes a purring noise and looks like he is crawling when on the floor he also pee ed on the younger ones face but when i seperate them the older one screams out for him what does this mean will they or wont they get on sounds like typical dominance behavior to me i have four male guinea pigs and i'm always hearing little rumblestruts now and then spraying rumblestrutting teeth chattering chasing and mounting are all normal displays of dominance used by both males and females to assert themselves within their herd my advice would be to read up on how to properly introduce two new guinea pigs to one another you'll want to do it in a neutral area like the floor or the couch it can be hard as the piggy mom to watch the two sort out dominance between them but as long as there aren't any furballs rolling around and bloodshed keep them together Guinea pig Domestic rabbit Cat Dog Pig Sexual differentiation Lisa the Vegetarian Elephant Gender role Peccary Knight Rider Toilet humour Combine (Half-Life 2) Treehouse of Horror V Hearing impairment Stuttering Psychedelic music Nine Inch Nails Tag Meme Ron and Fez The Muppet Show Notable lines in the Star Wars series The Legend of Zelda series enemies Animal Farm RuneScape quests Papua New Guinea Civilization Shifting cultivation Bonus Stage USS Ammen (DD-527) Sperm Whale Poker jargon Money Vitamin C Pink Floyd Kangaroo Little Britain References to Star Trek Salad Fingers Mountain Gorilla Blonde on Blonde Holes (book) Pump It Up The Marshall Mathers LP Kakapo Xiaolin Showdown Indian rebellion of 1857 Hippopotamus Baboon Blood Simple Sleeping Murder Brown Bear Peleliu Ostrich Dinosaur Garfield Giant Panda Animal testing 2004 Republican National Convention Shaggy dog story Eddie Guerrero Charles Darwin's education USS Yorktown (CV-10) Red Squirrel Australasia ecozone Out-of-body experience Coprophagia Eric Cartman Chicken Sin City Gramophone record Scenes from a Memory Manual transmission Friction Spirited Away USS Albacore (SS-218) Late Night with Conan O'Brien The Critic Sound recording Compact audio cassette Pet skunk Bird Sound effect Weighting filter Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Captain Thunderbolt Llama House Mouse Jethro Tull (band) Babe Ruth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prehistoric Britain Miss Piggy Dairy Good Times Laura Schlessinger A Day in the Life Motion picture rating system Cotswold Games
