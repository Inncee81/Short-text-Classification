mouse or rat my cat brought in a live rodent she had bitten off half its tail so i cannot tell by the length of it it is small about inch brown with a white stomach has very small eyes and ears its body shape is round like a ball really i think it is a mouse but i have never seen a mouse with small eyes i am currently looking after it as it has a broken leg and a gash in its side thanks for any answers i live in a very rural area so it is more likely to be a mouse but there are also quite a few rats on the farm but the ones i have seen are very large it has not even tried to bite me or to escape from its current location shoe box and dont worry i have a better place to put it but its under constant supervision and i thought i would let it get settled and eat something before i moved it after further research i think it is a vole it is just like a round blob of fluff with two little black dots for eyes the ears are barely visible anyone know any information about these creatures i have cleaned up the wound and it has stopped bleeding seems pretty content but is there anything i should bear in mind while i am keeping him her no its definately not a mole and i saw the cat bite the tail and it also finishes very abruptly so it is clear it is missing some tail i have nursed animals before he she is eating happily and is hardly even disturbed when i reach into the container he she has made a little nest with some cotton wool i put in there seems to be doing very well and loves eating clovers update doing well this morning eating lots of clovers i have changed the water and bedding etc i can now see that only legs are working properly the other is present but not functioning thanks for all your help it was probably a shrew or a vole it's pretty uncommon to catch a mouse outside as they usually shelter pretty well Hamster Cat Fancy rat Vole House Mouse Textile manufacturing YuYu Hakusho The Secret of NIMH Mattress Stoat Shen Gong Wu Brown Rat Fauna of Australia Guinea pig Snake Mouse (computing) Porcupine Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Spider EastEnders Drill bit Horse Cheetah Gray Wolf Equine conformation American Black Bear Tasmanian Devil Rodent Fast bowling Billiards Spidey Super Stories Ferret Tarantula Mountain Beaver Virginia Opossum Creatures in Bionicle Taboo food and drink Puma Chicken Hay First aid Naruto jutsu Piccolo Junior Saga Narnia Elephant Vomiting Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Eye Bubonic plague Comanche Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Lemming Mammal The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents Murinae Mole (animal) Glossary of nautical terms Water Vole Races of Final Fantasy Visual cortex Red Fox Social rule Mouse RuneScape quests Dobermann Sin City Animal testing Violin The Legend of Zelda series enemies Terminal ballistics Mickey Mouse Stomach cancer Felis sapiens Spot the Dog Tenchi Muyo!
