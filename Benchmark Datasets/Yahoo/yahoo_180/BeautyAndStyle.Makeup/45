i was just wondering can you change the way your eyebrows grow and if so how nope you can't what you can do to change the shape is get them waxed to the shape you want and as new hairs come up just tweeze them and you will have a great eye brow shape or if you have a little amount of eyebrow hair you could get eye brow stencils and get a eye brow shader or filler and shade in the shape hope this helps Head Physical characteristics of the Buddha Waxing Eye Baldness Shader Depilation Hair color Hair Salute Unibrow Kender Cosmetics Social role of hair Puberty Pubic hair Conducting Welding Leather Computer graphics Leaf Vertex and pixel shaders Cigar Chakra Eye color Lunar phase Bonus Stage Cabochon Sesshomaru Drawing NVIDIA Dreadlocks Fetal development Mimeograph machine Griffon Bruxellois Screen-printing Anorexia nervosa Wax Dr__edain Dandruff Meriones unguiculatus Noonan syndrome Carnivorous plant Mystique (comics) Race of Jesus Surrealist techniques Super Saiyan Dog Horse Opera (web browser) Mummy Witchcraft Radiation therapy Kimono Camouflage Physical attractiveness Rose Candle Homestar Runner Kodocha Botulin toxin Buick Skylark Gesture Alopecia areata GeForce Coast Douglas-fir Ren__ Descartes Haircut Floater Bates Method 3D computer graphics The Ashlee Simpson Show OpenGL Dildo Guinea pig American Sign Language Wood carving Hyuga Hinata Repouss__ and chasing Phonograph cylinder GLSL Headgear Sexual attraction Three Stooges Dither The Contender (television series) Internal ballistics Xbox 360 Afrocentrism Wario Cross-country skiing Shade Supply and demand Gas metal arc welding Overclocking Protein Dragon Booster Night elf Deforestation
