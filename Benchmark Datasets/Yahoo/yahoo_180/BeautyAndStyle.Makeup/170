what do you think of this poem the journey of the lioness camouflaged i prowl around i can see the sun yet it s a journey with no doubt my family keep near me my paws keep my cubs close my lion watching beside me i don t let him go the darkness is pain but god shines from above keeping me strong knowing my journey is not up rain shows my tears but belief stays my shelter like leaves and its roots if gods there then he is my helper the sun brings out love to my lion and cubs gods praised me with them and i pray to him with love i learn to hunt watch the cubs grow moving around teaching what ever i know i see the sun get closer i and the lion grow old i can see the sunlight ahead i know its time to let the cubs go we take are final steps our chapters in life we die as the sunset we made it heaven shines so bright wrong section Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Lion King Jon Secada Lion Wolfrider Samson Brother Bear Johnny Appleseed Chicago Cubs Paradise Lost The Amber Spyglass Origin belief Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sabbath The Pilgrim's Progress C.
