why do makeup assistants insist on selling darker foundation i am a biracial with tan skin and blue eyes i have been doing my own makeup for over years and it is very natural looking i like my foundation to match my skin tone exactly no lighter no darker however it seems like every time i go to a makeup counter the m a almost always wants to sell me a shade to times darker my body neck matches my face so i do not understand why as a result instead of purchasing i kindly walk away if you are a makeup assistant will you please tell me the logic behind this isn't makeup suppossed to match your skintone i work for mac and sometimes it all depends on the situation the lighting in one of our stores is really bad so sometime we mix wrong colors also i can say that if you are biracial then your skin tone is probably really hard to match im am a very fair black woman and i constantly have that problem makeup is supose match our skin evenly you are right as well depending on what type of coverage youre going for could effect the foundation that you get too if your skin is primarily yellow then a high coverage makeup will be red based and give you that dirty color to your face so simply i think you should go to a counter or store and watch a makeup artist and see how they do and then walk outside and let the makeup set for at least min before you decide if you like it or not good luck Human skin color Color theory Skin Color Black (people) Dragon Booster Cosmetics Physical attractiveness CPU cache Color blindness Hair color Drawing Expert system Tattoo Cheating in Counter-Strike Sin City Social rule RGB color model Light-emitting diode Camouflage Melanin Weight training Bulk vending Yu-Gi-Oh!
