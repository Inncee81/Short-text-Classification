okay so im ondering about makeup my gf recently had her first runway show and i was kinda surprised at all the makeup she had on and how she had to put on fake eylashes and stuff its totally different from her regular makeup and was all shiny and extreme rather than the usual soft colors and things that i happen to think look better but im wondering if there is a reason for all this and y its so extreme is it more noticable from a distant or what and whats with the eyelashes i just want to understand so next time i wont think its so surprising the main reason why she had to wear all that makeup is that is what the designer asked for if she was showing off his clothes then as part of the whole look her makeup is going to be strong and not something she wears normally also if pictures were taken her face would show up as beautiful as she is without looking all washed out she needed to seen by everyone in the room including those sitting way in the back one of the main reasons why her makeup had to be that bright but it sounds like it was part of her outfit sure it was different but you noticed right that was the main reason why so she would be the one noticed on the runway now if you liked her lashes you need to look into something thats not so wild but just as much fun to have her wear look for magic lash google or yahoo magic lash eyelash enhancer made with natural fibers and super cool to wear Teen Girl Squad Cosmetics Upholstery Japanese tea ceremony Time Out of Mind Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Blood on the Tracks Clothing Great Teacher Onizuka Strap-on dildo Textile manufacturing The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Textile manufacturing terminology Sinfest Jute Sento The Ashlee Simpson Show Lighting Dragon Booster Sauna Bat Lash Characters in the Smurfs K' Leather Volleyball High-heeled shoe Piccolo Junior Saga Vegeta Eye Homestar Runner Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Amber Spyglass The Fairly OddParents Kimono Avenue Q Social rule Shaggy dog story Code: Lyoko Mario Super Nintendo Entertainment System The Legend of Zelda series enemies Mummy The Shining (film) Charles Goodyear Mattress Characters in Bleach series GoldenEye 007 Totally Spies!
