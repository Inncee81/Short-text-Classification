lyrics of the song show me the meaning of being its by backstreet boys right here you go show me the meaning of being lonely so many words for the broken heart it's hard to see in a crimson love so hard to breathe walk with me and maybe nights of light so soon become wild and free i could feel the sun your every wish will be done they tell me refrain show me the meaning of being lonely is this the feeling i need to walk with tell me why i can't be there where you are there's something missing in my heart life goes on as it never ends eyes of stone observe the trends they never say forever ends guilty roads to an endless love there's no control are you with me now your every wish will be done they tell me refrain there's nowhere to run i have no place to go surrender my heart' body and soul how can it be you're asking me to feel the things you never show you are missing in my heart tell me why i can't be there where you are refrain The Beatles discography Jon Secada Rod Stewart Max Martin Sgt.
