i have just moved a few times and my little dog does her poo's outside but short from catching her in the act of doing wee's and racing her outside i don't know how to stop her please help me to train her i live with someone and it is tough on us as it marks the carpet too i used and still use puppy training pads that have a special scent in them that makes them want to go on it i kept my dog in one room until she's shown no problems for a few weeks if she wets on the carpet or sofa or something i'd clean it up well and spray a no go type of spray you get at the petstore i actually ended up removing the area rug from the room she was in so that she'd stop going on it that was before i got the spray my neighbor uses dishsoap and water and claims it works the same as the spray and also says it stops them from chewing things too then i'd let her in to the rest of the house very slowly one room at a time always monitoring her at first until she stops alltogether don't yell rub nose in it etc that just makes them aggressive or learn to hide it better so you don't yell then you have a real problem cause you don't know where she's going once she's perfected the pad move it closer and closer to the door and eventually outside once she's used to going outside to go on the pad start bringing her further out to an area of grass or dirt she likes use the same area all the time at first to avoid confusion i'm keeping my dog both pad and outdoor trained so i don't have to bring her out during extreme temperatures or weather it's working well so far if she has to go she usually waits by the door for a minute and if we don't get her in time she goes on the mat remember to always praise your dog for going on pad or outside i had good luck getting her to poop outside almost on command by rewarding with treats right after she went i also say the same stupid thing over and over when i bring her out to poo quickly do your business do your business quickly and now she starts puckering when i say that also after she goes to the bathroom outside now she immediatley runs up to me looking for her reward which is either good girl and petting her or a piece of a treat most of the time she goes outside because she wants her treat or rewards and on super hot days or raining days i reward her for going on the mat the same way but most of the time i don't see her going on it i just check it a few times a day i'm not sure if it's good to have the dog be both pad and outside trained but it works for me i started putting the pads in areas that i saw her going on at first then slowly moved them into an area that was less visible to company but that she could still easily find one other hint for clean up my mom swears buy vinegar and water to clean up the urine the vinegar counteracts the urine and destroys the scent and while it smells bad also it goes away in a day or so another reason dogs go on the carpet is because they smell their own urine on it and that makes them want to use it more so it's important to clean up the stains really well Dog training Fancy rat Toilet humour Upholstery Cat Hamster Shaggy dog story Japanese toilet Ron and Fez Toilet Piccolo Junior Saga Sin City Social rule Shit Mattress Fire fighting Diseases of the honeybee Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pet skunk Tag The Adventures of Pete & Pete Ron Weasley Japanese tea ceremony Euphemism Animal Crossing Plastic Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sento USS Tunny (SS-282) Chair Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hyperthermia Dog Cosmo Kramer Bart chalkboard gags Animal communication Conker's Bad Fur Day RuneScape quests Ferret Poker jargon Vegeta Thermal power station Pitaten Avalanche Cube (film) Skunk Spidey Super Stories The Inside The Amazing Race Fecal incontinence The Death Gate Cycle Natural Selection (computer game) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Fast bowling Dishwasher Iditarod Labrador Retriever The Price Is Right Ben Johnson (athlete) Menstrual cup Kim Possible StarCraft: Uprising Common cold Cocaine Crate training Halitosis New York Giants Russian joke Jam (TV series) Undergrads Characters of Naruto Fire extinguisher Combine (Half-Life 2) KaBlam!
