my pup just came back from the vet from being neutered and they put an elizabethan collar on him so he won't lick his stiches my question is will he adjust to this thing he bumps into things with it and seems to be having difficulty eating and drinking with it on i feel so sorry for him i find that a better thing to use is a bath towel or a hand towel depending on the size of the dog fold it lengthwise until it's about inches wide then wrap it around the dog's neck and secure it with safety pins or duct tape the dog won't be able to reach back there to lick but he will be able to see eat and drink normally or you could just see how he does without any collar at all Hat Hazing Cat Sento Menstrual cup Gray Wolf Professional wrestling throws Dog collar Dog Dog training Towel Dog agility Collar Textile manufacturing terminology Equine conformation The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Oral sex Upholstery Textile manufacturing Customs and etiquette of Japan Brian Griffin Hyperthermia Professional wrestling holds Richard Chase Garfield Bong Shirt Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sauna Duct tape Mattress Tatting Paper towel Drag racing Hamster Guinea pig Floppy disk Microchip implant (animal) Domestic rabbit Electrical wiring Strap-on dildo Breastfeeding Sanitary towel Greg Valentine Shaggy dog story Stone Cold Steve Austin Order of the British Empire Wire wrap Chair Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Car handling Kurt Angle Blood on the Tracks Caddy Necktie Happy Tree Friends Hot dog Kimono Vampire Mercury 4 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Order of the Bath Tooth enamel Poodle Aztec Penis Violin Pit bull Aerial (dance move) Iditarod Leash Philip J.
