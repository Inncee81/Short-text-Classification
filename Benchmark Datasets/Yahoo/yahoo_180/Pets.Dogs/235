post neutering blood in vomit help i got my one year old male neutered yesterday and he is doing really great he just puked and there was a streak of blood in it i am waiting for a call back from the vet any idea of why this has happened thank you your dog may still be a little nauseous from the anesthetic he may have been doing some empty stomach vomiting since the surgery and has just ruptured a small capillary in his stomach or esophagus the blood may also be from the endotracheal tube your vet used during the surgery he may have also accidentally bit his tongue or cheek while either going under or waking up from the anesthetic if this is just an isolated incidence i wouldn't be too concerned as long as he's doing fine otherwise wait for your vet to return your call which may not be until monday due to the week end if the condition continues gets worse or if you notice any other symptoms have your dog seen by your vet or an emergency vet Stomach cancer Gastroparesis Prostate cancer Vomiting Ferret Aortic dissection Brachial plexus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Stroke Gastroesophageal reflux disease Drowning Pneumonia Myocardial infarction Peptic ulcer Esophagus Hypoglycemia Breastfeeding Childbirth Animal testing Shock Local anesthesia Cat General anaesthesia Asthma Bloat Garfield Paracetamol Bulimia nervosa Cocaine Dehydration Adjustable gastric band Obstetrics Lung cancer Anesthesia First aid Cerebral aneurysm Cancer Medicine Autonomic nervous system Diabetic retinopathy Blood vessel Chemotherapy Earring Digestion Addison's disease Dog Cancer of the larynx May 2005 in Australia and New Zealand Hemorrhagic stroke Androgen insensitivity syndrome James Herriot Atherosclerosis Hernia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Endometriosis Cardiac arrhythmia Pet skunk Domestic rabbit Acupuncture Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Charles Darwin's illness Intubation Guinea pig The Price Is Right Veterinarian Chocolate Concussion of the brain Endotracheal tube Trazodone Insulin Milton H.
