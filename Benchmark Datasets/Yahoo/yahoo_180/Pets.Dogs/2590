please give me tips i was walking my dogs on the leash and a loose dog came running toward us and my dogs started to bark they are super protective of me and i said leave it leave it fortunately the dog ran away and did not come close and my dogs stopped barking i did not see anyone with that dog i think it was just loose but what should i have done if that dog had come to my dogs what do you do if they fight i am happy i was not in that situation but i would like to know just in case it happens one day only serious answers please my dogs are friendly but they act differently when on leash they usually ignore other dogs when i walk them we just walk but i guess they did not like that running dog they also don't like when a dog come sniffing at them only when they are on leash so i tell people i meet that my dogs are not super friendly when on leash and we change sidewalks but in that case i did not have the choice no way i could have grabbed that dog's neck it was a big tall black sheperd huge probably why my dogs barked so much my mom told me to never grab a dog i don't know my dogs are lbs each so people mention pepper spray so is it legal to use it on dogs not harmful i don't think i would take a stun gun i am so clumsy sometimes i would be scared to hit my dogs by accident i'll try the bottle with vinegar it does not happen everyday i wanted to have some tips in case i always have a cell but i was so scared that i just went back home and i forgot to call animal control i carry a spray bottle full of water to spray at stray dogs that come running up to me my two dogs in a threatening manner i have a friend who dilutes her water with a small percentage of vinegar just in case the dog doesn't mind plain water also carry your cell phone with you so that you can always call for help in case of emergencies Dog training Dog Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shaggy dog story Reservoir Dogs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obedience training Fire fighting Professional wrestling match types Futurama (TV series - season 5) Kodocha Smallville (Season 4) The Inside Cat Tenshinhan Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Mario series enemies Vegeta Professional wrestling throws Social rule Humphrey Bogart Spidey Super Stories The X-Files (season 1) Toilet humour Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Lady and the Tramp Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Escape from New York StarCraft: Uprising World War Three (Doctor Who) Dog collar Joke Game show Champagne (beverage) RuneScape quests Pet skunk Pogo Sydney Riot of 1879 Stopping power Pok__mon Live!
