how can i make this easier for my dog my mom and i are going out of the country usually when we go on trips we take the dog with us to not burden anybody else but since we're going out of the country we can't do that i hate to say it but i've spoiled her majorly we've had her since she was a pup and she is years old now and she is very attached to me for example when i leave she usually sits by the door until i get home a year or so ago we tried to leave her with my uncle he also has dogs and i figured they could play while we were away it didn't work out apparently she pouted the entire time and would search the house looking for us she would scratch or howl at doors that were closed and wouldn't stop until somebody opened them and then she would proceed to look around the room searching i had done everything i could to make her feel more comfortable brought her bowls bed and toys from home gave her lots of bones she loves to chew on them and brought her regular food and snacks from home none of it seemed to work any more ideas i'm thinking that this time we can make a few trips before hand to my uncles house and leave her there for a few hours and then come back to get her maybe that will let her know that i'll always come back for her i'm lost as to what else to do lol this question sounds sort of pathetic but i got my dog after my dad died and she helped me through it giving all my attention to her helped me not to dwell so much on what had happened so thanks for the help i appreciate it oh and if it helps to know her breed she is a beagle basset hound thanks again i think your concern for your dog is so sweet you're a good doggy mommy i learned that dogs don't like change too much especially if they don't have another dog as a companion and if they're moved to a different place when they are so used to being in their own home they seem to get depressed and nervous too there are new sounds and smells they are not used to and i think they can really miss their owner trust me she won't starve she might not eat for the first few days you are gone but she won't starve herself and get sick if you have an old sweatshirt or article of clothing that you don't care about in case it got chewed up or ruined wear it for a while so your scent gets into it then leave this article of clothing at your uncle's house so she will have a reminder of you your idea of taking her to your uncle's house before you leave is a good idea if you stay there with her on these visits instead of leaving her there alone it might be better she'll get to see that it's okay to stay there because you stay there too you can show her around take her into each room she will be allowed to go in and she might be more comfortable Dog Dog training Basset Hound Japanese tea ceremony Shaggy dog story The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Obedience training Kodocha The Shining (film) Fancy rat Housebreaking The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Doug About a Boy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cat Time Out of Mind Customs and etiquette of Japan The Apprentice 2 Garfield Sonic the Hedgehog RuneScape quests One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Grandview, U.S.A.
