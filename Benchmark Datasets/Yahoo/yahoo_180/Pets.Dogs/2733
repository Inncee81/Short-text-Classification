flat coated retriever too extreme my family and i are going to get a new dog and flat coated retrievers seem to be one of the best if not the best dogs to get the reason i am concerned is because i have read that flat coated retrievers get separation anxiety and destroy things when people leave my siblings and i go to school regularly and my parents are gone during the day and i was wondering if the dog would do as i described earlier i also heard they may be aggressive sometimes and attack people is that true thank you for your time like any retreiver or lab they are very smart and have a great store of energy and good bit of endurance it's what makes them such good hunting and agility dogs and any dog with that many smarts and that much energy will become destructive if not kept busy training and socialization also helps but unless you can give that dog the outlets it needs for it's energy i'd suggest researching other breeds but also like the first poster i'd like to give you a high five for researching the breed first rather awesome of you i'd have to say Labrador Retriever Working dog Jack Russell Terrier German Shepherd Dog Golden Retriever Mixed-breed dog Gray Wolf Schutzhund Chesapeake Bay Retriever American Pit Bull Terrier Ferret Havanese Animal Liberation Front Alaskan husky Obedience training Airedale Terrier Belgian Shepherd Dog Social rule English Springer Spaniel Australian Cattle Dog Fancy rat Dalmatian Poodle Dog training Domestic rabbit Border Collie Sesshomaru Horse Skye Terrier American Eskimo Dog Komondor Keeshond Surveillance Dog agility German Shorthaired Pointer Electronic commerce Tasmanian Devil Wal-Mart Great Dane Medieval hunting RX-78 mobile suit series Australian Shepherd Dog breed Octopus card USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Kerry Blue Terrier Spitz Italian Greyhound Equine conformation Weimaraner Force (Star Wars) Arabian horse Miniature Pinscher Spaniel Solar cell Aphasia Case-based reasoning Griffon Bruxellois Phobia Hamster Strategic management Border Terrier Prostate cancer Azumanga Daioh Animal testing Cat Perfect Dark Sonic the Hedgehog Aliens versus Predator (computer game) Our Gang Korea Jindo Dog Bernese Mountain Dog Nintendogs Livestock Kim Possible Basset Hound Docking Manx (cat) Samus Aran StarCraft: Uprising Companion dog L.
