speaking of stupid dogs i had dogs siblings both became champions both made an impact of some sort nationally for their breed we called the boy meathead no that wasn't his name it was more of an affectionate half joking thing like calling a bald guy curly he was called that because of his tendency to look at you like he hadn't a clue what you were talking about the girl was the brat and yes that did become part of her name she was a pita sort who was always into everything incredible food drive and very very trainable we showed them both when meathead was shown you better have hotdogs cheddarwurst steak liver a piece of pig's ear and as a last resort a stale hotdog bun after he'd been standing pretty and smiling for one type of cookie for a few minutes he'd look at you stop smiling drop his tail and wait til you offered something better meanwhile the brat would work for kibble or really anything so who do you think was smarter personally i think it was the dog that learned to manipulate the system meathead was smarter he figured out how to get the better treats we used to have a pair brother and sister that we dubbed p ss and her brother vinegar trouble when they were together teamwork Hot dog Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Dog Trailer Park Boys Pitaten Cuisine of Denmark FoxTrot Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Fancy rat Social rule Ren and Stimpy Maison Ikkoku Care Bears YuYu Hakusho German Shepherd Dog Totally Spies!
