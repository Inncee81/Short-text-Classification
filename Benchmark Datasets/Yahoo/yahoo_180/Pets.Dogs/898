behaviour between dogs puppies i've just adopted a new puppy very suddenly my husband rescued her from being euthanised as were the rest of her litter mates i have an month old beagle mix who is extremely active she's a very hyper dog needs lots of exercise and attention the puppy is a bassett hound and she's about weeks old i've never really had more than one dog at a time except for brief periods like fostering but nothing that required intensive training my beagle wants to put her paw on the puppy's head she likes to knock her over if the puppy is sleeping or sitting still she's reaaaaaaallly lazy it seems to drive the beagle nuts she will start biting at her muzzle and putting her paw on her head is this behaviour unacceptable is this a dominance issue i'm really not sure how to let them behave together i don't want them to form bad habits but obviously i want them to play i don't want her to dominate the puppy so i have been correcting it i was definitely under the impression that i should be the only dominant dog and the beagle already has dominance issues she often tries to hump my cats so i guess the real question should have been is this playing or a dominance thing what their doing is fine however if it worries you you should correct the dog Dog Housebreaking Dog training Sick Puppy Guinea pig Nintendogs Socialization Shaggy dog story Shetland Sheepdog Beagle Golden Retriever Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Snoopy Belgian Shepherd Dog Ron and Fez Publication of Darwin's theory Theory of conduct Greyhound Fancy rat Border Collie Skinny Puppy Milton H.
