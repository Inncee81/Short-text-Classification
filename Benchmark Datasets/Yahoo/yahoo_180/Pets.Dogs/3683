any idea which complete dog food will not give my dogs such bad wind i have adults and puppy puppy has a sensitive tummy so also have to be careful what he has pups needs to be for large breed firstly there is no such thing as a 'complete and scientifically balanced' commercial dog food the wind is probably caused by the dog's inability to digest grains properly conditions like sensitive skin and delicate stomachs are often alleviated or totally banished by feeding a more natural diet of raw meaty bones and offal most raw feeders comment on how their dogs no longer smell 'doggy' and no more room clearing farts there is no need to feed different foods to pups and adult dogs the only difference is the amount and the frequency large breed pups benefit from this type of diet as their growth is from high quality meat proteins and natural calcium pups feed a prey based diet will not carry the excess 'puppy fat' that commercial fed dogs often have i hope the links help Dog Guinea pig Livestock Nutrition Protein Breastfeeding Hamster Domestic rabbit Veganism Atkins Nutritional Approach Insulin Cancer Cat Fancy rat Vegetarianism Seabird Vitamin C Chicken Flatulence Albatross Food Raw food diet Soybean Hypoglycemia Mosquito Gray Wolf Agriculture Organic farming Chocolate Animal testing Organic food Domestication Honey Stomach cancer Egg (food) Omega-3 fatty acid Tocopherol Coeliac disease Tofu Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Sewage treatment Orca Foie gras Tooth Growth hormone treatment Krill Harp Seal Obesity Androgen insensitivity syndrome Factory farming Shrimp farm Dieting Offal Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Vegetarian nutrition Capercaillie Bird migration Carnivorous plant Hip dysplasia Shar Pei Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Low-carbohydrate diet Shark Kakapo Golden Retriever South Beach diet Domestic goat Hunting Anemia Fish farming Growth hormone Whaling Puberty Ozone depletion Puppy mill Labrador Retriever Eye Spider Docking Cholesterol Prostate cancer Protein-energy malnutrition Growth hormone deficiency Dairy Famine Transformer Domesticated turkey Cochineal Healthy eating Earless seal
