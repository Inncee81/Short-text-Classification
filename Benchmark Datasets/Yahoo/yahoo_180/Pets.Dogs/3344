my dog is sick now because she ate a bone my dad brought home a big knuckle off a cow or something for my other dog doberman pup and my terrier cross got hold of it every time she eats a bone she gets sick i dont think theres a piece lodged in her because it was a safe bone from a petshop the kind for dogs it was more like they were wearing it down rather that breaking bits off it we never give her bones because she gets very protective of them and since we noticed they made her sick and if we did give her one its a big safe one my dad didn't know bones made her sick i don't like to give them bones anyway because they are horrible she is lying under a chair now and she looks like she's shaking ever so slightly when you look at her there is a bit of discharge in her eyes and every time she eats she gets sick she has been like this since yesterday we gave her some neurofen last night because it made her better the last time don't tell me to bring her to the vet because he never does anything for her no matter what the problem is just gives her injections tells us to come back and charges us heaps every time we go there i don't want all that crap in my dog she dosn't need it is there anything we can give her ourselves to make her better i'm going to ask people if they know any healers around and if i can find one bring her to them i've been trying to put good energy in her and push the bad energy out but i'm no healer or psychic or anything so does anyone know what could be in the bones to make her sick bacteria is she allergic how can we help her we probably will call the vet but eh sorry to say it most of the ones i've met dont know sh t the vets around here are for farm animals cows sheep pigs etc theres no vet specificly for pets to michael a thats the weirdest answer i've ever heard have you permanently deformed the dog in anyway by either cutting the tail opening the testicles etc full tail she is neutered is the dog locked inside always and denied exercise no have you ever allowed the dog to compete with other dogs if this means have i made her fight no if it is a female are you denying it a male she is neutered and it would be completly irresponsible to not have her so its proven that denying a dog a mate causes no health problems there are too many unwanted pups being put down each year without me breeding a dog just for the sake of it ok she has gotten sick a huge puddle of disgusting putrid smelling liquid we rang the vet and he said give her flat up and bring her to him in the morning i know she wont be able to keep that down there are no other vets here but i'm going to try to find one in another town or something because this is ridiculous thanks for all the answers so far if you won't go to the vet try and starve your dog for hours and let the gut rest make sure she drinks plenty of water you must not let her get dehydrated use a syringe to get the water down her mouth if neccessary after hours just give her a small meal of boiled fish or chicken with rice the first day give her three small meals of this and the day after do the same thing then gradually re introduce her normal food check the inside of her mouth to make sure there isn't a piece of bone lodged in her back teeth or on the roof of her mouth please don't give your dog any kind of human tablets this could prove fatal in some cases i hope she recovers soon Cat Guinea pig Dog Hamster Gray Wolf Fancy rat RuneScape quests Poker jargon Shark Tooth enamel Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Domestic rabbit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Equine conformation Sin City Shaggy dog story Fugu Livestock Chicken Pet skunk Social rule Taboo food and drink Ferret Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Characters of Naruto Dobermann Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Piccolo Junior Saga Chopsticks Ron and Fez Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Tooth Foodborne illness Joke Vegeta One Piece minor characters Insulin Fecal incontinence Dairy The Shining (film) Stomach cancer Vampire Roman eating and drinking Boom Town (Doctor Who) Theory of conduct Kosher foods Rodney McKay Kodocha YuYu Hakusho Phoebe Buffay's songs Vitamin C Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cuisine of Denmark Egg (food) Elephant Lisa the Vegetarian The Amber Spyglass The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Ocean's Twelve Factory farming Mixed-breed dog Dog training Baldrick Housebreaking Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Decompression sickness Water Unclean animals First aid Veganism Chaos Emerald Korean cuisine House Mouse Ron Weasley Docking Paget's disease of bone Vegetarianism Milk Obedience training Characters in the Smurfs The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Iditarod Cocaine Traumatic incident reduction The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist American lobster Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Legend of Zelda series enemies Spider Mosquito Urinary incontinence Cantonese cuisine
