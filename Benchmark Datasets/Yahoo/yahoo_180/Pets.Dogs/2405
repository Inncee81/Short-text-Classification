are obedience classes worth it a trainer in my area offers training courses where i am with my dog in a class once a week is where i leave my dog to spend days a week in his training center and another is where i leave my dog with him for a month and he teaches him everything i love my dogs so much but i'm having problems between dogs with aggression housebreaking and sometimes leash walking i know for sure that my mini dachshund will be a full month of work his attention span is shorter than a goldfish his anger towards strangers is also miserable my basset beagle is a perfect dog it all equals out in the end i guess how severe are the problems i think in most cases it's better for you to do the training just under the instruction of a trainer that way you learn along with the dog how to teach how to correct etc which will help if there are any future problems however if the problems are bad enough you'll need the extra step Dog training Housebreaking Obedience training Dog Nintendogs Dog agility Basset Hound Musical Canine Freestyle Dachshund Leash Clicker training Keeshond Education in Australia Air Education and Training Command Whippet Shetland Sheepdog Schutzhund The Perishers Invader Zim Education in Germany Skye Terrier Scientology beliefs and practices Beagle Education in the People's Republic of China Dog collar Garfield Drill instructor Dog intelligence Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints German Shepherd Dog Havanese Quill (film) Reservoir Dogs Crate training Tiny Toon Adventures Mixed-breed dog Social rule Gun dog Scent hound Teacher USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Education in Portugal DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Grade (education) Education in Romania Dobermann Hebrew calendar The Family from One End Street Clinical depression Aphasia The Voyage of the Beagle Sola fide Kodocha Hikikomori Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Charles Darwin's illness Robert Hutchins Working dog The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Goldfish Graduate school Community college Tibetan Mastiff Reiki Jack Russell Terrier Computus CPU cache Simone Weil Chevy Chase Snoopy Neil Gaiman Charles Darwin's education Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Recruit training Boy Scouts of America Billboard Hot 100 1957 World Series Italian Greyhound The Princeton Review Master's degree Publication of Darwin's theory Socialization Jennifer Lopez Evan Mecham Border Collie Speed reading Ranma __ characters Education in Taiwan __cole Polytechnique A Course In Miracles $ale of the Century Pit bull Pai Mei Education in the United States Columbia University GED Guide dog CatDog
