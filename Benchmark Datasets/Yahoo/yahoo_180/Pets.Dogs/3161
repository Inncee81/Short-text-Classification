dog breed suggestions okay soooo about three years ago i had a dog and i had to give it away because my sister didn't know how to treat a puppy well i want to get a new dog really bad and i need a breed suggestion i prefer a small dog that can be carried in one hand doesn't shed too much rarely barks and doesn't mind being home alone hours a day but will get a lot of attention when we're home thanks you aren't going to find a puppy that can be home alone for hours a day or one that you can hold in one hand and that doesn't bark a puppy needs to go out to potty every couple hours if you can't do that at this time i'm sorry but don't get a puppy you should adopt an adult dog from a shelter or rescue organization that way you can leave it for hours and it will be fine any poodle mix doesn't shed very much but most small dogs are barky i think that you should check out petfinder com they advertise dogs from many organizations and you can read about them there are adoption fees but they go right back to the care of more animals you can also check craigslist but people on there can be liars and some even sell their animals and you have to be weary about those people because many of them got the pet for free from someone else and are now selling them for profit good luck to you Dog Housebreaking Dog training Puppy mill Mixed-breed dog Golden Retriever Labrador Retriever Havanese Rescue group Domestic rabbit Keeshond Pet skunk Nintendogs Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Skinny Puppy American Eskimo Dog Hamster Theory of conduct Docking Fancy rat Dog breeding Korea Jindo Dog German Shepherd Dog Rottweiler Poodle Livestock RuneScape quests The Apprentice 2 Border Terrier 101 Dalmatians: The Series Ranma __ characters Kerry Blue Terrier Blonde on Blonde Maltese (dog) Animal shelter Crate training Alaskan husky Working dog American Pit Bull Terrier Pitaten Time Out of Mind Ferret Dog breed Whippet The Fairly OddParents The Death Gate Cycle The Critic Rabies Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Santa's Little Helper Community emergency response team Police dog Dairy Greyhound racing Border Collie EastEnders Microchip implant (animal) Steven Wright Brian Griffin Social rule One Hundred and One Dalmatians Coat (dog) Kodocha Guinea pig Poker jargon Basset Hound Obedience training Lady and the Tramp Equine conformation Finnish Spitz Dog show Shaggy dog story Chicken Rugrats Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Kid Buu Saga Neopets The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Philip J.
