dog harness my little guy is a bit of an escape artist and is too strong for the collars i have bought him in the past when he gets chasing he just snaps it off and runs so i bought a harness i am noticing now that it is wearing the fur off a little on his chest and the side of his legs the skin doesn't look pink or sore and he doesn't respond when i touch it is this okay is it hurting him he is built kinda funny so it is hard to find a harness that fits any better especially since we have no big petstore in town his neck is tiny and his chest is huge and the length between them doesn't fit harnesses well either right now the harness is almost on the smallest it'll go on his neck and almost the biggest around his chest thanks meg i think i need to get to a big petstore sometime moving closer to a city in the near future he needs something with adjustable length between neck and body because his neck is so small about inches the harness are made for dog with smaller bodies and less room between neck and chest i don't want to waste money buying online returning etc i want to take him to a big petstore and try them on to be sure it fits well even looking at the puppia he's inches around the neck and around his actual chest this one hits too close to his legs he just barely fits the medium min neck max chest i made him one once with an old leash but my hand stitching isn't strong enough i need to use my sewing machine on it when i get it back in a month or so personally i'd recommend a soft slip limited slip collar http www whitepineoutfitters com catalog category cfm queries index index title bar soft web collars productcode i've been using these for probably years still have the st one i ever bought they're tough they don't chew up coat and you can cinch them down to the size you need no snap i've trained some big tough pulling dogs including lbs rescues i'm working with a lb tough necked saint right now but would not say he is trained with these collars and have never had one break they're worth what you pay for them and then some you can buy a matching leash the leashes are so kind to your hands i've never tried the soft snap collar i might consider it for a puppy but would not use it on a dog who pulls good luck Dog training Horse tack Dog collar Strap-on dildo Professional wrestling match types Fast bowling Violin Sin City Piccolo Junior Saga Aerial (dance move) Dog Drill bit Professional wrestling throws Domestic rabbit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Dog agility Laws of cricket Textile manufacturing Suplex Mattress Archery Tenshinhan Diving RuneScape quests Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Bondage (BDSM) Professional wrestling attacks Horse Nine Inch Nails Textile manufacturing terminology Late Night with Conan O'Brien Swingout Conspiracy (TNG episode) Humphrey Bogart Doom enemies Fencing Trapping Drag racing Glossary of climbing terms The Inside Conker's Bad Fur Day Knife Single bullet theory Vegeta Shaggy dog story Babe Ruth Characters in the Smurfs Professional wrestling slang Bass guitar Comanche Professional wrestling aerial techniques Hamster Internal ballistics Combine (Half-Life 2) Snowboard Fancy rat Kimono Volleyball Great Teacher Onizuka Autopsy Firefighter Shirt First aid Gray Wolf Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Blood on the Tracks Unreal Spark plug Sewing Diving suit NASCAR Urinary incontinence Naruto jutsu Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Characters of Naruto Cat Fielding (cricket) Kurt Angle Climbing equipment Ben Johnson (athlete) Softball Stunt Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Craps YuYu Hakusho Undergarment View camera
