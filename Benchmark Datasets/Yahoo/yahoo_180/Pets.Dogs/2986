my month old dog refuses to get in the van with me i had to force her just for the vet visits help holiday is part black lab golden retriever she is just so heavy to pick up and then i feel guilty forcing her in she pees half way in which is no picnic and when she is inside she sits on the floor between the two front seats scared to death any other time she is happy to be with me including sleeping at night in my bed we are very close and i want to be able to take her places with me i would appreciate any advice here thanks holiday what an awesome name do you only put her in the car when she's going to the vet if so she's already made the connection between the car and being poked prodded injected etc what you need to do is teach her that go for a ride in the car usually means something great as some of the others said it's a good idea to load her into the car and give her treats while she's in there even if you don't go anywhere try that for a few days then put her in give her a treat and drive somewhere even just a short distance give her lots of praise good girl holiday such a good girl yes you are a few days of that then same routine but end up somewhere fun the pet store the park treats and praise if anything negative happens she pees or cries or shakes in terror don't acknowledge it keep your tone of voice happy pretty soon she'll be looking forward to the car rides most important thing is to make getting in the car an everyday thing for her and once she understands it's not going to be a painful experience she'll accept it and here's a tip for making those dreaded vet trips less scary for her explain the situation to the vet or the front desk staff at the vet and ask if you could bring holiday in a few times just to say hello and have her ears scratched and have a big happy fuss made over her maybe she could sniff around the waiting room step up on the scale and check her pee mail on the shrubs outside the vet clinic trust me they will say it's fine to do this she'll soon learn that the vet clinic is an okay place to be and afterwards it's off to mcdonald's for a double cheeseburger or whatever really junky horrible treat that she loves best hey she earned it and lots of praise because she was sooooo brave good luck if the advice you find here doesn't help please ask your vet for suggestions i think this is a pretty common problem and should be resolved fairly easily Shaggy dog story EastEnders Milton H.
