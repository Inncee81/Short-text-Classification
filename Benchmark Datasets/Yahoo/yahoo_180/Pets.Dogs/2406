is it ok if the groomer left ear cleaning powder in my dogs ear i always check my bichon's ears after he gets groomed and when i got home i noticed all the clumpy white ear powder in the little crevice of his ear it's in the external part of his ear so is it fine if i try and clean it out or should i take him back to the groomers you can wipe ot brush it out but it won't do any damage the powder is usually used to help the groomer to get a grip on the hair inside the ear that needs to be plucked out usually the ear cleaning follows the plucking you might ask the groomer to re clean the ears in case that step was accidently missed she might have been distracted by another dog or a customer and thought she had completed the cleaning human error once in a while doesn't mean the groomer's not good now if it happens every time Havanese Violin Bichon Fris__ Brush Shetland Sheepdog Ear Airedale Terrier Diagon Alley Dog Hearing aid Pekingese Domestic rabbit Portuguese Water Dog American Eskimo Dog Keeshond Gun safety Poodle Labrador Retriever Niddah Maltese (dog) Wudu Reservoir Dogs Spatial disorientation Diseases of the honeybee Dog training The Five Doctors Skin Cat Debugging RuneScape quests Code: Lyoko Siberian Husky Fecal incontinence Internal ballistics Diving Autopsy Etiquette Dry cleaning German Shorthaired Pointer Hamster Pitaten It's All Gone Pete Tong Hearing impairment Computer virus Handloading Elephant Hand grenade Brazing Certified Nursing Assistant Decibel Knife Cochlear implant Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Good Times Phineas Gage Son Gohan Earring The Apprentice 2 Futurama (TV series - season 5) Crate training Beard Los Angeles Dodgers Magical objects in Harry Potter Brewery Earwax Body piercing Papillon (dog) The Star Wars Holiday Special Aerial (dance move) Dog agility Futurama (TV series - season 3) The Death Gate Cycle The Inside Cheetah German Shepherd Dog Comanche 2001 anthrax attacks Clothing L__wchen InuYasha (character) Depilation Red Dwarf characters The Legend of Zelda series races StarCraft: Uprising Cello Salah Reading spark plugs for racing Skye Terrier Manicure The Human Stain Dither Social rule Upholstery Felis sapiens Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Guqin Roots: The Saga of an American Family Combine (Half-Life 2) Glossary of climbing terms
