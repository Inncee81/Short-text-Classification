good dogs for kids we have a year old lab and are looking to adopt a second dog any good breeds must be good with babies smart we are looking for a dog that has a good sense meaning a good guard dog but is good with babies kids a medium sized dog would be better than a small dog thanks i agree you should first check at the pound they usually have older dogs who are calmer i think golden retrievers are a good breed i have one and he is very relaxed he's been relaxed since he was a puppy golden retrievers are very social and friendly so he would be good with your other dog they can be medium large they usually wouldn't hurt a fly so they may not be very good guard dogs but they can bark loudly so this would always alert you of course this may hurt the baby's ears but i'm not sure a collie might also be good i'm not positive but i here that they're gentle and friendly then again if you like your lab why not get another lab of course the breed doesn't matter as much as how it's been handled if it's been handled to be mellow and calm it will be mellow and calm but if you get it wound up all of the time that's what it will be like so make sure you get a dog with a good personality look at pet stores and in the newspaper for dogs like that or you can ask your vet good luck Labrador Retriever Dog Golden Retriever Mixed-breed dog Rottweiler German Shepherd Dog Shetland Sheepdog Dog training Irish Wolfhound Smooth Collie Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obedience training Whippet Guinea pig Working dog Pet skunk Nintendogs Hamster Great Dane Socialization Dobermann Housebreaking Fancy rat West Highland White Terrier The Fairly OddParents Dog breed English Springer Spaniel Humphrey Bogart Care Bears Reservoir Dogs Kim Possible Border Collie Characters of Naruto Domestic rabbit Siberian Husky German Shorthaired Pointer Border Terrier Poodle Companion dog Pomeranian (dog) Lady and the Tramp Keeshond Docking American Eskimo Dog Alaskan husky Basset Hound Boston Terrier Pug Road Rovers Chihuahua (dog) Greyhound Iditarod Puppy mill Parachuting English Cocker Spaniel Havanese Xiaolin Showdown Animal testing Nova Scotia Duck-Tolling Retriever Dog breeding Beagle Pet store American Pit Bull Terrier Theory of conduct Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Griffon Bruxellois Maltese (dog) Pekingese Cat Guide dog Chinook (dog) Korea Jindo Dog Toy dog Gray Wolf Futurama (TV series - season 5) Weimaraner Spaniel Ferret Tai shogi Chesapeake Bay Retriever Social rule The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius Yorkshire Terrier Garfield Skye Terrier Rat Terrier Taikyoku shogi Miniature Pinscher Characters in the Smurfs KaBlam!
