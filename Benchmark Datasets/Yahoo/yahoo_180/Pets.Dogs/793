any training tips for my year old dog see details my dog has some annoying habits but since she is our family s first dog we are unsure if these problems are helpable or if she just acting like a dog can any of you dog experts out there help w o sending us to a professional trainer here are the problems ok she loves walks we taught her that walks were meant to relieve yourself and she goes but even after one even long ones she might go sometimes too on the rug sometimes even if she just had a walk minutes ago this isn t everyday but it is a problem but she isn t sick we also tried to put her on a daily bathroom schedule but it turned out impossible because of our family's routine is different everyday our dog automatically shreds chews on anything and will destroy it luckily she never got hurt from doing this but we are tired of worrying that she swallowed something and sick of our stuff getting ruined she chews on those chewable rawhides thingys but likes shredding things she shouldnt too oh by the way she is a schnauzer poodle mix small medium sized and we got her as a puppy with no training i'd also like to mention that the distance of her walk is once around the average sized neighborhood block a quarter of a mile long probably that's long enough right feed your dog her meals at the same time every day which will help regulate her schedule she may be trying to tell you that she is not getting enough exercise so try walking her a little longer or take her to a dog park where she can get some good fun play time and good exercise also monitor the amount of water she drinks and take her out when you seen she's had some water if you're walking her only long enough for her to do her business and then bringing her right back home she is telling you that she needs more time outside and more exercise because your schedule is different every day doesn't mean that her schedule has to be different every day try taking her out at the same times every day and if all else fails crate train her if she is shredding things she shouldn't she is telling you that she is bored so get her some good interactive toys to play with like the buster cube a kong toy which has been stuffed and frozen or a large marrow bone or a treat kibble dispensing toy those toys will entertain and amuse her and keep her occupied with good things rather than ruining things she shouldn't be some consistency with her meal times and good long walks good exercise and play times and interactive toys should all greatly help good luck Dog training Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog The Inside Garfield The Star Wars Holiday Special The Shining (film) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Hamster God Emperor of Dune Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Kim Possible Fancy rat Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Weight training Piccolo Junior Saga Urinary incontinence EastEnders Futurama (TV series - season 4) USS Yorktown (CV-10) Dog agility Tenshinhan Futurama (TV series - season 2) Sinfest Time Out of Mind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Critic Water Characters of Naruto The Lovely Bones Comanche Obedience training Customs and etiquette of Japan Fecal incontinence Poodle Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Amber Spyglass Johnny 5 Philosophy of language Milton H.
