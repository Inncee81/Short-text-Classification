dominance question i am bringing home a retired racing greyhound next week and i was wondering how do you confirm your self as pack leader with out traumatising the dog good on you for adopting one of these wonderful dogs i also have a retired greyhound they are the best when you get them assimilated into 'civilian' life i suggest getting cesars way book and retired racing greyhounds for dummies there is also a website called greytalk com but beware of them they tend to say that a grey is a grey and you cant change their behavior those on that site usually allow their dogs to continue to growl and be aggressive or destructive saying thats just what they do well its not they are a dog like any other dont feel sorry for the dog being a racing dog first thing you need to know is that a greyhound has never been inside a home before they dont know what widows or glass sliding doors are they dont know what stairs are theire paws are not calloused and you need to slowly introduce them to rough terrain when you walk them get your dog a crate the most important thing you can have they are used to being in one its not cruel its their safe havens their dens get them a martigale collar special for greyhounds they are not house broken so to speak make sure you have time at first to devote to your dog like being able to let him outside times during the day they will go in the house your dog may even chew on stuff they do suffer from separation anxiety badly they will have a lot of issues and you probably will think of giving up and giving back but dont it just takes time took us a year to get dash where we wanted the first thing you should do is claim your house before bringing home baby for the first time take the dog for a nice long walk to get ride of energy let him in the house you walking first do not take leash off walk him around the house you in lead show him around keep him by your side all day long never leave the dog alone set up the rules from the very beginning oh and never ever let him off leash unless in a fenced area they have a high prey drive and will chase and run away send me a message if want more info Dog training Greyhound Dog Gray Wolf Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog agility Housebreaking Fox hunting Babe Ruth Horse Equine conformation Ferret Italian Greyhound The Shining (film) The Brady Bunch The Death Gate Cycle EastEnders Shaggy dog story RuneScape quests The Star Wars Holiday Special Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jennifer Lopez Obedience training Trapping Alaskan husky Seabiscuit Care Bears Aerial (dance move) Cat Characters in the Smurfs Neighbours Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Social rule Iditarod Hamster Atomic Kitten Laci Peterson Conspiracy (TNG episode) Reservoir Dogs Sesshomaru Medieval hunting Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Poker jargon The Unquiet Dead Sonic the Hedgehog Richard Chase Manual transmission Ocean's Twelve 1957 World Series Pet skunk Humphrey Bogart Baseball Milton H.
