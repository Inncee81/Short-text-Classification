if you feed your dog raw meat and raw food in general do you also eat it yourself i know that some people rave about raw chicken backs and wings and such for their dogs but do they also eat these things themselves or feed it to their children if not why not one theory is that dogs and humans became 'domesticated' together so that dogs are as close to 'wild' as humans are in that case perhaps humans should be on a raw chicken back and chicken wing diet if the question is boring please don't bother to answer it dogs are also susceptible to food borne illness so that is a nonstarter what i am trying to understand is why if people have such good results with dogs they themselves do not engage in raw eating if it works with dogs then some version should work with human beings perhaps not raw chicken backs but beef tartar sushi oysters caesar salad with real eggs carpaccio are these on the menus of most people if not why not frankly i think these are all delicious but i do not trust the local grocery store or family restaurant for these delicacies i also cook my chicken and hamburger thoroughly joh i am offended by your being offended calm down i am asking a legitimate question of people who swear by raw foods for their dogs i feed my dogs cooked 'human' food they do not eat purina or canidae or any other 'dog' food i think that dog food is too processed i do not see any scientific research that says dogs are so different from humans that they cannot eat many but not all of the same foods that we enjoy what i am asking is if raw foods are great for dogs then why aren't more people considering that they might be great for themselves dogs are more or less omnivores as we are there are obviously differences but not like say horses or cattle or even cats most people however do not like raw meats and i am wondering why there isn't more of a move towards eating raw meats this bipolar attitude towards dogs and humans makes no sense to me differences certainly but not such a wide divide as you make it out to be where is the research yes but humans discovered fire and can cook their food dogs never did that Food Chicken Hamburger McDonald's Livestock Vegetarianism French cuisine Japanese cuisine Veganism Taboo food and drink Cuisine of Denmark Sushi Dog Korean cuisine Escherichia coli O157:H7 Tofu Foodborne illness Hot dog German cuisine Omega-3 fatty acid French fries Cuisine of the Southern United States Raw food diet Chili con carne Cuisine of Malaysia Meat Gray Wolf Pig Hot pot Animal rights Barbecue Peruvian cuisine Horse meat Cat Ramen Dim sum Cantonese cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Pizza Cuisine of Africa Salad Bengali cuisine Jewish cuisine MRE Cuisine of Laos Lisa the Vegetarian Vitamin C Salmon Chinese cuisine Brown Bear Oyster Bird Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Fancy rat Cajun cuisine Vegetarianism and religion A&W Restaurants Fish and chips Delicatessen Hell's Kitchen (television) Trailer Park Boys Domesticated turkey Cuisine of Brazil Agriculture Species Sauerkraut Saimin Breakfast D__ner kebab Brain Fast-food restaurant Foie gras Carnivore Shanghai cuisine Kashrut Fast food Louis Pasteur God Emperor of Dune Kitchen Cheese Kosher foods Beef Vegetarian cuisine Cuisine of Norway In-N-Out Burger Fugu Canadian Chinese cuisine Matt Hardy Food preservation Organic farming
