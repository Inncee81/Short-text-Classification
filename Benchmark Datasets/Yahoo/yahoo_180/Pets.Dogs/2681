puppy confused about name my dog whos names is aspen thinks his name is stop i guess he picked that up when we would tell him to stop chewing on the furniture what should we do should we just rename him stop im confused dogs do not pick up their whole name when they listen most of the time they only acknowledge when they hear the last sound of their name in your case it would be pen the mistake probably started when you were trying to correct him and saying his name and stop together its always good to say you dog's name before giving him any command of even praising him like aspen sit or aspen good boy like i mentioned earlier try using simple single sound words instead of saying to to correct him change it to no and with a dominant tone saying aspen no should be easier for him to understand because dogs don't understand the meaning of no but with the loud tone no he will know that its not a good thing let the word no be your message to him to stop doing what he's doing and that it is the wrong thing to do hopefully a week or so he will remember his name then good luck Dog training Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) English grammar Non-native pronunciations of English Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Battle of the beams Philosophy of language Time Out of Mind Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Singlish Phoneme Extreme Programming Theory of conduct Debugging Wheel of Fortune Apostrophe (mark) Milton H.
