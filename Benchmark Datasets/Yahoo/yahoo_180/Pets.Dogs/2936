my poor doggie i just noticed he had something sticky in his fur and when i touched it a clump of hair fell off of him and revealed a large bald patch on his neck but it's not just a bald patch it's almost as if something attacked him and the area is raw i snuck up on him and poured peroxide on it which bubbled and caused him to cry but am not sure if i should take him to vet or not the reason i'm so concerned is that he's an inside dog and aside from his daily walks so i have no clue how this could have happened he wasn't attacked what you have is a 'hot spot' or 'lick lesion' the skin is infected with staph bacteria he needs to see a vet for treatment he probably has allergies to something in the food or around the house or possibly fleas that caused him to itch or lick the spot incessantly constant moisture and or irritation of an area will inflame and damage the skin which makes it vulnerable to infection Eczema Acne Psoriasis Dandruff Group A streptococcal infection Guinea pig Anthrax Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Intravenous therapy Dog Urinary incontinence Traumatic brain injury Fancy rat Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Conjunctivitis Skin Itch Chronic fatigue syndrome Herpes simplex virus Bubonic plague Rosacea Cat Common cold Hair Mange Tattoo Autoimmune diseases Hydrogen peroxide Radiation therapy Cephalic disorder Ulcerative colitis Halitosis Tuberculosis Candidiasis Domestic rabbit Baldness Rabies Aspartame Diarrhea Fecal incontinence Otitis externa Salad Fingers 613 mitzvot Benzoyl peroxide Gypsy moth Clothing Ulcer Depilation Allergy Tooth enamel Athlete's foot 101 Dalmatians: The Series Lyme disease Leptospirosis Hay fever Livestock Garfield Tasmanian Devil Smegma Boil Erogenous zone Scrofula Multiple sclerosis Ringworm Cirrhosis Keeshond Antiseptic Onchocerciasis Staphylococcus aureus Shampoo Breastfeeding Scar Medicine Plastic Cancer Jock itch Medical analysis of circumcision Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Spidey Super Stories Mycosis fungoides Asthma Endocarditis Callus Mouth ulcer Stroke Beetle Tag Bacteria Ultraviolet Immune system Prostate cancer The Marshall Mathers LP Dental caries Pet skunk Alopecia areata Foodborne illness Insulin Open cluster Paracetamol
