breathing funny hi my yr old active dalmatian is breathing funnny not all the time but a few times during the day she sneezes alot especially when we go outside and i was wondering if she maybe had an allergy to grass or something else she seems very happy otherwise i will take her to the vet tomorrow but wondered if this is something anyone else had has with their dog she is also prone to attention seeking too especially since i became pregnant and i am due in weeks i think it might be pollen as well its not so much that she is having trouble breathing but almost the way she gets if she is coughing up something or wants to be sick she isnt bothered by it well i shouldnt say that as i dont know whats going on in her mind but she carries on as usual and runs around sounds to me like she is backward sneezing when my beagle started to do this i freaked out i thought she was choking its fine though she does every once in a while now the vet told me that it can be from post nasal drip or allergies you can wind up spending oodles of money investigating the cause my sweetie is now and she has done it her whole life she is fine with it and i just tell her to go and get a drink of water Pollen Hay fever Common cold First aid Allergy Nasal congestion Asthma Cat Toilet humour Dog Charles Darwin's illness My Parents are Aliens Insomnia Shaggy dog story Decompression sickness Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nasal irrigation Transmission (medicine) Elephant Avenue Q Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tiny Toon Adventures The Voyage of the Beagle Dead Like Me Flower AFI 100 Years series Garfield Paul Is Dead Darwin from Insectivorous plants to Worms Guinea pig The Ashlee Simpson Show Tuberculosis Alcoholics Anonymous Charles Darwin's views on religion The Smoking Room Social rule History of the English language Sulfasalazine The Catcher in the Rye Fancy rat Professional wrestling holds Pneumonia Diarrhea Beagle Happy Tree Friends Russian joke Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Equine conformation The Marshall Mathers LP Sauna Dean Koontz Fasting Group A streptococcal infection Carl Barks Tom Jones (singer) Alois Hitler Frankie Laine Soap opera Silverchair Calvin and Hobbes Dr. Seuss S.N.O.W.I.N.G.
