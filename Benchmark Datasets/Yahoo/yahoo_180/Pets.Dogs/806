puppy mean to older dog my older dog is a year old bichon frise he is very sweet and tempermental likes to cuddle etc my new puppy is a month old female maltese she is more hyper and into doing her own thing while my bichon is very clingy and relies on people he likes the new puppy but she tends get him mad by jumping on his face stealing his toys and taking things out of his mouth he growls but has never ever bit her even when she is especially mean to him she even bites his face sometimes she doesnt realize that this upsets him and when she tries to sleep next to him or anything like that he runs away thinking she is going bite him or be mean what can i do to make them friends at first it sounds like a dominence thing which it very well might be since your older dog is so laid back and the young one all ready to go a power struggle might have a bit of play otherwise it sounds like your little pup never learned puppy manners and your older dog is too sweet to correct her at what age did you get her is she a rescue or breeder dog chances are if she was taken from her family before weeks she never learned the rules of playing nice for the biting next time you catch her nipping at the older dogs faces make a very loud high pitched noise this noise is similar to a noise her siblings would make if she had played too rough and had hurt them this should after one or two times send the message that what she's doing hurts and she shouldn't do it as far as establishing the older dog as the one in charge when you come home ignore the pup go straight to the older dog and greet him first then you can turn to the younger pup and greet her feed the older dog first and if the pup goes for his food move her away and block her path to the bowl then feed her after she sees the older dog eat this will also help to maybe give your older dog the confidence to stand up for himself generally when doing anything consider the older dog first before the younger this will send a clear message as to who you have decided ranks higher than the other good luck Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog Guinea pig Cat Gray Wolf Friends Kodocha Kim Possible Taikyoku shogi Dog agility Beethoven (film) Housebreaking Humphrey Bogart Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Care Bears Shaggy dog story Shark Social rule Customs and etiquette of Japan Piccolo Junior Saga Havanese Vegeta 1957 World Series Aerial (dance move) Skinny Puppy Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Kakapo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pittsburgh Steelers Professional wrestling attacks Sin City Socialization Tag Ron and Fez Hearing impairment The Shining (film) Characters of Naruto Full Metal Panic?
