how do i put my year old cocker spaniel up for adoption i'm afraid he may bite my toddler my cocker spaniel is not adjusting well to my young toddler he has growled and mouthed at him i love my children more than my dog i want him to be put into a good setting in a family without kids has anybody been in this position before i live in connecticut of course you love your children more i would hope so is there no way the dog can gradually be trained to be with the children perhaps with the help of a professional dog trainer face it not many want to adopt a seven year old dog if he's been in one family this long he is not likely to adapt well to another truth is he will likely go to a shelter and be put down then again if you suddenly leave him tied up outside because of this as some people do maybe its better to look for a new home for him Dog training Spaniel English Springer Spaniel Golden Retriever Dog English Cocker Spaniel Hearing impairment Spot the Dog American Cocker Spaniel Mixed-breed dog Adoption Dog agility Cat Kimberly-Clark Corporation Lady and the Tramp Nintendogs Obedience training Pok__mon Live!
