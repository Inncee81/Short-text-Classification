old injury our two year old chiualua was paralyzed back in februaury of this year we nursed him back to health and he was fine he bagan walking and playing as normal the vet said it was probably just swelling causing the temporary paralasis we counted our blessings and moved on until yesterday when all of a sudden he couldn't walk again when we put him in water he can stand and move his legs and when we touch them we can tell he feels them however he just drags his legs behind him just like he did during the initial injury we were with him when the problem began and did not see anything happen to cause it the weather is getting colder here so at first we wonderd if the injury could have caused arthritis the not walking part scares us tail still wags nose is still wet and he responds to sound and touch so we see no other underlying problem please if any one knows what might be the problem and what we can do it would be greatly be appreciated i recently had a similar situation i tracked two dogs newfoundland mixes when i got the one she was partially paralyzed i brought her to the vet and vet wanted to euthanize her i fought with the vet and suggested instead a cortisone injection and cortisone tabs to take with me this vet never even offered me anything within hours or so the dog began to move i was pretty upset with this vet who argued with me in front of the whole clinic telling me this dog would never walk again we actually had it out i didn't take the dog back to her but i did take her to a small animal teaching university where they diagnosed her as having a spinal ebolism like a blood clot in the spinal cord not at all that uncommon you can opt for an mri to determine the cause of your dogs problem in my dog between the spinal ebolism and the fact that she had been running for so long so hard and starved all of this contributed to the swelling which caused the nerve to be pinched creating the temporary paralysis the whole time her tail was moving a little and their was a hint of movement in her legs and feeling in her back and hind end but she still couldn't walk she ate and drank although this stray had been traveling for weeks and she was weak and emaciated there could be several other reasons for the paralysis too many to list here you really need to see a neurologist i would search in a small animal teaching universities or specialty vet hosipitals i hope my story gave you some light moral to this story is some vets are great and some are not don't always trust that the vet knows more than you or what is best for your animal ask questions hang on to hope and if in doubt always get a second opinion take your dog to a neurologist i won't bore with another story but my brother's dog also had a temporary paralysis also corrected over time ps my stray now my dog has been with us for over months now and she is almost i feel great because this dog is only about year old and she has her whole life ahead of her because i argued with the vet good luck and god bless Traumatic brain injury Dog Equine conformation Chronic fatigue syndrome Urinary incontinence Multiple sclerosis Stroke Cephalic disorder Stem cell Aphasia Milton H.
