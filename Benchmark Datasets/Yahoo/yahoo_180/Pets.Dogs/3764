dog hotspot on throat my dog got a horrible hotspot on his throat and had almost clawed his skin off before i found it i have treated and cleaned the area and the last couple days i have had it bandaged so he couldn't scratch it but i need it to start to scab and heal but can't do that with it being constantly bandaged and i am scared once it starts to itch again he is going to go right back to scratching at it what can i use to keep him from scratching at it but that will also allow oxygen to it to let it heal and no a cone won't work because again it's on his throat thanks for any ideas you can use a hots opt spray from the pet store or go to your vet you really just need to keep it clean and keep a close eye on him Group A streptococcal infection Hay fever Volcano Pet skunk Guinea pig Sin City Wound Cat Psoriasis Itch Eczema Ferret First aid kit Scabies Characters of Naruto Tattoo Common cold Clothing Ninja Scroll Fancy rat Wound healing phases Skunk First aid Fire fighting Radiation therapy American lobster Dobermann Urticaria Goanna Keloid Skin Sesshomaru Dead Like Me Antiseptic Aloe Cheetah The Apprentice 2 Mange Housebreaking Malignant melanoma Otitis externa Hydrotherapy Rabies Healing The Subtle Knife Hamster The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Medicine Dandruff Eldfell Happy Tree Friends Hotspot (geology) Pepper spray Butters Stotch Scarification Smallpox Blood (computer game) Garfield German Shepherd Dog Dog 2005 Iditarod The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Japanese Chin Crocodilia Urinary incontinence Apple Days of our Lives White phosphorus incendiary Dog agility Pediculosis Peter Shilton Brewery Microchip implant (animal) Carburetor Jackie Chan Adventures The X-Files (season 1) Kodocha Piccolo Junior Saga Sulis Scorpion Pottery Photodynamic therapy Doom enemies Hydrogen peroxide Gray Wolf Knife Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sabretooth (comics) Shaggy dog story Artemis Entreri Diamond Jet engine Professional wrestling holds Domestic rabbit Veterinarian American Eskimo Dog Natural Selection (computer game) Wolverine (comics) The Death Gate Cycle
