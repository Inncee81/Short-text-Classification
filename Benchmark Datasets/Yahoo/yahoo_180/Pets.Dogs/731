confused about something people say puppy dry food should not be fed to giant breed puppies but others say it's ok i'm confused is this just a matter of opinion one breeder refuses to feed puppy food to her giant breed puppies because she thinks that feeding puppy food takes off a year of their life so you must feed dog food to puppies no matter how young it is well the dog food seller said she's wrong and the puppies aren't getting the nutrients so who's right here or is it just a matter of opinion puppies need to have the correct nutrients when they are young especially they are at an important growing stage where you need to make sure they are getting everything they need to do this you need to make sure they are eating puppy food puppy food is specially formulated to give them more of what they need at that age than the regular food does the breeder you mention must be on crack if her dogs don't get the proper nutrients because she refuses to feed them puppy food her dogs could end up with problems that will take a whole lot more than one year off their lives those dogs are good candidates for back problems arthritis joint issues heart problems etc i love animals i have two dogs and i have been doing this for a long time but in my opinion there are some breeders out there that should not be breeding animals and they should not even own pets it is also my opinion that some breeders become very whacky over time they tend to experiment and they think that their experience as breeders makes them qualified vets scientists or even god while there are many good breeders out there you need to be very skeptical of some of the ones that become eccentric over time seriously i know a breeder that once said that she didn't believe in leaving water for her dogs when she left them to go to work for the day she said they don't need water while she's at work i'm sorry but dogs must certainly do need water to keep hydrated and she's sometimes gone for hours a day to go to work see what i mean some breeders get very full of themselves and think they know better when common sense should be dictating otherwise beware of stupid people Dog Housebreaking Guinea pig Garfield Puppy mill Domestic rabbit Livestock Dobermann Havanese German Shepherd Dog Agriculture Fancy rat Dog training Socialization Labrador Retriever Golden Retriever Basset Hound Dog breed Hip dysplasia Breed registry Hamster Dog breeding American Pit Bull Terrier Kodocha Ferret Kitten Shetland Sheepdog RuneScape quests Pet store Dog show Chicken Seabird Alaskan husky Cat Theory of conduct Bird migration Nutrition Gray Wolf English Springer Spaniel Gerald Durrell Equine conformation Pet skunk Breastfeeding Border Terrier Discus (fish) Taboo food and drink Folic acid Shrimp farm Coprophagia Keeshond Irish Wolfhound Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism House Mouse Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Manx (cat) Border Collie My Little Pony Time Out of Mind Simone Weil Brown Bear Animal rights Salmon Koi Hydroponics Terri Schiavo Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Zoophilia Rabbit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Poodle Intelligent design Goodness and value theory Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Shaggy dog story Vitamin C Plant breeding Snoopy Whippet American Eskimo Dog Vegetarianism Monster Rancher monsters Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Great Dane Rugrats Laura Schlessinger American Kennel Club Animal husbandry Italian Greyhound Lisa the Vegetarian Current teachings of Prem Rawat Factory farming Shark Social rule
