how good is a dog's memory can dogs remember things like where they were born siblings parents etc i'm just curious dogs have very poor memory they only know the now things can seem familiar to them and certain smells and sights and sounds may be very safe or unsafe in their minds i just left my month old pup with friends for a week friends that he knows but he has not been in the house since he came home at weeks old he sulked around and whined for a bit i don't think he was missing me or my house i think he was just not sure if he was safe or unsafe at my house the sights sounds and smells are familiar and have always been safe this place was new by the end of the first two days he had settled in very well he did not pine for there when he came home either he knew he was safe it was familiar Dog training The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Care Bears Hamster Social rule Richard Rahl Guinea pig Dog The Lovely Bones The Giver Kakapo Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Epistemology Hiberno-English Shark Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Boards of Canada She Loves You Jennifer Lopez Our Gang The Family from One End Street Fancy rat Adjective USS Trigger (SS-237) TLC Lisa the Vegetarian Bob Dylan (album) Hearing impairment Theodore Roosevelt Scooby-Doo Ron and Fez Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Escape of Charles II A Day in the Life Kender The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Kurt Cobain Christmas Breaker Morant Time Out of Mind Mnemonic Cognitive science Elizabeth Smart kidnapping Socrates The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe USS Atule (SS-403) Sweet Smell of Success: The Musical Elvis Presley Taikyoku shogi AFI 100 Years series 2005 Iditarod Blonde on Blonde K' USS Sea Devil (SS-400) Hey Jude Big Brother UK series 6 101 Dalmatians: The Series Breastfeeding Bye Bye Nerdie Jon Secada Piccolo Junior Saga Traumatic incident reduction American lobster Britney Spears Laci Peterson Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ty Cobb Billboard Hot 100 Coyote Francis Bacon (painter) USS Waters (DD-115) Hide and Q (TNG episode) USS Trippe (DD-403) T'Pol The McGuire Sisters Buster Keaton Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Mental image Muraqaba V.F.D.
