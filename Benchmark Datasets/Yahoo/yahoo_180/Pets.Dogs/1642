dog agility i have a hyper black and white border collie named roxy i have trained almost everything a dog can learn like sit stay come backup lay roll over play dead etc i have even taught her how to jump over feet and to swerve in out if poles i was wondering if agility would be good for a dog like her do they need speicial training for that is more than than just what i have taught how much do enetrance fees usually cost yes agililty would be wonderful for your dog border collies excell in agility it does take special training and equipment it usually takes about to years to train the dog to competition levels but you have already started the training process so it may not take as longs and bc's are usually fast learners it is something that will keep her mind occupied and something for the two of you to do together there is a lot more to agility than meets the eye they have to know which obstacle to go to while running for instance if there is a tunnel and the teeter toter next to each other as they land from a jump and you tell your dog to take the teeter toter the dog has to know not only which obstacle is the teeter toter but also the tipping point on that particular obstacle and that they have to touch the contact point of that obstacle they also have to be able to take an obstacle that is not right next to you bc's are so fast that most handlers will cut the course as much as possible for them so they can stay up with the dog so they have to take short cuts while the dog is running the course in order to do this there may be one or two obstacles between you and the dog they also have to know how and when to come into you or get out away from you the cost of entry fees varies on the venue and the amount of runs you enter per day the akc has a website that may be able to help you find training in your area as well of some of these others www akc org www k cpe com www k events com you may also be able to just put dog agility your area in your search bar and get some info on training if that doesn't work you should be able to find an agility event in your area from the above sites go watch learn and ask someone there about training my experience is that everyone at an agility trial is extremely helpful and super super nice your dog also has to be registered with the venue that you plan on participating in every venue has their own rules and games akc is the most strict but also challenging if your dog doen't have akc papers you can still participate in akc agility by proving that your dog is full bred bc via pictures and prove the she is spayed they will issue an ilp number and you are now able to participate in akc events then other venues just ask what kind of dog she is most of them are open to any breed even mixed first find a train facility in your area then think about the different venues they will help you get registered with the different venues and tell you about the different rules in each it's an addiction so beware a good addiction good luck to you and have a blast running with your dog Obedience training Border Collie American Kennel Club Australian Shepherd Sonic the Hedgehog Labrador Retriever American Pit Bull Terrier Keeshond Baseball Horse RuneScape quests RuneScape skills Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Volleyball Parachuting Shetland Sheepdog Dog Australian Cattle Dog RuneScape weapons Mixed martial arts Equine conformation Extreme Programming Ultimate (sport) Golf Dog training Tenshinhan Golden Retriever Skateboarding trick Super Sonic CPU cache Items in the Metroid series RuneScape locations Super Mario Bros.
