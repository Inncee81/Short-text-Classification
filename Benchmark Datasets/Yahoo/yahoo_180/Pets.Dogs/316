how long can you expect a dog to stay and at what age i have a mos old rott and he is doing really well with his training we are going to a puppy class and i am doing some training on my own i am wondering how long one could expect a puppy to stay how long would it take for a dog to be able to stay for say a half hour hi congrats on your puppy we have a neutered male year old rott that we rescued when he was abandonded we take in foster animals and were originally going to just foster him but we fell in love we have had him since february he was always kept in the backyard and no one ever messed with him and he also had confidence issues due to lack of socialization so we enrolled him in a group basic obedience class he can heel auto sit when handler stops walking sit and we are working on down and stay it has taken awhile just for him to stay laying down when i would walk around him with the leash getting him used to the command he can hold a sit for about minutes if he's focused our trainer has rotts that she participates in high level obed with and at one point her female could hold a sit for half n hour she said this took a long time of training to accomplish it is hard for big dogs like rotts to sit very long cause all their weight is on their front legs and they are basically supporting their whole body as far as say a down stay a dog could theoritically hold it until it was released from the command had to potty etc our trainer brings both her dogs to class and puts them in a down stay our class is approx a hour long and they will both stay laying down until she tells them otherwise its very good that you are doing this with your pup when he's young working with doc is like working with a lb puppy he is doing very well but is just now learning basics and getting socialized to basics car rides bikes etc that he should have mastered a long time ago good luck and there is a rott group that i am in through yahoo that i enjoy talking with other rott owners on you might check it out good luck Dog training Obedience training Dog agility Housebreaking Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation American Pit Bull Terrier Dog show Musical Canine Freestyle Crate training Golden Retriever Kitesurfing Shaggy dog story Schutzhund Brian Griffin Weight training Time Out of Mind Socialization Fox hunting Nintendogs Swingout Kodocha The Amber Spyglass Skateboarding trick Keeshond Gun dog Mojave people Gliding The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Recumbent bicycle Piccolo Junior Saga Sailing Milton H.
