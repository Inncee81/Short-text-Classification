feeding my puppy so i feed her about a cup twice a day she seems to me and her regular vet to be at a healthy weight shes prob about months and weighs lbs but we saw a different vet today due to hers being out and he says she looks a little thin and for her size should be about lbs so what im asking is is lbs and okay weight for a month old boxer lab and possibly pitbull mix shes a mutt we rescued her so we dont know her exact breed or age no bones are showing with a mixed breed it's impossible to say what she should weigh a person would need to see her can you see her spine and ribs and if so can you put your finger in the indents between ribs if you can she's likely a little thin if not she's probably a good weight hard to tell without seeing her just remember puppies go through gangly stages when they're growing if she's just had a spurt where she grew in height she might look thin until her body catches up the other thing is it's healthier to be a bit underweight than overweight Mixed-breed dog Equine conformation Puberty Fancy rat Guinea pig Breastfeeding Tyrannosaurus rex Milk Obesity Liger Human height Mixed martial arts Body mass index Dog Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma First aid Tasmanian Devil Domestic rabbit Boxing Pound Blue Whale Housebreaking Great Dane Dobermann Scoliosis Tetrapod English Cocker Spaniel Dog training Garfield Korea Jindo Dog Weight Dairy Handloading Anorexia nervosa Sperm Whale Basset Hound Humphrey Bogart Atkins Nutritional Approach Hamster Autopsy Fetal development Bone age Docking Professional wrestling holds Gigantism Striped bass Thoracic vertebrae Bone Cancer Browning Model 1919 machine gun Mattress Super Size Me Porsche 911 Stomach cancer PRIDE Prostate cancer Mosquito Sternum Irish Wolfhound Spider Knife Rabies Pet skunk Albatross Finnish Spitz Abdomen Physical attractiveness Nintendogs Shetland Sheepdog M60 machine gun Cervical vertebrae Farthing (coin) Weekly World News Dieting Growth hormone Koala Sphenoid bone The Red Green Show Strike (attack) Great White Shark Animal testing Tigon Cat Gray Wolf Salmon Rib Birth weight Folic acid Capercaillie Adjustable gastric band Professional wrestling throws Domestic goat Maxilla Golden Retriever Kidney Sexual attraction SuperCroc
