puppy sneezing hi my little month old pup havanese has been sneezing a lot there is no discharge mucus coming out of her nose her nose looks fine she always has a little tear staining in her eyes anyway and the staining doesn't look any different her stool is ok too i personally think she has allergies but vet says they don't appear until they get a little older but even if she has allergies should she be sneezing all the time any advice would be greatly appreciated she stays mainly inside the house unless she plays with my mom's dog and then they play outside in a fenced yard x's a week thanks you may want to consider getting a bionair type air purifier unit there are dusts pollens smoke and other allergens in the confined air of a home that small lungs have difficulty with being so close to the ground you may want to vacuum your rugs and floors more often or try a different or better machine being outdoors includes the possibility of external forces so perhaps it is an allergy to ragweed grass mold or its' food i would prefer to eliminate the irritant rather than have it ingest medications Hay fever Common cold Asthma Immunoglobulin E Sneeze Cat Havanese Dog Guinea pig Hamster Cannabis (drug) Ragweed Fancy rat Air pollution Housebreaking Pneumonia Pollen Urinary incontinence Pulmonary alveolus Dog training Air purifier Peanut Stomach cancer Equine conformation Chronic fatigue syndrome Nose McMansion Bong Breastfeeding Tag Tuberculosis Fecal incontinence Mucus Nasal congestion Food Casting Diving Francis Bacon (painter) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diarrhea Pet skunk Carpet Treehouse of Horror V Coeliac disease Domestic rabbit Characters in the Smurfs Mast cell House dust mite Livestock RuneScape quests Lung cancer Nuclear fallout Tooth enamel Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hiccup Tobacco smoking Garfield Irritable bowel syndrome Flower Kitchen Toilet humour Marching band The Adventures of Pete & Pete Medicine Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Calvin and Hobbes Conjunctivitis Flea Tank Vacuum tube Fire fighting Lightning Chinchilla Shaggy dog story Carbon dioxide Toxic mold Sinusitis Swimming pool Psoriasis Aspergillosis Ultraviolet Animal testing Bloodstain pattern analysis Traumatic incident reduction Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Traumatic brain injury Eczema 101 Dalmatians: The Series The Ashlee Simpson Show Babe Ruth Tobacco Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Vacuum Angioedema Dean Koontz Autonomous building
