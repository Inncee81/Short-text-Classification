people with jobs what do you do with your dog s while you're at work when my husband and i got our two dogs we were working opposite shifts so someone was always home to take care of them however now we are both working full time during the days and commute minutes to and from work each day so we are not able to check in on our dogs day care for dogs is more expensive than it is for children in our area and we do not have any close family members by who can take them in during the day right now we have a neighbor come over twice a day just to let them run outside check their food and water and throw a ball a few times and during the summer we hired a school kid to give them walks during the day the dogs also have the run of the house they are not kept in kennels and we also leave the air on for them when it's hot they also get plenty of attention and exercise when we get home question is is this enough is there more i can be doing i feel bad being gone during the day but it would break all of our hearts to give them up where does everyone get the idea that people with jobs can't have pets there is no reason to give up a pet just because you work i work full time and go to school part time i also have dogs cats and foster dogs the dogs go outside to potty first thing in the morning then they have play time while i get ready for work when i leave for work the ones that have to be crated because they eat the furniture go into their crates those that are trustworthy have run of the house as soon as i get home from work they go outside to potty then we play in the house for a while those that need brushing nail trims etc get that done early evening we go to the park for an hour or so walk the rest of the evening they entertain themselves while i do stuff around the house homework watch tv whatever feeding time a final potty break and then it's bed time they have the option of sleeping in the bedroom or not whichever they choose if they sleep in the bedroom they get hours of uninterrupted time with me weekends we take long hikes or if the weather is too hot a trip to petsmart where it's air conditioned sometimes if i feel i've neglected them i'll toss an old blanket and pillow on the living room floor and watch tv on their level they love that the cats on the other hand are pretty self sufficient when they feel like interacting with me they do otherwise they ignore me i have had many compliments on how well behaved and well adjusted my dogs are all while maintaining a fulltime job as long as you spend quality time with your dogs they don't care if you work or not Hamster Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Dog training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Sims Fancy rat Milton H.
