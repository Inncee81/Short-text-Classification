should i adopt when i have a busy schedule i am very interested in looking to adopt a puppy or a young dog but i work almost every day and am taking some night classes also are there some breeds that can be okay until i get home in the evening time or is it not a smart idea to get a dog if i cannot be with it during the day most of the week you can adopt and have a life with a dog even though you work i wouldn't recommend a puppy since they need to be fed and let out to potty every couple of hours consider a dog at least a year old it'll have many years of life to give you aaverage but will have the capacity to hold it's potty for hours if you're in night classes and don't come home between work and night classes please don't get a dog unless you plan on having someone else like a family or friend or dog sitter come over and and sit and play and take care of the dog because that will be alot of time that the dog is left alone if you only have another semester or two left of school than get a dog when you're done with the night classes that's only fair to the dog Housebreaking Dog training Dog Crate training Golden Retriever Soap opera Hopkins School The Citadel (Military College) Socialization Juris Doctor Brian Griffin Labrador Retriever Kodocha Fertility awareness Feral child Obedience training Animal Farm Beethoven (film) Dog show Education in Germany Snoopy Blonde on Blonde Quill (film) American Kennel Club Dog breed Crufts The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Nintendogs Puppy mill MTV2 Planet Waves Ocean's Twelve Iditarod One Tree Hill (TV series) Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Fancy rat Breed registry Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Pet skunk Eddie Guerrero Canonical hours Neighbours Basset Hound Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) 2005 Iditarod Steven Wright Korea Jindo Dog Dean Koontz Scooby-Doo Shetland Sheepdog Ephesian Tale Graham Kennedy Border Collie Future-Drama The Family from One End Street Friends Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Montreal Screwjob Graduate school Livestock American Eskimo Dog Dog breeding The Fairly OddParents Great Dane Propaedeutic value of Esperanto International League Dog agility Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show Education in the People's Republic of China Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier 101 Dalmatians: The Series Best of Breed Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Toilet humour WCBS-FM Academic term Humphrey Bogart Monday Night Football Chronology of Jesus WFAN (AM) Walt Disney World College Program Lazarus Long Belgian Shepherd Dog German Shepherd Dog Clifford's Puppy Days WNNX (FM) Eric Bischoff Theory of conduct Billboard Hot 100 Rugrats Animal rights Honey and Clover Tasmanian Devil Urinary incontinence Teacher's Pet (Disney) Social rule Whippet The Realm of the Elderlings/Characters Sally Ann Howes The Lovely Bones
