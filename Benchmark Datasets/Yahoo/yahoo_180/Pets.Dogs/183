am i teaching my dog violence or being playful i have a and a half year old female golden retriever she's so playful very much still a puppy i'm concerned that i'm teaching her to be violent when i play with her sometimes i'll make my fist into a claw and she will lift her mouth up show her teeth and attack my hand and i'll tease her with my hand for a minute or two eventually i just let her bite down on my fist and then she'll lick it so i think she understands not to attack people but i'm not so certain and i'm wondering if there is any conterversy on playing tug of war with dogs opinions the human hand is in dog language equivalent to the dog s mouth so only do things with your hand that dogs normally do with each other they play fight and nip each other in play the mouth is always their tool you should always initiate the game and end the game you as the boss have to determine what when and how it is to be done so the dog must never land up as the winner in a game as long as you keep this in mind i think it is alright to play this game i also play with my two dogs and playfully bite them with my hand on the jowls and on the shoulder and the hind feet are places where dogs often bite each other in play when a dog does bite in earnest then it heads for the scruff of the neck and the throat that is the place where you can bite your dog when he does something you do not like but the way you describe your game with your dog i do not think that this is dangerous it is just good to be aware of how dogs think Dog training Dog Doom enemies Gesture Professional wrestling holds Cat Rugby union Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling aerial techniques Boxing Kim Possible Professional wrestling match types Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Suplex Dilbert Sabretooth (comics) Akuma (Street Fighter) Table tennis Sick Puppy Tai Chi Chuan Brown Bear The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Gray Wolf Tai shogi Double Dragon Hamster Jade Empire Oral sex Vegeta Alaga__sia Draw poker Vampire Horse tack Zero (Mega Man) Housebreaking 2000 Australian Grand Prix Late Night with Conan O'Brien Labrador Retriever German Shepherd Dog Baseball Tenshinhan Unreal Strike (attack) Goanna I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Drill bit Pet skunk Treecat InuYasha (character) Rock, Paper, Scissors Sub-Zero Diving Swingout Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Volleyball Football (soccer) Powerbomb Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog agility Embouchure Monster Rancher monsters Internal ballistics Punch (strike) Capoeira Alex Ferguson Guide dog Fast bowling Human The Legend of Zelda series enemies Woodworking Amateur wrestling Norway national football team Gundestrup cauldron Equine conformation Obedience training Drowning Tooth enamel Vulcan (Star Trek) Dai dai shogi Toa American Alligator Paintball Happy Tree Friends Star Ocean: Till the End of Time Human anatomy Lion Spanking Richard Chase Softball Blood (computer game) Golden Retriever Humphrey Bogart Yusuf al-Qaradawi Milton H.
