anyone but me feel there is more there when it comes to our dogs i adopted a black female lab about a year ago who was rescued aside from the usually gentle loving companionship this lab offers some mysteries as i have become close to my i have sincerely developed the notion that there is more there then just being a dog i realize all dogs are controlled to most extent by their instincts but this dog seems to hold some human characteristics for example a month ago when i had the flu the dog laid by my side day and night in a concerned manor and could clearly tell i was sick and seemed to offer sympathy she can tell my moods and has become totally attached to me there just seems to be much more there then just the typical human dog relationship anyone else out there have this experience with their dog i get the feeling that when you become truly close with your dog there is more there then what we might realize almost a psychic thing going on a gratefulness from the dog that can't really be explained am i crazy you are absolutely not crazy you have been lucky enough to find your dog soul mate it is a wonderful feeling to be loved and cared for like that isn't it i have a wonderful aussie huskie mix who is my dog soul mate she stays by my side through thick or thin and is never too tired to comfort me or give me a hug when i need one she takes care of and mothers all the other dogs in my house i have seven and comes and tells me if someone is sick or has gotten out she even takes it upon herself to break up any squabbles so i don't have to wherever i am in the house she is there with me if i run errands she sits beside me and enjoys being with me i don't know how i will survive without her when the time comes Dog The Amber Spyglass The Invisibles Haven (TNG episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Kodocha The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Shaggy dog story Honey and Clover T'Pol The Critic The Death Gate Cycle Love Pitaten Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Characters in the Smurfs Dog training Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Avenue Q Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Scenes from a Memory The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Samurai Deeper Kyo God Emperor of Dune Into the West (miniseries) The Shining (film) Symbiosis (TNG episode) Sant Thakar Singh YuYu Hakusho About a Boy Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist My Parents are Aliens Sin City Abortion debate Dog agility The Secret of NIMH Domestication Characters of Lost Futurama (TV series - season 5) Friends Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ginny Weasley Labrador Retriever Obedience training Everwood Smallville (Season 4) Sonic the Hedgehog The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Neighbours Blonde on Blonde Philip J.
