my yr old dog is using the house as it's toilet my family has a yr old dog that has recently started to poop and occasionally pee in the house this is a dog that used to be able to hold it for hours now she can barely get up to go outside but still manages she can go outside to do her stuff then come in the house and poop an hour later i'm really getting tired of being surprised with poop every day other than her normal old age ailments she is ok not active at all mostly lays around she is overwight and is going blind and deaf and has arthritis but is still a part of the family anyone have any ideas as to what can be done about the new potty habits i guess i'm a bit offended by the comments from people advocating that you euthanize her what i'm hearing from you is that you're unhappy about the messes in the house not that her life has become constant pain and its time for her to die please forgive me if i'm misinterpreting you need to take her out more often restrict her access to only certain parts of the house the inability to hold it the sudden having to go now are all a part of the aging process frankly this is a good time to learn about love and tolerance of the aged because hopefully you too as well as your parents etc will eventually reach that stage its too bad about her being overweight as this was not her choice to make and it just increases her difficulties at her age Hearing impairment Pitaten Shaggy dog story Cat Toilet humour Breastfeeding Dog Autism Euthanasia Milton H.
