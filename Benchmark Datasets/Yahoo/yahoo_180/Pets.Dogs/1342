why does my daschund never leave me alone his name is elvis he's about months i just got him a couple days ago obviously i know i need to get him his shots and get him neutered or fixed asap but he just won't let me go anywhere without him even if it's to the next room he starts scratching the door barking and crying so loud also when i leave the house i come back to the things in my room like papers i had on top of my desks the puppy pads and the carpet near the door all ripped up i understand that maybe he wasn't getting enough attention or love from the family before but this is extreme attachment i tried leaving him in a kennel today a big one at that because i had to run some errands to get him used to me being gone without messing up my room i left his food water a couple of his toys a puppy pad a little bed for him so he can have it all there but he completely ripped up every single thing in there and dropped the water and threw the food out of the kennel i've never seen a dog this sounds like your dog has abandonment issues try leaving soft music and lighting on for him a tv on is also good he is only tearing things up because his anxiety level shoots up when you the pack leader is gone the kennel is a good idea because he'll eventually see it as a place of safety it's going to take time and patience he'll learn that you return when you leave try leaving for a short period of time then increase it more every time Dog Housebreaking Dog training Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Dog agility The Shining (film) Kodocha EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests Dog show Gramophone record She Loves You Toilet humour Sin City Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Characters in the Smurfs One Tree Hill (TV series) Nintendogs Chair Toy Story 2 American Kennel Club Cat Sick Puppy Chinchilla Billboard Hot 100 About a Boy Lady and the Tramp Golden Retriever Socialization Jennifer Lopez Combine (Half-Life 2) Skinny Puppy Maltese (dog) Ron and Fez Fancy rat Dog breed 2005 Iditarod Eddie Guerrero Crate training The Dalek Invasion of Earth Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Toyota Prius Ecco the Dolphin Crufts Alaskan husky The Doctor Dances Tag Cube (film) Iditarod Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show IBM PC compatible Fox hunting Pet skunk USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Ferret Dial M for Murder The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Highway 61 Revisited The Empty Child Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) The Basement Tapes Snooker Shawn Michaels Columbine High School massacre Scenes from a Memory I Want to Hold Your Hand Manos: The Hands of Fate Good Vibrations Trailer Park Boys Muslim ibn Aqeel Shetland Sheepdog Battles of Lexington and Concord Carl Barks Blonde on Blonde Equine conformation A-ha Reservoir Dogs The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Billiards Tears for Fears Mattress 101 Dalmatians: The Series Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Psychedelic music Cliff Richard USS Vestal (AR-4) Blood on the Tracks Professional wrestling match types P-38 Lightning Roxette Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind New Morning The Smoking Room
