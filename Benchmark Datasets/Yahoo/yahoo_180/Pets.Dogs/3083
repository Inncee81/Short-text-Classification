my dog is losing is hair and has bumps help i dont know what this may be i have an appt with the vet in two weeks to get my male dog neutered but i have noticed that he is missing a lot of hair around his jowels boxer and under his neck from my roomates puppy biting him so much but now i felt bumps under his neck where the hair loss is if it was infected wouldnt it hurt him if i touched it it looks like hard dried skin that has no fur then on the top of his head when standing from behind him you can see spots of fur that are missing this all started happening cause of the puppy biting him my bf thought that the puppy could have brought something home from the lake parks where he's not vacinated he is months old lab so his bites are hard anyone have any clue i did research something online and i cant remember what it was called but it affects the eye area first then goes to their legs so i dont think that could be it anyway im a lil concered any advise why does the puppy always want to bite him mange is what i researched after watching a tv show on homeless dogs just to let everyone know it's deff not fleas he's a boxer so had really short hair and i can see his bare belly but someone told me where he is vacinated that it wouldnt be mange so confused i wouldn't wait until the appointment to see the vet i would go ahead and take him in before whatever it is has a chance to get worse i would not let that other dog have anything to do with your pup again somebody is out of control and you need to protect your pup from the other dog i hope he gets better soon and it sounds like you are going to be a wonderful pet parent good luck Guinea pig Dog Dog training Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Housebreaking Fancy rat Gray Wolf Cat RuneScape quests Mange Poker jargon The Contender (television series) Prostate cancer Pet skunk Hair Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha 101 Dalmatians: The Series Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban 2000 Australian Grand Prix Keeshond Shetland Sheepdog Equine conformation Shaggy dog story Cheetah Social rule Professional wrestling throws Basset Hound Fur Piccolo Junior Saga Spidey Super Stories Skinny Puppy Labrador Retriever Domestic rabbit Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Stomach cancer Hamster Socialization Conspiracy (TNG episode) Garfield Humphrey Bogart Tarantula Ron and Fez Sesshomaru The Shining (film) Rabies Havanese Docking One Tree Hill (TV series) Milton H.
