breeds with high 'tucks' i know my dog is a mutt i like to try to figure out what kind of mutt he is so i know what genetic health problems to be on the lookout for as he ages what are some dogs with high 'tucks' my dog's chest is inches and his stomach is i am pretty sure he has some beagle and dachshund in his bloodlines but neither of these breeds seem to be built like that they are relatively flat across the bottom his legs are also too long what are some smaller breeds that have high tucks he's lb fully grown thanks http www dogster com dogs here are some pics if that helps yeah i don't really see the beagle either do dachshund howl too he howls like a beagle the vet and pound thought he was primarily beagle but beside well bred ones i don't see it tracy d partially i am a worry wart and partially i confess i just find it fun to try and figure out but that can get me pretty easily attacked on here by the you have a mutt end of story who cares what it is a mix of crowd 'mutt' doesn't have to have a negative connotation i love him to pieces and wouldn't trade him in for thousands i am a members of a facebook group called i have a mutt and i love his butt i mean no offense by 'mutt' i'll say 'mixed breed' if it makes people feel better but why do we have to let society make being a 'mutt' something bad yeah cat i'm always telling my dog your my widdle muttley to me he's cuter than a beagle or a dachshund and hopefully won't have those awful back problems since his legs are a little more proportionate i wouldn't say he howls alot but he does bay and howl a little when he wants attention that's pretty much it the doxie is easy to see but i don't see the beagle in him and i have more than my share of beagles if i had to guess i would say doxie x doxie cross Mixed-breed dog Dog Beagle Gray Wolf Equine conformation Humphrey Bogart Fancy rat Dachshund Minor Harry Potter Beasts Lady and the Tramp Inception of Darwin's theory Aerial (dance move) Theory of conduct Professional wrestling attacks My Life as a Teenage Robot Dog hybrids and crossbreeds The Ashlee Simpson Show Piccolo Junior Saga Def Leppard The Beach Boys Rocko's Modern Life Shaggy dog story The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Dobermann Havanese Diving Jon Secada Publication of Darwin's theory Joke Wolf's Rain Pitaten Animal testing The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Basset Hound The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Rottweiler Nintendogs Alaskan husky Charles Darwin's illness Domestic rabbit Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Cat Darwin from Orchids to Variation Monster Rancher monsters Transactional analysis Hamster Charles Darwin Professional wrestling throws Development of Darwin's theory Housebreaking Skunk The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Suplex Pet skunk Volleyball Redbone Coonhound Brian Griffin Firearm AFI 100 Years series Charles Darwin's views on religion Weight training Sexual orientation Selective breeding Greyhound Nine Inch Nails Time Out of Mind Social rule Manx (cat) Notable lines in the Star Wars series Garfield Transsexuality Pekingese Textile manufacturing Skye Terrier Something Awful Devil Fruit Ben Johnson (athlete) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Scrooge McDuck Blonde on Blonde The Voyage of the Beagle Liger "Weird Al" Yankovic Russian joke Reservoir Dogs Mojave people Clown German Shepherd Dog Yorkshire Terrier Smooth Collie Poker jargon Gerald Durrell Microeconomics Usher (entertainer)
