how much should my dog eat i have a month old black lab and it seems like he eats a lot to me i think if i let him he would eat the whole bag of dog food in one day when i first got him at about months old i kept him on a diet if cups a day i have moved that up to about cups now but it still seems like he is hungry all the time so does anyone no how much i am supposed to be feeding him and is this normal for black labs cups sounds like too much for your dog if that is the amount of food your dog requires to maintain good weight as mentioned you should be able to easily feel the ribs spine and points of the hip without them being visible you should perhaps consider feeding a better grade of dog food you will feed less and more of what you feed will be available to the dog as nutrition and not filler you'll also pick up less from the yard most feeding guidelines on the packages tend to encourage overfeeding large active deep chested dogs like labs are at risk for gastric torsion or bloat maintaining a twice daily feeding schedule helps to reduce that risk if your dog is carrying a normal weight for his breed and age and it seems you need to feed more to maintain that weight you might consider feeding one of the performance varieties of dog food these foods are formulated for very active dogs and enable them to maintain their optimal weight without feeding excess bulk if your dog is overweight or seems to be gaining reduce his feedings by always measure the food you give with a measuring cup so you know exactly how much you are feeding and can make accurate adjustments once your dog is at his optimum weight maintain him on that same amount labs have a tendency to overeat and gain weight easily keep him healthy and trim by feeding a good quality food and watching his weight most dogs are hungry all the time and quite willing to overeat if you let them Obesity Breastfeeding Dieting Equine conformation Fancy rat Domestic rabbit Nutrition Weight training Adjustable gastric band Hypoglycemia Hamster Cat Atkins Nutritional Approach Binge eating disorder Stomach cancer Folic acid Anorexia nervosa Guinea pig Insulin Vitamin C Labrador Retriever Welding Basset Hound Chocolate Tocopherol Super Size Me Cancer Microeconomics Tofu Food Livestock Dietary fiber Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Omega-3 fatty acid Genetically modified food Prostate cancer Raw food diet Gas metal arc welding Acne Terri Schiavo Carburetor Mattress Handloading Organic farming Inflation Albatross Human height Low-carbohydrate diet Bloat Local food Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Diabetes mellitus Kakapo Gastroparesis Coffee Chicken Tobacco smoking Goldfish M60 machine gun Shetland Sheepdog Tasmanian Devil Gastroesophageal reflux disease Movie projector Hubble Space Telescope Healthy eating Sailing Gramophone record Vegetarianism Dog (zodiac) Gastric bypass surgery Transformer Dialysis Organic food Calorie restriction Overeaters Anonymous Oral contraceptive Smooth Collie Internal ballistics Surveillance Garfield Vegetarian nutrition Pet skunk South Beach diet Puberty Animal testing Coeliac disease Sea-Monkey
