what can i do with my dog while i move into an apartment i have a month old black lab that my wife and i love we may be moving from our home to an apartment in another state we have our first baby coming in october and are worried that things may just be too hetic to have a young dog and a new baby in an apartment we would rather not give him away though any thoughts on what to do with him is there such thing as an apartment complex with a dog run hectic doesn't even begin to describe what you can expect and its just starting it's a huge responsibility taking on a new family and a new pup they're all going to need countless hours of attention and care medical bills and vets cost are not cheap and an emergency visit for any one of you can put a dent in any body's wallet but if you happen to be one of the lucky few with financial resources that put you in a comfortable level of living i think that's great and i wish you all the best i just hope you've looked at all the angles cramped space sleepless nights and the mother to be willl need any extra time you have but if you're in a position to provide for your family emotionally financially and all of the needs that come along with it schooling for both little ones included you should be able to find what you need an apartment complex would be my last choice now a days most town's have dog parks and some have doggie day care centers but then again there may be a fee i'd check with a realitor in that area to see if they have any listing for a place to rent in a quad plex or duplex its a bit more privite larger living space and a back yard of some sort i sure hope you find what you're looking for it's tough having a pet and finding a place that fit's a pet owners needs Friends Hamster Humphrey Bogart Strap-on dildo Dog training Breastfeeding Guinea pig Social rule AFI 100 Years series Shaggy dog story 1957 World Series Poker jargon Maison Ikkoku Sin City Dog Avenue Q Fancy rat Neighbours Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kodocha Pet skunk Kasparov versus The World The Inside CPU cache Prostate cancer Infantilism Smallville (Season 4) Housebreaking EastEnders Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Dead Like Me Futurama (TV series - season 5) Taikyoku shogi The Lovely Bones The Critic New York Giants Dog agility Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
