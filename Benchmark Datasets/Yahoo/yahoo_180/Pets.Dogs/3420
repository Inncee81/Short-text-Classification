new puppy help i just got a month old bull terrier mix today and i have been trying to introduce him to my year old cat the cat seems to stand his ground and growl at the puppy when he comes near which is understandbale because the puppy wants to jump at and play with the cat he has also barked at him a few times and i immediately told him no each time if the cat tries to run the dog instinctively wants to chase him any suggestions on how i can get the puppy to just ignore the cat is there a chance that they will ever be friends the cat was there first and has seniority if you will and yes puppies do chase anything that moves i wouldn't worry about it too much as long as the cat has something higher that he can jump onto and doesn't appear to feel threatened it should work out fine the cat and the dog may never be friends but will figure out their own boundaries also you just got the dog today please don't expect much from either of them just yet it's all very new to both of them and they need time to adjust right now what your pup needs most is your love and attention give him a few days at least to get used to his new situation there'll be plenty of time later for him to figure out how the cat runs the house good luck and remember to keep a sense of humor Dog training Dog Fox hunting Scooby-Doo Dog agility Beethoven (film) 101 Dalmatians: The Series Border Terrier Social rule Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Clifford's Puppy Days Taikyoku shogi Black Pete Skinny Puppy Shaggy dog story Cat Dean Koontz Carl Barks Kakapo Socialization Shetland Sheepdog Gray Wolf Zoophilia Golden Retriever Bull Terrier Garfield Friends Nintendogs Cheshire cat Pitaten Ron Weasley Tag German Shepherd Dog Border Collie Harry Nilsson Crate training Kodocha Rottweiler Brian Griffin Pit bull Ren and Stimpy West Highland White Terrier Rugrats The Ashlee Simpson Show Care Bears Cats (musical) Theory of conduct Time Out of Mind Dog show Pete the Pup Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Ranma __ characters Obedience training Humphrey Bogart Piccolo Junior Saga Mixed-breed dog Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Volleyball Guinea pig American Pit Bull Terrier Boston Terrier God Emperor of Dune Poker jargon Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Code: Lyoko Marilyn Monroe Little Britain RuneScape quests The Butterfly Effect Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Kerry Blue Terrier Yorkshire Terrier Jam (TV series) The Perishers Fancy rat Girly Elvis Presley Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Tai shogi The Pet Sounds Sessions Luck Scrooge McDuck The Invisibles Basset Hound The Star Wars Holiday Special Guilty Gear Dog breeding Daredevil Reservoir Dogs Honey and Clover User Friendly Karl Rove Equine conformation The Fairly OddParents
