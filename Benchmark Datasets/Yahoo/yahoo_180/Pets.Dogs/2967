when do you start training your dog i've recently adopted dogs the first one is a golden retreiver and he is weeks old i know he is too young for some serious training but he didn't even learned how to sit and come yet he is very hyper so it is very difficult to get his attention the other is siberian husky and she is months old her owners abandoned her because she was a handful and chewed the entire apartment is it too late to train her for some basic stuf eg come don't pull way too strong for me i've raised a perfectly well behaved german shepard and i also hope that they will pick up some of his behaviour tnx your week old pup is still a bit young for training classes but you can start training at home even at that age google nilf which stands for 'nothing in life is free' its a training method which makes the dogs work for everything they get so they get it in their heads that you are the boss alpha and they defer to you in all situations one way to start is to insist that both dogs sit before they get any treats from you be consistent kind and gentle and they will 'get it' very quickly the month old husky is highly trainable because of their exercise needs they are not 'apartment dogs' which is why the former owners ended up with an destroyed apartment i can't tell you the number of times i've seen this happen and it happened because she wasn't in a yard or being exercised enough and likely was left alone for long periods of time huskies are smart dogs eager to please and highly food motivated so get started with the nilf with her asap and go from there unfortunately its in the breed to pull so training them to not pull on leash is challenging but the breed needs daily exercise so if you're not walking her regularly its only going to make it worse start making her sit for treats take her for a walk with a treat bag and everytime she starts pulling stop walking make her come back towards you allowing the leash to relax then reward her with a treat after she has sat and then continue with the walk eventually she will get that when the leash is relaxed not taut that walks will proceed now with that said remember that she will always be inclined to pull some pull like crazy the first mins of the walk then relax all of them seem to stop pulling when they're heading back home but huskies need hr out the yard daily to meet their exercise needs more if possible when they are young and full of energy and most husky owners agree 'the only good husky is a tired one' see if you can find a trainer in your area with husky experience its an investment worth making best of luck Obedience training Dog Siberian Husky Dog agility The Contender (television series) Falconry Hamster Fancy rat Milton H.
