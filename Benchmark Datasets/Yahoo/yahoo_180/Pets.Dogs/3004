how do i train my dog to speak or bark at something hmm interesting question i guess step one would be to teach it to bark on command this would probably entail your taking it and saying something like bark and then barking yourself and doing this ad infinitum until it figures out to bark back then refine it until it just barks when you say bark then you would have to introduce the something preferably it's something you can easily repeat as opposed to say the mailman coming or a robber for instance a car pulling into the driveway you'll need someone else to help obviously when the dog sees it get him to bark then and only then and reward it with a soft chew treat like a bite sized part of a hot dog but if you want it to bark at stuff that doesn't happen much it'll be very difficult also it'll have to be something the dog recognizes things like arrivals people cars deliveries whatever and events sounds like phone ringing are trainable so would stuff like smoke in the house etc stuff like the swimming pool water is too low won't work because the dog has no point of reference Dog training Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic incident reduction Obedience training Shaggy dog story Modem Swimming pool Reservoir Dogs Russian joke G-Man (Half-Life) Scrooge McDuck Volleyball Little Britain Crate training I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Jam (TV series) Tag Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man The Inside Swimming Shit The Apprentice 2 Kim Possible Speech synthesis Wheel of Fortune Mojave people Textile manufacturing Rich Mullins Hamster Mixed-breed dog Brian Griffin Time Out of Mind Sin City Sauna Illegal drug trade Piccolo Junior Saga Police dog Dog show Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 CPU cache Fancy rat Snooker Tom Waits Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Water polo Speech recognition David Hume Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Hearing impairment Dog agility Social rule Gag (BDSM) Campfire Theory of conduct Dualism (philosophy of mind) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Manual transmission Mickey Mouse Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Doomtown Black Pete Hiberno-English Non-native pronunciations of English Theodicy Professional wrestling holds Goodness and value theory Drag racing Wood Hogan's Heroes Fossil fuel power plant Winning Streak Ludwig Wittgenstein Diving Causality Scientology beliefs and practices Columbo Indian English Toilet humour Professional wrestling match types Equine conformation Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle Blood (computer game) English grammar Spanish verbs Philosophy of language The Sims 2: Nightlife Altruism You Don't Know Jack Survival skills Trapped in the Closet Avenue Q Beethoven (film) Carl Barks The Flintstones Microeconomics Tenshinhan
