how do i find out what happened to my dog in the past to make him so nervous all the time i have a shiba inu about years old ever since we got him he only lets me and my mom and my best friend pet him my dad cant touch him and no one else can every night he starts trembling like crazy he s water and wont walk in the rain hes friendly and hardly barks and never bites but he wont get near people only me my mom and my best friend we got him at the pound when he was almost i really wanna find out wat happened to him to make him so nervous any ideas well it's impossible for a dog pound to keep track of every dog they may take a history of the dog but that's usually words or less sorry but i don't think the pound can or will help you and i am certain that whoever abused that dog before you adopted him will not come forward it's a shame to see a dog who's afraid of things and it's heartbreaking to watch them suffer sometimes the things that humans want to do reach out to them hug them pat them on the head just seems to make things worse the first step is to learn about dog body language and adapt your own behavior so that the dog can learn to relax around you http www diamondsintheruff com bodylang html some of those pictures will look very familiar to you http www canis no rugaas is a discussion and information list for more about dog body language try to get your dad to work with you have him get low you should too and just stay still give him a bunch of stinky dog treats chicken salmon cheese steak and have him just toss them around bit by bit for the dog to take getting low to the ground is the thing you can do to be nonthreatening to a dog also not staring at them in the eyeballs or reaching grabbing at them with your hands looming over them and swooping down on them is another big no no and will likely send your dog back a few steps never force your dog to interact with people this is a fear biter in the making if you see that the dog is friendly that's great but keep in mind that every person who sees the dog does not have to get all over him that's your job to prevent good luck Dog training Shaggy dog story Joke Gray Wolf Dog The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Milton H.
