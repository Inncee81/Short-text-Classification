wolves ok so i have been insterested in wolves since i was little i would do pretty much anything to get one i have no idea where to get one could anyone help me find some in nj has anyone ever owned a hybrid or full out wolf that would know any things that i dont already know i knew a woman who had a hybrid and she said wolves are not for everyone she had to have a special license to own it it is considered a wild animal and its temperament can't be compared to a domesticated canine it was mentioned in news stories in my area how one woman owned three she kept them penned up and treated them very well her neighbors were leery about them being in the neighborhood and rightfully so because she was found in the pen mauled to death they were feeding on her wolves and wolf hybrids are high strung around people they don't know there is a romance to owning a wolf and i feel that it should be something in the mind only these are animals that need room to move and patience if you can't be with the animal for the duration of its lifetime and if you don't have the resources to give this animal the care it needs don't acquire one you will do nature a great disservice Dog Domestication Animal rights Gray Wolf Hybrid Horse Saki RuneScape quests Theory of conduct Dingo Manga White Wolf, Inc.
