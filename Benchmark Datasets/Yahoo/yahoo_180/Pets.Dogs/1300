why does my parents' old dog bark incessantly she's a year old medium sized mutt for the past several years she's been in the habit of barking non stop for literally hours at a time it's not a piercing yelp or anything suggesting pain it's just a monotonous steady bark with maybe a second or two between each one what's worse is that she doesn't seem to be telling us anything we always try to give her attention water food treats we try to get her outside but she's never interested in any of it could it be dementia no one knows what to do about it thanks yeah the vet who i'm not a fan of has repeatedly dismissed the problem he's like and well past retirement age my parents have taken their dogs to him for years and won't hear of changing who knows why her vitals are very good extremely good for a dog her age it's interesting that some have mentioned blindness and deafness she has very bad cataracts and her hearing is not very keen she can still see and hear to a very limited extent at it could very well be dementia have you discussed the problem with her vet also in the past few years have there been any additions to the house such as an air purifier or electronic bug repeller some of them make a high pitched sound that the dog might be hearing in any event i would have her checked by the vet Hearing impairment Milton H.
