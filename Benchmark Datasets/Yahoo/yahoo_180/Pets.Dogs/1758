i want a puppy we have children between my husband and i and all of them want a house puppy i say puppy because i would prefer a smaller dog to be in the house so it doesn't really have to be a puppy per say just a smaller breed of dog the reason for not getting a dog before was because we lived in a really small house and i didn't feel there was room for one more living being now we've moved into a huge house with a huge back yard and i feel like it's time to get a pet i don't want a cat because i just got a house full of furniture and i don't want it sharpening it's claws on it my husband doesn't want a dog because he says the house will smell of pee and poop but my dad kennel trains all of his dogs and they are all house trained in a matter of days i guess my question is what is a good smaller bred dog that is good with children and smart enough to house train quickly i should mention i don't have small children they're all over the age of affenpinscher a spunky pal these dogs
