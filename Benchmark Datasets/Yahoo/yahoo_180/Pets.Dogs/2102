maggots in puppy's feces yeah its gross but i need to know ok well it was degrees today so i waited until just a few minutes ago to clean off my back porch where my puppy sleeps at night she always leaves me a couple surprises everyday newho as i was cleaning up her messes i noticed that there were maggots in her surprises now i know that it wasn't tapeworm or roundworm because i just took her to the vet last month to get dewormed i'm positive it was maggots i was reading somewhere that especially in the hot summer flies get around feces and lay eggs that produce maggots that will hatch very quickly if it is hot outside is this correct and if so should i really have anything to worry about as long as i cleaned it all up and made sure that there wasn't anything crawling around on my porch or should i take her to the vet once again and consult him with this problem has anyone out there ever seen this with their pets who sleep outside let me know ty mucho d ok reading answers and i saw something i needed to verify yeah i specifically treated my pup for tapeworms and hookworms because the vet tested her and saw that she had them and gave me two medications for her i was given two doses of the tapeworm medicene and three of the hookworm medicene that have all been completed plus i just took her to the vet today for her parvo shot and rabies shot and they tested her stool once again and she was clean of everything so yeah mister and misses you know who you are she does not have worms i'm pretty sure it was maggots i'd guess it is maggots tapeworms don't live long outside the dog so they would just look like pieces of rice by the next day i recently moved to texas and have this same problem if i don't pick up quickly even overnight and i find large numbers of maggots in the dog poop it's no concern other than to be sure the maggots don't get on the dog and that you clean up your porch well might want to pour some bleach on the porch to be sure to kill all the maggots Pet skunk Dog Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Ascariasis Hookworm Guinea pig Dog training Housefly Skinny Puppy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Fecal incontinence Apollo 8 Jon Secada Shit Piccolo Junior Saga Cestoda RuneScape quests Ferret Hymenolepiasis The Ashlee Simpson Show Coprophagia Roundworm Jackass: The Movie Fly Cliff Richard Folic acid Diphyllobothriasis Flea Kodocha GED Heartworm Intestinal parasite Russian joke Social rule EastEnders Unclean animals Tsetse fly Mattress Lisa the Vegetarian Whipworm Spidey Super Stories Ben Johnson (athlete) Surveillance Kurt Cobain Theory of conduct AFI 100 Years series Diarrhea Bart chalkboard gags Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Pet Sounds Echinococcosis Pretty Good Privacy Baylisascaris Microchip implant (animal) StarCraft Episode VI Pitaten Blood Simple Road Rovers Feces Fancy rat Sin City 2000 Australian Grand Prix Conspiracy (TNG episode) Menstrual cup 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Eddie Guerrero I Want to Hold Your Hand Narcolepsy Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Maggot therapy Jumpstart 3rd Grade Socialization The Amber Spyglass A Milhouse Divided Nile crocodile Game show Second Battle of the Atlantic The Inside Skinny Dip Cysticercosis Hip hop collaborations Beethoven (film) Scooby-Doo Cat Jam (TV series) Textile manufacturing Ocean's Twelve The Subtle Knife Phoebe Buffay's songs Bat Beetle in an Anthill
