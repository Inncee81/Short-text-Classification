my new year old great dane is scared of everything any good tips besides loads of love and time your dane is not fully grown yet and they go through phases as they grow do not reward the behavior act as if nothing is wrong and continue to expose him to things he will follow your lead patience will prevail i would also try to spend more time socializing him and introducing him to things and calmly telling him it's okay with a lot of love he will start to feel secure with you around and trust you completely then he will learn not to be afraid he's a year old and you say he's new do you have any idea how he was raised it he's severely afraid it could be from something his previous owners did or exposed him to time is on your side and by working with him you won't have a year old dog with fear aggression great danes aren't known for their aggression just their size is intimidating lol i had one years ago and he was a true marmaduke so much fun to watch and he thought he was a lap dog lol Milton H.
