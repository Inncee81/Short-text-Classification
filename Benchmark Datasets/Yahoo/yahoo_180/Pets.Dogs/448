whoa come command i have a puppy brittnay spaniel and he is roughly months old i have been working with him since i got him and he refuses to learn the command whoa and come i have read a book on it and everything and i work with hime every day so it's not like i'm missing out on sessions i would like to avoid giving him treats because he does not get enough exercise to work off the amount of treats i would give him because i work with him every day i do exercise with him walking running ect any ideas thanks he is a hunting dog for upland birds so he needs to listen to me always i have a brittany too that's cool that you'll be able to let him hunt my dog has the instincts but he never had the chance to do any real hunting well he's still a puppy at months so you want to be gentle i always found food difficult to train with so a lot of times i used just praise and my brittany always responded to it well my brittany is one of the most food obsessed dogs i know so i did use food i'd suggest you portion out his food in the morning and then use pieces of kibble to train him that way he won't get fat eating too much extra food it's difficult to say without knowing more about your specific situation i haven't read a lot of gun dog books but i did read one called urban gundogs which i thought was excellent even if you don't live in the city if you do though it's a must have provides some great tips on training a hunting dog while living in the city it deals with birddog commands like whoa which aren't really found too many other places i'd highly recommend it excellent resource for the new owner of a working birddog one thing i noticed about my brittany is that he's very sensitive i trained him we competed in akc obedience with an obedience club i'd definitely say if you take a class be choosy of your instructors and classes don't get one that has harsh old fashioned methods and if you must correct start very gently good luck p s a bit of advice if you've never owned a britt one thing everyone told me was that they calmed down and stopped being so wild at years old definitely still crazy but definitely calmed down at Dog training Dog Obedience training Dog agility Golden Retriever Social rule Housebreaking Labrador Retriever Shetland Sheepdog Pet skunk German Shepherd Dog Mixed-breed dog Ferret Gun dog Hamster Teen Girl Squad Fecal incontinence Cat Fox hunting Theory of conduct Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Brittany (dog) Socialization Basset Hound Royal Assent Milton H.
