what happened to my dog my dog got sick yesterday a female doberman yrs old took her to the vet today said her stomach was turned around and she had a fever of extremly dehydrated she died an hour later is this a common thing she was healthy all her life and seemed happy until yesterday when she seemed to fade away thank you all for your help this is a condition called bloat but medically it is referred to as gastric dilation volvulus gdv the symptoms of bloat are dry heaves depression and restlessness some people believe that dogs who get bloat eat primarily dry kibble and then drink too much water others link the condition to over excitement after eating although these may be causes bloat can also appear for no reason this condition almost always occurs in deep chested dogs considered to be medium to large breeds some of the more commonly affected breeds besides the doberman include great danes irish setters german shepherds and afghan hounds the reason one can lose a dog so quickly to bloat is this when the stomach is distended with air it puts pressure on the large veins in the abdomen that carry blood back to the heart without quick and proper return of blood the output of blood from the heart is diminished and the tissues are deprived of blood and oxygen the dog often goes into shock if blood supply is not restored quickly the wall of the stomach begins to die and it may rupture if that occurs the spleen's blood supply will also be impaired the spleen is attached to the stomach wall and shares some large blood vessels when the stomach twists the spleen is also rotated to an abnormal position and its vessels are compressed digestion stops this results in the accumulation of toxins the medical emergency escalates from there i am so very sorry you lost your girl to bloat but you had awesome years with her she knew you loved her and the depth of that love was clearly understood at the end i lost my one dobergirl at to wobblers its never enough time but i made sure each of the days i had with her were filled with laughter love and yes treats i'm sure you did the same thing no dog could ask for more Bloat Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Myocardial infarction Traumatic brain injury First aid Pneumonia Stroke Dehydration Gastroparesis Aortic dissection Vomiting Dog Sickle-cell disease Cirrhosis Bloating Decompression sickness Shock Spleen Atherosclerosis Intracranial pressure Urinary incontinence Diabetes mellitus Drowning Atrial septal defect Anemia Circulatory system Blood pressure Cardiac arrhythmia Coronary heart disease Turner syndrome Medicine Obstetrics Great Dane Insulin Atheroma Childbirth Diabetic neuropathy Equine conformation Diarrhea Angina Spider Blood vessel Chlorpromazine Fecal incontinence Leukemia Breastfeeding Cholera Lymphatic system Tourniquet Adjustable gastric band Lung Death Heart Cancer Smooth Collie German Shepherd Dog Blood Dialysis Red blood cell Paracetamol Cephalic disorder Volleyball Penis Wood Mitral regurgitation Puberty Tooth enamel Asthma Aneurysm Ulcerative colitis Prostate cancer Cardiac stress test Carbon dioxide Bleeding Hearing impairment Hemorrhagic stroke Atrial fibrillation Breathing gas Abdomen Miscarriage Scuba set Autonomic nervous system Acne Paget's disease of bone Ventricular fibrillation Sewage treatment Rabies
