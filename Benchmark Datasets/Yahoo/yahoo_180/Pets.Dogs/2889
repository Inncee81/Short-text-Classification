i'm so upset my year old lab died today we had to get him put to sleep he had an agressive tumour in his throat today i had to take him to my vet to be put to sleep and he died in my arms i can't stop crying my poor kids are scared he was such a good friend he slept on our bed with us i miss him so much sorry it's not a question i'm so sorry i know how much it hurts it's not like losing a member of the family it is losing a member of the family i hope that in time you can take some comfort in knowing that you gave him a wonderful life and lots of love and that when the end came you did what you had to do to make his passing as comfortable as possible i'm sorry for your children too it's very hard for kids also to lose a pet cry all you want and think about your boy because at least you'll always have your memories of him everyone here will be thinking of you good luck xxx Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Fairly OddParents Sin City Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kodocha About a Boy The Inside Friends EastEnders The Shining (film) Humphrey Bogart The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Time Out of Mind Jon Secada Rich Mullins One Tree Hill (TV series) Lisa the Vegetarian Johnny Appleseed Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cliff Richard The Contender (television series) W.I.T.C.H.
