question about canidae canned dog food my weimaraner eats canidae dry dog food except once a day he gets a half a can of canidae canned dog food that little bit of canned dog food has always been one of the highlights of his day as soon as he sees the can he is literally slobbering all over the floor he chows it down really fast today when he ran over to his bowl he stopped and sniffed it and jumped back i looked really closely to see if there were maggots or ants or something then i sniffed the food smelled fine looked fine i can't even get his mouth pried open to stick some in there which is probably the best i can't figure it out i thought maybe something was wrong with his mouth so i got a doggie treat and he gobbled that right down then i put another treat on top of that canned stuff in his bowl and he very carefully plucked it off with his teeth and ate it but won't touch the dogfood what do you suppose could be wrong all right i just managed to get some in his mouth and he spit it out on the floor in a hurry you can tell her really wants it though he's drooling and staring at it and licking his lips ears perked up i think i'm going to throw out all the canned dog food i have just in case but i'd still like to know what could be wrong it is possible that the seal had been broken on that particular can and that it wasn't good throw it away and use a fesh can sometimes in transit or at the store a can gets dropped or what have you and even though it appears fine it has an air leak that's not detectable i also feed canidae wet dry and had this happen to me before i've seen it happen to other canned pet foods and also to canned human foods Dog Cat Shaggy dog story Garfield Domestic rabbit Dog food Gray Wolf Happy Tree Friends Aerial (dance move) Hamster Obedience training Humphrey Bogart Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dog training Piccolo Junior Saga Theory of conduct Fancy rat Shark Hot dog Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Tlingit Vampire 2000 Australian Grand Prix Professional wrestling match types Felis sapiens Reservoir Dogs English cricket team Indian Oil Cup 2005 Oral sex Teen Girl Squad Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Friends Social rule Iron Bowl Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Guinea pig Bong Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Sin City Goofy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Diving Taboo food and drink Tobacco Chopsticks Homer Simpson Naruto jutsu Lycanthropy American Alligator Kitchen Super Bowl XXI Mario American Black Bear Tag Pittsburgh Steelers Chili con carne Food preservation Professional wrestling throws Fast bowling Tofu Tasmanian Devil Rabies Spidey Super Stories Skateboarding trick Apple Late Night with Conan O'Brien The Inside Coffee Carnivora West Indian cricket team Textile manufacturing The Parting of the Ways Bowl Championship Series Radiohead The Price Is Right Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cannabis cultivation Professional wrestling holds Gag (BDSM) Poker jargon Laws of cricket Dairy Ant Chocolate Volleyball Elephant History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Insect Rocko's Modern Life Phoebe Buffay's songs Debugging Discworld gods The Legend of Zelda series enemies Coconut crab Rose (Doctor Who) 24 Hours of Le Mans
