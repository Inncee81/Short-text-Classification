will my dog ever trust me again i accidentally injured my month old puppy as he was trying to pass through a doorway and i attempted to block him he ended up getting slightly hurt he was very upset afterwards but now he seems to be completely back to normal i called the emergency vet and my own vet i'm worried now that he'll be cautious around me for fear that it will happen again he's very attached to me and i'm scared that now our bond may have been compromised yes your dog will trust you again just give him some time again it was an accident and you did not mean it and you called the vet so relaxed and tell your dog that you are sorry about that and you love him even more and you will not do that again your dog will trust you again good luck Housebreaking Dog Social rule Shaggy dog story Philip J.
