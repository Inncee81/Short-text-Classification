new puppy hello everybody this saturday i'm bringing home a new blue merle pomeranian puppy i am very excited about it but actually kind of nervous we recently lost our dog dolly about a month ago and our other dog honey she's an year old lab has been quite depressed since then i basically thought it would be best for everyone if we had a new puppy because blue merle poms are so expensive i offered to split the price with my dad even though he is buying the dog for me i'm so when i move out the dog is coming with me as weird as it might sound i'm nervous the dog might not like me as much as i'm going to like him i'm a dog groomer and i watch how excited dogs get when their owners come to pick them up after their grooming what can i do to make the dog love me and enjoy being my dog thank you the time i spend with dogs at work and the love i get from them isn't hardly the same thing i've been a groomer for years and my dogs love me more than anything just bring home that baby and as soon as he settles down a bit on day put him on a grooming table or your washing machine and give him a nice quick layer by layer brushout just like you will do to him for the next years of his life you know how our most often customer dogs behave the best on the table it's because they are groomed to death and they know how to be good to get it done so they can get home sooner those once a weekers or every weekers could practically groom themselves right so will your pom be that way so long as you make him a once a weeker too Dog training Dog Shaggy dog story Shetland Sheepdog Housebreaking Characters in the Smurfs Pomeranian (dog) Skinny Puppy Social rule Neighbours Keeshond Episodes of Lost (Season 1) W.
