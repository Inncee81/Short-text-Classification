raw dog food diet hello to start i have a month old pitbull her name is domino for her visual traits i feed her good and walk her daily times or more around the block minutes well actully i kinda lied about feeding her good i feed her that dry stuff puppy chow mixed with pedigree wet food i want to feed her better who doest want a good meal now days exspecially in america lol i been reading alot about raw food but dont understand it could you give me a list of raw food that is good for dogs how much is it ok for a month old how often do you feed the raw food and how do you prep it also can you tell me the good side about raw food i want my dog to be very healthy and muscular also have some meat on her and then the down side about raw meat thanks alot hey there the sooner you get her off the puppy chow the better but i see that you understand that raw food should never be fed in combination with kibble kibble is digested much more slowly than raw and will cause major stomach drama for a dog that's fed both if i must feed kibble to my dogs i will fast them skip a meal after that kibble meal there are a lot of extremely opinionated raw food groups online quite a few here in yahoo if you can get past the ranting and raving they have some very good suggestions and things to look out for i try to only feed natural organically raised meats the chicken wings that constitute the bulk of my dogs' diet are organic and humanely raised do the best you can you'll see a big difference in the health of your dogs' teeth when feeding raw this is a great benefit you won't have to worry about decay also their poop is smaller and doesn't smell quite so much the downside is having a freezer stuffed full of animal parts having to shop a little more than if you were just feeding kibble and having the salmonella conversation with people again and again the upside very healthy dogs who have great teeth i am very happy that i switched Dog Dog food Egg (food) Domestic rabbit Cat Breastfeeding Livestock Chicken Guinea pig Milk Food Fancy rat Raw food diet Vitamin C Stomach cancer Tooth Veganism Hamster Domesticated turkey Vegetarianism Factory farming Taboo food and drink Cuisine of Denmark Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Cuisine of Malaysia Brown Bear Omega-3 fatty acid Dairy Gray Wolf Organic farming RuneScape quests Salmon Cat food Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Healthy eating Ferret Dog training Foodborne illness Albatross Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hamburger McDonald's Japanese cuisine In-N-Out Burger Ramen Animal rights Sewage treatment American Chinese cuisine Capercaillie Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Laos Garfield Gastroparesis Cuisine of the Philippines Peruvian cuisine Kangaroo Dietary fiber Bee Kashrut Pig Vermicompost Prostate cancer Chocolate Fugu Hypoglycemia Super Size Me Labrador Retriever Korean cuisine 101 Dalmatians: The Series Natural Hygiene Offal Dieting Soybean Vegetarianism and religion Cheese Wraith (Stargate) Dim sum Agriculture Elephant French fries MRE Organic food Vomiting Earthworm Tlingit Genetically modified food Kodocha Compost Bengali cuisine Peanut Folic acid Kebab
