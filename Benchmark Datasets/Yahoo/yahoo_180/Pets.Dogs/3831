long question i think the vet hurt my dog any vets out there anyone with help last tuesday i was gone for about mins when i came home i saw the left side of my dog's cheek was really swollen it' s very near his eye like high on his cheekbone i figured he got stung by a bee as he had been outside i have a doggie door while i was away i gave him doses of benadryl but the next morning it was worse i took him to the vet clinic with volunteer vets to help cost down anyhow she said he had a fever was concerned that swelling could be infection from something in his gum but gums looked good she took a needle to the 'lump' to see if there was any pus there wasn't she gave him a cortisone shot gave me some pain meds antibiotics told me to bring him back if it didn't get better brought him back friday different vet she thought the same as first but instead of a needle she took shears and dug into the lump he is way worse the swelling is so bad now he can't open his eye should i take him to a new vet there's a sore where she dug http viewmorepics myspace com index cfm fuseaction viewimage friendid albumid imageid this is a pic i took of him yesterday not a very good one though it's much worse today with drainage hope this link works when in doubt get a second opinion it never hurts the procedures you said they did are common they have been done at every practice that i have been at and worked for i would say that it had an allergic reaction which is normally okay after benadryl and or cortizone but if it continues to get worse they may be an infection just because of how they pried with it get another opinion Allergy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Common cold Group A streptococcal infection Intravenous therapy Pneumonia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Body piercing Herpes simplex virus Guinea pig Tattoo Syphilis Breast cancer Radiation therapy Insulin Asthma Hip fracture Conjunctivitis Smallpox Multiple sclerosis Infectious mononucleosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Al-Razi Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Endocarditis Ehrlichiosis Veterinarian Fancy rat Gonorrhoea Abscess Mastoiditis AIDS Babe Ruth Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Cephalexin Cellulitis Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Shaggy dog story Bone marrow transplant Tuberculosis Immunosuppressive drug Boil Paul Is Dead Hip hop rivalries Chlorpromazine Psoriasis Pharyngitis Prostate cancer 1957 World Series Gout EastEnders Chiropractic Theory of conduct Ebola Sin City Carpal tunnel syndrome Futurama (TV series - season 5) Dexamethasone Kawasaki disease Skinny Puppy Antibiotic Hay fever Domestic rabbit Antidepressant Traumatic incident reduction Black Death Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Eczema Acne Animal testing Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Obstetrics Poliomyelitis Rheumatoid arthritis Humphrey Bogart Needle aspiration biopsy 2000 Australian Grand Prix Acute pancreatitis Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Earring Cancer Sandy Koufax Dialysis Diabetes mellitus One Tree Hill (TV series) Lethal injection Cindy Sheehan First aid Sydney Riot of 1879 Cocaine Aspergillosis The Inside Reaction to Darwin's theory Tarantula Virus Lymphogranuloma venereum Operation Market Garden Plame affair timeline
