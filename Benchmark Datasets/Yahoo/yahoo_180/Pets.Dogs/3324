is this okay to do my dog falls asleep in the kitchen alot and im usually on my laptop in the living room or watching tv i usually take him to his crate and put him inside he continues to sleep on his comfy bed rather than the cold marble i always thought this was a good idea because i was putting him in a quieter place so he could sleep easier is this okay it's okay in the fact that it makes you feel better but as far as the dog is concerned that cold marble floor feels real nice depending on how hairy your dog is it might really be trying to cool down mine do prefer the cool hard floor over the fluffy bed when it's warm outside i'm sure that when the dog is ready for the comfy bed it knows where to find it Futurama (TV series - season 5) Mattress Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Care Bears Oplan Bojinka Kitchen Out-of-body experience Dog training RuneScape quests The Shining (film) Avenue Q Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sento Buckingham Palace Brewery Professional wrestling match types Sleeping Murder Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kill Bill Ed, Edd n Eddy Dog The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Abbey The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Hogwarts Floor Directory Garfield Planet of the Daleks Strap-on dildo Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Lucid dreaming The Catcher in the Rye Theory of conduct Mathematician Apollo 8 Dormitory Sudden infant death syndrome Co-sleeping The Amber Spyglass Sleeping car Hamster Thermoregulation Grace Cossington Smith Pliocene Reservoir Dogs Nuclear reactor Nuclear power Sleep Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Blankets (graphic novel) Conspiracy (TNG episode) Diving suit 2005 Iditarod Warm-blooded Textile manufacturing Insomnia The Rutles Casting Forty-seven Ronin Cheating in poker Pug Aerial (dance move) Paul Is Dead The Star Wars Holiday Special Phaedo Medieval hunting Homer's Enemy Cat Pebble bed reactor Sundial Sampling (music) Max Payne Xanadu House Sauna Plastic EastEnders Dundas Square Chatsworth House Vermicompost Living with Michael Jackson Trapped in the Closet Crate training 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Blood (computer game) HVAC English grammar Socrates Cuisine of Denmark Milton H.
