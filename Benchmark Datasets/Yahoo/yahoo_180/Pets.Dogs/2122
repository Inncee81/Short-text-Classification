doggie question woof i want to buy a puppy from a local shelter but i really dont want to spend lots of money so i was wondering what shelter would provide me with a healthy dog de wormed spayed nuetered and has his vaccinations for a small price i heard that the local shelter l a county animal care control agoura has dogs for so here are my questions is there a place in la that has dogs for a cheaper price but yes i know that is a very good price are the dogs healthy at l a county animal care control agoura and are they really spayed nuetered have vaccinations once u adopt a dog does at l a county animal care control agoura do they give u like a leash doggie treats ect do they have yorkies or maltese at l a county animal care control agoura oh and here are some x tra questions how long do yorkies or maltese live what kind of food should i feed a maltese or a yorkie thanks glenda i wanted to ask u where is that shelter located thanks if you want a cheap pet i do not recommend a dog in the first months you have the puppy you will likely spend between on various things i'll give you a run down of the estimated costs i've spent on my healthy puppy in the past months that i've had her initial supplies crate grooming needs toys etc puppy wellness exam vaccinations booster shots spay microchip food treats training classes flea preventative yr heart worm preventative yr all in all i've probably spent well over in these first months of owning her and i think that's a low estimate also my puppy has been healthy if you puppy has something come up and needs extra veterinary attention that will be more money as well here is an article from the akc about a survey on the costs of dog ownership http www akc org pdfs press center costs of dog ownership pdf small breeds live on average years on choosing a dog food read the ingredients on the food you buy go with a high quality dog food or in your case the puppy food counterpart of the brand you choose a grain should not be in the first couple ingredients ingredient corn and such are mainly fillers dogs don't digest it well avoid foods that have a lot of by products listed here is an article about byproducts http www

http www dogfoodanalysis com dog food reviews i recommend only feeding foods rated or stars anything stars or less i would stay away from stay away from grocery stores brands they are low quality foods chalk full of fillers preservatives dyes etc grocery store foods are those like beneful old roy alpo pedigree purina etc beware premium foods premium does not mean good nutritionally and is not a nutritionally high quality food it has the same types of ingredients as grocery store foods just a bit better quality of those not so good ingredients premium foods are those like iams eukanuba science diet etc another thing to be wary of a lot of vets will recommend what they sell in their office they get profit from the brands they keep on their shelves that's why they push it truth is vet schools don't focus a lot on nutrition it's not saying that a vet is a bad vet because he recommends those foods a lot of vets just are told this is good food so they pass the message along without proper nutrition knowledge also some dog food brands like hills support vet schools so vets have heard of it from the time they start college which makes them think it's good as well it may seem like the initial cost of the better food is more expensive but it really isn't in the long run right now you're feeding your dog fillers your dog eats more to try to get the nutrition it needs and most of the food just passes right on through by feeding better food your dog will eat less and poop less so less cleanup for you also it will make your animals healthier so you save money on vet bills in the long run when switching foods do it gradually i do this over about a two week timespan food a food b food a food b food a food b food a Hamster Cat Guinea pig Cat food Dog training Fancy rat Wal-Mart
