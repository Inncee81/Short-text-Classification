i'm going to buy a pug puppy should i get a boy pup or a girl pup no i do not plan on breeding i do not own a pug but i do have to disagree with most of the previous answers that said that girls are more loving and less aggressive than males i talked to a lot of people before i got my dog a french bulldog everyone i spoke to told me that girls tend to be more bossy bitchy and independent than the boys after owning cats all my life i know this is true for cats as well our boy is very sweet and loving but what you really should do is meet the puppies before you take one home play with them and see if a particular puppy seems to bond with you your relationship with your puppy is much more important than the sex of your puppy you might think you want a girl but once you meet the pups a little boy could steal your heart Dog One Tree Hill (TV series) American Pit Bull Terrier Gray Wolf Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Scooby-Doo Kodocha Beethoven (film) Mixed-breed dog Our Gang Golden Retriever Pug Hamster Bulldog Little Britain Snoopy Guinea pig Socialization Smallville (Season 4) Friends Zoophilia Trailer Park Boys The Smoking Room Ranma __ characters Girly Nintendogs Garfield The Bash Street Kids Pete the Pup About a Boy Housebreaking Care Bears Great Teacher Onizuka Philosophy of language Skinny Puppy Pit bull Paranoia Agent Sin City Neighbours Marilyn Monroe Sinfest Dog breed Homosexuality and Christianity Rugrats Bisexuality Billboard Hot 100 Wolfrider Puppy mill Black Pete W.I.T.C.H.
