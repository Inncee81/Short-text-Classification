does anyone have a dog that licks his paws til they are raw in several spots what can we do to stop him we have taken him to the vet twice for it they have advised to keep him on benedryl and gave him steroids which cleared it up the benedryl is beginning to not work any longer and once the steroids were gone he began licking again i know you can't keep a dog on steroids for the rest of his life the dog collar is not an option he is an inside dog with a dog door to get in out during the day since we both work and i can't keep him outside during the day the temp today was i have a dog that was severely allergic for a long time and we never knew what was wrong with him he woudl scratch his ears until they bled and he frequently had bad ear infections eventually after many trips to the vet and a huge vet bill we found out he had a serious allergy you can put creams put them on medication to remove the allergic reaction but it doesn't prevent the problem from occurring rather it is a cure or remedy it sounds like your dog has a major allergy we put our dog on special feed for dogs wtih allergies and within a few days his allergies cleared up of course he still had some creams and medicine to take for the ears to clear up but we have nto had any problems since i would suggest with the vet testing for allergens or suggest eating special food for dogs with allergies the downside is no more scraps or other bits to eat they can only eat their own food to prvent teh allergy coming back i woudl also suggest vitamin e which you can buy in pharmacy's it's basically a capsule helps all kinds of skin to heal and you just cut the capsule and spread a generous amount on the paws perhaps when you're at home your dog can be kept indoors and with a cone on the other option is to bandage their four paws securely to prevent them licking the dog really has to stop licking the paws have medication cream vit e administered and allow the paws to heal up plus new feed in order for him to stop it once the irritation has subsided he will probably stop licking anyways really try the dog feed option it might work Eczema Asthma Cat Psoriasis Hay fever Chronic fatigue syndrome Common cold Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Acne Food allergy Conjunctivitis Tattoo First aid Fecal incontinence Crohn's disease Prostate cancer Dog Scar Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Insulin Peanut Medicine Tocopherol Breastfeeding Folic acid Medical prescription Vitamin C Coeliac disease Herpes simplex virus Dog training Food Alcoholics Anonymous Homeopathy Paget's disease of bone Garlic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diarrhea Garfield Charles Darwin's illness Scabies Pharmacology Livestock Dairy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Wound Cancer Housebreaking Bleeding Radiation therapy Multiple sclerosis Multiple chemical sensitivity Dialysis Candidiasis Aloe Carpal tunnel syndrome Syphilis Glucocorticoid M__ni__re___s disease Shaggy dog story Hamster Hot dog Ulcerative colitis A Day in the Life Hyperglycemia Biblical scientific foresight Nut (fruit) Yarrow Cephalexin 1957 World Series Lupus erythematosus Aspergillosis Patent medicine Ayurveda Mouth ulcer Medical cannabis Traumatic brain injury Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Rabies Endometriosis Gout Urticaria Otitis externa Docking Immunoglobulin E Coprophagia
