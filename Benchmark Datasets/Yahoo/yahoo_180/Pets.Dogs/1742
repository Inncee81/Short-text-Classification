my dog is aggressive okay what's the best way to describe petey he's very loving and gentle around children any child for that matter he gives lots of slobbery kisses and hugs he gets along well with strangers when it comes to small dogs that bark and yap at him he doesn't seem to mind he likes to chase them and lick them but when it comes to bigger dogs he's always aggressive dogs his size or larger he growls and shows his teeth he never wags his tail in a playful manner like he normally does with smaller dogs why is he like this in the beginning it was just him now i have a female pitbull who is perfect she doesn't mind any other dogs small or large she and petey get along great but any other dog that comes into the mix he's so aggressive and mean what can i do to control that he's been in obedience classes twice socialized in both and for awhile it seemed to be working but now he's just so overly aggressive i can't take him anywhere i would like to take both dogs to the bark park or petsmart but now it's gotten to where i only take the female out with me to the park or petsmart petey is just out right mean it's very misleading because he is very nice and loving at home oh i apologize i should have mentioned more about petey he's years old neutered he's a boxer pitbull mix his buddy jolee a female pitbull purebred is years old and spayed neutered also important to note both dogs are crated for half the day while i'm at work on occasion one will come to work with me neither of the two are left alone together mainly for safety reasons i don't know when they will snap on each other though they never have jolee isn't playful she keeps to herself petey loves to play and he's all over the place all the time i can't take him to the park and i want to be able to train him not to be aggressive around other dogs first off are peteys hackles up if so then he is acting out of fear you didn't give me an age of petey either but if his hackles are up then he is unsure of the situation when this happens you bend over but not over the top of petey and with one arm cradle him about the chest and with your other hand stroke him slowly but firmly from head to toe and tell him quietly shhhhh it's ok he learns two things his alpha is not alarmed so no need to worry his alpha will fight his battles so no need to get upset unless you his alpha shows the need for alarm dogs are pack animals and look to the alpha to see the reaction they need to take so if you are nervous thinking peteys gonna bark n growl well he can feel your uneasiness in the situation so he reacts we have to do this to for dogs in training all the time is not unusual our dogs have to learn to trial with another dog on the field during the obedience stage or perhaps out waiting during the tracking good luck with petey h o t dog handler owner trainer of gsd's member u s a a w d f Dog Gray Wolf Cat Obedience training Schutzhund Professional wrestling holds German Shepherd Dog Housebreaking Shaggy dog story The Price Is Right Pit bull Garfield Fast bowling The Smoking Room Ranma __ characters Social rule Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Care Bears Poker jargon Kim Possible Time Out of Mind Ferret Domestic rabbit Shetland Sheepdog Keeshond Kodocha Late Night with Conan O'Brien Mixed-breed dog Dog show Characters of Naruto Buddy Guy The Death Gate Cycle Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pitaten Golden Retriever Milton H.
