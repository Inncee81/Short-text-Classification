i'm having such a hard time deciding dog food quesion i'm and get bucks a month i have dogs a black lab mix lbs and a husky chow pit mix lbs my question is should i feed them solid gold barking at the moon which is grain free and one of the best it has a star rating http www dogfoodanalysis com dog food reviews showproduct php product cat all or should i just feed them something i can afford better like chicken soup which has a star rating http www dogfoodanalysis com dog food reviews showproduct php product cat all i also feed them some raw chicken twice a week sunday's and wednesdays i hate the smell of the solid gold it smells like horrible fish fish bait or something and then my dog's breath and turds smell like it my real question is will feeding my dog a food with a few grains in it really kill him sooner or what i mean it couldn't be that bad right is solid gold really that much better what should i go with and please don't reccommend canidae or any other kinds of food b c the only high quality foods we have around here are chicken soup solid gold and wellness the store just started selling wellness a couple weeks ago well it's better than cs but also more expensive but not as bad as solid gold maybe i'll go with wellness i dunno yet thanks laura a heh funny my name is laura too and my middle name is ann laura a p yup i've tried canned mackeral sp before i forgot about that i think i'll get some thanks for all your answers everyone i think i'll vary different foods i've been thinking about it for a while sometimes chicken soup sometimes solid gold and sometimes wellness p along with the raw chicken and maybe some high quality canned food like from solid gold and some canned mackaral sp i can never spell that correctly xd any of those foods would be fine feed what you can afford and your dogs do best on i like the idea of varying brands just in case one is missing some vital nutrient at least they get it part of the time i hate to rely on only one brand especially since contaminated foods have recently come to light dogs in the wild will eat a little bit of plant matter both directly and by way of the stomach contents of their prey you're not doing your dogs any injustice if you feed them food with some grain in it they may not digest it quite as well but it won't harm them i'm not a nutritionist but i've had dogs for over years and never had any diet related health issues in fact i have a year old lab mix who acts like a pup he eats nutro natural choice lamb rice not the best food ever made but the only one that keeps his joints pain free there's plenty of grain in that food and he's never been sick that's just my experience you obviously care about your dogs very much good for you keep up with the raw chicken have you ever tried canned mackerel or sardines those are great additions too you're doing a great job don't feel like you need to spend all your money to feed your dogs right Cat Dog Guinea pig Chocolate Agriculture Food Omega-3 fatty acid Fancy rat Dog food Veganism Tofu Breastfeeding Livestock Cat food Nutrition Milk Egg (food) Gray Wolf RuneScape quests Domestic rabbit Organic food Genetically modified food Sewage treatment Fishing Stomach cancer Chicken Rice Food and Drug Administration Garfield Foie gras Organic farming Alcohol fuel Shark Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Folic acid Ramen 613 mitzvot Taboo food and drink Tlingit Dairy Joke Atkins Nutritional Approach Cuisine of Malaysia Hamburger Korean cuisine Fasting Vitamin C Healthy eating Domestication Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Famine Waste management Chicken soup RuneScape skills Simone Weil Scientology beliefs and practices Rocko's Modern Life Foodborne illness RuneScape economy Cantonese cuisine Adjustable gastric band Food preservation Fox hunting Japanese cuisine German cuisine Domestic goat Honey Gasoline Coeliac disease Characters of Naruto Sauerkraut Salmon Sushi Water Brewery Tocopherol The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Earthworm Kashrut Hemp Ecology Cuisine of Africa Ron and Fez Ant Fish and chips Carnivore Dietary fiber Microeconomics
