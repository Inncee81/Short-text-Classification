house breaking pup im having trouble house breaking my pup hes months old and just thinks he can go where ever whenever he wants even all over his bedding he has other adult dogs in the house with him and i hoped that would help him catch on as well but any suggestions hes an english bulldog he always does his business outside before he comes in and could be minutes later hes whizzing in the kitchen or sneaks under a bed and does it if he gets caught he has that look like he knows hes been bad i put him directly back outside i always take him out first thing in the morning and after he eats and drinks all the time i even call home while im working midnight shift to make sure my husband gets them all to the bathroom when he wakes up he even has a personal babysitter while we are at work so hes not left in the utility room alone and this person is very dependable and i know he gets love and care always keep him in the same room as you so you can keep an eye on him if he wanders too much get a leash and tie him near you so you can watch as soon as he starts to go tell him no no no no and run him outside when you goes outside praise him as he becomes more trustable you can let him have rooms at a time and eventually you won't need to watch him at all if you can't watch him or are gone put him in a crate most dogs will not go where they sleep this will also set your dog up for success since he can't go in the house because he is in a crate or being watched and corrected then he won't have a chance to get away with and think well if mommy's not home i can pee on the carpet and it will take much longer to re train the more often he goes do not leave his water or food out after he eats or drinks find out how long it will take for him to have to go then get him outside when he'll need to go and reward him for going potty outside take him out before bed and before going in his crate and don't give him food or water hours before bed or being in a crate for a few hours good luck Dog training Housebreaking The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Social rule Patrick Star Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Crate training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Avenue Q Toilet humour Obedience training Customs and etiquette of Japan Humphrey Bogart Shark Mattress Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Fairly OddParents Gray Wolf Kitchen Hamster The Brady Bunch Tag Daylight saving time Philip J.
