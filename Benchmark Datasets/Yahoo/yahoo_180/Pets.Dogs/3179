how much to charge for dog walking dog sitting my parents said that i need to do some dog walking and dog sitting in the neigborhood before they will get me a dog so i am going to put up flyers around my neighborhood but i am not sure what to charge i want to make some money but my main priority is not the money it's the experience so i don't want to charge too much how much should i charge for dog sittting and dog walking i'd hire you for a week lol but my dog is huge and i usually pay a day anyway check with a local vet office and also the local humane society you can volunteer at their offices too and also find out how much people charge you can just ask if they have any dog walking services or look it up in the phone book yellow pages online and call a few and ask how much they charge how often they walk etc owning a dog is a lot more than just walking it though just remember that dogs get sick just like us need their shots might chew or dig until they are trained properly i would suggest learning about crate training before getting a dog and thoroughly reading about the breed www akc org before buying one make sure you get one that will fit your lifestyle as active or lazy as you want etc Obedience training Dog training Socialization Dog Docking Ferret American Kennel Club Labrador Retriever Time Out of Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog agility The Catcher in the Rye American Pit Bull Terrier Housebreaking Aztec RuneScape quests MoveOn Community emergency response team Eric Bischoff Wal-Mart The Ersatz Elevator Garfield United States Postal Service Dog breed Meat Loaf Nintendogs Lee Harvey Oswald The Skeptical Environmentalist Border Collie Australian Shepherd The Inside Internet fraud Plame affair Columbine High School massacre Neighbours Dog intelligence Public transport Ocean's Twelve Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in Australia Crate training Milton H.
