my puppy's mother my puppy was taking away at his mother right after birth and was left in a box along the highway with his other brothers sisters a friend of ours found them and took them in we got one of them when he was days old ever since i have taken care of him feeding him talkng to him and just loving him he is now weeks old healthy and just wonderful my boyfriend and i have been pretty much the only ppl that he has seen but he is by my side when i sit down he has to be on my lap when i walk any where in the house he follows me if im doing my makeup cooking or standing any where he sits right on my feet he wont leave me from when i walk in the door but im home of the time dont get me wrong i enjoy the attatchment but im just wodering do you think that he thinks im his mother and also is this a healthy relationship when he gets a bit older i do plan on socializing him w other pups and dogs i plan i socializing him as soon as he gets his shots i dont want to expose him to anything his appt is in a week and since he is a pittbull and ppl judge him on that we are def putting him through classes so we have proof that hes been trained right unfortunately although out of your control he will miss an important part of development and that is with his litter mates socialization within the litter helps establish pecking order and he may have a hard time establishing dog relationships he will always feel like you are his main source of happiness since you were he only one around while he was young i would enroll him in puppy classes as close to weeks of age as you can he will be able to socialize with other puppies don't be surprised if he has no idea what to do or seems frightened of other puppies at first i think with lots of socialization and patience from you he will develop fine but he will probably always be clingy to you he will also have a healthy relationship and trust with people i have seen it the other way around when a puppy hasn't been socialized with humans during his puppy hood and is frightened of people i think this can be worse in terms of being a good pet good luck with him it sounds like you are doing a good job Dog training Dog Hamster Social rule Shaggy dog story Housebreaking Kodocha Guinea pig The Ashlee Simpson Show Theory of conduct Pet skunk Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) RuneScape quests Gray Wolf Fancy rat W.I.T.C.H.
