my dog when he's playing when he gets a little excited when playing with me he starts to open his mouth he doesnt bite down or anything but his teeth are sharp and they hurt a little bit i've tried stopping him holding his mouth shout and saying no bite but he keeps doing it he's yrs old jack russell hello the jrt is an aggressive breed of dog bred to hunt and kill animals sometimes more than twice their size doing it often and that means they cannot afford to be gentle although your dog needs to learn limits you need to understand the nature of the breed they will need plenty of exersize and if they don't get it they'll act out at home or when playing if they aren't kept busy and challenged then they'll often act out i am ' tall and walk at my top speed with my jrt twice a day these twice a day speedwalks have lost me lbs hell i didn't realize i had gained that much i also get him to an open field once a day for to min oh our walks are to miles and that's twice a day if you can't get him out that often try to find someone with a dog he can play hard with for at least an hour a day lastly i have to admit since my dog passed the yr mark he's a full grown adult and much easier to deal with even though they physically mature at one year they've got some mental emotional maturing to do as well and that can make it difficult to train a jrt oh i wanted to also ad a dog when playing uses it's mouth it doesn't have hands like us so what your dog is doing is normal in fact he sees your hands as the same as his mouth and he's outnumber cuz you've got two jrt's don't lke to lose so he gets aggressive i wear leather gloves when i go at it with mine and sometimes that's not enough if you've ever seen him play with other dogs you know what i mean they look sound as though they're fighting my jrt used to play with a lb french corgi when that monster got too rought with my dog she'd draw blood and my jrt wouldn't yelp but he would fight back and growl hard once he jumped on her back and clamped down on her ear you've never seen anything so funny a lb dog riding a lb corgi as it yelps in pain becuase the jack won't let her ear go to let you know how tough these dogs are my mothers jrt was attacked by a rotweiler she ripped it's testacles open and the dog had to have emergency surgury another one in my neighbors dog obedience class they introduced a goat to see what the dogs reactions would be apparently they do this with every class and the goat had been around dogs alot well this time he butted the jrt and it just jumped up and ripped it's throat out yep a lb dog killed a lb goat just like that my own got lost down a woodchuck hole at nine months old when he came up min later i had to cut through a root to get him and he was covered in blood upset i rushed him home only to find he had not a scratch on him it was from the woodchuck it's quite a responsibility having a jrt but the rewards are worth it they have a heart and love like no other dog that's my take on it marcos Dog training Dog Humphrey Bogart Cat Shaggy dog story Gray Wolf Obedience training Poker jargon Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Social rule Blood (computer game) Dog agility Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tenshinhan Piccolo Junior Saga Shark Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Doom enemies Milton H.
