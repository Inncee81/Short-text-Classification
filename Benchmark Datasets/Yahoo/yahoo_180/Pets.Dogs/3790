girl doggies and their periods when do they end hey i have a year old female shish tzu she has her period ever some odd months like a girl dog show have but there is one problem me and my mom both have we wanna go take our dog lilly to go get fixed so she wont have to have a period anymore cause we know it bugs her and it makes a mess around the house and so on and so forth but we know it will cost quite a bit of money and it will put her into pain if we take her to go get fixed so we were wondering if it is really worth going to get her fixed cause she might stop having her period soon so my question is when do dogs like mine finally stop have a period or do they even stop do they just keep going an going also when do they start having one like we have ours once a month for about a week so wut is their cycle please give as much info as u can me and lilly both thank u female dogs go into heat roughly every months for approx days although you will see bleeding only for about half that time the rest of it is the 'standing' heat which is the time she would likely get pregnant if bred if you do not intend to breed your dog have her spayed no matter what the mess and cost is only a small inconvenience compared to the health risks down the road of not having her spayed as a small breed you are looking at many more years of 'heats' and possibly an unwanted pregnancy Dog Cat Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Miscarriage Housebreaking Domestic rabbit Poker jargon Guinea pig Dobermann Pet skunk Breastfeeding Estrus cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kodocha Iditarod Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Social rule Fertility awareness Childbirth Great Dane Abortion Hebrew calendar AFI 100 Years series Ferret Nuclear power Mixed-breed dog Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mosquito The Joker's Wild $ale of the Century 2000 Australian Grand Prix COX-2 inhibitor Year 2000 problem Daz Dillinger Extreme Programming Premature birth Shaggy dog story Swimming Hey Jude Obstetrics Growth hormone treatment Friends Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hyperinflation Shih Tzu Tocopherol Software bug Anal sex Time Electronic amplifier Female genital cutting Month Kurt Cobain Billboard Hot 100 Dog training Keynesian economics Oral contraceptive Malaria Pit bull Fancy rat Days of our Lives Gregorian calendar Ja Rule Oral sex EastEnders Betting (poker) CPU design The Fairly OddParents Amy Dumas Meat Loaf Menstrual cup Code: Lyoko Ectopic pregnancy Spina bifida Second Battle of El Alamein KDE Stomach cancer Manx (cat) Sexual intercourse Jam (TV series) Infertility Dog show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hey Arnold!
