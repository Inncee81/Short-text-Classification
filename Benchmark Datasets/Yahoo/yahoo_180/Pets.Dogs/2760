how well would a border collie do in a sqft apartment we would of course take him her on plenty of walks one of us is alway home and when we go somewhere we plan to take him her with us if we can't take him her we'll have a doggie door on our sliding glass door to let him her out onto our patio to potty we live on the second story so there is very little risk of him her running off and the balcony is very high i asked a similar question in this catagory earlier but hubby suggested a border collie since they're not too big and not too small we don't want a toy dog so what do you think of a border collie we live out in colorado so open space and exercise are not hard to come by although your intentions are very honorable the border collie is a farm dog it needs to cover many many miles per day living where you are the dog will get very agitated at the lack of exercise i've had two of these dogs and they really need lots of walks runs etc so although they are a lovely dog unless you can do this it would be cruel to keep one inside without some readily available outdoor space for it all the time hope you make the right choice Door Border Collie The Time Machine Alaskan husky Dog Housebreaking Obedience training The Brady Bunch The Shining (film) Strap-on dildo USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Sento Toy Story 2 G-Man (Half-Life) Hamster Collision detection Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Mixed-breed dog Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center Opportunity rover Floppy disk Humphrey Bogart Super Mario Bros.
