need help with my blue nose pitbull puppy i have just gotten a week old blue nose puppy is it too young to be trained or do i have to be patient until it gets a little older i got dem pads and stuff but it still manages to go on the floor i even put it in his crate i also have to get bigger crate because the crate is larger but with it bigger i would be able to put a pillow in there with the pad i got it s shots not long ago so i dont think it's able to be walking around outside i dont want to take it out if it's goin to harm him also what is the healthy food anf vitamens and stufff for him so he could take it am i supposed to be the pad in the crate i've had a dog before but never so young now i know a few things but not everythin and it's wise to learn cause i learn somethin everyday please can someone help me get this dog to start pissing and shittin on the pad or on the pad in the crate instead of my bed and floor oh yeah is it supposed to drink milk please help it's never too early to start working with your puppy but this puppy should still be with it's mother for another weeks as for the crate you need one that isn't too big for it dogs don't like to go to bathroom where they sleep and if they have enough room in the crate they'll pee on one side and sleep on the other this is why you should absolutly not be putting his puppy pads in his crate with him this completely defeats the purpose of crate training crate training is a way to teach the puppy that there are certain places he can't go to the bathroom and the most sacred of these places is his crate to a dog his crate is his own little room where he can go and relax and be comfortable keep in mind though that he can't hold it for long because he's so young my chihuahua was crate trained when i got him at weeks so it is possible for a young pup but he'll still need to be let out often because his little body can only hold it for so long since you're not wanting to take him outside yet you should train him to use the potty pads then switch to going outside when you're comfortable enough to let him go outside whenever you see him starting to pee or poop on the floor pick him up and put him on the pad when he pees or poops on the pad praise him and give him a small treat if you catch him peeing or pooping on the carpet or find out that he has don't punish him simply put him on the pad eventually he'll get the point and he'll know what is and isn't acceptable and no he's not supposed to be drinking milk he should be drinking water too much cows milk isn't good for their tummies hope i was helpful and good luck Dog training Housebreaking Toilet humour Crate training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog RuneScape quests Urinary incontinence Fecal incontinence Ron and Fez Humphrey Bogart Hamster Dairy Shaggy dog story Care Bears Euphemism Breastfeeding The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Catcher in the Rye Fancy rat Mattress Pitaten The Shining (film) Ron Weasley Milton H.
