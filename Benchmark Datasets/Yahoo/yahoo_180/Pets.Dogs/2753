puppy pad or litter box i'm getting a pomeranian puppy soon and i'm contemplating whether to use puppy pads or a litter box i plan on training her to go outside along with whatever i choose i will be gone for about hours during the school year and live in a climate with winter please let me know which is most convienent thank you we used puppy pads and then transitioned out of them after a couple months if you plan on using them on a regular basis get the puppy very familiar with them so that she won't decide to chew them up destroy them during the time that you're gone our puppy wasn't left for more than hrs at a time so going potty outside was what he expected when i left a pad with him he'd tear it to shreds probably because we didn't have him rely on using them as for the litter box my brother had great results with their toy poodle using it on a daily basis i'd say the more consistent you are the better your results will be good luck Dog Rugrats Skinny Puppy Housebreaking Dog training Labrador Retriever Nintendogs Fancy rat EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Mixed-breed dog Crate training Docking Eddie Guerrero Domestic rabbit Nintendo Poodle Battle of the Bulge Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Socialization Scooby-Doo Ron and Fez Havanese 1957 World Series Ice hockey American Kennel Club Golden Retriever Gerald Durrell Eddie Murphy Hamster Characters in the Smurfs Dog breeding Santa's Little Helper American Eskimo Dog Saturday Night Live Mixed martial arts Belgian Shepherd Dog Beethoven (film) Topps Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Climate of the United Kingdom Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Winter War The Contender (television series) Hour World War I Vegeta 101 Dalmatians: The Series The Apprentice 2 Regina, Saskatchewan My Little Pony Doom (film) Big Brother (USA TV series) The Amazing Race Disgaea: Hour of Darkness Shetland Sheepdog Continuation War The Daily Show Poker jargon Nine Inch Nails Wayne Gretzky Andr__s Galarraga Tenshinhan 24 Hours of Le Mans The Apprentice 3 Cascading Style Sheets Guinea pig The Adventures of Pete & Pete Sick Puppy Port Authority Trans-Hudson Bay Area Rapid Transit Thirteen Years' War Guard Mounting Mattress Luanne Platter Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Dance Dance Revolution History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Australian Silky Terrier One-time pad International League Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Kodocha Primus (band) Press Your Luck Majin Buu Saga Solar power Nirvana (band) Kasparov versus The World Guide dog The Supremes Canberra Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 B-47 Stratojet Joy Division (band) Wrigley Field Pet skunk Transformers: Energon Breed registry Norway national football team
