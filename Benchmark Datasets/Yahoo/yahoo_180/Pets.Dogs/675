my dog has started eating stones and always has a bad stomach how can i stop him i discovered three piles the other day that he had thrown back any ideas how to stop him this is a serious problem called pica and what your dog is ingesting can kill him you need to keep him in a stone free environment always have him on leash outside you can try feeding him more exercising him more and keeping his life as stress free as possible if you don't want to add more calories to his diet you can add more fiber in the form of shredded vegetables mixed into his regular food if he is a puppy give him safe toys for him to eat he may just be confused as to what is food and what is not puppies do not come with that knowledge and have to be taught if you cannot keep him out of a rock free environment try getting some bitter apple or pepper sauce and spiking the rocks it is a dangerous habit and can lead to surgeries and ultimately death even if nothing is obviously wrong with him now it can cause problems in the future the link below shows a dog that had eaten a ball a decade before until he had to have surgery to remove it http www thepetcenter com xra ball html best of luck Dog Dog training Hamster Fancy rat Cat Fecal incontinence Stomach cancer Atkins Nutritional Approach Chicken Hot dog Dieting Cuisine of Denmark Dietary fiber Eating disorder Vegetarianism Nutrition Veganism Obesity Healthy eating Tofu Cancer Breastfeeding Egg (food) Food Guinea pig Ferret Sick Puppy Volleyball Super Size Me Garfield Housebreaking Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aztec Anorexia nervosa Domestic rabbit Fugu Insulin Vomiting Livestock Eating Tocopherol Tomato German cuisine Colorectal cancer Domesticated turkey Aerial (dance move) Raw food diet Biblical scientific foresight Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sauerkraut Kakapo Skinny Puppy Obedience training Kodocha Coronary heart disease RuneScape quests Red Hot Chili Peppers The Ashlee Simpson Show Survival skills Jewish cuisine Animal testing McDonald's World Wide Web Professional wrestling throws Sugar substitute Sushi Low-carbohydrate diet Adjustable gastric band Invader Zim David Hume Aspartame The Life and Times of Juniper Lee 1957 World Series Calorie restriction MTV2 Pizza Coprophagia Taboo food and drink Compost Socialization Urinary incontinence Korean cuisine MRE Stone Age Hamburger Bengali cuisine Botulism Food guide pyramid Plastic Gastric bypass surgery Agriculture Cuisine of the Southern United States Cincinnati chili Omega-3 fatty acid Weight loss Terri Schiavo Cuisine of Laos
