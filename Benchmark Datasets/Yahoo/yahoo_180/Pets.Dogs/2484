my dog loves to bury bones why this is an instinct held over from their days as wild dogs and a lot of domestic dogs still do it though it's not as common as a lot of other instinctive behaviors it's called caching in the wild after they've eaten their fill dogs and other canids like wolves and foxes will often take leftover parts of their kill and cache or hide them until needed in leaner times they bury it to keep other predators from finding and eating it before they can come back foxes especially do this a lot for example they'll raid a nest of duck or goose eggs eat one or two and then bury the rest maybe your dog hides his bones because he wants to be sure he has one later when you haven't given him one in a while more likely he doesn't know why he does it he just knows it feels right to do it Dog Gray Wolf Canidae Pet skunk Hunting Housebreaking Cat CPU cache Kevin and Kell Fox Domestication Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Hamster Fox hunting Red Fox Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Domesticated turkey Spider Wolf's Rain Chicken Bird 613 mitzvot Dingo Leatherback Sea Turtle Nile crocodile Kangaroo Leopard Egg (biology) RuneScape quests Cantonese cuisine Rocko's Modern Life Livestock American lobster Characters of Naruto Brown Bear Coyote Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Hedgehog Puma Canada Goose AVN Awards Pack (canine) Island Fox Animal communication Domain Name System Franklin (television series) Blood Syndicate German Shepherd Dog Fancy rat Quicksort Roman eating and drinking The Death Gate Cycle Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tasmanian Devil Kakapo Dog training Red Squirrel Comanche Coprophagia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pig Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Cigarette Smoking Man Cache Elephant Acorn Hybrid Jak II Egg (food) Time Crisis 3 Meat Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Reindeer Wa shogi Madagascar (film) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Redundant array of independent disks Ant Trailer Park Boys Skunk Tarantula American Alligator Taikyoku shogi Molecular systematics Sea turtle Temple of the Dog Jayne Mansfield Tag Ocean's Twelve Brian Griffin Ron Weasley King of Fighters Guinea pig Salmon Extinct birds Squirrel The Heartbroke Kid Goose Domestic rabbit Kosher foods
