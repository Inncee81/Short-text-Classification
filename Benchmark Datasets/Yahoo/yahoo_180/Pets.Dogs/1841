how do i keep my dog from barking while i'm at work i live with other people we all have different schedules and they are asleep when i leave for work i walk and feed my dogs before i leave and walk them when i get home my roomate has complained a couple of times that my boy caramel has made his way upstairs and is barking at his door while he's trying to sleep i have since put up a barrier so he can't get upstairs but he's still barking i got a call this morning from my roomate for the barking this morning but he doesn't know why caramel keeps barking despite him saying quiet or no i suggested spraying him with water in a spray bottle whenever he barks but i'm not sure if that is going to help any suggestions thanks an anti bark collar might help there is no need to use a shock collar there is another type that uses citronella instead when the dog barks the collar sprays citronella dogs don't like this and eventually learn not to bark Dog training Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Shaggy dog story Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Toilet humour Carl Barks Friends The Shining (film) Philip J.
