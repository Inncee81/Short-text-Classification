why is everyone against breeding purebreed dogs mixbreeds i was wondering why anytime i come on a forum to get information about dogs particularly breeding and welping there is always so many people against breeding pure bred dogs are ment to breed with eachother period the same as a small child plays mommy and choses the names of her future babies i have heard that dogs espically females long to be mothers so why not fill this desire i agree yes there is too many dogs being put down everyday and yes its wrong but my dogs arent going to be another statisic i will tell all those takeing my puppies that if they cannot care for or don't want the dog ever to bring back to me and another thing what's wrong with mutts i happen to think cockapoos labordoodles among many others are adorable and maybe they can't compete but as a family pet they are awsome more and more mutts end up in movies and such and hey life happens dogs interbreed don't like it don't get one i just wanted an open debate i don't want a brawl i honestly want to know if my chocolate lab and poodle make labordoodles what is the problem its a cool new breed things change same as everything eles why can't breeds i am not trying to make money off of my dogs just so its clear i see the look in baby girl's eyes and know its what she wants also these aren't designer dogs these are just a combination of dogs that i think is adorable i have been to shelters and seen the dogs that are there it seems that the shelters aren't even a suitable place for animals to ever go umm i would work out a contract when and if my dog gets pregnant i created this question because everytime i go to look anything up about dogs and puppies all i see is innocent people who just want an answer getting belittled by responsible more intelligent classier people and i wondered why yes i understand you need to inform the people of your opinion and let them know the facts but that isnt reason to treat them badly i'm just saying things happen and people come here to seek answers so give them respectfully i respect those who show respect those who yell and belittle i disreguard all their ideas oh and yes let your dog drive it's been waiting years oh some more points labordoodles make awsome guide dogs and tend to have less of the common lab hip problems i am going to be a teacher of the visually impaired i think i may take that to heart another thing is the reason most pure bred owners are agaisnt desigener dogs because they are bringing in much more money i mean alot of people here brought up the fact that puppies dont equal money and that labordoodles cost too much for being a mutt but i was never in this for money and it makes me question motives never said i was gonna charge much for the puppies my female baby is a year old chocolate lab who is akc approved and based on her size and other determineing factors she is definately from a showing line bear is a year old cockerpoo who is more cockerspainel than poodle it seems as he along with all of his siblings are more or less cockerspainel looking their temperments are very good they are surrounded by children everyday and although baby was very rowdy before getting bear she has greatly settled since haveing a pup which is how i know that she wants a litter dogs are dogs contracts or not money or not cute or not they are loveing dependable and needed it all comes down to education there are too many people out there that are breeding animals that do no research at all before hand then there are those who are breeding labordoodles and cockapoos etc and asking a lot of money for mutts and many of them still end up in shelters yes mutts happen and it would be a sad world without them i have gone to shelters and adopted dogs and trained them and they have done commercials tv shows and movies they are great but i've also use purebred dogs i almost hate to use purebred dogs only because i don't want them to become the flavor of the month and that's what happens heard of dalmatians you don't even want to know how many turned up in shelters months after that film came out here again people see the movie think they have to have one without doing any research at all on the breed before bringing the puppy home these are just a few reasons why people on yahoo get so upset when we see questions like omg my dog cat is having babies what do i do or my female dog is months old and i want to breed her to the dog down the street should i if you think we're going to say oh yea that would be great think again some of the questions can make your blood boil and we care about animals and yes the truth hurts so i'll get off my soap box but you asked have a good one Theory of conduct Guinea pig Episodes of Lost (Season 1)
