question about grains so i've finally decided what to feed my dog i'm gonna feed him wellness lamb and he'll have his raw chicken turkey pork raw egg twice a week sundays and wednesdays and i'm also gonna get a big bag of chicken quarters and a pack of hamburger some canned mackerel and maybe some pork cuts or other meats also some chopped vegetables and i'm gonna cook them and chop them up and make like a stew thing and i'm gonna put half a cup with his dry food everyday i'll freeze it in small portions i was wondering if i should add any grains or supplements andy oils or things that are good for his coat is white rice very digestable what else should i add to it personally i see no reason to feed dogs grains dogs are carnivores albeit scavenging carnivores who take just about any opportunity to eat anything and were not designed to digest grain they do not possess amylase an enzyme that aids in the digestion of carbs in their saliva like humans do their sharp teeth and short digestive tract was designed for meat and bones not plant matter because you plan on cooking some of the food you may need to add extra supplements while raw poultry bones are nutritious and easily digestible cooked poultry bones should never be fed due to splintering calcium and phosphorus may need to be added to this diet to make it more nutritionally complete and account for the cooked bones that must be thrown away if the meat you are feeding is commercially raised and not grass fed you may want to consider feeding fish oil to help balance out fatty acids Veganism Omega-3 fatty acid Food Vegetarianism Tofu Milk Chicken Hamburger Nutrition Carnivore Pork Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Denmark Cat Barbecue Domesticated turkey Raw food diet Cantonese cuisine MRE Guinea pig Japanese cuisine Cheese Carnivorous plant Soul food Ramen Chili con carne Chicken soup German cuisine Jewish cuisine Vegetarian nutrition Peruvian cuisine Cajun cuisine Agriculture Cuisine of the Philippines Food preservation Tooth Atkins Nutritional Approach Cuisine of Africa Digestion Vitamin C French fries French cuisine Vermicompost Egg (food) Hamster Soup Korean cuisine Dog Fancy rat Kosher foods Sausage Domestic rabbit Healthy eating Tlingit Roman eating and drinking Soy milk Garlic Insulin Hot dog Rice Protein Oily fish Kashrut Dumpling Sushi Cereal Polish cuisine Taiwanese cuisine Stock (food) Ham Salmon Organic farming Low-carbohydrate diet Cuisine of the Southern United States Peanut Taboo food and drink Cuisine of Laos Sewage treatment Organic food Gastrointestinal tract Tyrannosaurus rex Food storage Knife South Beach diet Coffee Cat food Cuisine of Ethiopia Alcohol fuel Gelatin Factory farming Meat analogue
