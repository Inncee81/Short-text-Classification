new chocolate lab i brought home our new dog today she's a year old chocolate lab her owners had to give her up do to their youngest daughters allergies it's her first few hours here and honestly she's being amazing and sweet my cat however freaked a bit when the dog came in the door so i put dog in basement to look for cat who i still haven't found poor thing my question is that the dog peed twice on floor in my looking for cat this is normal i assume also the second time she peed it was a brownish color she's been fixed is this normal and do you think my cat will chill out the dog grew up with cats and barely even noticed her thanks to all we went on a long walk so i think she was thirsty to goldengal she was in basement for a matter of minutes and actually her introduction was th long walk and hanging out with me try reading the entire question and don't make assumptions make sure your lab is drinking her water it does sound like uti and she could be nervous about the change as far as the cat goes they hate changes and will get use to the dog in time just let them both be and things will get back to normal whenever you get a new pet it should be checked out by your vet a good look over would be a good call hope all works out soon Fancy rat Cat Dog training Labrador Retriever The Smoking Room Ferret Toilet humour Chocolate Garfield Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Dog Ron and Fez Guinea pig Housebreaking Hamster Trailer Park Boys KaBlam!
