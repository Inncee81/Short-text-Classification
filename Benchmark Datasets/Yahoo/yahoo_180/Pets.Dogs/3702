considering a pomeranian puppy my husband i dog sat a neighbor's pom and he was good with me but kept acting aggresive towards my husband rejected his ownership by peeing on him almost everytime he picked the dog up i really want to buy myself a pom but my husband now is convinced all pomeranians are going to take a leak on him and display aggresive behavior what do you guys think the dog your neighbor has sounds like it has some behavorial issues it needs to have a professional evaluate it and could use some professional training they are great little dogs mine follow me around and love to play they love children and adults my male loves my dad and sits in the chair with him when he reads the newspaper like any other dog they need to be trained and socialized with other dogs and people they can benefit from training classes just like any other dog they are great little dogs you can find them at shelters pounds rescues or find a reputable breeder who tests for genetic conditions and breeds to better the breed there are a lot of breeders out there who do not test for genetic conditons just be careful and find a breeder who does do these tests pomeranians can possibly have issues with luxated patellas knees thyroid hypothyroidism heart conditons tracheal collapse low sugar hypoglycemia retained baby teeth hip dysplasia or issues with coat loss there are other health issues that are possible these are issues to question a breeder about pomeranians do shed pomeranian prices can range from from a reputable breeder although i have seen retired female or males for less but it depends on the breeder Dog Pomeranian (dog) Mixed-breed dog Havanese Domestic rabbit Keeshond Border Terrier Puppy mill Labrador Retriever German Shepherd Dog Basset Hound American Eskimo Dog Shetland Sheepdog Border Collie American Pit Bull Terrier Pet skunk Tibetan Mastiff Great Dane Hip dysplasia Cancer Hypoglycemia Dobermann Cat Horse Dog show Dog training Alaskan Malamute Dog breed Diabetes mellitus Italian Greyhound Fancy rat Hearing impairment Dog breeding Chihuahua (dog) Alaskan husky Intelligence quotient Gray Wolf Manx (cat) Coeliac disease Livestock Whippet Nuclear power Canary Mental retardation Turner syndrome Growth hormone treatment Belgian Shepherd Dog Psychiatry Airedale Terrier Endocrinology Docking Bernese Mountain Dog Growth hormone deficiency Infantilism Biology and sexual orientation Guinea pig Medicine Pekingese Genetic algorithm Maltese (dog) Alzheimer's disease Pet store Liger Androgen insensitivity syndrome Organic food Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Down syndrome Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Working dog Education in the United States Agriculture Equine conformation Smooth Collie Insulin Breed registry Hypertension Breastfeeding Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Folic acid Animal testing Contract Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Japanese Chin Terri Schiavo Microchip implant (animal) Arabian horse Transsexuality Health insurance Incest
