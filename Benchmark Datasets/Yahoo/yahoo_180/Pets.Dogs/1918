good german shepherd breeders can anyone recommend a quality gsd breeder i already have one female gsd spayed and now i'm looking for a male pup just for a family dog no showing breeding or working i would really love to find a solid black puppy they are so gorgeous but its not a requirement at all something within a few states of sc would be ideal georgia nc virginia tennessee upper florida but a breeder who can safely ship a puppy would be a nice last resort i guess actually while i'm on that subject do you recommend buying a puppy online and having it shipped via plane i always thought it was important to meet the puppy before you buy it but it seems a lot of breeders are dealing online now anyway any advice recommendations is appreciated thanks in advance it can be safe to buy over the internet i have sold most of my pups from my website i screen very carefully so this is a long process beginning well before the litter is planned however you really have to do your homework as there are so many scams out there now i would say that unless you can get several references it is not worth the risk there are many great gsd breeders in florida and several that have the blacks my friend raises wonderful gsd's in canada she contacted me this week to warn of a new scam someone has stolen her website and is selling her puppies only payment is going to the thief's address and the thief has no puppies to deliver the thief is claiming to be her even using her picture a good way to know if the breeder is legitimate is to ask for a veterinarian's contact and a vet record for the puppy to be sent to you then follow through and contact the vet's office the breeder would have given the vet permission to release info to you these look very nice http www holmesvalleygermanshepherds com solidblackfemalepuppy html http www elitek academy com blackknight html http www forevergsds com German Shepherd Dog Internet fraud Guinea pig Dobermann Schutzhund Breed registry Domestic rabbit Docking Cat Dog breeding Puppy mill Hamster Advance fee fraud Dog training Theory of conduct Mixed-breed dog MapleStory Dog breed Golden Retriever Lottery Bank fraud World Wide Web Housebreaking Livestock Uniform Resource Locator Ocean's Twelve Ferret Scooby-Doo Socialization Great Dane American Pit Bull Terrier Cross site scripting Gmail RuneScape cheats Kitten Dog show Warez Episodes of Lost (Season 1) United States Postal Service Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mail fraud Make money fast Neighbours Domain Name System Website Koi Mutual fund Fancy rat Mail-order bride Discus (fish) Cosmic Era list of characters Sly Cooper Nintendo E-mail spam Killian documents Nuclear power Stopping e-mail abuse Border Collie Wireless Application Protocol Microchip implant (animal) Uniform Resource Identifier Opera (web browser) Extreme Programming Confidence trick Havanese Shetland Sheepdog Intellectual property Agriculture Spam (electronic) Fault (dog) Copyright Skinny Puppy Life insurance Gray Wolf Condom MMORPG American Kennel Club Manx (cat) Pretty Good Privacy Wget English Springer Spaniel Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Gerald Durrell Web crawler HTML Our Gang America Online Monster Rancher monsters Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Elton John Nuclear reactor Glycogen storage disease type I
