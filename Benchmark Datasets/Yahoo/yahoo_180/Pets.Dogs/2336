breeding chicken or the egg dogs end up in shelters these dogs were bred by someone and usually sold to someone so who is responsible for the dog being in the shelter the breeder who sold a puppy to someone who promised to take care of it or the owner who has since decided he doesn't want the dog because its out of control has grown too big sheds isn't housetrained or whose owner cannot afford to feed it has had to move gets rid of the dog rather than finding a new dog friendly place to live has a baby no longer has time for it etc etc etc or is the problem a throw away society where people stick their parents in nursing homes and get rid of anything that isnt easy to deal with a society where people feel no shame in having failed as parents and as pet owners people ask me why its so hard to buy a dog from me and i tell them because i am responsible and do not trust easily to my knowledge no dog i've produced has ended up in a shelter an owner attempted to place a dog i produced with purebred rescue because they were too embarrassed to phone me and admit they could not afford his veterinary care silly people i paid the incorporation fee for that rescue breeders need to be responsible for the dogs they produce moreso people who buy pets need to be responsible for them quit blaming responsible breeders for dogs in shelters educate people about what having a dog entails hold them accountable for their actions and be willing to mentor my personal belief is that i am responsible for the life of any animal i produce however there comes a point where i have no control over what happens to that animal i can spay neuter it microchip it screen its new owners have a return policy and do everything under my power to deal with it in the case of the dog someone attempted to place with purebred rescue i arranged medical treatment fostered him with someone begging me for a pup and re homed him with them when they fell in love a parent does their best to raise their children instruct them on what is right and then sends them into the world is the parent then responsible if the adult child fails i do my best to educate my buyers act as a mentor and resource am available at all times to rehome a dog for the life of that dog people need to start being responsible for the dogs they take into their lives it's a combination it's the breeder for not properly checking out the home not asking the right questions and not taking back their dogs if they don't responsible breeders always do it's the owner for not buying responsibly doing research and not going back to their breeder for help with the problem and not trying to return the dog the the breeder it's the throw away society people are very quick to just dump problems rather than fix them you know that by the questions asked here if people were truly wanting to fix their problems they wouldn't ask here they would go to the people that can help them fix the problem do people really need to be told to go to the vet do they really need to be told to go to a trainer no they know the answer already they are just trying to get out of their responsibility many of them aren't here so that you can tell them to go to a trainer they want an immediate fix or they want you to tell them to get rid of the dog if people bred responsibly so that they weren't producing unwanted litters that get dumped in the shelters and breeders took the time to find the right home rather than ' a home ' and took back their dogs and people spent more time researching and soul searching trying to figure out if they really want and need a dog if they could afford or take care of a dog we wouldn't have so many dogs in shelters when i have people come here to meet the dogs i am a little pushy with them i allow my dogs to sit on people jump up on people getting dog hair and hopefully mud on people i want to see how they react to these type things if their shirt is more important than a little hair or a little mud then they aren't going to be a good dog person in my mind i want to see how they react to dog spit on their glasses and what they think of my trouble maker girl going thru their purse i want to see them reacting to things that are going to happen to them at home obviously they are going to be more reserved here around my dogs but you can get a feel of how people are dealing with their pocket torn off their blouse on all my dogs registered i am listed as the contact person to call if the dog is lost or goes to a shelter or rescue on all my microchip applications i am listed as the contact person should the dog be found if any of my dogs end up anywhere i am or would be contacted immediately to this point i have had one end up in doberman rescue they called me and we went and got him immediately there should be no shelters people should take care of their own Domestic rabbit Cat Guinea pig Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Microchip implant (animal) Golden Retriever Kodocha Mixed-breed
