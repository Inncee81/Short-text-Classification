what should i do if my future wife hates my dog my future wife hates to have a dog any where around her she's not afraid of them but she just dislikes them anywhere near her personal space i have had my daschund for years and she is an inside dog since i live in an apartment she agrees that my dog is the sweetest and least annoying she has ever been around but still she gets anxious and nervous we have talked seriously about getting married and i've compromised to let the dog stay outside most of the time when we get married but she is not willing to bend a bit she said that she wouldn't even like my dog sitting in my lap for minutes in the evening while i watch tv she says that she is dead set on letting the dog anywhere near the inside of the house how can i deal with my future wife hating the dog that i love as a child the dog is housebroken with unbelievable manners what should i do i love my dog like a child i may be a bit biased being a complete dog person lover but i'd be thinking twice about marrying someone who is so rigid about my dog she claims not to be afraid of dogs yet is forcing you to plan on banishing your beloved pet outdoors isolated from the only home he's known if you want to marry her which really indicates that she has no consideration of how you feel about your pet or about whats best for your pet i'd hate to see how she'd act if you had a human kid not a dog you're going to make whatever decision you are but someone who really loves you is going to love anything anyone you love and support you even if its not always 'comfortable' your dog is only going to be around for yrs another if you're lucky she's as your wife is supposed to be in for your lifetime you'd think she'd be more understanding and less demanding if she's this demanding now i hate to see where those demands go later but if you decide to stay with her it would be more humane to find your dog a home that will love and cherish it like it deserves not abandon it in a yard for a relationship your dog was raised as an indoor dog and will not understand nor likely do well suddenly as a outdoor dog best of luck Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Housebreaking Shaggy dog story The Death Gate Cycle Neighbours Dead Like Me Recurring South Park characters Nineteen Eighty-Four Obedience training Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cat Marriage Good Times Miss Saigon Knots Landing Philip J.
