another dog question i know you are supose to be the alpha of your dog but how do you do it without getting mad or frusterated i watch the dog whisper and i try mimicing what he does but it doesnt seem to work for me i end up getting obsessed over being the leader and getting mad and yelling because the dog wont listen to me now im afraid the dog fears me and we're loosing our really close bond please help my dog means the world to me and i want her to be like one of those dogs who follow their owners everywhere and listen to everything but withought being mean or getting mad or having to hire a trainer i mean i cant keep the dog on the leash all the time jsut to correct it and i don't know how to correct it even if i get stern with her and say assertivly no or stop she blows me off and continues what she's doing my parents let her get away with it and we get into an argument about how to take care of a dog and then i get even more frusterated about making her lsiten and ruin our bond even more start with obedience classes they teach you how to train your dog you're right yelling at your dog will just make the dog fear you there are ways to teach your dog you are alpha but it does take time and patience on your part you always go through doorways and up and down stairs ahead of your dog the alpha goes first you eat first and never give the dog treats while you are eating the alpha eats first never let your dog on top or above you even in play the alpha is highest always dogs do better with positive reinforcement than yelling for bad behavior when the dog does well you give lots of praise and even a small treat again start with obedience classes Dog training Obedience training Dog agility Gray Wolf Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Housebreaking Mixed-breed dog Schutzhund German Shepherd Dog Milton H.
