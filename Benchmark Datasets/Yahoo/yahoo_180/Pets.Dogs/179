i have a labrador retriever he is about year and months old sometimes he gets aggressive but thats only about night time when he hears somebody coming or anything else that disturbs the silence but i wanna make him aggressive whenever i tell him to for example tell him get him and he starts growling because he is too much of a pussy sometimes how do i make him aggressive on the command ok listen bitch i dont destroy my dog he has everything and more that any other dog has trust me and he has a loving family and i know the breed isnt aggressive but you can still train a dog to be aggressive and if u dont know anything about the question u are bein asked get tha fuck outta the question and dont answer peace ok that is what i meant a protective dog and im sorry if i offended u but to me a protective dog becomes aggressive at a signal from its owner so that is what i meant and i do know a lot about my dog and he is a happy dog very smart and intelligent and i dont want another dog im thinking about buying a different breed like a german sheppherd that is a more aggressive breed and it might turn the lab a little more aggressive towards non family members i had a st bernard a long time ago and he was fridnly to everyone untill i got a rotweiler then they were both protective and aggressive towards anyone other than our family he is yellow and people are scared of him when they see him because he is big but too playful he can bark on command but thats only if i say bark he doesnt really understand that its supposed to be scary to others he is also aggressive towards animals like squirrels and rabbits or cats and he does try to attack them when they are around but to people he is very friendly but i do have hope that he can be aggressive or protective because sometimes he does show signs of aggression for example whenever someone makes a wierd noise downstairs or somewhere where he doesnt know where its coming from and i can act like somethiings not right he will put his ears up and will growl or bark and rush downstairs but i am worried because whenever someone comes in our back yard and hes there and the person is known to me but not to the dog he should not let him in but instead i find him playing with the person what can i do about this by myself of course i dont wanna send him to training lol u prolly can ha but just wanted let ya kno that ur gettin best answer Dog Shaggy dog story Cat German Shepherd Dog Dog training Obedience training Housebreaking Dobermann Rottweiler Golden Retriever Gray Wolf Daz Dillinger American Pit Bull Terrier Social rule Finnish Spitz Atomic Kitten Working dog Chesapeake Bay Retriever Keeshond Dog show I Want to Hold Your Hand Nintendogs Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Domestic rabbit Philip J.
