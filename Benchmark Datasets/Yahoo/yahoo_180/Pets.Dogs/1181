dp i have a question for you hey dp if i offended you in any way yesterday i do apologize i am just trying to take the best possible care that i can for my dog heres my question i noticed that you said to sell mix bred puppies for i was wondering if you could elaborate at all on this because we were just concerned about finding great people with great homes and not even asking for money can you further explain your opinion on the subject i would really appreciate it thanks camille thank you so much shanna bozema and goldengal i am horrified to hear that people pose as adopters and then turn around and sell the puppies every shelter that i have looked into in my area is not a non killing shelter any suggestions on how to find one i don't think you offended me i very quickly get over things so if you did it's forgotten thanks i believe that if you give away puppies you invite the wrong kind of people people who use dogs for bait for fighting people who take those puppies and feed them to their snake yes they do and people who take puppies and do not take care of them i have given away dogs both of them to what i thought were trusted friends both people i have known for over years in both cases i have made a big mistake anyhow these are people i know and thought i could trust what about the people that come to your house to see puppies you have to either get them to fill out a questionaire and follow up or you must meet with them a few times you cannot put an ad in the newspaper meet people for minutes and get a real good feel for them it used to be you could look at someone and size them up pretty quickly they were what they seemed but today people are different you can't as easily make a judgement on people they have evolved i guess into what they need to be look how many scams are out there people are falling for scams all the time why cause it's harder to judge people if someone could easily be scammed out of millions of dollars don't you think it would be easy for some joker to con you into thinking he was a great home they learn what they need to say to get that puppy out of your home so if you at least charge then you are at least going to deter some of these people from showing up is even easy for people to get spend and feel like ' oh well it's just not a big deal ' if i gave you something and you lost it you wouldn't be all that upset big deal i'll get a new one or it was free if i sold you something you would be a little more careful with it puppies are the same not always but it at least is a bit of a deterant to someone who wants the puppy for reasons other than what you intended don't get me wrong rich people aren't any better lots of times cause money doesn't mean as much to them but free is just that free and people don't take good care of things that they get for free that includes puppies Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Advance fee fraud Make money fast Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Confidence trick Avenue Q God Emperor of Dune Humphrey Bogart The Ashlee Simpson Show Dog training Hey Jude The Apprentice 2 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pitaten I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Blood on the Tracks Microeconomics RuneScape cheats Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shaggy dog story Marilyn Monroe The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Friends Philosophical skepticism Scenes from a Memory AFI 100 Years series The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Craps EastEnders Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Cliff Richard Have I Got News For You Poker jargon Neighbours The Death Gate Cycle Fair use Animal Farm Trailer Park Boys One Tree Hill (TV series) Spidey Super Stories Jam (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga National Kidney Foundation Singapore The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sin City Contract Ocean's Twelve The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Emancipation of Mimi Arguments for and against drug prohibition American Psycho Theodicy Skinny Puppy The Amber Spyglass Vegeta LiveJournal W.I.T.C.H.
