how can i make my great dane stay off of my bed alot of times when i walk into my room there she is on my bed she knows shes wrong too because when she sees me coming she puts her head down and hops down also when i leave she gets up there and demolishes my blankets i cant close by bedroom door when i am gone or she scratches and tears up the carpet outside of my bedroom door she has her own bed so now everytime i leave i have to make sure i put all my blankets and pillows shut up in my closet so that they will last until i get home the spray stuff that you put on things so your dog will not chew on it would it be a bad idea since i sleep there you know why is that funny jr crate training would be your best bet it's not cruel the dog should look at the crate like their den and be happy to go there just don't use the crate for punishments a crate will be useful in other situations as well if you can't get a crate the no chew spray stuff sold at petsmart works great my shep x is a terrible blanket chewer and it put an end the that it only smells to me for a few minutes after you spray it on when it's dry it doesn't stink but still tastes horrible i know i tried the tiniest tiny taste on my finger before i bought it and almost threw up right there on petsmart's floor it took bottles before it stopped him completely but was well worth it as long as you don't lick your blankets you should be fine Dog training Sin City Housebreaking Crate training The Jeffersons (South Park) Trapped in the Closet Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Toilet humour Cube (film) Blankets (graphic novel) The Marriage of Figaro RuneScape quests Russian joke EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Aerial (dance move) The Shining (film) The Lovely Bones Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Brewery The Star Wars Holiday Special Milton H.
