i have a dog training question i have one adult female dog standard poodle and a female puppy golden retriever that is months old the golden has shown a few signs that she will be an alpha female and we have been working on her like crazy to keep her in lined and trained and she's doing really well my question is both females like to romp and play just like any normal dog and i've heard that a romp can turn into a fight very easily the golden is only puppy but i want to know if it is okay to let them romp like normal dogs or if i should make them stop they have never had trouble with eachother or anything and my poodle is really well trained but i'm afraid it might be teaching the puppy how to fight she's a smart girl and really sweet just some pre aggressive signs have been displayed that we are trying to weed out if you have had experience with this and youre a trainer please help i'm glad to see that you can recognize that there will be a pecking order please let them play this is a normal part of canine behavior and actually helps establish the alpha i dont see it turning aggressive with an adult and a puppy especially thoes breeds of dog generally fights are over other things and if you dont have two strong personalities let them play relax and enjoy trainer for over years Dog training Mixed-breed dog German Shepherd Dog Obedience training Guide dog Housebreaking Labrador Retriever Nintendogs Poodle Working dog Socialization Dog breed Dog intelligence Dog show American Pit Bull Terrier Schutzhund One Tree Hill (TV series) Dog agility Jennifer Lopez Mountain Gorilla Puppy mill Gray Wolf Sick Puppy Fancy rat Ferret Rottweiler Autism Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Pack (canine) Krypto Belgian Shepherd Dog Golden Retriever American Eskimo Dog Domestic rabbit Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Border Terrier Rugrats Kim Possible Cockfight Ranma __ characters Tai shogi Gun dog Chesapeake Bay Retriever Border Collie Havanese American Kennel Club Bull Terrier Equilibrium (2002 film) Hamster Australian Cattle Dog Shetland Sheepdog Infantilism Breed registry Cat Komondor Boston Terrier Crate training Neuro-linguistic programming Beethoven (film) English Cocker Spaniel Animal communication Paranoia Agent Gifted The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Ron and Fez Taikyoku shogi Motivation Social rule Milton H.
