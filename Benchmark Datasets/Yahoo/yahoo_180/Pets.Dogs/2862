question for shiba inu owners i have a yr old male shiba inu he is the first shiba i have had i love him to pieces he has however a horrible habit of shaking like a leaf during the slightest hint of a storm then when the thunder begins he heads to the bathroom digs on tile behind the toilet then when i stop him he stays in the bathtub keeps trying to dig behind the toilet is this normal my shiba does the same thing he hears thunder way before my inept ears detect it i'm sorry to say i don't have any suggestions for you i've read that folks with dogs with fear issues should try to desensitize them the suggestions include playing recordings of thunder and rain at increasing volumes until the dog gets use to hearing it unfortunately for me my dog knows the difference between recorded thunder and the real mccoy i do my best to ignore his behavior i don't talk to him pet him or coddle him when he's freaking out i do let him go into our basement finished room and i will turn on the tv to help drown out the sounds i know it's not a good solution but i'm like you i'm at a loss for how to help him through this for the record he's never had anything happen to him to cause his fears i think they're just a little more high strung and if they don't get a lot of exposure to strange looking sounding things when they're young there's a chance they develop fear issues sorry i couldn't offer any help other than saying you and your shiba are not alone Shaggy dog story Milton H.
