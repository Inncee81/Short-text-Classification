what breed of dog would be a decent guard and watch dog but doesn't need a lot of excercise english bulldog it's for my grandfather who's not as fit as he used to be our lovely boxer dog died recently and i'd like to get him a companion that could also protect him and watch the house but not too hyperactive or wild a dog with a shorter lifespan would be a bonus too we like bull breeds i love english bulldogs do you think this breed would be suitable for our needs i also don't want a dog that is so strong wild it might pull him off his feet when he is walking it the only bulldogs i've known have been really friendly but i wasn't trying to mug their owner or rob their house i certainly wouldn't get one as a guard watch dog but maybe they make better watch dogs than i think my suggestion with reservations would be a livestock guardian dog these dogs were bred to hang out with flocks of sheep all day they're not herding dogs but protection dogs they're large and protective but weren't bred to need constant exercise they're also pretty laid back don't want them scaring the sheep and since they're large dogs they have shorter lifespans reservations however they were bred to guard large amounts of property with sheep on it i don't think it would be the best choice if he lives in an apartment or even if he lives in a house with a small yard if he has a large yard and can't exercise the dog much i think it would be just fine these breeds include great pyrenees kuvasz komondor anatolian shepherd tibetan mastiff this breed did plenty of other things too but they can still fit into this category most of the breeds who have historically been livestock guardian dogs lgds are still very rare breeds i just listed some of the more common ones here's a website if you want more information about this group of dogs http www lgd org Dog Mastiff German Shepherd Dog Gray Wolf Pit bull Cat Tibetan Mastiff Working dog Brown Bear Anatolian Shepherd Dog Herding dog Cowboy Obedience training Border Collie Australian Shepherd American Kennel Club Domestic sheep Equine conformation American Bulldog Mixed-breed dog Argentine Dogo Time Out of Mind Bulldog Sheep husbandry Pug American Pit Bull Terrier Conker's Bad Fur Day Domestic goat RuneScape quests Fox hunting Dingo Irish Wolfhound Terrier Animal husbandry Dobermann Humphrey Bogart Domestication Keeshond Schutzhund Hamster Havanese Pyrenean Shepherd Poker jargon Bull Terrier Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wool Fancy rat Firefighter Maison Ikkoku Agriculture Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Alaskan husky Monster Rancher monsters Weimaraner Boston Terrier Tibetan Terrier Rottweiler Docking Great Dane Jack Russell Terrier Skye Terrier Shetland Sheepdog Housebreaking Akita Inu Dairy German Shorthaired Pointer Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Shaggy dog story Companion dog Theory of conduct Francis Bacon (painter) French Bulldog Labrador Retriever Friends Dog breed Belgian Shepherd Dog Bearded Collie Portuguese Water Dog Garfield Pekingese Shepherd Blonde on Blonde Siberian Husky Hunting Bouvier des Flandres Ant Australian Cattle Dog The Lovely Bones Marching band Professional wrestling aerial techniques Smooth Collie Poodle
