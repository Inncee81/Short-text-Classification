clumsy dog one of my dogs seems completely unaware of her feet and butt she's always stepping on us tripping over things and knocking things over she's not a dumb dog she knows basic commands and is very trustworthy and good just clumsy we got her from a labrador rescue about a year ago she's now she spent the first part of her life in a cage inside a barn enslaved to be a mother at a puppy mill it got shut down as part of a neglect case and the salvageable dogs were pulled by a rescue she came to us with really no skills at all didn't know how to live in a home she's made great progress considering she's quite sensitive yet stubborn how can we best train her out of her clumsiness your dog is clumsy because she wasn't able to develop her motor skills at a normal pace i would suggest agility activities you don't necessarily have to enroll her in agility lessons you can do simple things like get a kids pop up tunnel for her to crawl through or try and teach her to jump through a hula hoop any kind of activity that would involve her having to negotiate her size over and through an obstacle will help her become less clumsy obviously giving a treat and lots of affection when she does a task correctly will give her some motivation if she likes to play fetch letting her run full force and catching balls or frisbees would also help her motor skills i think she just needs help catching up on the years she missed out on Dog agility Fast bowling Episodes of Lost (Season 1) RuneScape quests Rugby union positions Kim Possible Extreme Programming Obedience training Dyslexia Baseball Equine conformation Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Labrador Retriever Volleyball Golden Retriever Professional wrestling match types Characters in the Smurfs Asperger syndrome Milton H.
