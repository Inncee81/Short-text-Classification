how do i train my dog to stay out of my way as i walk around the house dot is a year old mutt that i've had for four years she was listed as a basenji mix at the pound when i adopted her but she looks exactly like a canaan which is similar the description on akcs website almost fits her to a tee dot is constantly under my feet both of the breeds i mentioned are herding dogs and i wonder if she is constantly trying to herd me toward the treat jar do you have any tips or suggestions to keep her out of my way every time i walk from one end of the house to the other i have to travel at a snail's pace because she is slowly walking backward or hopping around directly in front of me i'd love to be able to walk around without her in the way she acts very young even though she's and often shows puppy like behavior like rear up front paws down while she is underfoot haha i had the same problem with my dog he would always run in between my legs but he was a chiuahua and would get stepped on or i would trip and fall trying to avoid stepping on him i gave him a designated space in the house and everytime i saw him follow me i would tell him to go to his spot he was only allowed to be with me when i was already sitting down and we're not in eachother's way he learned slowly but surely not to run into my legs Dog training Mixed-breed dog Aerial (dance move) Horse Dog agility Combine (Half-Life 2) Swingout The Time Machine Horse gait Basenji Marching band Shetland Sheepdog Guinea pig American Kennel Club German Shepherd Dog Elephant Gray Wolf Labrador Retriever B-47 Stratojet Australian Shepherd Cat Equine conformation Tai shogi Fancy rat Brown Bear American Pit Bull Terrier Lady and the Tramp Border Collie Smooth Collie Schutzhund Sailing Belgian Shepherd Dog Paragliding Biped Skateboarding trick Havanese Balboa (dance) Professional wrestling holds Bicycle Professional wrestling aerial techniques Stairway Glossary of American football Garfield Dog breed Dressage Keeshond Iditarod M16 (rifle) Glossary of partner dance terms Herding dog Diving Parade (military) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rocko's Modern Life Apollo 11 Dinosaur Autogyro Eye Car handling Italian Greyhound Working dog Tango (dance) Dairy Dalmatian Red Deer Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Golden Retriever Professional wrestling throws Newfoundland (dog) American football Professional wrestling attacks Pyrenean Shepherd Basset Hound Greyhound Australian Cattle Dog Volleyball Boxing Livestock Rabbit Undergarment Domestic rabbit IBM PC compatible Seabiscuit Circle (dance move) Charleston (dance move) P-61 Black Widow Dobermann Mouse (computing) Dog show Rottweiler Stage lighting Hamster Tetrapod Swimming Guadalupe Mountains National Park Prank flash Cowboy
