a question about pitt bulls okay i have heard sevral diffrent sides 'it only depends on how they are raised' or 'pittbulls are agressive dogs there is no way to keep them from being agressive towards other animals' personaly i could go either way i read in the paper once that pittbulls have a chemiacle in there brain that other dogs don't have don't ahve as much of as pittbulls also when they do bite it is hard for them to let go because of the way there jaw is stuctured i have also seen a pittbull puppy with a family that is very sweet but he is just a puppy and has not matured this queston has absolutley nothing to do with pittbulls fighting other pittbulls as a 'sport' i am aggenstit this i am asking weather or not you think that pittbulls are aggresive when they are in a normal home not being trained to fight becuase as i said i have seen it go bth ways just tell me one or the other and try to have some proof thanks d i've seen it go both ways given that it's hard to know exactly what goes on behind closed doors someone saying that they are raising their dog properly is one thing what really goes on is maybe another thing i can't say i don't know for sure but i have definitely talked to many people who claim to have raised their pb properly only to have it attack but i have seen a pb taken from an abusive situation and turned into a big huge sweetheart that would hurt nothing but a squirrel if given the chance Dog Dog training Pit bull Animal Farm Socialization Shark Gray Wolf American Pit Bull Terrier Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Livestock Social rule Trapping Equine conformation The nature of God in Western theology Philosophy of language Puppy mill Ron and Fez Aphasia Housebreaking Ferret Theory of conduct Infidels Hearing impairment Randomness Martial art Vegeta Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Sin City Rick Santorum Hamster Milton H.
