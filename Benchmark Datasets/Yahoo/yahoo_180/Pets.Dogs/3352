boston terrier german shepherd alpha male we have a year old male german shepherd and two weeks ago got a year old male boston terrier that needed a home both dogs were and are energetic and constantly chased each other around the house the first week we figured they would settle down after the novelty wore off and they got accustomed to each other the shepherd though is as hyper as ever he runs after the terrier constantly and won't let the terrier play with a bone or a toy without needling him incessently although if the shepherd has a bone and the terrier gets close the shepherd growls and snaps at the terrier my husband thinks we need to give away the terrier that there can only be on alpha male and the shepherd is or should be that one because he was here first and it's his house i don't agree with that but i'm not sure how to fix the situation btw both dogs are unneutered males does anyone have any ideas would neutering one or both do the trick thanks i really want to keep the boston terrier so giving him away would be a last resort i have already gotten attached to him and i think he's gotten attached to us thanks to everyone for your responses so far in any pack you have to be pack leader as does your husband then the two male dogs have to decide which dog will be alpha male and they have to settle that themselves it can get a bit hairy meanwhile it doesn't matter that they have gotten accustomed to each other they'll get alone one moment and challenge the next they need to establish which male is alpha you don't necessarily need to give away either one of the dogs you just have to be patient regardless of who was there first first come is not always alpha dog you don't get to designate which dog is alpha male they have to work that out but you can alleviate the challenges and difficulties somewhat by neutering both males that will make a difference intact males are always much more aggressive to each other you may not have read up enough on personality traits of each breed so please do so now it will help you make your decision regardless of what i say the decision on the dogs must be made by the two of you and agreeable to both of you not just one of you Dog Dog show Jack Russell Terrier German Shepherd Dog Terrier Mixed-breed dog Dog training Pit bull Working dog Cat Gray Wolf Boston Terrier Skye Terrier Border Terrier Nintendogs Yorkshire Terrier Fox Terrier Fox hunting Schutzhund Police dog Toy dog Housebreaking Fox Terrier (Wire) Cowboy Breed standard Ferret Gender Royal Assent Rat Terrier Pack (canine) German grammar Mastiff Kerry Blue Terrier Border Collie Social rule Belgian Shepherd Dog Transformers: Energon Species Pet skunk Abortion debate Characters of Naruto Miniature Fox Terrier Dog breed West Highland White Terrier Companion dog Breed club American Pit Bull Terrier Tibetan Terrier Australian Shepherd Tenterfield Terrier Nietzschean Road Rovers Best of Breed Theodicy Toy Fox Terrier Joke Karen Horney Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tobacco smoking Fault (dog) Fala Maltese (dog) Welsh Terrier Horse Infantilism Newcastle United F.C.
