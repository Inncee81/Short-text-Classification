a rottweiler jumped into our locked fenced in yard and killed our chihuhua why do people keep big dogs yesterday the neighbor's rottweiler was in our fenced in locked back yard we share a fence with the neighbor it had somehow jumped over that fence my wife let our two chihuhuas out into our yard she heard one of our dogs screaming and ran she's disabled so ran as well as she could to the other side of our above ground pool what she saw was a large rottweiler with our little lb chihuhua in it's mouth shaking it violently our other chihuhua was trying to bite the rottweiler but for obvious reasons wasn't having much of an effect the rott dropped our little baby dog and then picked it up again by the neck shaking it some more i was not home at the time and my wife couldn't get the rott to let go of our dog it took animal control a stun gun a tranquilizer dart and the owner coming back home to get the rott subdued q why do people keep dogs that would do something like this i have big dogs of which are dobermans not one of them would do something like that they all love playing with little dogs just because that rottweiler did that does not mean that all big dogs would this is a case of an owner not properly training socializing and controlling their dog little dogs are capable of being vicious as well but they just aren't as strong the worst dog bite i have ever had and i work in rescue so i've had quite a few came from a miniature pinscher i am truly sorry for what happened but please do not blame all rottweilers or big dogs most big dogs are gentle and well trained and would never hurt another dog my big male doberman allows little dogs to crawl all over him and he just sits there obviously this owner is completely responsible for not properly handling his dog again i am so sorry what a tragedy Dobermann The Inside Dog Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dog training Shaggy dog story Rottweiler Professional wrestling attacks Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels The Shining (film) Sin City Unreal Fox hunting EastEnders Miniature Pinscher Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pit bull Professional wrestling throws Babe Ruth RuneScape quests Volleyball Dog agility Pittsburgh Steelers Tag Combine (Half-Life 2) Professional wrestling holds Schutzhund Gun safety German Shepherd Dog Tenshinhan The Legend of Zelda series enemies Police dog Working dog Blood (computer game) New York Giants Darth Vader The Suffering (game) Ferret Garfield San Francisco 49ers Columbine High School massacre Aerial (dance move) Family Guy Gun politics Limp Bizkit Natural Selection (computer game) Siegfried & Roy Milton H.
