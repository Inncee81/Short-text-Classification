boston terrier info if you have or know somebody that has a boston terrier what kind of information can you give me how much do they shed do you think they'd be good for someone with allergies do they have a good temperment easy to train bark a lot good with children etc thanks i beg to differ with those who say that bostons are big shedders barkers hyper and hard to train i know a few that are very hyper when you first meet them but they calm down very soon after the excitement of meeting someone new is over i also live in deep south mine shed twice yearly once in late fall early winter and once in later spring i have hardwood floors so i can really see the hair if it's there i vacuum weekly except when they are shedding then i vacuum every couple of days as for the barking my males will bark once each if someone they don't recognize is coming to the door my windows are low so they can see out if they hear an outside door open and it's not the time that someone usually comes home they bark once and run to see who it is my females bark very rarely everyone in my family has allergies of one type or the other we all take claritin or zyrtec and never have a problem because of the dogs it could be very different for you and your family though there is no such thing as a guaranteed hypoallergenic dog no matter what the labradoodle folks say if you have carpeting lots of upholstered furniture that the dogs get on let them in the bed with you we don't and have draperies then you will have more allergy problems that folks who have hard flooring leather furniture no dogs in the bed and no draperies or who clean the draperies monthly bostons are in my experience wonderful with children they love kids and kids love them the key in this is to get a dog that was socialized to children at a young age before leaving the mother at about weeks as to training bostons do have minds of their own they can be a little stubborn sometimes but i consider them to be pretty easy to train esp if you are gentle patient and give lots of treats please visit the website for the boston terrier club of america to learn all about the history of the breed and the traits of these wonderful dogs there is a section about how to find a good puppy and lots of information about health issues read it all before you consider getting a dog if you decide on another breed go to that parent club's website and do the same thing good breeders of any breed of animal breed for conformation to the breed standard and for the correct temperament bostons should be happy active but not hyper companion dogs be sure to look at the illustrated standard for the breed on the btca website it shows you what a boston should and should not look like also don't fall for the rare reds blues fawns etc they are only rare because they do not fit the breed standard and no reputable breeder breeds for anything against the standard http bostonterrierclubofamerica org index html Dog Havanese American Pit Bull Terrier Boston Terrier German Shepherd Dog Dog training Shetland Sheepdog Domestic rabbit Jack Russell Terrier Border Terrier Keeshond Dog show Cairn Terrier West Highland White Terrier Kerry Blue Terrier Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Bull Terrier Upholstery Skye Terrier Border Collie Dobermann Great Dane Obedience training Airedale Terrier Beagle Welsh Terrier Rat Terrier Basset Hound Pug Maltese (dog) Tibetan Terrier Dog breeding Breed standard Golden Retriever Guinea pig Poodle Pitaten American Eskimo Dog Hamster Smooth Collie Breed registry Social rule Puppy mill RuneScape quests Dog agility American Kennel Club Tenterfield Terrier Brian Griffin Pet skunk Toy Fox Terrier Alaskan husky Housebreaking Kodocha Wood Guide dog Rottweiler Australian Cattle Dog Horse Dog breed The Emancipation of Mimi Dog hybrids and crossbreeds Schutzhund Tibetan Mastiff Humphrey Bogart Dachshund Boston University Ferret English Springer Spaniel Church of Christ, Scientist Strap-on dildo Little Britain Chinese Crested Dog Childbirth Finnish Spitz The Fairly OddParents Livestock Manx (cat) Grace Cossington Smith Staffordshire Bull Terrier Red Squirrel Australian Silky Terrier Inception of Darwin's theory Equine conformation Terrier Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Griffon Bruxellois Carl Barks Animal Crossing Docking The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan
