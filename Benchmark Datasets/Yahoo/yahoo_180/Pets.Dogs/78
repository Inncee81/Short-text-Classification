regarding growth of husky akita mix my puppy who is husky and akita is months old weighs around pounds and is very athletic i was just wondering in your opinion how much will he approximately weigh when he's full grown and how big will he be by the way i feed him about cups of natural choice food a day and give him a few treats and he gets walked every day thanks for the info but akitas grow from lbs to lbs i would estimate he's around half his adult weight so somewhere in the lb range as an adult would be my guess somewhat bigger than a sibe but a little smaller than an akita sibes are very fuel efficient and don't require a whole lot of food akitas tend to eat more for the same body mass my male akita who is years and about lbs typically eats about cups day at mo he was probably getting about day our male siberians never seemed to need more than about cups day as adults it sounds like your dog may have inherited more of the akita metabolism than the siberian the main issue is whether or not the dog is overweight not the absolute amount of food he's getting you should be able to feel his ribs but not see them also when looking at him from above there should be a little tuck behid the rib cage to the pelvis if he looks like a sausage with no indentation he's probably overweight the next time you take him to your vet ask about weight and have them show you how to judge from the dog's appearance it sounds like you're feeding a quality food i would suggest a large breed puppy formulation to get the right amount of protein and stay away from anything that has a lot of wheat or corn in it including treats siberians and akitas are about my two favorite breeds have had sibes since and akitas for a little over two years it would be interesting to know which breed your dog most resembles in terms of termperament good luck with your pup Dog Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Mixed-breed dog Hamster Liger Obesity Puberty Fancy rat Gray Wolf Pound Alaskan husky Atkins Nutritional Approach Milk Siberian Husky Agriculture Hypoglycemia Garfield Tigon Binge eating disorder Tyrannosaurus rex Coeliac disease Chocolate Cat Insulin Mixed martial arts Capercaillie Tocopherol Akita Inu Dairy Ferret Alcohol fuel Veganism Anorexia nervosa Spitz Weight Maize Hydrogen economy Dog training Androgen insensitivity syndrome Brown Bear Lion Tasmanian Devil InuYasha (character) Barbecue Mass Domestic goat Body mass index Sea Otter Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Biodiesel Alaskan Malamute Great Dane Folic acid Weight training Urinary incontinence Sewage treatment Humpback Whale Stomach cancer Growth hormone Kakapo Blue Whale Terri Schiavo Bird migration Organic farming Cuisine of Denmark Livestock Cairn Terrier Domesticated turkey Golden Retriever Domestication Hachiko Albatross Spider Iditarod Mosquito Hot dog Mountain Gorilla Growth hormone treatment Labrador Retriever Adjustable gastric band Breastfeeding Bodybuilding Green Revolution Breakfast Diving Greyhound Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
