owning a dog and work schedule my wife and i work full time but would like a dog also have kids and and a cat the dog would be alone from about am to pm most likely in a crate i thought an older dog from a shelter or rescue might be best do others find they have happy dogs when everyone in the house works i've had both adults and puppies when both my husband and i were working and the kids were in school and they were all fine my last puppy was my bearded collie we chose putting him in an exercise pen during the day rather than a crate he had bedding and toys on one end and newspapers at the other before he was months old he stopped peeing in his pen and would hold it until the boys got home from school at around millions of people have dogs and jobs to support those dogs there's no need to feel guilty for leaving a dog alone during the day they're still happy what's important is the amount of and quality of the time you give him when you are home early morning evenings weekends if you spend time then playing with exercising and training a dog you 'll have a happy dog Housebreaking Dog training Dog Socialization Working dog USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Doug USS Yorktown (CV-10) The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Border Collie Crate training EastEnders Nintendogs Mixed-breed dog Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Daylight saving time Kodocha Shaggy dog story Fancy rat Avenue Q Golden Retriever Ren and Stimpy WNNX (FM) USS Wasp (CV-18) Care Bears Skinny Puppy Obedience training Dean Koontz German Shepherd Dog The Catcher in the Rye L.
