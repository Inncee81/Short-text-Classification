she pees everywhere how do you tarin dogs i have a new dog and she is so much harder to train then my other one was how did you train yours so you buy a crate and you put her in at night she'll need to go out before you got to bed she'll likely need to go out again at approx am and then likely by am immediately when you let her out take her outside i do not lead puppies from the crate to the door i either have the crate by the door and lead them out or i pick them up and carry them to the door the less chance they get to pee on the carpet the better off you are there is something very wonderful about peeing on carpet i believe when you are a puppy i take them out approx every hour no matter what they are doing if they are eating playing sleeping etc i take them out to pee i have a bell tied to the door that i ring when i open the door letting them know that the ringing of the bell will open the door when they go out you go out with them then you are standing right there and know that they peed and you can praise them praise is what is going to get them housetrained when you are inside you watch them like a hawk if she starts to pee you say no peepee outside you pick her up and you take her outside give her a minute to recoup from the surprise and you let her finish peeing and then you praise her if you can't watch her you crate her when you go away you crate her you don't put any paper or anything in the crate you don't want her thinking that it's okay to go in the crate just like you don't want her thinking it's okay to go in the big crate the house when you are outside and watering the garden and you see her pee tell her good girl go pee pee every chance you can have to tell her she is good for peeing outside is a point toward being housetrained if i have a dog that isn't getting it i put their water dish outside puppies find it much easier to tell you that they want a drink of water than they do to tell you that they have to pee if you are going out for a drink of water you might just as well pee while you are out there Dog training Humphrey Bogart Crate training RuneScape quests Ron and Fez The Shining (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Catcher in the Rye Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Poker jargon Sin City Toilet humour Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Ersatz Elevator Jackass: The Movie Aerial (dance move) The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Friends Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Winning Streak Fire fighting Sento Theory of conduct Futurama (TV series - season 2) New York Knicks Trapped in the Closet Muslim ibn Aqeel G-Man (Half-Life) Lisa the Vegetarian Mnemonic Futurama (TV series - season 5) Ocean's Twelve Otello Brian Griffin Grandview, U.S.A.
