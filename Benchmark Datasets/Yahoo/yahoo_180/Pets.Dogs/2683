i'm scared to put my golden on prednisone for what my vet thinks might be an immune disease but not for sur my dog got sick for about a week really high fever very lethargic no appetite had no diarrhea no vomiting she was having a hard time getting up and looked really stiff took her to specialist did all kinds of tests and came back with what she called as mediated immune disease affecting her joints now my dog seems fine and back to normal the vet still wants to put her on prednisone just in case but i feel like that may be more harmful to her especially if what she had was just a really bad bug and i have read quite a bit about prednisone that scares me i dont want it to do more harm than good or to give her something that she may not even need if she seems fine right now then i would wait to see if she has another episode before putting her on the prednisone it is a very useful but powerful drug and has a lot of side effects including weight gain increased thirst and urination diabetes and others of course it is entirely up to you but i'm just telling you what i would do good luck and hope your dog keeps feeling fine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Diabetes mellitus Prostate cancer Diarrhea Stomach cancer Diabetes insipidus Asthma Adverse effect (medicine) Cancer Anorexia nervosa Rocky Mountain spotted fever Urinary incontinence Equine conformation Crohn's disease Dehydration Aspergillosis Tuberculosis Chronic fatigue syndrome Diabetic neuropathy Malaria Glucocorticoid Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Hyperglycemia Hepatitis Hypertension Ebola Myasthenia gravis Autoimmune diseases Atkins Nutritional Approach Chemotherapy Nutrition Ulcerative colitis Anthrax Gout Chlorpromazine Insulin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Immunosuppressive drug Leukemia Osteoporosis Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Bone marrow transplant Cholera AIDS Rheumatoid arthritis Charles Darwin's illness Allergy Leptospirosis Fever Diabetic nephropathy Adjustable gastric band Serotonin Schistosomiasis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lassa fever Bipolar disorder Foodborne illness Sulfasalazine Marburg virus Dieting Ehrlichiosis Paracetamol Alzheimer's disease Animal testing Chocolate Theory of conduct Dietary fiber Chagas disease Addison's disease Endometriosis Ferret Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Osteoarthritis Poker jargon Multiple myeloma Doxepin Vitamin C Hepatitis C Coeliac disease Hyperthermia Obstetrics Obesity Clozapine Antiviral drug Medicine Yellow fever Psoriasis Dexamethasone Gastroparesis Antipsychotic
