weeing indoors iv got a year old jack russell and a wk old jack russell the older one was house trained up until we got the puppy he saw her doing it and started doing it again himself they both stopped and started barking to be let outside which was great but now they have gone back to weeing in the house again any ideas or advice first and foremost it is worth getting the vet to check them over although water infections are more common in females they can also occur in males it is however likely that your dogs are scent marking your male could simply be at his peak now and believes he is ready to take over leadership whichever scenareo you have the answer is the same first let's throw out one popular myth neutering is not guaranteed to stop this neither will rubbing the dogs nose in the urine the dog will simply not understand this at all clean up very thoroughly anywhere where your dogs could possibly have urinated in the house i always recommend blotting up the wet with an old towel or kitchen paper until the area is more or less dry then clean with either a pet accident cleaner or biological washing powder and rinse the area thoroughly never use cleaning products with amonia or bleach in them to the dog these chemicals smell similar to urine the dog then thinks another dog has urinated on his patch and will urinate on the same spot again if you find either dog has urinated in the wrong place and you did not see it happen say nothing and calmly clean up if you catch either dog in the act don't make eye contact or talk to your dog silently lead him her out to the garden or wherever s he is meant to toilet by the collar if s he then toilets in the right place praise him her immediately for getting it right then quietly clean up the accident indoors whenever your dog gets it right and toilets outside praise him her every time if s he gets it wrong indoors clean up and say nothing they will soon learn that good things happen when they get it right good luck o Housebreaking Dog Fancy rat Dog training Menstrual cup Shaggy dog story Toilet Hamster Toilet humour Tattoo Pet skunk Kimberly-Clark Corporation Urinary incontinence Toilet paper Domestic rabbit Urine Urinal Sin City Upholstery Sento Social rule Euphemism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Washroom Dog agility Ben Johnson (athlete) Menstrual cycle Rabies Air pollution Dry cleaning Clothing Animal communication Towel Tag Hand washing American lobster Guinea pig Salad Fingers 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Milton H.
