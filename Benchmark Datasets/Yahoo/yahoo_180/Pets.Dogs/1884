i want an american bulldog since my sister got a bichon frise years ago i was only allowed a small dog so i got a jack russell this time last year i love my jr but i really want a power breed dog like an american bulldog aswell the bichon is not very active and my jr is so i want a good athletic dog my parent won't allow me to get another dog because it's too much and they say i won't take them out but i will i always get put off by taking out the small dogs because they bark like crazy at other dogs but they do go out at least once a day hopefully an american bulldog would become pack leader and put the little guys in their place lol how can i convince my mom to let me get one of these great dogs she has never even seen one but is put off by the 'pit bulls are horrible' reputation oh yeah my sister does not take out her dog me and my brother end up having to you said that the dogs go out at least once a day once a day is not enough you need to take the dogs out a few times a day do you go to the bathroom only once a day now as to convincing your parents into letting you have an abt i think the only thing you can really do is keep taking care of the dogs that you already have start showing them a lot of attention maybe start earning money to pay for their food clean up after them and just love them i am sure you already do some or all of those things but that is all i can think of i guess you could just bring one home and be like mom can i keep him lol btw someone needs to educate your mom on pitbulls i have owned pitbulls all my life my year old grandma has had pitbulls her whole life and her pitbull is a huge part of her life my pitbull is a part of my family she is just another one of my kids i couldn't imagine life without her any dog can be mean and bite people pitbulls are just more heard about because when they do bite usually from being mistreated it is talked about more you don't see in the newspaper rat terrier bit man but you would see it if it was a pitbull i would say that only about of all daily dog bites in the world each day come from pitbulls you just don't hear about the rest of them Pit bull American Pit Bull Terrier Dog Terrier The Fairly OddParents Havanese Garfield Shaggy dog story Phoebe Buffay's songs KaBlam!
