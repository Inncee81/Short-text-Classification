is it okay we have a fenched yard a big doghouse tons of toys cool grass and a cold porch and a sunsetter is it okay for my month old golden retriever puppy to live outside i want her to be inside more than anything but my dad and grandparents say no my mom agrees and so does my brother my dog gets a lot of excersize everyday we take long walks and play a lot i play with her all the time its not my choice wow people turn on you really fast on here dogs have lived outside while the people live inside for centuries it's great that your dog has a nice backyard to live in what's just as important is that he has lots of interaction with his pack if you can't spend plenty of time with him every day then no it's probably not a good idea i think some outdoor dogs have a better deal than some indoor dogs because they're able to spend more time with their people so if you can play with him if you can take your homework outside if you can take him for walks if you can take him on family adventures i think he'd have a great life even living outside Housebreaking Shaggy dog story Dog training Doug Spot the Dog Garfield Swimming pool Socialization The Life and Times of Juniper Lee KaBlam!
