i need some advice on what to do with this situation there are these little gangster black kids across my street and they always come over and pick on my dogs they think they are super bad but they're only like yrs of age they'll spit at my dogs and try to poke them with sticks yesterday i saw one of the kids jump on my fence and was taunting my dogs and then when i came out and i told them not to mess with my dogs they just said what are you going to do about it i don't know what to do because it seems that their parents don't even care is there something i could do to make them stop it's getting to the point where i just want to break them i know their race doesn't matter and now that i think about it some people might find that racist but i am not so i apologize to those that may get offended anyway i am going to put of come cameras and when they do it again i'll get the cops thanks peeps first off i have to hand it to you for your self control if anyone ever disrespected my dog like that i dont think i would be able to control myself and they would probably get a bullet in the head personally if one of these kids with wonderful parents asked me a question like that he would get a serious beating he would never forget you need to call the police and let these punks incriminate themselves the cops probably are going to brush it aside and tell the kids to leave the dogs alone and the kids will come back the next day videotape these future malt liquor drinkers doing what they do and then show them to your lawyer or at the very least file a civil complaint i would make it my personal mission in life to press charges to the full extent of the law and even hire a lawyer to help me sue their families the one thing i will say is that if you have little yipper dogs that just stand at the fence and bark all day long its not really helping your problem Humphrey Bogart Sin City Escape from New York Reservoir Dogs EastEnders The Life and Times of Juniper Lee 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Mumia Abu-Jamal Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Futurama (TV series - season 5) Plame affair Minor characters in Seinfeld Great Teacher Onizuka The Inside Dog training Avenue Q True Crime: Streets of LA Shaggy dog story The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Theory of conduct Friends Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Vegeta One Piece minor characters Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Military unrest since the Fiji coup of 2000 The Untouchables Charles Graner Evan Mecham Aerial (dance move) Russian joke American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Brian Griffin Joke AFI 100 Years series The Apprentice 2 One (Voyager episode) Rodney King American Psycho Karl Rove Piccolo Junior Saga Past teachings of Prem Rawat Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Surveillance Transactional analysis Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Dog Teachers (film) Kender Laura Schlessinger Silent Night, Deadly Night The Body (Short Story) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Sydney Riot of 1879 Whose Line Is It Anyway?
