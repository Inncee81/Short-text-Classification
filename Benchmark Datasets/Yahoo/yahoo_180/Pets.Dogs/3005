fear aggression in week old puppy just picked up a litter of puppies that were being housed amongst broken lawn tractors and cars they are weeks old terrier and only god knows what else mixes puppy a female is terrified and is being very aggressive normally i would just let the dogs work it out among themselves but am leery to this time my own dogs are a yo husky neutered a female great pryneese spayed and a week old saint bernard they are much greater in size so i do not want to let them handle her if it can be avoided even though i do not believe they would ever hurt her just pin her and make her yelp but that actually leads to my next reason she is scared of them due to their size she is super with dogs her own size no aggression at all anyway how can i keep her from going into attack mode from fear until she realizes they will not hurt her i am almost positive once she realizes this she will be ok thanks but she is not agressive toward me at all she prefers to be on my lap i want to know how to keep her non aggressive long enough for her to realize my dogs will not hurt her good for you for taking on the responsibilities of a litter of stray pups not just a job but an adventure i'm sure your best bet is going to be to get a crate preferably wire and then have her in the crate where she is safe yet unable to get at the other dogs place the crate in a communal area of the house and allow her to a get used to being in the crate for short periods of time b get used to being in the crate with the other dogs outside the crate i would suggest maybe having her in the living room in the crate while you watch tv with the other dogs lounging around i'm sure it will be a bit chaotic at first while she talks trash from inside the crate and the others loom around sniffing but you're looking to safely get her used to be around the other dogs and realize that she's safe i'd do that for a few days then perhaps start socializing her with the youngest dog first also she will learn from the other dogs how they interact with one another and perhaps when she's calmer and feeling less fearful she will take the cue from them best of luck Housebreaking Dog Dog training Socialization Hamster Domestic rabbit Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gray Wolf Guinea pig Pit bull Pet skunk Ferret Brian Griffin Social rule Beethoven (film) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Crash Bandicoot Kodocha Fox hunting Fancy rat Skinny Puppy Dog agility Breastfeeding Internet fraud Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Oh My Goddess!
