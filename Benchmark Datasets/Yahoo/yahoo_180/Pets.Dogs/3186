the alpha dog theory i have one dog book that teaches the alpha dog theory and another that says the alpha dog thing is outdated and only positive training like clicker training should be used so which is right or are they both right that would depend on what the book considers alpha dog most books training methods are based on the traditional alpha dog theory suggesting alpha roles scruffing shaking yelling and other aversives physical punishments as discipline usually it is justified by saying that this is the kind of discipline an alpha wolf would use in the pack what these books fail to mention is that they are based on observations of unrelated captive wolf packs and that such behaviors as alpha roles are not typical of a normal wild wolf pack most reputable trainers today realize that an alpha roll and other similar training methods not only don't work and damage the dog human bond in the process but they are a good way to get bitten keep in mind that clicker training is not the only positive training method positive methods work better and they are nothing new they've been around for years in punishment based training the dog learns slowly that anything that isn't what the handler is looking for earns them a pop on the training collar this means that the handler is spending a lot of time looking and waiting for the dog to make a mistake and telling the dog that that behavior is not what they are looking for it's much easier and far more motivating to tell a dog or person when they've done something right rather than punish them for every time they do something wrong take heeling for example heel is a very definite position and there are a lot of wrong positions it's much easier to tell the dog that that one position is the correct one by giving a reward of some kind whenever the dog is in that position and not rewarding the incorrect positions than to spend a lot of time telling the dog that this position and that position and this other position are all wrong by popping them with the choke chain while waiting for the dog to figure out what that one correct position is the past ten years have seen a huge surge in the number of owners and trainers using positive methods because they work so much better than the old and more abusive punishment based methods positive methods aren't simply bribe for a treat based either praise and other rewards such as getting to chase that darn rabbit if it is safe for the dog to do so are also just as effective as food treats and if used properly can result in a dog that will ignore other distractions because chances are pretty darn good that mom or dad has something even better and positive methods don't mean that you aren't being a leader either they simply mean that you are being a leader by controlling the resources that the dog has access to rather than by physically overpowering or punishing the dog i use positive methods and my dogs do get consequences for ignoring me or not following commands promptly but i don't have to hit them or choke them in order to let them know that they made the wrong choice Obedience training Dog Fox hunting Gray Wolf Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Clicker training Dog agility Soul Randomness Reinforcement Housebreaking Scientific method Utilitarianism Francis Crick Spanking Theodicy Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Simone Weil Philosophy of language Ethics Doomsday argument Tag Goodness and value theory Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Motivation Procrastination Ferret Poker jargon Social rule Objective-C Economics Renormalization Contract Cat Neuro-linguistic programming Addiction Schutzhund Second language acquisition Game show God Emperor of Dune Alexander Technique Divorce Martial art Kim Possible Meaning of life Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Traumatic incident reduction Falsifiability Normal distribution Aikido Drug addiction Sin Quantum mechanics Free will Religion Debugging Milton H.
