i just got a puppy and she is refusing to go potty outside she will only go in her cage help no matter how long i have her outside for she waits until she is back in her cage to go how can i fix this problem no matter how long my guess is that if you wait long enough she will eventually go where you want her to waiting long enough may be a couple of hours which means she already has great bladder control which means she'll be realllllly easy to housetrain lucky you there are two things you need to look at is her crate small enough a puppy will go in a crate more readily if it is too big and if it has things to soak up or bury the mess in get a smaller crate where did you get her puppymill petstore and pups raised in unclean surroundings pen with a pile of newspapers or pineshavings are more likely to be messy it then becomes your job to teach her that being clean is a good thing you may need to take an entire weekend from friday evening until monday morning to dedicate yourself to getting her housetrained during that time you need to watch her at all times when you are not asleep to set yourself up for success you'll want to make sure she has lots of opportunities as well as need to potty you can blenderize canned dogfood in with water baited water so she drinks lots hold off on feeding her or halve her feeding so she's hungry and she'll drink more use her food as treats when she succeeds in pottying where she needs to watch her in her crate when she looks like she may be needing to potty dash her outside and wait you've set up the weekend to curing the problem so waiting an hour or two isn't a bad thing eventually she will go when she does celebrate its a party give her praise and cookies etc etc during the weekend training know that if she pottys in the crate it is because you weren't watching roll up a newspaper and whap yourself on the head Housebreaking Dog training Crate training Urinary incontinence Toilet humour Social rule 2000 Australian Grand Prix Poker jargon Hamster Ron and Fez Dairy RuneScape quests The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Trapping Domestic rabbit Shaggy dog story Cuisine of Denmark Sydney Riot of 1879 Futurama (TV series - season 2) Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Menstrual cup Kosher foods Blonde on Blonde Textile manufacturing Operation Market Garden Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Avenue Q Shark My Little Pony Worms weapons and tools Garfield Scooby-Doo Thanksgiving The Ashlee Simpson Show Full Metal Panic?
