food aggression i have an month old black lab mix we got her from the humane society about months ago we haven't had too many problems with her besides the begging at the table eating out of the garbage she's pooped on the floor numerous times within minutes of coming in the house after minutes walks all that out of the way now we have a new problem she has been awesome when it comes to her food up until this past week she just got out of her first heat and now she's a different dog it seems we don't know what she is mixed with but it is starting to make us nervous we have boys and it seems that all of a sudden she's barking and growling at the kids if they walk by her when she's got her chew bones or rawhide chews she's even tried nipping at my youngest yr old what is going on with her is her personality changing completely or is this just a stage we can't have her biting one of the kids know what i mean i'm starting to get nervous the h s released her to us with the promise that they would call us in june july for her spay apparently the vet was on vacation and would be backed up when he got back yeah i know real nice they finally called us on july th no kidding her appointment is next thursday to get spayed i would spay her right away if you plan to keep her that would help a little to calm her and you have to stop this problem at all costs it is a territorial dominance issue she owns the food she owns the toy etc so she is telling the less dominant members of her pack to stay away it's dangerous temperament is a genetic trait because she is reaching maturity her temperament is showing and it is dominant some people try to train it out by making the children dominant members of the pack letting them go through doors first have them eat in front of her and feed her and even by pushing the dog to the ground rolling it over and growling at it but training will never change the personality only control it your dog will always be prone to this behavior but might possibly be trained to control it lots of people with pits swear they are sweet until they turn or so and start showing their adult temperament it's just a genetic issue it can't be changed only trained all that said if it were my dog i would get rid of it you have to put the child first if you do keep the dog then spay it that might help a little and get it trained that might help a little too but whatever you do it will always have that instinct in the back of it's genes so be aware of that to keep your children protected Cat Dog training Domestic rabbit Fancy rat Housebreaking Ferret Domestication Elephant Pet skunk Gray Wolf German Shepherd Dog Hamster Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Stuttering Horse Socialization Breastfeeding The Fairly OddParents The Contender (television series) Garfield Autism Obedience training 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Pit bull Brown Bear Insulin Guinea pig Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Kakapo Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Time Machine Tobacco smoking Urinary incontinence G-Man (Half-Life) Kangaroo Tooth enamel RuneScape quests Controversies in autism Tooth Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Comanche Aerial (dance move) The Ashlee Simpson Show Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Amazing Race Milton H.
