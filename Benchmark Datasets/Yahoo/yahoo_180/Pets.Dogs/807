should i breed my doxies i've got two male mini doxies before i get them fixed i was thinking about finding females to breed them to but i don't know exactly if they are up to par with some of the breeders around me or if anyone would even be interested in using them as stud dogs but when i purchased my first from the breeder he told me that he was almost perfect and he's a gorgeous dog and the other is real pretty thick coat very outgoing and sweet i don't know though how to get started with that whole thing or if i should even bother with it i don't want to get one of them fixed and then regret it in the long run ya know thank you for all the responses i thought about it myself and i figure that maybe it's time to send both of them under the knife instead of dealing with it later on i think i'll get them started in field trials earthdog instead of course the breeder is going to tell you he's perfect they want to sell you the dog what championships has he won you do show him don't you owning stud dogs is not the easiest thing in the world they pee everywhere and hump everything they howl roam dig circle and generally make nuisances of themselves they can be agressive with each other and people they have been known to hurt themselves trying to get out to the girls they can be injured mating intact dogs have a higher risk for certain cancers the stress of sexual frustration can injure a dog's health remember that they can smell the girls from miles off they can go off their feed worrying about and trying to get at the females millions of doxies are killed in shelters almost perfect dogs die in shelters everyday because there just aren't enough homes stud owners are just as responsible as the mother's owners please neuter them it really is the best thing for them Domestic rabbit Dog Cat EastEnders Hamster Dog show God Emperor of Dune Pet skunk Minor Harry Potter Beasts Humphrey Bogart Breed registry Mixed-breed dog Gray Wolf Social rule Dobermann Manx (cat) German Shepherd Dog Shaggy dog story Kodocha Jon Secada Guinea pig Puppy mill Betting (poker) Staffordshire Bull Terrier Working dog Labrador Retriever Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Havanese Insurance English Springer Spaniel Dog breed Philosophy of language Sunday Silence Dog breeding Brian Griffin Sin City Boston Red Sox Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stud poker 2005 Kashmir earthquake American Pit Bull Terrier Theory of conduct Microeconomics Greg Valentine Marilyn Monroe Basset Hound Great Dane Livestock Australian Cattle Dog Border Terrier Milton H.
