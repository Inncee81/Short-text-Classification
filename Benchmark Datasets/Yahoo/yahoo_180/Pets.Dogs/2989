how come my dog chews shoes when i play with her answer please i really wanna know why it just seems a little weird to me do ya if u answer thanjs much because you let her if you don't want this behavior to continue once she chews on your shoes stop playing and don't pay any attention to her give her a sit command and place her in it if she doesn't do it herself every time she goes after your shoes stop the activity and withold attention she will learn that chewing and attacking your shoes gets her no attention and will stop doing it this is not a good behavior there may be a time where she gets underfoot of an elderly person and can really hurt them you need to stop this behavior make sure when she's doing something right that you also praise her she will learn what gets her attention and what doesn't don't hit her or anything like that that will only make it worse and could make her afraid of your hand plus hitting your dog is still giving them attention wether negative or positive your dog doesn't know the difference be loving and firm with your wants and most of all be consistant the result of this activity is always the same no matter what that is the best way to teach any dog Dog training Blackjack Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Shaggy dog story Traumatic incident reduction Milton H.
