chihuahua's hind legs i just got an week old chihuahua his name is xavier amadeus anyways he will be running around all happy and everything and then his hind legs will kind of give out he is very clumsy i know that most puppies are but its almost like he has temporary loss of his hind legs does anybody know what could be wrong or is his back legs just tired should i be worried or will he grow out of it should i take him to go get checked out he doesnt seem to be in any pain and i dont hear any clicking comming from him i would chances are it's just normal puppy clumsiness but if it's really as bad as you're making it sound it might be a bit of nerve damage might have happened by accident by a litter mate stepping on him weird as long as it's not causing serious mobility problems though i wouldn't be too worried just be sure to get it checked to make sure Equine conformation Prostate cancer Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Dog Traumatic brain injury Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Childbirth Fecal incontinence Dog training Penis Skinny Puppy Homestar Runner Manx (cat) Fancy rat 2000 Australian Grand Prix Multiple sclerosis Hearing impairment Horse gait Social rule Debugging Professor X Cat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Doom enemies Tire Rocko's Modern Life Drowning Chlorpromazine Fast bowling Characters in the Smurfs Eddie Guerrero Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Hamster Guinea pig Marilyn Monroe Marching band Radiation therapy Blood (computer game) Chess strategy and tactics "Weird Al" Yankovic Avenue Q Kangaroo The Contender (television series) Stopping power Chess terminology Tarantula Havanese Theory of conduct Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Legend of Zelda series enemies Charles Darwin's illness Kodocha Tasmanian Devil Danny Phantom (character) Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Piccolo Junior Saga One Tree Hill (TV series) Headcrab Poker jargon Jon Secada Baroque chess Duchenne muscular dystrophy Anxiety Tag Biped Gray Wolf Kim Possible Unemployment Cancer Philosophical skepticism Hip fracture 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Shaggy dog story Escape from New York Stuttering The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Inspector Gadget Tetrapod Milton H.
