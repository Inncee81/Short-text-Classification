at what age should you get your german shepherd's hips checked and how often my german shepherd is turning year old in a few days and i was wondering if this would be a good time to get his hips checked or if it is unnecessary at this age i have never had them checked before i know that shepherds are prone to hip problems so i just want to be sure that he is getting this properly monitored also how often should i have this done hip xrays are usually done by your local veterinarian and then sent into ofa orthopedic foundation for animals ofa will have veterinarians who are radiologists review the films and come to a consensus while an xray can be done anytime they will only give a permanent ofa rating and number to a dog after he has reached the age of months old a dog younger will receive a preliminary rating but this is not valid after the age of months the reason why ofa will not give a permanent concensus of findings until months is because many breeds of dogs are still growing and hips can change significantly and affect the grading process even at months the accuracy is about but this is much greater than one taken at months i would recommend waiting until the dog is months if you are considering xraying because the dog is having some symptoms like stiff hips or stilted or limping gait while walking i would xray to get a diagnosis sever cases can be diagnosed as early as months but you cannot clear a dog until it is years old Hip fracture Prostate cancer Hip dysplasia Dog Border Terrier Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Equine conformation Fancy rat Asthma German Shepherd Dog Bipolar disorder Heartworm Domestic rabbit English Springer Spaniel Asperger syndrome Docking Osteoarthritis Medicine Pneumonia Ehrlichiosis Diabetes mellitus Horse Paget's disease of bone Mixed-breed dog Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Hypoglycemia Dobermann Myocardial infarction Clinical depression Guinea pig Crohn's disease HIV test Growth hormone treatment Rabies Malignant melanoma Radiology Dog agility Tobacco smoking Osteoporosis Breast cancer Wikipedia Labrador Retriever Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Stomach cancer American Cocker Spaniel Autism Colorectal cancer Radiation therapy Abortion Leptospirosis Pet skunk Growth hormone deficiency Controversies in autism Chronic fatigue syndrome Greyhound Multiple sclerosis Psychosis Cat Medical analysis of circumcision Anorexia nervosa Rocky Mountain spotted fever Debugging Transsexuality Expert system Puberty Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004 Iditarod Decompression sickness Belgian Shepherd Dog Tibetan Terrier Domestication Tooth enamel Information Technology Infrastructure Library Narcolepsy Consensus Central processing unit Hepatitis Paracetamol Animal testing Gray Wolf Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Scoliosis Dairy Iliotibial band syndrome Fox hunting Turner syndrome Endometriosis Motion picture rating system Cerebral palsy American Pit Bull Terrier Essential tremor Cardiac stress test Renal cell carcinoma Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Chlorpromazine Cystic fibrosis
