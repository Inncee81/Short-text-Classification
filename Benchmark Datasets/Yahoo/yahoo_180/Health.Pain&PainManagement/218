neck shoulder pain killing me i started getting a little twinge of a pain in my neck monday noonish now it's friday and not only has it not gotten any better it has actually gotten worse it went from being a little twinge to being an all out war on my muscle from the base of my head to my shoulder i went to the er today and the doc gave me lortab but that didn't touch the pain and actually made me seriously sick to my stomach felt like vomiting weak slow heart beat and breathing cold heat only temporarily eases the pain some but not much the massage head on full heat in the shower works while i'm directly under it but as soon as i move the pain comes rushing back i can't barely move my head much i can't look up or touch my chin to my chest without wanting to cry the muscle actually feels like its hot inside i had a migraine last night as well i took tylenol and motrin during the course of the day yesterday and nothing seemed to help much at all any advice on what my next step should be the pain is well a pain it throbs like with my heart beat and when i bend over to pick something up it aches right up into my head it feels hot but not like a burning hot like a fever hot and that's deep inside so it's not even something that can be felt with my hand i have had constant heat on it since getting home and it's just doesn't help much at all try a heating pad with a damp towel inside of the bag moist heat helps the best and you should skip the tylenol and stick with motrin i know how you feel i've hurt myself in the same spot and its very painful try the moist heat i hope that it helps if not then go see your family doctor Massage Professional wrestling holds Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hyperthermia Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation First aid Breastfeeding Professional wrestling throws Pain Diving Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pneumonia The Inside Migraine Myocardial infarction Professional wrestling attacks Fecal incontinence Mattress The Shining (film) Paracetamol Professional wrestling slang Gastroesophageal reflux disease Sin City Sento Weight training Urinary incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Swingout Billboard Hot 100 Fire fighting Tai Chi Chuan Cluster headache One Piece minor characters Breaststroke Angina Richard Rahl Piccolo Junior Saga Traumatic brain injury Babe Ruth Milton H.
