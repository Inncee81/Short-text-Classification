what are some things to do to make my back stop hurting i have kind of a big chest so to speak and it caused me to have a curved spine but i dont have scollyosis they said nothing was wrong except that it is slightly curved becasue my chest makes me slouch my back has been bothering me ever since before then but they said nothing is wrong it always hurts but not a big deal just like in that annoying way you know if i stretch nothing happens do you think if someone just gives me a quick massage that would help or some sort of stretching i dont know what to do a massage could greatly help as well as applying a heating pad or other source of warmth however these will just treat the symptom not address the cause it sounds like you may need to try wearing a more supportive bra sports bras or underwire bras may help a little if they don't and the problem is really bad you may need to wear a back brace before you freak out modern ones are worn under your clothes and can't easily be seen even though you don't have scoliosis it will help keep your back straight which will eliminate a lot of the pain Brassiere Equine conformation Massage First aid Fast bowling Theory of conduct Undergarment Breastfeeding Professional wrestling match types Carpal tunnel syndrome Strap-on dildo Professional wrestling holds History of corsets Bicycle brake systems Repetitive strain injury Glossary of ballet terms Volleyball Utilitarianism Sin City Osteoarthritis Social rule Pitaten Mattress Medicine Sciatica Upholstery Debugging Iliotibial band syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Jackass: The Movie Traumatic brain injury Scientology beliefs and practices Piccolo Junior Saga Chiropractic Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 24 Hours of Le Mans Violin Fencing Cramp Aerial (dance move) Skateboarding trick Quotation mark Embalming 2000 Australian Grand Prix Physical therapy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Reflexology Vegeta Car handling Blood (computer game) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist New York Giants The Apprentice 2 Horse tack Professional wrestling throws Human position Mastitis Myocardial infarction Gramophone record Social aspects of clothing Glen Jacobs Grunge music XML Tai Chi Chuan Pneumonia The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Manual transmission Milton H.
