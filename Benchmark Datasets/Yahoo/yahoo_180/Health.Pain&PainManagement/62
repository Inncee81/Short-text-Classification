every time i stand up sit up my head throbs times and stops what the title says basically it's not that i'm sitting laying down for elongated periods of time i can sit for seconds stand up and my head will start throbbing a couple of time and quit it's not very painful but enough to be noticeable i don't get tunnel vision either so i don't think it's a case of standing up too quickly what do you guys think i have experienced this before too i do have low blood pressure sometimes or also i tend to feel this way when my blood glucose level is either too low or too high i am diabetic so those things do affect blood flow it could be nothing or it could be several things best thing is to go to a doctor preferably begin with a neurologist who can maybe do a brain scan and rule out anything serious with your nervous system or an impending mini stroke or something once that is ruled out i would go to a major medical center and get an appointment with a pulmonologist or cardiac specialist who can take it from there and rule several things and further refer you to other departments within the medical center until you are satisfied that you have found the correct cause i know it sounds extreme but that little bit can be a sign of mini strokes and they can lead to more dangerous problems hope everything goes ok maybe it is just a simple thing that can be diagnosed and will eventually go away but do not put off seeing a doctor and soon waiting can lead to worse problems down the road if you notice it then it is not weird to seek medical advice good luck Stroke Hypoglycemia Diabetes mellitus Medicine Hypertension Blood pressure Traumatic brain injury Insulin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diabetic neuropathy Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Myocardial infarction Decompression sickness Terri Schiavo Cardiac arrhythmia Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Epilepsy Multiple sclerosis Diabetic retinopathy First aid Aortic dissection Prostate cancer Coma Stuttering Brain Dyslexia Alzheimer's disease Syringomyelia Paget's disease of bone Physical examination Dieting Lupus erythematosus Bipolar disorder Drowning Obstetrics Migraine Chlorpromazine Shock Folic acid Panic attack Muscle Malaria Pain Breastfeeding Tobacco smoking Gastroparesis Lumbar puncture Angina Autism Adult attention-deficit disorder Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Anxiety Acromegaly Atrial septal defect Stomach cancer Asthma Dialysis Cardiovascular disease Aspartame Propranolol Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Atkins Nutritional Approach Cardiac output Carpal tunnel syndrome Dog training Balance disorder Turner syndrome Equine conformation Social rule Sleep Intracranial pressure Theory of conduct Publicly funded medicine Aerial (dance move) Terri Schiavo timeline Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Obesity Autoimmune diseases National Institutes of Health Transactional analysis Endometriosis Animal testing Addiction Glaucoma Dog agility Psychosis Pulmonology Milton H.
