how can i get rid of these leg cramps during lifeguard school today i had to lift a lb weight fromt the bottom of the pool on the way up my right leg suddenly exploded with pain like my femur was being twisted i don't think it was a normal leg cramp because as soon as i even wiggled my leg i was wracked with pain again and it wouldn't go away for a long while so i was left looking like an idiot on deck wincing with pain this happens every time i attempt the weight challenge and i need a remedy because if i can't bring the weight to the top then i fail the course and can't be a lifeguard a lot of times athletes get cramps from lack of salt in the body i am not sure by your message if by the time you have to do the exercise with the weights have you been exercising for a while or is it the first exercise of the day if it is the first exercise of the day you may need to warm up a little better one should not do any kind of sport without warming up properly hope this helps if you have any more questions you can message me Weight training Cramp Swimming Diving Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling holds Iliotibial band syndrome Suplex Drowning Diving suit Horizontal bar Aerial (dance move) USS Tunny (SS-282) Bicycle Acupuncture Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bodybuilding Running Professional wrestling throws Exercise Marching band Poker jargon Triathlon Sport rowing USS Whale (SS-239) Swimming pool Hip dysplasia Professional wrestling attacks Piccolo Junior Saga Spanking Urinary incontinence Paragliding Carburetor Brassiere Dialysis Chronic fatigue syndrome USS Tang (SS-306) Characters of Naruto Autism Muscle Boxing Undergarment Swingout Lifeguard Escape from New York Fast bowling Creatine Mixed martial arts Menstrual cup Obesity USS Picuda (SS-382) Suspension bondage Clinical depression Powerlifting Human adaptation to space Theodicy Ben Johnson (athlete) Trapping Stretching Pole vault Water polo Atkins Nutritional Approach Appeal Osteoarthritis Hiberno-English Make money fast Tyrannosaurus rex 1896 Summer Olympics Blood (computer game) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Bottlenose Dolphin Recumbent bicycle Anchor USS Forrestal (CVA-59) Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Dieting Anal sex USS Trigger (SS-237) Naval mine Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne USS Yorktown (CV-10) Chicago White Sox Combine (Half-Life 2) Anorexia nervosa Ripped Pants Dog Hal Trosky Hulk Hogan Casualty lifting Team Fortress Classic WNNX (FM) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Professor X Weight loss Mattress USS Tilefish (SS-307) Kodocha Insomnia
