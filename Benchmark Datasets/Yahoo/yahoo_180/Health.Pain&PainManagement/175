lower leg pain i have been having lower leg pain since february at first it felt like it was going all around my cald muscle and then down the front bone of my leg at the time i had only been taking birth control for a month and the doctor had an doppler ultrasound performed on my leg to rule out a blood clot and it came back as negative plus i've had multiple doctors feel my leg since then and each has assured me repeatly there is no blood clot then i want to a new doctor who had an mri run to make sure the muscle was not torn and it just strained since i was still getting pain i had an emg done to make sure it wasn't my nerves and it was clear so i am at a complete loss i am still having a dull pain in my leg muscle today it felt like it was running down the front of my shin and coming out my arch i am not taking birth control i am a non smoker the area is not bruised swollen hot or red i am about and weigh i gained pounds this year due panic attacks i also work at a job wear i would wear heels and for three months this year had to run up and down the steps at least thirty times a day also i get charlie horses and now just started taking a potassium supplement i am just tired on hurting and almost feel defeated anybody have any suggestions the reason for your pain could be something as simple as muscle imbalances in your leg there's also the possibility that perhaps your foot may have structural abnormalities like a flattened arch which could be causing you to walk differently on that leg a physical therapist would be able to check out your muscles and feet or you could see an orthopedic doctor the fact that you are on your feet a lot and wearing heels which provide very little support or stability makes me think your problem is more mechanical in nature hope this helps Equine conformation Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urinary incontinence Weight training Prostate cancer Multiple sclerosis Professional wrestling holds Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Spina bifida Iliotibial band syndrome Diving Fecal incontinence Boxing Stomach cancer Myocardial infarction Hip fracture High-heeled shoe Orthopedic surgery Clinical depression Obstetrics Carpal tunnel syndrome Tocopherol Breech birth Puberty Stroke Atherosclerosis Childbirth Post Polio syndrome Cancer Medicine Syringomyelia Massage Bruise Cephalic disorder First aid Diabetic neuropathy Becker's muscular dystrophy Professional wrestling slang Group A streptococcal infection Aortic dissection Menstrual cup Folic acid Cardiac stress test Androgen insensitivity syndrome Aerial (dance move) Foot Action potential Scapula Stress fracture Paget's disease of bone Back pain Migraine Duchenne muscular dystrophy Osteopathy Menstrual cycle Diabetes mellitus Stopping power Eye Tyrannosaurus rex Osteoarthritis Colorectal cancer Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Horse Swimming Humerus Insulin Dieting Alexander Technique Enzyme Professional wrestling attacks Turner syndrome Backstroke Cerebellum Elephant Endometriosis Leukemia Ebola Babe Ruth Ben Johnson (athlete) Biped Coeliac disease Poliomyelitis Doom enemies Intracranial pressure Cirrhosis The Contender (television series) Aikido Chiropractic Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
