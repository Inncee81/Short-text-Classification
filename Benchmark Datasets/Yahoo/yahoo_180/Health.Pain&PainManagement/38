what's wrong with my leg i got a pain in my left leg and it seems to be coming from the same area where a vein is popping out and there are other vein visible around it that weren't there before right now my leftfoot seems to be swelling up and the reason i awoke early this morning was because of pain from the swelling in my right foot and knee at first i attributed this to my dancing yesterday but now i'm getting similar feeling in the bridge of my nose i don't know though i agree with a previous poster that you should go to a doc mainly because i've never heard of that feeling on the bridge of your nose i've had swelling in my legs and feet and it does hurt went to my g p about it and he said it was a medication i was taking too much of plus sitting up for too many hours on the puter had a friend whose legs swelled up also and she also had the veins showing she used cocoa butter on those areas and that helped the thing that helps the most is to put your feet up as often as you can watching tv resting in bed reading etc in fact it helps pretty quickly and is a great relief hope this helps you Diving Aerial (dance move) Escape from New York Professional wrestling holds Jon Secada Skateboarding trick Shaggy dog story Paul Is Dead Milton H.
