i have a dish network system and i have a problem i have two tvs and in one tv i am viewing a channel for minuets and then an error sign comes up in the other tv i have another reciver but that tv works just fine the tv that has a problem comes back into view after minutes oh yeah and i have only one dish that controls both recivers and also some bees also circle and land on the dish and i think they go inside it too do you think this is the problem if not what do you think is and how do i fix it and also there are no shadows or trees surrounding it so i know thats not blocking the view the bee's sound far fetched from cutting out the satellites signal but i guess it could be possible if htere are enough of them to actually block the lnb then signal could cut in and out i would also try to disconnect the power cord out of the dvr for about seconds then reapplying the power cord it may be a software issue conflict which is causing a hardware issue of the tuner if this is not the problem then it is very possible that one of the tuners in your dvr is going bad maybe it is getting hot and once it cools it starts back to working if hte bee issue does not get fixed i owuld recommend calling your dish provider and let them know that the signal cuts in and out i hope it all works out for you Digital video recorder High-definition television TiVo Television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Communications satellite Modem Digital television Federal Standard 1037C Radio Direct broadcast satellite Satellite internet Oscilloscope Pirate decryption Apollo Guidance Computer Central processing unit Brain CPU cache Cray-1 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Global Positioning System Windows Vista Windows XP Teletext ZX Spectrum Digital audio broadcasting Low-noise block converter Motorola 68000 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Broadband Internet access Dish Network MP3 Mouse (computing) Password Microsoft Redundant array of independent disks Set-top box Mercury Atlas 6 Windows 2000 RS-232 Mars Polar Lander Home Box Office Urinary incontinence Safety engineering ITV Analog-to-digital converter Antenna (radio) Air traffic control Information Technology Infrastructure Library Impedance matching Buffer overflow SETI TurboGrafx 16 DVD Electrophysiology Xbox 360 X Window System GSM services Logopolis Digital Satellite System Longitude STS-61 Loudspeaker Vacuum tube Microphone Satellite dish TV tuner card Bluetooth Telephone StarChoice Telephone exchange Booting Computer Debugging Software-defined radio SCART Voice over IP MDAC Satellite radio Super Nintendo Entertainment System PaX FireWire Software bug Code division multiple access WWOR-TV Virtual memory Electronic amplifier Kosher foods Commodore 64 PlayStation 2 Laserdisc Revision control Cache MIM-23 Hawk DMX (lighting)
