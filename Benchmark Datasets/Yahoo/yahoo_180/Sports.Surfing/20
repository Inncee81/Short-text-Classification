surfers always take their suits off like that today i went to sausilito its near sf and i just sat on the beach watching some hot surfers well anyways once they get out the water they go to their car and just pull their suit off halfway above their 'you know' and just put a towel around them and take the whole suit off and try to dress with the towel covering and i was just sitting there in front of them and they didnt even try to hide and was standing in front of their car undressing which was pretty hot though but i was just wondering do all surfers undress and show the whole world yea thats what all my friends do and what i do by the way we do it for people like you Sento Social aspects of clothing Sauna Swimming pool Academic dress of Oxford University Surfer Girl Paul Is Dead Surfing Kitesurfing Drag racing Corset Beaches of Hong Kong The Time Machine Jackass: The Movie Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nudity Roxette Diving suit The Beach Boys Changeroom Japanese toilet Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Windsurfing Dude Shake It Off Professional wrestling holds Jackass (TV series) G-Man (Half-Life) Rain Man Menstrual cup Volleyball Gold Coast, Queensland Academic dress Teen Girl Squad Crowd surfing Blood Simple Japanese tea ceremony The Ashlee Simpson Show Indianapolis 500 __douard Manet Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 2) James Hanratty Bethany Hamilton Urban beach Shut Down Volume 2 Milton H.
