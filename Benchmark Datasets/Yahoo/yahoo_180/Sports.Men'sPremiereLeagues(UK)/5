why does sky sports not show more games of the premierleague in iceland you can choose between games at all times it sounds ridiculous that you can watch more football in iceland than in the uk even though the deal is split that still doesn't explain why there are so few games on tv in the uk in iceland there is only one channel with the rights but they broadcast games this season and that is only from the prem league sky will broadcast around games this season and setanta games or around games in total this shucks sucks not shucks under their contract with the fa sky etc are only allowed to show a set number of games the fa are worried that if there were no restrictions too many fans would stay at home and watch the games on tv there aren't many icelanders who fly to england to watch games every week NFL on television National Football League Super Bowl Sky Digital Major League Baseball television contracts The Football League Football (soccer) Philadelphia Eagles Monday Night Football 24 (television) MLB on FOX Fox Broadcasting Company David Beckham Newcastle United F.C.
