am i being unreasonable with the daycare director my kids are in a daycare preschool and have been students there for the past two years they love it i like the teachers and the school it's convenient to where we live they offer an after school program as well so when my oldest starts kindergarten next month he'll be able to be bussed to the same center with the teachers and surroundings he knows and loves however we've had an issue with the director and my youngest son he was nearing four years old when he finally got fully potty trained no accidents ever they transferred him to the three year old classroom with the rest of the kids his age then transferred him back to the older toddler room until he got fully potty trained he got fully potty trained a few months ago but they haven't transferred him over yet saying at the end of august all the kids move up this means he'll only be one year behind instead of two which is just not good enough the director has been out of town for six weeks and supposedly no one can make the decision to move him with the kids his own age the child is starting kindergarten next year and is in the toddler room a full year older than his classmates am i being unreasonable to say that if they don't transfer him to the four year old class not the threes we're withdrawing our kids and putting him somewhere where he can be with kids his age and on his level he's perfectly happy but the classes are done differently the classroom he should be in has a more educational focus while the other is primarily playtime i've spoken with everyone at the school all i'm getting when i ask flat out to talk to the director is that she is aware of the situation and it takes everything in me to keep from yelling well big freakin deal it's a private daycare preschool he's supposed to start kindergarten in a year fall and he's currently in the older two's classroom he's so far behind a year moving him to the room with all the rest of his current classmates will mean he won't complete pre k the class that really focuses on getting them ready for k or he'll be held back a year he's happy where he is but more days than not the most educational thing he does is watch dora the explorer i really don't want to withdraw them they love it they have friends etc i'm just bothered by her lack of availability i can understand the delay most preschool rooms aren't equipped for diaper changing also a lot of places wait until certain dates to move kids that way groups of children move to the next room at the same time it helps with the transition if they move up with a buddy unlike moving up by themselves at thier birthday since they do it that way it probably means they would be out of ratio to move your son up early however in august they should bump him up two grades so to speak not just one Kindergarten Education in the United States Education in Taiwan Education in Germany Education in Japan Education in the People's Republic of China Kimberly-Clark Corporation Education in Romania Education in Australia Kodocha Recess (TV series) Education in Hong Kong Primary education Education in Portugal Columbine High School massacre Hikikomori GED Baby Blues Montessori method Caulfield Grammar School Shaggy dog story Social rule Boston Public Secondary education in Japan School Current teachings of Prem Rawat The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Early childhood education JumpStart Murdock-Portal Elementary School Avenue Q Grade (education) College Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Tripartite System The Ashlee Simpson Show Taipei American School Drama Rugrats Hopkins School The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete Code: Lyoko Dalton McGuinty Laura Schlessinger Ben Johnson (athlete) Miss Saigon Autism Theory of conduct George Burns Scientology beliefs and practices Bilingual education Sesame Street Miami-Dade County Public Schools RuneScape quests Hillary Rodham Clinton Culture of the United States The Sims 2 Graduate school About a Boy The Sims The Karate Kid, Part III Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Education Alexander Technique The Catcher in the Rye Vegeta Education in South Korea Japanese tea ceremony Dog training Time Out of Mind British Rail Class 86 Gwinnett University Center Columbia University University of Virginia Tai Chi Chuan E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.
