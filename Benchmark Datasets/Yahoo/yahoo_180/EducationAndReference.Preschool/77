my son will turn three in september and he doesn't want to go potty how can i do help me please wait wait wait he's not yet you have time don't panic don't push it boys are infamously later in potty training than girls and it is not uncommon for them to well past before they get it or even want to even try to get it there are things you can do to gently get him used to the idea let him sit on a little potty while he watches a video he may accidently go but fuss like he did it on purpose he'll like the praise and may start to show more interest in wanting to potty like a big boy when he does show interest then i suggest these tips let him run around with no bottoms on it'll be easier to catch him before he goes and dash him off to the potty sink the fruit loops worked really well in my house put big boy underwear under pull ups so he gets the feel of underpants how uncomfortable it is when he wets them but you have less mess to clean up but relax he's fine no kid has gone to kindergarten with diapers on good luck Social rule Fecal incontinence SpongeBob SquarePants Undergarment Milton H.
