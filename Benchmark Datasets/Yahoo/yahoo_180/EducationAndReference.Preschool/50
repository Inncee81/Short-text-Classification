i want some activities for kids age i am a teacher in a nuresery my kids are years i want a new good syllubus for them in english language could anyone help even by sites i remember in my primary school we had word cards and in our groups we had to put them together to make a sentance they were just printed out words on a paper which were then laminated we all used to love using them however i'm pretty sure we were a bit older than and lol maybe you could do the same thing with the childrens names to start off with one letter per sheet and they have to use the cards to make their names and then move on to other words as they progress another idea is to use 'magic sand' the children can practice their letters and names in a shallow tray of coloured sand using their fingers to write them perhaps you could write a class story not too long just sit them all down on the carpet and ask them what could happen next and try to encourage them to tell you word for word what to write down then they could draw pictures to go with it afterwards you could always make it about a certain character and each story could be about a day to day activity and you could keep them all in a kind of scrapbook you could always try reading them a short story but replacing one of the words with a nonsense word and asking them what they think it could actually say eg the cat 'strawberries' on the mat and encourage lots of suggestions i hope this helps sorry my suggestions aren't all that great i did try hehe good luck with whatever you decide to do Yu-Gi-Oh!
