which camcorder do you recommend hd or mini dv hi i am part of the vastly growing youtube generation i have done some minor video projects before but i am thinking of expanding onto youtube and buying an new camcorder here are the two i am between canon optura canon hv the canon optura is not hd but still has an impressive picture the canon hv is hd and has an even better picture but costs a good more while i am willing to pay the money i need to know if its worth it to buy an hd camcorder for youtube can youtube play hd please note that i do not have an hdtv or any other appliance that plays hd if you are planning on making small video projects and youtube videos i recommend you buy the optura i have heard good things about the optura it even has a ccd and youtube doesn't even have hd capabilities anyway you probably won't even be able to take advantage of hd features anyway for a couple years due to the fact that it is still new and being developed don't get me wrong the hv is still a nice camera but internet and youtube videos are highly compressed and you will not tell the difference between sd and hd if i were you i would save the extra and spend it on audio equipment or something considering the optura has a microphone input they say that audio is just as important as video edit also there is no point in an hd camera if you have no hdtv because the only difference between hd and sd is resolution so hd video on an sd tv would look no different than sd video on an sd tv there's also the hd dvd that you have to buy too High-definition television Camcorder Digital cinema 8 mm video format Digital photography Digital video Warez Laserdisc VHS DVD Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Digital cinematography Charge-coupled device Videotape Video Xbox DV MPEG-2 Widescreen S-VHS Video codec Stereoscopy Sega Dreamcast MP3 Digital television Gross domestic product Television Digital8 Nintendo Revolution Machinima NTSC Independent film Movie projector Blu-ray Disc Professional video camera Movie camera Hubble Space Telescope Windows Vista PlayStation Portable Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Oscilloscope Anamorphic widescreen Karaoke Surveillance Floppy disk Film Cable television Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis IPod Aspect ratio (image) Moving Picture Experts Group Videoconferencing S__CAM High fidelity Economics Canon (fiction) Microeconomics Star Trek, other storylines ITunes Digital single-lens reflex cameras Stereophonic sound Ocean's Twelve Secure Digital card ATI Technologies Microphone Super Nintendo Entertainment System Screenshot Surround sound Home cinema Sampling frequency Computer and video games Telecine Theory of conduct Sharp Zaurus Apple Computer Chess strategy and tactics Green Day Real Love (song) Internet pornography Camera Copy protection Xbox 360 Super Video CD Inflation Transformer HDV UK Singles Chart Mouse (computing) Videocassette recorder Dolby Digital Nine Inch Nails Audiophile Data compression Windows XP They Might Be Giants
