how can i play a sony mp video cassette without the original camera i recorded it on my camera was stolen i don't remember it's make model and i can't watch any of my home movies from the past like nine years i'd prefer some kind of cassette player instead of having to buy another camera that i won't even be using since we have a new one now i just want to play the old movies i have no idea what to even begin looking for hi your tape is an mm video tape and yes u can play it in any camcorder mm if u don't want to buy another camera u can go to your camera store and ask if they are able to transfer your tapes to dvd or vhs they normally can Camcorder VHS Videotape 8 mm video format Videocassette recorder DVD Betacam DV Compact audio cassette Betamax Laserdisc JVC Camera S-VHS Sony Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind High-definition television Digital8 Warez Professional video camera Mixtape RCA Digital cinema Pornography Digital cinematography Video 2000 Digital camera Secure Digital card Compact disc The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) Videotape format war Cassette deck MiniDisc Cradle of Filth Video Panasonic Charge-coupled device Digital photography Doctor Who missing episodes Digital video The Cure Retronym Floppy disk Real Love (song) Magnetic tape I Don't Wanna Cry S__CAM Electronic journalism Peter Gabriel Sony Pictures Entertainment FireWire Macrovision Movie theater Film Vision of Love Computer and video games Television Remaster TiVo Karaoke MSX Telecine Stop Making Sense Blu-ray Disc Copy protection ZX Spectrum Video CD Sound recording Video game crash of 1983 Technicolor TRS-80 Independent film EyeToy Marilyn Monroe Daniel Johnston Back to the Future Audio tape length and thickness History of computer and video games Surveillance PlayStation 2 Someday (Mariah Carey song) Blockbuster Video Cassette culture Sony Corp. of America v.
