manage avi files captured from digital camcorder i used pinncale studio to capture avi files from my digital camcorder these files about gb each are scattered on three hard disks i want to put all files on one hard disk shall i just move the files to new location or i need to recapture the video will studio be able to detect the scenes in moved files is moving files affect my saved projects my other question can a software other than studio can open these avi files and detect the scenes thanks you can put them all into one file and studio will still detect the scenes however moving files will affect saved projects as the project links to the last known location of the video file when you capture studio creates a buffer file that you can disguard studio doesnt use it detecting scenes is a something that a number of video editing software does in studio it simply scans through your video and detects any frame where the pixels change completely in the next frame camera flashes will be picked up as scenes another thing in studio when you are in capture mode there is a little picture of a folder clicking on this allows you to direct files to a certain location this is a good way to keep files from going all over the place Digital photography Mouse (computing) Digital cinema Warez Digital camera Digital video Floppy disk Screenshot Computer animation Enterprise content management PlayStation Portable DV Camcorder Traditional animation Windows Vista Stereoscopy File Allocation Table Anamorphic widescreen Geographic information system Streaming media IPod Movie camera Video Videotape ITunes AVI File system Digital cinematography Independent film DVD Windows XP Secure Digital card Computer virus QuickTime Pixel Disk image Digital video recorder H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Virtual memory Macintosh Finder Windows 2000 Digital circuit Photography High-definition television Atari 8-bit family Nintendo GameCube Copy protection AmigaOS Computer Ebook Motion capture NTFS 2D computer graphics Cache Web page 3D computer graphics ZX Spectrum Automatic number plate recognition Charge-coupled device Apple IIGS Hard disk Film VHS Amstrad CPC Object Desktop Professional video camera Iriver Federal Standard 1037C Image file formats ILife Btrieve NeXT Acorn Electron Steganography AviSynth Xbox 360 Anti-virus software System 7 (Macintosh) Steam (content delivery) USB flash drive Quest for Glory Original Amiga chipset Digital image editing Creative Zen Apple II family Password S-VHS FireWire PlayStation 3 Video codec Blender (software) Library (computer science) Persistence of vision DivX
