how do you roll your tongue yeah help me please x i can't do it at all haha actually you can train yourself to roll your tongue even if you weren't born being able to as a kid i had nothing better to do lol the problem is most people that don't know how to do it are trying to get the end of their tongue closest to the teeth to flip over instead you need to use to back of the tongue to push your tongue forward and concentrate on putting the top of your tongue upside down onto your teeth at the same time really hard to explain but good luck on that lol Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Skateboarding trick Suplex Ken Chu The Cure Non-native pronunciations of English Place of articulation Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling aerial techniques The Fairly OddParents Cliff Richard Knife Powerbomb She Loves You The McGuire Sisters Chris Benoit Battlebots Table tennis Backgammon Backstroke Voiceless palatal-velar fricative Halitosis Australian Aboriginal languages Embouchure Escapement LOL (Internet slang) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Old Tongue 10cc B-47 Stratojet Laminal consonant Tooth Naruto jutsu Indonesian language Lindy Basic Sleep apnea Shit Vowel Piledriver (professional wrestling) Procrastination The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie American and British English differences Empire Burlesque Rhotic consonant Cocaine Shen Gong Wu Trapping Cardinal vowel Pittsburgh Steelers Neckbreaker Aerosmith Boom Crash Opera Rugby union Highway 61 Revisited Steven Wright P-38 Lightning Casualty lifting Postalveolar consonant Hangul Nile crocodile Gag (BDSM) Swingout Happy Tree Friends Kurt Angle Drill bit Hall & Oates Kyle Broflovski Girls Aloud Hiberno-English Fire eater Saw Basque language Dental caries Piccolo Junior Saga Dental click Buddy Guy Hard disk Rocko's Modern Life Autogyro Garbage (band) Craps Voiced alveolar fricative Oral sex Pitaten Esperanto as an international language Act Without Words II Stuttering Penske Racing Who Shot Mr. Burns?
