i want to learn to speak arabic do you have any tips i was thinking that just for starters i would pick up the pimsleur language beginning program on arabic if i can handle that then i would take classes there is a college in my city that teaches levels in the language is this a good plan or is there a supperior beginners' audio program that you would recommend any other ideas thanks to the person who asked why and said it's a waste of time i'd have to disagree i could double to triple my current salary if i were to attain fluency in that language and i don't plan to travel to the middle east there are actually many job opportunities within the u s it s amazing how ignorant people can be referring to the comments above well i would highly advise you to start taking classes before trying to self teach you ll need people who are fluent and pronounce the letters correctly in order to attain fluency it would be great if you use other things while taking classes like audio cds and once you start learning the most important thing to do is practice you should practice all the time not because arabic is difficult but because it s important for any language you learn in order to become fluent to make learning fun try to listen to arabic songs but if i were you i d do that once i can understand a lot of things in the language because the songs are in colloquial arabic hope this helps good luck Arabic language Stuttering Irish language Second language acquisition Python programming language Esperanto as an international language Multilingual Social rule Scientology beliefs and practices Literacy Chinese character Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States German language Non-native pronunciations of English African American Vernacular English Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Welsh language Dutch language Hiberno-English Noam Chomsky Spanish language English language Taiwanese (linguistics) Chinese language Extreme Programming American and British English differences Economics I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Standard Mandarin Urdu Philosophy of language GED Milton H.
