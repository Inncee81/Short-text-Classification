what is more human a bo n arrow or gage i'm not into hunting i like guns but not to do any harm to animals if you are not wasting the animal then i understand i was curious though which is a quicker kill and or less painful i know my uncle prefres a bo lol my bad i ment humane do you know how exactly a bow or a shotgun kill animals an arrows point will start cutting vessels and if you hit the heart lungs it suts them wide open and they pretty much die from blood loss and the split lungs heart doesnt help it live either a shotgun kills by brute force in which when it hits the animal it sends them into shock because its a big chunk of lead that hits very hard they die from that and the blood loss too some say shotguns are more humane than rifles and bows but i cant possibly see that i think bows are the most humane and the most challenging Shotgun Terminal ballistics Rifle Archery Unreal Weapon Team Fortress Classic Marathon (computer game) Firearm Fox hunting Shotgun shell English longbow Heart Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion Turok: Dinosaur Hunter Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stopping power Tenshinhan Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Diablo II: Lord of Destruction RuneScape quests Battles of Lexington and Concord Quake III Arena Doom enemies Blood (computer game) The Covenant Circulatory system Perfect Dark GunZ The Duel Bow (weapon) Shooting sports Punisher Shock First Battle of the Atlantic BloodRayne Trench warfare Traumatic brain injury Pneumonia Bong Jet Force Gemini Theory of conduct YuYu Hakusho Equine conformation Lung cancer Kashrut Pulmonary embolism The Cure Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RuneScape weapons Yusuke Urameshi Half-Life: Opposing Force Hunting Electroshock gun Final Fantasy XI Diablo II SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Naval mine Gibs Turok: Rage Wars Cancer Cocaine Bioinformatics Poker jargon Technology in the Stargate universe Wolfrider Beryllium Computer chess Stroke Lung Directed-energy weapon Combine (Half-Life 2) Manhunt (video game) The Legend of Zelda series enemies Trapping Reptile Battlefield 2 Rod Stewart Kammerlader Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening RuneScape skills Hitman (computer game) Dehydration The Suffering (game) Cobra Commander Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Medicine .22 Long Rifle Battle of Jutland Suicide methods Kryptonite Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Ammunition USS Washington (BB-56) War of the Pacific Pitaten Blood Naruto jutsu Organ transplant
