whats the best load for the remington skeet i just purchased a remington and she's a guage with a inch barrel i have read for a few months how some people have problems with it cycling shells and also how the rings go bad i know they are easy to replace but how often do you realistically have to do it and im wondering what shells have the most success i shoot mostly skeet but sometimes light bird any ideas what loads work i'm a gunsmith and remington repair tech the is a fine gun and despite what you have heard the majority of ejection problems are from poorly reloaded shotshells and not so much gun issues the was manufactured as an upgrade to the older remington model semi auto yes in fact the seals go bad but not often and not because of use per sea the gas seals are permiable rubber and rubber has a tendency to dry out combine this with the gases that the shells produce as the gun cycles as it's fired and the occasionally lose their seal i say occasionally because it will usually take several thousand rounds of shells to be fired before this even will be an issue i see more guns come into my shop because they are put away and not fired for years and the seals dry out from lack of use then from being fired regularly the seals are quite easy to replace and at the same time you change them you clean the built up carbon and powder residue and you're good to go for another year or so as far as shells go the remington will shoot pretty much any factory made shell with peak performance the shell choice as well as shot size is of course up to you to decide i shoot trap and i use winchester aa's for that and hunting dove hope this answers your question feel free to ask should you have any more concerns Shotgun Cartridge (firearms) M16 (rifle) Krag-J__rgensen Firearm Internal ballistics Wildcat cartridge Handloading 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Bullet Revolver Jarmann M1884 Airsoft Beretta 92F/FS Ammunition Suppressor Air gun Rifle Machine gun Gun barrel Remington Arms .44 Magnum M60 machine gun Shell (projectile) .22 Long Rifle Kammerlader Tire Thermal power station 88 mm gun 7.62 __ 51 mm NATO Mini-14 Tank M4 Carbine Lee-Enfield Carbine Rimfire Skeet shooting Bayonet Punisher Dry cleaning Sniper rifle Mauser Trap shooting Repeating rifle GLOCK Carburetor Diving suit Terminal ballistics Messerschmitt Bf 109 Artillery Mortar (weapon) Spark plug XM8 rifle Dairy FN FAL U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance First Battle of the Atlantic E85 Bofors 40 mm gun Anti-aircraft warfare Coal Remington M1867 Typewriter Heinkel He 112 Remington 870 Teen Girl Squad Remington model 7600 rifle Colt Commando Terran (StarCraft) SA80 Gauge (bore diameter) AK-47 Explosive material Colt Single Action Army handgun M40 (rifle) Remington 700 Flintlock M1 Carbine Ashton-Tate M61 Vulcan Scientology beliefs and practices Hydrogen economy Floppy disk M1911 T-64 Fossil fuel power plant Steyr Mannlicher M1894 MS-06 Zaku II Carbon dioxide
