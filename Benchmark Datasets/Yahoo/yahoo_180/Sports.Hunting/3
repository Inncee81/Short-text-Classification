anybody have the new winchester super x if so how does it shoot i have a super x the x looks good just wanted to see if anybody has shot it also remington has its new cti anybody shot that one i'm torn between the two my super x has been a great gun but this new remington apparently loads and ejects from the bottom i'm a dealer and i got a chance to shoot the x about two months ago compared to the x its definately improved but i can't help but wonder why winchester was in such a rush to come out with the x in light of the x being such a success i haven't fired the remington cti but the remington distriuct rep was in my shop with one in march trying to get reactions to the new design i love remington's i'll tell you from the beginning but this shotgun is almost too hi tech as you are aware it loads and ejects from the bottom and has a titanium receiver with a new poly fiber nylon space age cover and a poly fiber ventilated rib the biggest draw back is it can only shoot standard gauge mid range shells it isn't able to handle magnums if you are used to loading any other shotgun ever made til now you will have to forget everything you know and start over the loading system is completely different from anything you will have seen till now if you are happy with the x i would suggest you stick with that the x is nice but pricey the remington starts and a cool grand and up this is one call you have to make yourself but before you upgrade and spend the money try to get a chance to shoot both first if possible Shotgun Internal ballistics Punisher M16 (rifle) Ammunition Revolver Cartridge (firearms) 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Krag-J__rgensen Winchester Model 70 Sniper rifle Wildcat cartridge Shotgun shell .44 Magnum Remington 870 Firearm Kammerlader 7.62 __ 51 mm NATO Repeating rifle Carbine Rimfire John Browning Mini-14 Springfield 1903 rifle Remington Arms F-14 Tomcat B-47 Stratojet Jarmann M1884 Battlefield 2 Remington model 7600 rifle .22 Long Rifle Machine gun Dodge Charger Benelli M4 Super 90 Tank Poker jargon Cannon M40 (rifle) Heckler & Koch G3 Airsoft Cessna T-37 Steyr Mannlicher M1894 The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Codename: Kids Next Door Suppressor R-Type Sega Saturn Varmint rifle Mossberg 500 Marathon (computer game) Trench warfare M4 Carbine GunBound Saiga-12 Terminal ballistics Transformers: Cybertron Double-barreled shotgun Mattress Floppy disk Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Mars Exploration Rover Natural Selection (computer game) Personal weapon Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Futurama (TV series - season 5) Trap shooting Bulletproof vest Bayonet Winchester rifle Remington M1867 Franchi SPAS-12 F-15 Eagle Nintendo Revolution Grand Theft Auto (game) M14 (rifle) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sawn-off shotgun Shell (projectile) Knife RX-78 mobile suit series Hard disk The Inside T-72 Metal Slug Lee-Enfield Bicycle frame Star Destroyer Clothing GunZ The Duel Anti-aircraft warfare Extreme Programming Doom enemies Draw poker
