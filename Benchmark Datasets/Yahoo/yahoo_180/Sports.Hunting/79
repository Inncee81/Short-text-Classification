is it legal if i shoot a air rifle when im far away from any houses or public walkways i live by chicago i would suggest you call a non emergency police number in your city and ask a law enforcement officer different cities have different rules but i would think most would consider a pellet or bb or shot a projectile if it is being propelled by air so it probably would be considered a firearm do a search online just for kicks on the brady campaign and they list some firearm related info by state i don't think they get into city laws chicago is by far one of the most restrictive as far as gun laws are concerned so you can get yourself into trouble very quickly and without knowing it if you don't know the rules if someone in the general public population sees you out with an air rifle from any kind of distance it is very difficult for them to tell whether its a toy air rifle real rifle etc and some people get shot by law enforcement for what ends up being a toy gun i would personally avoid carrying one around and shooting one but thats a personal choice Airsoft Gun politics National Rifle Association Air gun Shotgun Terminal ballistics Internal ballistics Rifle Gun politics in the United States Police Concealed carry (USA) Cartridge (firearms) Assault rifle Gun control in the United States (by state) Pistol Ammunition Electroshock gun Sniper rifle Civil disturbances and military action in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Lee-Enfield M16 (rifle) Weapon Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Shotgun shell Federal assault weapons ban Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Israeli police Gun safety Stopping power North Hollywood shootout Sniper Gun barrel .357 SIG Beltway sniper attacks Bulletproof vest Punisher M1 Carbine Road-rule enforcement camera Counter-Strike Projectile AK-47 Krag-J__rgensen Gun Control Act of 1968 Directed-energy weapon Bullet Railgun Tribes 2 Saturday night special Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Sarah Brady John Allen Muhammad National Firearms Act 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory New Zealand Police Democratic Party (United States) Firearm case law Rifling SWAT Suppressor Pellet Football (soccer) Mossberg 500 Assault weapon Tank Archery Murder Trench warfare Coilgun Smoothbore New York City Police Department National Police Agency (Republic of China) Plame affair Muzzleloader Columbine High School massacre Technology in the Stargate universe External ballistics Coercion Copyleft Team Fortress Classic Combine (Half-Life 2) M82 (rifle) Policing in the United Kingdom Weathermen John Lott Citizens' band radio Webley and Scott Personal weapon International law Easement Law Varmint rifle Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Leonard Peltier Quake III Arena
