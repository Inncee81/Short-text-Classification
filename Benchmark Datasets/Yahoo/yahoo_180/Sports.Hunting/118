which handgun round is comparable to a gauge shell hey i worked at a local swat like team in here and i carry a remington marine magnum shell stack loaded and pistol grip shot gun as a primary gun my commander once told me to use a hkusp as a secondary pistol and told its good but when it nearly killed me when i needed more than five shots into the torso of my slightly armored shooter that shot me once and i shot him eight or so since i was nervous and clearly my commander had rather failed to protect me any ways do any of you know about a pistol or a handgun round that can do the same as my remington marine magnum tactical shot gun and which gun would shot it the best particularly i say it should be able to kill a those type and armored targets in one shot in almost all directions carry a decent amount of ammo per clip although those twenty round pistols that need not even kill three from the whole clip are useless larger capacity would mean i could use it as a primary gun as well as a secondary and it should not give high recoil case the shot i took is for my right arm it is very important for me to know it and you can answer by emailing me or at yahoo answering buttons give all sources wow dude this whole question smacks of wannabe but hey whatever first off don't call the magazine of a pistol a clip its a magazine and only a magazine check out this website http www lifelibertyetc com rangebag video lle clips magazines large wmv for some explanation on the whole clip vs magazine thing anyways if you want something in a handgun that would be effective against body armor i would try the fn five seven http world guns ru handguns hg e htm the five seven is able to penetrate a pagst vest at meters and crisat armor at m the ap ammo for the five seven is only available to the military and police agencies so this is a valid choice only if you really are on a swat like team if your not really a swat team member then i would recommend a pair of desert eagles hard chromed and chambered in ae everyone knows all the real bubba's and operators out there carry desert eagles because they can shoot through tank armor so body armor is no problem Internal ballistics Terminal ballistics Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Ammunition M1911 Cartridge (firearms) Pistol Carbine Revolver .44 Magnum .357 SIG M16 (rifle) Desert Eagle GLOCK SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Machine gun Airsoft Punisher SWAT Battlefield 2 MS-06 Zaku II Columbine High School massacre Shotgun shell Beretta 92F/FS Stopping power M60 machine gun .22 Long Rifle Day of Defeat Tank Five-seveN Heckler & Koch USP Star Wars: Battlefront North Hollywood shootout Bullet Starsiege: Tribes Bulletproof vest Counter-Strike Sniper rifle T-72 Manhunt (video game) Suppressor Personal weapon Resident Evil (video game) Concealed carry (USA) Armored Core FN P90 Remington 870 Krag-J__rgensen Gun control in the United States (by state) Quake III Arena Railgun Trap shooting Combine (Half-Life 2) Natural Selection (computer game) Blood (computer game) Doom enemies Wildcat cartridge Gun politics Rifle .45 ACP Springfield 1903 rifle Half-Life Air gun Shell (projectile) GunZ The Duel Shooting sports Syphon Filter Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Israel Defense Forces Artillery Halo: Combat Evolved Sin City M4 Sherman Smith & Wesson Half-Life: Opposing Force Rocket propelled grenade Armour Heckler & Koch MP5 Sniper Unreal Anti-tank RX-78 mobile suit series M82 (rifle) High explosive anti-tank Armoured warfare M1 Abrams Jet Force Gemini Speedloader Steyr Mannlicher M1894
