about sixth sense does anyone know of any sites that can help unlock your sixth sense or possibly test it also does anyone have any books on this subject also is it considered a sign that i have the sixth sense when i have dreams about certain events and then they come true later does anyone have any websites on harnessing the sixth sense or books the sixth sense is just another way of describing psychic ability if you have dreamt about an event or situation that then later came true then yes that is your sixth sense at work the best ways to unlock it seems to be via meditation in my experience and from what i've read sometimes a traumatic experience can do it though i don't recommend it do you write down your dreams and date them test yourself by thinking about what will happen to say a celebrity in the next months eg who will break up or do well write it down the drawback to this is that you have to wait to see if you're right the best place to start is by checking out books by the really big names in the field like john edwards james van praag and see if any of their experiences feel familiar to yours Lucid dreaming Out-of-body experience Philosophical skepticism Consciousness Parapsychology Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Dream Telepathy Extra-sensory perception D__j__ vu Supernatural T'Pol Epistemology Traumatic brain injury Rape Carl Jung Philosophy of science A Course In Miracles New Age Post-traumatic stress disorder Professor X Theodicy The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie General relativity Edgar Cayce Redundant array of independent disks Causality Carlos Castaneda Neuro-linguistic programming Gmail Musical analysis Arthur Machen Scenes from a Memory Philosophical Investigations Vulcan (Star Trek) Year 2000 problem Artificial consciousness Scientology beliefs and practices Numerology Free will Cliff Richard Psychology of religion Book of Daniel Doctor (Doctor Who) Children of Dune Sant Mat Traumatic incident reduction Theory CPU cache Science String theory Logic Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Mythology Alexander Technique Ren__ Descartes Determinism Precognition John Cage English grammar Oasis (band) False memory Debugging David Hume Spanish verbs Software testing Philosophy of perception Fischer Random Chess Remote viewing Spice Girls The Tale of Genji Eberron Dianetics Neurofeedback God Emperor of Dune Religious Society of Friends The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Dream Theater Happiness The Giver GED C.
