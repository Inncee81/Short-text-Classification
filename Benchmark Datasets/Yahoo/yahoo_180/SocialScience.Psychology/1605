female mind games this is a serious question by the way if you are a female you can probably answer this question for me what makes you do the things you do i once knew a girl as a friend i was always nice to her and never thought anything more of it then one day she got mad at me and we haven't spoken since my questions are why do you do things like this you think screaming in my face will make it better how the hell can i do anything about it if you wont even talk to me after it occurs yea i know you arent all the same but ive seen a lot of girls and you seem to have the same kind of mind so i know there are rules in your secret organization of secrecy but can please tell me what you're thinking ps the thing she got mad at me about wasn't me asking her out i think having a girlfriend at my age is pointless because the odds of actually hooking up is very very very very very very slim also before you start thinking anything about that last sentence im not stupid enough to tell someone that if i knew them chances are she is mad at you because she thought you felt the same way her reason being you probably did what women would categorize as flirting men don't always agree on what is flirting and what is not she probably sent you hundreds of what she would consider blunt signs that she liked and probably though by you being nice to her flirting that you felt that same way so it is understandable why she would be upset because she cared about you so much would probably be just cause for her overeaction the reason she is probably not talking to you any more is because she is embarassed because she overreacted and that she feels stupid for thinking you felt the same way she probably acts like she hates you hide her embarassment i hope that helps let me know if you have any other questions Social rule Friends Theory of conduct Little Britain Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ranma __ characters George Costanza Kyle Broflovski Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Kodocha She Loves You Jon Secada Spice Girls The nature of God in Western theology Milton H.
