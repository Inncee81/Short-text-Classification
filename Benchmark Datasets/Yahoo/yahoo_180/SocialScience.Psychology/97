how to deal with an unruly young adult i volunteer for an organization that deals with young adults one of our goals is to teach them some mannors such as saying please and thank you one instance last night turned sour and required us to ask one of the young adults to leave the building it began when i was put in charge of handing out an item if one of the young adults came up to me usually they said could i please have a and i would gladly give them whatever they requested but my buttons started being pushed by another young adult who came up and demanded something to which i replyed i dont respond to demands but if you ask me nicely and say please i would be more then willing to help you to which he said i dont even say please to my own mom at that point i said then you wont get anything from me needless to say shortly after he started causing problems and was asked to leave when he started cussing how could i have handled this situation better i think you dealt with it very well that was the only way you could make him understand the importance of respect he started acting out because he couldn't get his way he must understand that once he enters the real world he won't be able to get what he wants by attention seeking behaviour or by throwing a temper tantrum it is better he learns this lesson now than later as an adult personally by the way he was behaving like a little child i would have been tempted to give a time out anyways you took a step that might influence a series of good events to follow in his behaviour you should be proud good luck with those young ones Theory of conduct Transactional analysis Milton H.
