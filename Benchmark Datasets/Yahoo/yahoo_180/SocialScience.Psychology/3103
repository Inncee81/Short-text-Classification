the mind of a child abuser why would anyone abuse their child paticularly when the child irritates them if their child irritated them that much why don't they just put it into care i mean why do they do it what drives them bullet b you're talking crap it should never cross your mind of whats going on in the mind of a child abuser it's a crime to try to understand now hmm i guess we shouldn't study hitler if we're not looking to be fascists either abusers of any kind whether they abuse children or other adults are very angry people while it may appear that the target of their anger is the child the real person they may be angry with is someone who has hurt them deeply in the past in other words abusers are angry people who are deflecting their anger to another source their anger doesn't always come from previous abuse some abusers were never abused by their parents but have suffered other forms of pain that have made them angry and again when they begin abusing their children they are deflecting their anger onto another person as for why they don't just put their children into care some of them simply don't have this option child care especially good child care usually costs money and in lower income households there often isn't money for child care in other cases the parents do actually love their children on some level and want to be able to interact with them on a more regular basis than they would be able to if their children were in care and then there is the issue of parental duty some abusive parents keep their children around out of a sense of duty this duty may come from many different sources from societal pressures from family pressures etc ultimately there are many different factors that combine to make the child abuser these factors combine in different ways for each person Theory of conduct Divorce Borderline personality disorder Infantilism Traumatic brain injury Drug abuse Pitaten Autism rights movement Fathers' rights Tax The nature of God in Western theology Narcissism Scientology beliefs and practices Spanking Second language acquisition Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Childlove movement Kodocha Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Polyamory Education Autism Social psychology Motivation Abortion Moral Politics Theodicy Simone Weil Addiction Microeconomics A Course In Miracles Psychiatric hospital Child sexual abuse Hikikomori LiveJournal Shit Androgen insensitivity syndrome Dissociative identity disorder Urinary incontinence Estoppel Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Abortion debate Anger management Fecal incontinence Children of God Transsexuality Sexual addiction Adult attention-deficit disorder Inflation Economic inequality Avenue Q Hulk (comics) Grief Social rule Sin City Alignment (role-playing games) Homeschooling Pedophilia Alcoholics Anonymous Diving Psychoanalysis Tenshinhan EastEnders Evil Goodness and value theory Rick Santorum S__ren Kierkegaard False memory Anorexia nervosa Rape Flat tax Friedrich Schleiermacher Teen Girl Squad Postpartum depression 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Password Prolog Controversies in autism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Humphrey Bogart Stuttering Acne Insurance Cult Gravity Child pornography Infant baptism Psoriasis Blackjack Education in the People's Republic of China Rich Mullins
