premonitions ok i don't believe in physcics didn't spell that right i know or people who can tell the future i'm a christian so i know this isn't demonic but ever since i was a little kid i've been able to tell when something was going to happen for example this happens about once a day on average i'll think of a specific episode of some show and that day it'll come on or like the other day and this has happened about three or four times in months i was thinking of this scene on a movie i've only seen once didn't know the title and it had been about five years since i had seen it later that day i just randomly turned on lifetime which i never do and that same scene was on also i get bad feelings about something and then something bad happens or i'll have dreams about something whats the deaaaalll and no offense but i kinda want someone who would give me a christian perspective mainly because psycics haha sp creep me out any ideas my sisters the same way she had a dream about that movie quantom leap never heard of it before just had a dream like the movie and thot it was cool and then about months later the first preview came on for it and there were the same characters on the movie is it possible christians can have future feelings about things pleaasee no retarded answers to that because i know gods against people who tell the future but i know there were 'holy prophets' and such ordained by god please someone with a christian veiw on this or someone who might have a religious opinion this weirds me out too much i mean i'm like right on target with things and its reallly starting to freak me out with all of the chaos and random events in this universe there are going to be occasions where you think about something and it happens it is chances occurrence a coincidence you don't have premonitions you think about something and it just happens to occur after i am sure there are a ton of things that you thought were going to happen and didn't Predestination The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Phoebe Halliwell Intelligent design Origin belief Slayers Religion God Wheel of Fortune God Emperor of Dune Witchcraft Kimi Finster Charmed Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Negima Determinism The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Magic (paranormal) Meaning of life Shaggy dog story Evil Christian eschatology Teen Girl Squad The Ashlee Simpson Show Storytelling Whose Line Is It Anyway?
