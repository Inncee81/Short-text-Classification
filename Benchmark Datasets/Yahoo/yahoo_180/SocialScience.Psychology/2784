my daughter has been vicious and mean she is years old to me and my husband lately she recently graduated from a university psychology major she said she needs to quit us get us out of her life she has lived away from home for four years but we have paid all of her expenses and have given her money for school now she has a nice job but she is miserable she has told us that she frequents ghetto's and hopes that someone robs her or rapes her or even kills her her emails to us are vicious and mean rot in he and f k you we are hurt and don't understand why she treats us this way she thinks she is suffering from low self esteem i don't know about that but she is going out of her way to make her sister miserable and her younger brother she has been a problematic child she brings up unhappy memories of her childhood and blames us for everything that has ever went wrong in our lives we lost a child aged to a brain stem tumor when she was a baby i don't know we are hurting right now do we just tell her goodbye thanks so much to everyone for the advice i honestly feel confused and lost at the moment i love my daughter and want her to be happy but i'm unsure what i can do at this point i'm having difficulties even considering letting her go i know it's something i might have to face but she's my daughter my honest suggestion tell her that you love her and you're sorry that she feels that way but until she can show some respect towards you and your family your family cannot emotionally take her presence and she is not welcome when she feels she can grow up and act like a mature and loving human being then you will be more than happy to welcome her back into the family also i'd recommend individual counseling for her or family counseling for everyone or just you and your daughter if she'd be willing to go obviously she has some issues that she needs taken care of but you can only do so much for her she needs to take some steps like counseling on her own Theory of conduct Hollyoaks Knots Landing One Life to Live EastEnders Infantilism Pitaten Friends Cancer Divorce Laura Schlessinger Everwood Breastfeeding Domestic violence Sin City Psychoanalysis Avenue Q Baldness Guiding Light One Tree Hill (TV series) Abortion debate Marie Antoinette Psychotherapy Alcoholics Anonymous Narcissism Kodocha Jon Secada Boston Public Transsexuality Angel Sanctuary Simone Weil Plame affair The Shining (film) Dead Like Me The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Ron Weasley Serial killer The Catcher in the Rye Psychology Anorexia nervosa Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sigmund Freud Neighbours Cliff Richard Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Amber Spyglass Empathy Polyamory Motivation Bernard Williams W.I.T.C.H.
