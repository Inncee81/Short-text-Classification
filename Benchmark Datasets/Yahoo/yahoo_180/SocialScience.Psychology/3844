what is it called when you don't like other people don't like being with them is it just anti social or is it something more if you prefer to be alone because being with other people is draining and you don't really enjoy it i mean what's the description of the mental state not just the physical state of being a recluse a recluse can just avoid people without having an actual aversion to them i think i have an 'avoidant personality style' comfortable with habit repetition and routine prefer the known to the unknown close allegiance to family and or a few close friends tend to be homebodies sensitive and concerned about what others think of them tend to be self conscious and worriers very discreet and deliberate in dealing with others tend to maintain a reserved self restrained demeanor around others tend to be curious and can focus considerable attention on hobbies and avocations however a few engage in counterphobic coping behaviors i don't think you're anti social infact you sound like a lovely person i find myself wanting to be on my own a lot lately which upsets my mum as she doesn't get to see me very much perhaps you are tired from work and find it exhauting feeling the need to sort of entertain others in a sense you do need some quality 'you' time sometimes i can't even hold a conversation with my boyfriend because i can't be bothered to keep talking and we just end up arguing so instead i sit on my own and read play on the internet or go for a walk cycling is good to as it keeps you fit and burns off adrenalin why not have some time to yourself switch off your mobile cook something you enjoy or have a take away watch a few feel good films and just enjoy every minute of being alone if you balance the 'you' time and social events equally you may find you aren't so overwhelmed by being with others because you can enjoy the best of both worlds good luck to you x Social rule Autism Infantilism Alignment (role-playing games) Asperger syndrome Surveillance Procrastination Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Domestic violence Ethics Milton H.
