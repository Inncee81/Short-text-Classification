is it a sin to think 'too much' i get the idea that i think too much' about just about everything what is wrong with that my curiosity and cynicism has helped me more than i can explain it is safer to think things through a lot and it opens my eyes to things people normally miss on the downside people might find me a bit paranoid except for this site i do my best to keep my observations and thoughts for myself sometimes they are poisonous and sometimes life saving i am strong enough to deal with a little internal poison if i create it myself why do i feel like it is wrong to think and think and think and think this way while my life continues is doesn't stand still i think too much too and for ppl like us it is hard we see things others dont and we're able to conclude our own thoughts because we've thought it through without trying to face this inner turmoil of thoughts try letting your mind escape and do things you like doing i like socialising and i use my 'thoughfullness' to get to know others and i find that ppl are interested by me because of these never ending thoughts use it to your advantage and you'll start delving into the minds of others and by god yes it is a sin enjoy Meaning of life A Course In Miracles Social rule Sigmund Freud The nature of God in Western theology Predestination Sin Sabbath Evil Karma The Subtle Knife Extreme Programming Religion Social psychology Paranoia Capital punishment Ten Commandments K' Autism Theodicy Unconscious mind Miss Saigon The Amber Spyglass Blood (computer game) Repentance Time Out of Mind Socrates Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City EastEnders Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Rudolf Hermann Lotze Summa Theologiae Epistemology Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Jam (TV series) Existentialism Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Kain (Legacy of Kain) God Diablo II: Lord of Destruction The Invisibles Coming of Age (TNG episode) Jiddu Krishnamurti Theology Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Soul Philosophy of language David Hume Piccolo Junior Saga Meme About a Boy God Emperor of Dune Israel ben Eliezer Past teachings of Prem Rawat Sant Thakar Singh Ludwig Wittgenstein The Apprentice 2 Avenue Q Boom Town (Doctor Who) George Fox Atheism Charles Darwin's illness Kender Jon Secada Church of Christ, Scientist Original sin Pitaten Procrastination Justification (theology) Charles Grandison Finney Goodness and value theory Falsifiability YuYu Hakusho Cultural Revolution Scientology beliefs and practices Alaga__sia Ninja Scroll Creationism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity W.I.T.C.H.
