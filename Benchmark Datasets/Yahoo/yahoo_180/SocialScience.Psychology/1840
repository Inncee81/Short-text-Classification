is frustration related to negativity okay i like being a positive person and well someone is just negative all the time so i always ask her to be more positive and she must not like it because she brought it up after going through a drive thru i asked her to stop fidgeting with food and just eat it at home but nooo it will get cold so she would rather be piggy and drive sideways when i got frustrated and asked her to wait she says why are you being so negative is that even related to the same subject frustrated about safety has nothing to do with being positive right is frustration a negative thing in this case is it possible to be positive about being piggy and possibly getting into a car accident because the food will get cold i do not criticize fast food i find it to be convenient occasionally i criticize being distracted with food while driving because it is not safe why not wait until you get home it is impatient and piggy to eat and drive at the same time break up with her i think someone assumes waay too much we are not dating we are related you were not being negative when you recommended safety you were being positive not every disapproval is negative when you disapprove wrong you are being positive Speed limit Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Anger management Drowning Coeliac disease Anorexia nervosa Manual transmission Guinea pig Mothers Against Drunk Driving One Tree Hill (TV series) Restaurant Road traffic accident The Amazing Race Super Size Me 24 Hours of Le Mans Sonic the Hedgehog Donald Neilson Billboard (advertising) Sport utility vehicle Indianapolis 500 American Idiot Foodborne illness Car handling Food GED Food and Drug Administration Atheism Airport Peter Singer Invader Zim Characters of The Sandman Derivative Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Road safety Light pollution Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abortion Fast food Hypoglycemia Condon Committee Freeway Shaggy dog story Coercion Rules of the road Poker jargon The Amber Spyglass Frame of reference Ben Johnson (athlete) Homophobia Password German grammar Precautionary principle Passover Bayesian inference Oscilloscope Past teachings of Prem Rawat Everwood Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Traffic light Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Bus accident at Carrollton, Kentucky in 1988 Fast bowling Drug test Human sexual behavior Professional wrestling throws Driving Adult attention-deficit disorder Floppy disk Pigs is Pigs (1937) Procrastination Common cold Mobile phone radiation and health Roller coaster Asperger syndrome Tomato Piccolo Junior Saga God Emperor of Dune Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Murphy's law Christmas Road-rule enforcement camera Breakfast Personal rapid transit Burke and Wills expedition Bicycle helmet 2005 United States Grand Prix Transactional analysis Hollywood Squares Neighbours Calvin and Hobbes Time travel Johnny 5 Shark Car safety American Black Bear Utilitarianism Abortion debate Thimerosal
