going to therapy how to get over nervousness in a nutshell i'm happily married mos pregnant and my parents just wrote me off for life because i won't convert back to the catholic faith pretty messed up stuff i set up an appt with a therapist thinking this is what i should do to get my head in order before the baby comes but i'm nervous i don't want someone to tell me i have deep seeded emotional issues from my childhood that are going to take years to work out i just want to go once or twice and get some practical advice on how to deal with the unfairness of it all i don't want to start thinking of myself as a victim i'm not having suicidal thoughts or anything that serious but i'm afraid the therapist might lead me to believe i'm worse than i am how do i get the most out of therapy without completely putting up a wall perhaps it would help to think about therapy just as you do the catholic faith obviously something in that faith doesn't fit for you not all therapist and styles of therapy will fit for you in my not so humble opinion a good therapist should make you feel comfortable enough to talk to him her and at least attempt to understand no one will completely because they are not you and i tell my clients this up front you the average number of therapy sessions is visits you the client not the therapist determines how many visits will be useful for you michael john weaver m s licensed mental health counselor new mexico Psychotherapy Psychoanalysis Traumatic incident reduction Massage Reparative therapy Albert Ellis Transsexuality Cognitive therapy Neuro-linguistic programming Milton H.
