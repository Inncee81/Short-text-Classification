i was smoking and some couple was looking at me from my house like i was street some performer i'm years old but they acted like they've never seen a teenager smoke before they were pointing at me and were acting amazed i think thats pretty damn stupid i try not to do it in public but during that time i was just walking my dog i know a lot of people are going to say smokings stupid but why do people point and make a big deal out of it i think thats just stupid wether i'm a teen or not my bad i don't mean my house it was just some random house magicdust i think your retarted i was so far away from them they were looking at me from their balcony you retard i think they're just shocked at how young you are and how many young people actually do smoke just try to ignore it but smoking is bad for you it's not right for them to point at you did you think that maybe they might be pointing at your dog maybe talking about they want that kind of dog or something anyways doing something you're not supposed to be doing at your age will always attract attention whether you like it or not Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.
