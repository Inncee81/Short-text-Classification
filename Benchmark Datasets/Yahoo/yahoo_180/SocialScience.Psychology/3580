you don't have to believe in jesus etc to suffer from horrible guilt do you i am here in hell having an icy diet cola but it is hell most of the time are all people that way you suppose i am baffled and try to block bad thinking very very hard for me looking back is often unavoidable for me i try to burn it out of my memory i learned from mistakes but it was so unnecessary to make so many bad decisions i think of samuri who knew what to do i dont have their courage i just coca cola cowboy phoney boy coward and liar who wasted many many great opportunity no you don't if there is a god he's obviously a sadist so no i don't believe in jesus i feel bad for things every day of my life and look back at everything i did wrong possibly messing up someone's life and i love them but i know everything is my fault by the way do i know you by any chance i'd also like to elaborate on this like i said i have a feeling you're somebody i know but if i'm wrong i'm sorry either way everyone feels guilt as a normal human emotion because they feel they've done something wrong you usually feel it until you make things right but unless you try to do that you'll never stop feeling bad and all it will do is get worse as you obsess over it sometimes you can't do something about it though and you're stuck waiting like i am the person i wronged still won't talk to me because they feel guilty for doing something to me but it was actually the other way around long story you just need to do what you can focus on what's making you guilty and fix it i do know what you're going through and hopefully that at least will help you good luck Sin City Social rule Sin John Howard Yoder 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Pitaten Justification (theology) Theory of conduct Procrastination Transactional analysis Time Out of Mind God Shit Goodness and value theory Nicomachean Ethics One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends A Course In Miracles Punk ideology Theodicy Scenes from a Memory Utilitarianism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Angel (vampire) EastEnders Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Guilt Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Meme Milton H.
