'saviour siblings' what is the opinion on this in the news this morning there's a lot about parents being able to create so called 'saviour siblings' to cure or treat their existing children from life threatening effecting conditions what do you think of this i really don't know really i thought when i've heard about it before that yes of course it should happen but when i put a lot of thought to it i wonder whether this child will be as loved as the sibling they've been born to 'save' is it fair to create a child for that wont the child its whole life feel slightly inferior that it was created specifically to cure rather than because they were wanted as another addition to a family im sure some of these children in fact most will be as loved and cherished as any other but there is a risk the way we mess with nature could have such huge implications in the future what are your thoughts on this good morning by the way hope everyone is well today xx good night here i think it's the jodi piccoult book my sister's keeper i think about two sisters one who's very sick and one who's a good match for their entire childhood one of them keeps giving up pieces of her body for the other as the sick sister keeps needing new and finally she says no more she goes to court over it i think to win rights over her body as a minor not quite the same thing just came to mind it was a very popular book for a while especially for book clubs hard question because that doesn't seem fair really being created for the express purpose of giving up pieces of your own body hmmm i think though that if it were my family i would have that child without question saving one child would be worth virtually anything in exchange for that i'd take any issues that the savior child would have to face i think i'd just have to do everything i could to make sure they didn't face emotional problems from it i'd definitely spend a lot of time on the question you're asking Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Social rule Salvation The Amber Spyglass Transactional analysis Pitaten Predestination The Ashlee Simpson Show Autism rights movement Domestic violence Controversies in autism Goodness and value theory Time Out of Mind About a Boy Extreme Programming Sola fide Justification (theology) The nature of God in Western theology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Transsexuality K' Intellectual property Autism W.I.T.C.H.
