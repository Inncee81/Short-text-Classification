why does it take so much time to get over someone we've been in a relationship with would you say it depends on the attachment level of one of the partner the importance that one gives to the relationship i've been friend with and in a relationship with someone for just and years of friendship and months in a relationship still that person cannot get out of my mind that person called me recently to ask me about my status nice months after the relationship ended i said i'm still not ready and she said oh still i still can't completely be over her is it because she's a woman or because the relationship was not enough important to her the amount of herself she has invested in a relationshiop and eventhough i pretend to get over her it is not true she's still weighing on my mind now and then what do you think about that hi bobby it sounds to me like you gave your whole heart to this girl why did you all break up the reason i'm asking is because may be there are some unresolved issues that you may not be aware of because your blinded from the love you have for her you may need some more closure before you can seriously move on she will weigh on your mind for a while time will heal i promise but in the meantime the more contact you have with her the longer it will take for you to heal and move on i think that was very insensitive of her to ask you what your status is and then say oh still shame on her does she not realize how she affected you it doesn't seem like she had her whole heart in that relationship and the sooner you realize that the faster you will heal i feel for you and the pain you're enduring is so great i know i've been there when i was in your shoes i felt lower than dirt because i gave it my all in this one relationship i had and i found out that he didn't feel the same later on in the relationship that is you feel like you've been stepped on and smushed into the dirt as if your heart didn't matter unfortunately because you feel so deeply for her she will weigh on your mind and the thought of her will come and go just remember to focus on yourself and be true to yourself no matter what she took advantage of the love you feel for her it's her loss i say also please try not to stray from ever loving again because i'll tell you one thing my cyber friend every time you love someone it's a new love with a new person it's a risk that we all take sometimes it goes our way and sometimes it doesn't making new memories often heal us inside and mend our past broken hearts let go of the love that didn't come back to you meaning your ex girlfriend and make room for someone new you have to let go of the past so you can have a future don't stray make new memories and keep your heart open to someone new you will be just fine it will just take some time best wishes to you Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Sex and the City Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Kodocha The Invisibles Days of our Lives Time Out of Mind Blood on the Tracks Avenue Q Cliff Richard Rei Ayanami Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Simone Weil Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) S__ren Kierkegaard W.I.T.C.H.
