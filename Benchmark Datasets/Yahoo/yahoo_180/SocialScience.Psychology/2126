did you grasp underlying gist of freud's oedipus and elecktra complexes seriously did any student research analyze or even permit themselves to attempt to arrive at understanding of freud's intent the electra complex is a concept found in psychoanalytic theory that attempts to address issues of female development it is based largely on the work of sigmund freud and uses the oedipal complex as a point of reference for its elaboration freud referred to it as the feminine oedipus attitude in his own writings freud's research on female psychology sexuality in particular was limited by social conventions of gender and class women of the period were considered the 'second sex' and many of his female patients were labeled degenerates the feminine oedipus attitude was posited by freud as a theoretical counterpart to the oedipus complex carl jung proposed the name electra complex for freud's concept although freud himself rejected the use of the term because it seeks to emphasize the analogy between the attitude of the two sexes deriving the name from the greek myth of electra who wanted her brother to avenge the death of the siblings' father agamemnon by killing their mother clytemnestra according to freud a girl like a boy is originally attached to the mother figure however during the phallic stage when she discovers that she lacks a penis she becomes libidinally attached to the father figure and imagines that she will become pregnant by him all the while becoming more hostile toward her mother freud attributes the character of this developmental stage in girls to the idea of penis envy where a girl is envious of the male penis according to the theory this penis envy leads to resentment towards the mother figure who is believed to have caused the girl's castration the hostility towards the mother is then later revoked for fear of losing the mother's love and the mother becomes internalized much the same as the oedipus complex Carl Jung Penis envy Karen Horney Sexual orientation Gender role Psychology of religion Psychosexual development Castration anxiety Androgen insensitivity syndrome Oedipus Lesbian Gender Psychology Jungian psychology Unconscious mind Religion Louis Althusser Human Wilhelm Reich Immanuel Velikovsky Orgasm Penis Transsexuality Otto Rank Feminism Homosexuality Cross-dressing Jacques Lacan Intersexuality Psychotherapy Sexual fetishism Reparative therapy Deconstruction Child sexuality Alfred Adler Modernism Phallus Transactional analysis God and gender Franz Boas Biology and sexual orientation Gender identity Personality psychology Electra Incest History of intersex surgery Moses Pedophilia John Money Rape Woman Puberty Second language acquisition Fictional character Domestic violence Sadism and masochism Postmodernism History of science Hypnosis Structuralism Nudity Birth control The Oresteia Anti-psychiatry Autism Anthropology Asperger syndrome Akhenaten Emotion Sexual differentiation Sex assignment The Brothers Karamazov Literary theory Ethics Sex Enneagram Grammatical gender Gender-neutral language Infantilism Greek mythology Innate bisexuality Effeminacy Frankfurt School Oedipus the King One Tree Hill (TV series) Self-concept Female genital cutting
