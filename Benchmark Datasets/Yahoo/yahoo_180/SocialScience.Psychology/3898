the other day i told myself i am good enough i can do it etc and it seemed to help my anxiety did it really or was this a mind over matter thing i just asked another question about coping with extreme anxiety and fear of life ironically years ago i was the most spontaneous outgoing socialite with heaps of freinds not now it may pay to read that so you know what im on about here anyways the other day my daughter went back to school from holidays i hate being away from her i worry i will get a phone call since we got a phone call on boxing day just gone saying my grandmother passed suddenly i have attacks everytime the phone rings thinking it will bring bad news anyways i felt like i was dying all day about an hour before she came home i picked up a pen and paper and wrote a page of stuff like i am good enough i can do things there is nothing to be scared of i will not live in fear i am a beautiful i can do anything i want to do in life there is no reason to be scared and things like that for about an hour or so after that cont i felt normal i never knew quite hoe abnormal i have felt for the past years until i had that hour of feeling ok there was no tension inside of me it is so hard to put into words but for the last years i realised i have had like contant butterflies in my stomoch which were kind of like waiting for something bad to happen expecting something bad to happen it felt great but went away after an hour or so was this mind over matter can anyone explain it to me always even though you are a shallow rude ignorant uncompassionate person i would still never ever wish a condition such as extreme anxiety onto you you experienced mind over matter and the power of affirmations like shakespeare said long ago as a man thinketh so he is our thoughts precede our actions and how we choose to act upon them or not determines the way we live our lives best wishes Shaggy dog story Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Milton H.
