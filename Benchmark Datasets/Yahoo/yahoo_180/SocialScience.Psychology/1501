did hypnosis work for any of you hypnosis is not cheap like per sessions and it's like the lottery of the practitioner is any good or not but did it work for any of you in replacing bad habits or depression did the effects last please tell all please answer if you've been to a hypnotist only hypnosis is not a cure all i use it for lots of things it takes work to get good at it i use hypnosis in my practice for relaxation for stress pain and to quiet the mind i use self hypnosis everyday the more you use it the better it works it is very important to learn to use it positively i am not an advocate of hypmotizing people and making suggestions i don't believe that works well i have hypmotized people to stop smoking and they believed it worked for them i believe they really wanted to quit and they quit what ever at least they quit and that was thier goal hypnosis is a wonderful tool that a person can use along with other tools to change bad habits fight depression deal with health problems stress and ect the more you use it in a positive way forming new beliefs about yourself saying positive things about yourself learning to trust yourself picturing yourself healthy innergetic vibrant human being the old saying is what you see is what you get my mentor wayne dyer says what you say about yourself is what expands so now i am very careful what i say the more you tell yourself positive things that is what becomes i found self hypnosis speeds that process up change is a process the first part of the pocess of change is resistance you want to change something you keep doing it until you like it that is said often in aa you will catch yourself saying it isn't working this is a crock that is the resistance you go through that with anything you do taking a walk you do it diligently for a week then you start missing mornings than you realize it's been a week and a half since you walked resistance if you want change you fight through that resistance and do it no matter what until you like it it's hard work change doing anything new is hard hypnosis is the same way the more you work at it the better it gets and you will be suprized at the results therapy is the same when it gets tough people quit going and they say it wasn't working when it really is it gets uncomfortable and then we say it didn't work that's why alcohol treatment is in a inviornment that is closed to help that person get through the resistance that's what it is all about there is no miricle cure in the end it is your persistance and work no one elses counselors can guide you give you tools and ideas that will help you work through your resistence but in the end it is you who has to do the work Hypnosis Milton H.
