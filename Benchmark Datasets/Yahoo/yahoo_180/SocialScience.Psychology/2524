i'm sick of feeling this way can anyone relate i just wondered if anyone feels like this or if you could let me know what this might be every single day i feel a general uneasiness just always on edge always like something isnt right it gets so bad sometimes that i can hardly sleep i've been diagnosed with depression but i really cant take this any more i dread the days where i have to try to lead a normal life after something upsetting happens because i'll toss and turn all night feeling like my heart is about to jump through my throat and i cant get this feeling of uneasiness sadness nervousness i dont know how to describe it its just hard to live like this that is why so many people with depression try to kill themselves because it is unbearable i understand and have done this as well i hate going anywhere because i know what will happen maybe not the exact thing but i know it will hurt in someway be upsetting in someway or make me made beyond belief i usually don't sleep much at night which doesn't help one thing i stopped doing is calling the days normal there is nothing normal i have found that to be true and whatever i am doing i try to find something smart a in it i don't always share this discovery with others but if they are irritating me well i will share my smart a attitude this does help and it feels good to get it out a bit i don't say things to intentionally hurt people but i do make smart a comments a lot of the time some people don't appreciate them and quite frankly they leave me the hell alone which is what i want anyway i don't think this will help you much but i wish you luck in your search to deal with it just remember you are here for a reason and not less worthy than the stars in the sky you have importance on this earth Theory of conduct Social rule Time Out of Mind Pitaten Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.
