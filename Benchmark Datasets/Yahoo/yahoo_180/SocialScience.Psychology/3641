do you believe that we most hate the people we are most like what do you think do you think we see our own worst traits in them and that's why we dislike them so much i had a friend who used to say you spot it you got it so according to his observation your hypothesis would be true of course there is also the exact opposite phenomenon too hating people because they are so different humans have a history of acting out on those feelings hence the term genocide it's hard to believe that such a term would even exist if we didn't hate those who we believed were so different than we are i personally believe that it is possible to rise above hate and move towards other more noble feelings such as compassion or empathy for example i don't hate murderers i feel pity for them why hate them following a very negative event with an extremely negative emotion only continues the cycle we as a race need to rise above hate it's not even a base emotion it always arises from something else like fear envy prejudiced etc in essence our hate is more about our inability to accept our own emoitional frailties than it is about the other person or people Empathy Evil Homophobia Patriotism Numerology Emotion Gender role Force (Star Wars) Human Cult Supernatural Hate speech Rei Ayanami Anti-Americanism Revolutionary Girl Utena God Sigmund Freud Phobia Hate Soul Borderline personality disorder Hate crime Alignment (role-playing games) Grunge music New anti-Semitism Love Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Goodness and value theory Controversies in autism Infantilism Transsexuality Opposition to cults and new religious movements Enneagram Advertising Mind Free will Narcissism Atheism Defence mechanism Ten Commandments Iago War Pacifism Objectivist philosophy Altruism Theodicy Islamophobia Ethics Structuralism Personality psychology Novel Falsifiability Charmed Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gay rights Nicomachean Ethics Social psychology Slander and libel Religion Fruits Basket Karen Horney Experiment Theory of conduct Moral objectivism Polyamory S__ren Kierkegaard The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Pedophilia Bisexuality Kimi Finster Aristotle Conspiracy theory Watchmen Religious Society of Friends Romulus and Remus Out-of-body experience David Hume Scientific method Abortion debate Victor Cousin Ranma __ characters Autism Guilt Social rule Nationalism Black supremacy D.N.
