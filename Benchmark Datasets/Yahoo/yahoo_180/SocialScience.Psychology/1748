did freud develop his psycho sexual development theory without studying children some critics argue that freud who developed psycho sexual development theory never himself studied the early childhood experiences of children but relied on his adult patients' recollections free association and dreams is there any truth in that criticism although it is true that freud would have largely concentrated on adult patients he was especailly interested in pshcizophrenia its causes and treatment there is no doubt that freud would have come in to contact with children some of whom i am sure were unwell but freud's theories are extremely complicated and not easy to understand even by those who study psycohology in fact many who do study psychology do not take the time to actually read freud's own work but instead rely on the interpretation and conclusions of others another difficulty is that freud was austrian and wrote in aus deutsch so translations of his work can also be open to misinterpretation but his commentary that childhood experiences affect adult psychology is groundbreaking in itself he literally flipped the knowledge at the time and of course it is really his theories on the conscious the unconscious the id and the super ego all groundbreaking and original that he must be recognized for he didn't have all the answers no one does but without his work no one in contemproary psychology would be where they are now Sigmund Freud Psychoanalysis Autism Carl Jung Psychotherapy Transactional analysis Hypnosis Sadism and masochism Human Sexual orientation Wilhelm Reich History of science Asperger syndrome Unconscious mind Consciousness Karen Horney Narcissism Jungian psychology False memory Reparative therapy Jacques Lacan Second language acquisition Josef Breuer Adult attention-deficit disorder Schizophrenia Arthur Schopenhauer Ego, superego, and id Transsexuality Psychology of religion Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Religion Joseph Campbell Traumatic incident reduction Abduction Phenomenon Motivation Michel Foucault Anti-psychiatry History of psychology Oneiromancy Immanuel Kant Free will Franz Boas Child sexual abuse Guru Divorce Dissociative identity disorder Psychosis Philosophy of mathematics Mind Alfred Adler Creationism Orgasm Infantilism Transpersonal psychology Surrealism Science Philosophy of science Parapsychology Homophobia Epistemology Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Cultural relativism Logic Lesbian Homeopathy Friedrich Nietzsche Neon Genesis Evangelion Homosexuality Charles Darwin's illness Psychohistory History of intersex surgery Louis Althusser Chiropractic Structuralism Max Stirner Storytelling Developmental psychology Human nature Cancer Fictional character Scientology Objectivist philosophy Jean Piaget Self-concept Karl Popper Traumatic brain injury Education Cognitive science Social psychology
