is it true that you see your life pass by your eyes when you are about to die you know what i mean you have seen it on ads but i believe that before ads it could be something that people believed i'm no specialist but i think it can possibly be an unconscious action in which you enter a state of mind that tries to bring you images of your life's best moments because when we are on bad situations we think of good things maybe people that have had entered that state of mind survived somehow to their deadly situation and passed on what happened to them what do you think do you think that when you are on a life or death situation most probably the death side you see your life pass in front of your eyes if you don't then you don't but if you do what do you think that you will see on that flashback and probably the most important question has this ever happened to you you don't even have to die while riding a motorcycle a caddilac turned right in front of me i knew i was going to hit it and i saw myself in the hospital with people visiting me and i had vivid recolections of a time whan i was a child and my mother was preparing thanksgiving dinner for our family gathering then i picked up both me feet and prepared to roll over the hood of the caddilac and splash onto the pavement where the ambulance would pick me up i heard a click and looked down and saw the ground going underneath me and i was stll riding my motorcycle it had ricocheted off the front bumper and i looked back at the caddilac and just kept going i did'nt get hurt but the caddilac bumper would've crushed my leg if i did'nt throw my legs up in the air when you know your going to die bits and pieces of your past that you would never have remembered flash through your memory like rem when you dream so by experience i know it is true that your life flashes by you when your about to die Lucid dreaming Theory of conduct Social rule Dream Professional wrestling throws Milton H.
