if they go together does it necessarily mean she likes him there's this gal that i like and have told her how i felt last year but she said she just wanna be friends however now i feel that some things have changed recently she showed more interests and especially today there were more conversations between us and often she asked me about things she seemed more interested she also teased me more but there's this guy who likes her too this guy's friend started it first by asking her and her friends to play bowling next week i think they've been planning it so far he even teased her about me i think is to eliminate any suspicion of him trying to unite them should i be worried if they agree does it mean that she likes that guy this is the first time though and in my case i've hanged out with her together in groups a couple of times we're involved in more activities though when he asked her about that she seemed rather clueless she did not seem to really look for him though they re in different class and i doubt if she realized he was absent today your'e obsessing which is not good if they go out its not the end of the world she may be great but shes not that great you think theres nobody like her billion people gotta be similarities somewhere so if u go out great if u dont dont worry about it if u think she likes u flirt back try and go somewhere alone e g a movie and see how she behaves alone with u if she goes out with him try not to be angry or feel rejected these things happen they suck for a bit but its ok she may be a great girl but shes human shes not the perfect girl that u imagine Avenue Q Social rule Kim Possible Knots Landing Pok__mon Live!
