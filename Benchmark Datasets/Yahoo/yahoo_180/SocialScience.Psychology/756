am i emo i really feel like i have the worst life compared to others it's really stupid cause i know i don't but i always feel like my life is an endless struggle i'm not suicidal nor do i dress like people who are my friends who dresses like an emo please tell me what's wrong with me i am always depressed i am not bipolar or schizophrenic am i just over sensitive this is bullshit coz no one knows what's wrong with me and i need to know the way you describe yourself is somewhat what i would describe myself in a secret diary for me it's been going on for two years now all of a sudden i start feeling deeply depressed and miserable this might be because i am a lonely and shy person i don't have any friends in school and i don't even eat lunch because i have no one to eat with plus people gossip about me i can tell i just lower my head and pretend i don't hear it and when i go home i cry myself to sleep sometimes it's just little things that affect me so deeply i keep telling myself it's not that serious but my heart commands otherwise i kind of hope for a miracle to happen one day because i don't want to live the rest of my life like this if i live a miserable life i'll die a miserable death what i learned today i'm not the only one feeling this way you aren't emo the only way you feel so is because you know people of such nature a doctor visit might be helpful but i myself would never have the nerve to go Friends Shaggy dog story Bipolar disorder Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Marie Antoinette Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Dead Like Me Mojave people Borderline personality disorder The Smoking Room Characters in the Smurfs Clinical depression The Catcher in the Rye Theory of conduct The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Fruits Basket Marilyn Monroe Insomnia Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism W.I.T.C.H.
