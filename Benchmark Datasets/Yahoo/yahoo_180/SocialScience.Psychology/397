why do people put religion everywhere does anyone ever think that some people might not like the ideals everywhere i look i see religion and it makes me mad i'm the only atheist in my family and they're always trying to make me go to church and stuff and no one gets my point i keep telling them how religion isn't true and that it's an explanation of things that when religion was created we did not know the thing is that we know that stuff now except what happens after death so people don't need to be as serious about it all people were mad at my school because they taught darwin's theory of evolution rather than creationism it's so stupid people can believe what they want they want but to judge religion over science is a very stupid argument yet right on the dollar bill in god we trust i just don't see why it has to be so advertised and shoved down people's thoughts so my question is why do people take it so seriously to answer nerys it's religion all together most of my family is christian but my brother is actually a bhuddist but they have nothing against him because he believes in something they just don't like that i don't believe anything about any religion but christianity is most advertised so even though i don't believe in anything it's mostly christianity just because they have to announce it to everyone all the time maybe you should move to cuba we believe in freedom of religon here you have a right to believe what you want but so do i you don't have to say the pledge if you dont want to but dont tell me i can't you don't like that our money says what it says be thank full your allowed to feel the way you do openly and not made to wear a burka and cover your face if your family is cramming religon down your throat that is a family problem not the rest of the countries take it up with them Creationism Atheism Religion Teach the Controversy Evolutionary creationism Phillip E.
