what do you do when a person insists they are being raped by a ghost odd question i know i am a tarot reader and the people i read for i don't know them personally this lady always texts me and says she is being raped by a ghost i have tried telling her to seek help can someone else give me a different way or ideas on how to convince this person to see a doctor i didn't say i don't believe in ghosts but based on what i hear from her this sounds more like mental issues she sounds to have other anxiety and ocd issues as well i think you should look up astral projection it occurs often in your sleep when your spirit leaves the body and does re enter they say it happens to everyone but not everyone has the same experience anyway the ghost is probably her own spirit re entering her body and it can feel like she is being sexually assaulted try getting her to pray to god that she has an easy exit and entrance if she still thinks it's a ghost tell her to tell the ghost that he she is dead and needs to go home finally if that doesn't help try convincing her again to see a psychologist because she has already tried the other options and mental illness may be the issue good luck Ghost Animism A Course In Miracles The Amber Spyglass Astral projection Out-of-body experience EastEnders Soul Theory of conduct Deprogramming Holy Spirit RuneScape quests Dualism (philosophy of mind) God and gender Church of Christ, Scientist The Invisibles Reincarnation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Reparative therapy Rape Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Meditation Simone Weil Anorexia nervosa Scientology beliefs and practices Transsexuality The Catcher in the Rye Theodicy Lucid dreaming The Lovely Bones Abduction Phenomenon Sexual orientation Storytelling God StarCraft: Uprising Sigmund Freud Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Karen Horney Human sexual behavior Spiritism Transactional analysis Sin City Dead Like Me Socrates Dissociative identity disorder Psychology Euphemism Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Carl Jung Necrophilia Milton H.
