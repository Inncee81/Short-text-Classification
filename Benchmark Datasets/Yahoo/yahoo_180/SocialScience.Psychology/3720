crying and alone it seems like i am crying everyday whether it is my job as a nurse having to pay money for my car on a mistake the car dealer made my sister continually telling me my clothes and my hair are ugly my mother trying to get me into a religion i don t understand and probably never will too scared to tell her i don t like it because i was born into it and the whole famiy is the same religion but now i am starting to cry over nothing i just start crying like all that stuff is building up inside me over and over again sometimes its in front of my family my friends the boy i like which is terrible because then he thinks he did something wrong and feels bad or even at work in front of my patients and i hate it so much i feel so alone simply put dear you are depressed in no way am i calling it manic depression or chronic depression but rather it seems that the stress in your life is simply dragging you down you need stress relief easier said than done but trust me on this tell your mom no on the religion it may upset her but cutting the stress involved in that situation will be far more beneficial to you tell your sister to keep her opinion to herself if she doesn't cooperate temporarily cut off communication with her and see if she get's the message not much you can do about the dealership but it does sound like you could stand to assert yourself i don't mean blow up and scream at everyone but i do mean push back a little don't let anyone dictate the rules to you and above all talk to someone close to you who doesn't make you feel like crud they can help you smile and bless you for being a nurse Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha The Ashlee Simpson Show Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Yoko Ono Time Out of Mind The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Characters in the Smurfs One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Everwood About a Boy The Shining (film) History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Jon Secada The Smoking Room The Amber Spyglass Marie Antoinette Little Britain Manual transmission Clinical depression My Life as a Teenage Robot Procrastination YuYu Hakusho The Inside Kurt Cobain Liam Gallagher Taxi Driver Fred Phelps Craps The Marshall Mathers LP Fruits Basket Traumatic incident reduction Great Teacher Onizuka Past teachings of Prem Rawat Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Jam (TV series) Good Morning, Vietnam Scenes from a Memory Rocko's Modern Life Babe Ruth Kimi Finster RuneScape quests The Catcher in the Rye Great Depression Coming of Age (TNG episode) W.I.T.C.H.
