a question for athiests i am an atheist personally just because i honestly don't believe in god but my question is why do some atheists feel the need to stoop the level of extreme hypocricy where push their believes onto religious people and use brain washing as their argument honestly i envy those who are true believers but i just try to be honesnt with myself and i wanna say that those other atheist make the rest of us look bad why do you care what someone else believes in why can't you let them live their lives happily isn't that the point of being an atheist just being honest with yourself so that you can be content so why try and steal it away from someone with different beliefs what do you gain from that unless you are miserable and want to drag someone down with you it makes me sick that i fall under the same label as these athiests by definition you aren't supposed to care about religion and yet you make it your biggest concern so leave any comments you might have i am a christian and i think the same can be made for christians look let people know what you believe but when you try to shove it down their throat you lose them immediately if people don't want to believe in a higher being then let it go same thing for atheists if i am right about believing in god and jesus and all that goes along with it great in the end i will end up in heaven if i am wrong and there is no god at the end of my life what have i lost if that belief makes me happy i have lost nothing Atheism God Religion Fundamentalism Supernatural Soul Afterlife Theodicy Pascal's Wager Meaning of life Evil Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief S__ren Kierkegaard Existence of God Philosophical skepticism Creationism David Hume Agnosticism Religious conversion Moral objectivism Immortality A Course In Miracles Resurrection of Jesus Biblical inerrancy Alcoholics Anonymous Dualism (philosophy of mind) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Phillip E.
