am i a sociopath first off this question is not related to michael jackson the pop star this is a serious question ignore the aviator i have broken many womens hearts in my life because i'm terrified of letting anyone get too close to me also i can never end relationships on good terms but i am so scared of getting attached and then getting dumped i don't think i could handle it and i don't like when women get attached to me because i feel i will hurt them more in the end this is usually when i leave why do i feel a need to keep my emotional distance in all my relationships i admire people who can be so open and genuine with their emotions by the definition laid out here no you are not a sociopath but you do have a problem within the area of social adjustment dealing with relationships you are living out a self fulfilling prophecy here you in the back of your mind know going in that you are going to be reacting the way that you do yet you draw the person in allowing them to think that you are going to have a naturally progressing relationship and sure enough at that point when the other person begins to feel as though this is something they can lean on and trust in bang you do the thing that you do call it whatever you want and rationalize it any way you think you can but what is going on here is you are just simply being untruthful and covert in your behavior within these relationships it is most likely a power thing it somehow feels as though you have the upper hand your ultimate freedom that no one can touch but listen up dude you are the real loser in this because you may be maintaining your freedom and having a heyday with showing others how little you need them you don't know it at least not yet but you need them more than you know the only way a cycle like this is ever going to end is when you come to the realization that not every relationship has to be a loss of your freedom and a long term lock down of your options and that you are probably missing out of the absolute best things in life with this stand off you have going on between you and who ever is in your life at any given time loosen up here dude and give at least someone a chance to get in close you may find you like that i mean how long has it been ever you might even give someone else the opportunity to bust up with you that would be the biggest test of all to set you back into the real world and it wouldn't be the end of the world i guarantee it here's hoping that at least something i've said here touches a nerve that spurs some positive change because as harsh as i've been my aim here is to help and sometimes that can only be done by coming down straight in the middle of things wishing you the best and good luck and about the avatar come on man give it a rest already Poker jargon Friedrich Schleiermacher Social rule The nature of God in Western theology Evil Theodicy Property (ownership right) Philosophy of language Jon Secada Past teachings of Prem Rawat Altruism Polyamory Sex and the City Antisocial personality disorder Meaning of life Volleyball Nicomachean Ethics Narcissism Transactional analysis New York Giants Force (Star Wars) Coercion Human sexual behavior Abortion debate Shaggy dog story Infantilism Keynesian economics Mystique (comics) Criticism of libertarianism Human nature Mind control One Tree Hill (TV series) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Goodness and value theory Game show Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social psychology Happiness Philip J.
