i feel completely lost okay cheesy my friends will agree with me when i say im smarter than them i had two friends i could talk to and theyve both moved to different continents the rest of my friends laugh at my 'intellectuality' and its becoming impossible to talk to them i can muck about and play the fool and i love them like crazy but when they start talking about boys and clothes we are after all i get sick ive actually started hanging out with my cousins and younger because i find them more fun ive had people tell me im not a normal teenager in a good way but off late ive been starting to think its not so good because im such a misfit i like who i am and dont want to change but how do i get people to understand and appreciate the real me rather than percieve me as a rambling moron first off your not a misfit there are huge changes going on in your life and your friends you are all growing and changing a lot right now the thing is sometimes the friends you have don't grow or broaden in the same ways you do example some people choose band some choose athletics you don't have to shun your old friends completely i think the thing you need is to make some new friends in an area of interest to yourself you may have to join a club or group outside of your school if your you are old enough to volunteer or work part time try to find something that is of interest to you and spend some time there good luck Pitaten Social rule Kender The Ashlee Simpson Show The Beach Boys Friends Kodocha Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Incarnations of Immortality My Life as a Teenage Robot The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Rich Mullins Wheel of Fortune The Misfits Theory of conduct Maison Ikkoku Good Morning, Vietnam Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Charles Ives Kim Possible Anne Boleyn The Catcher in the Rye Honey and Clover The Adventures of Pete & Pete Highway 61 Revisited Earth Girl Arjuna Cliff Richard Kylie Minogue The O.C.
