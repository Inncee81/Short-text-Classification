my diagnosis of asperger's real a couple of months ago i went to an asperger's clinic because my mum thought i had it so i went along for an hour i was asked to sit outside and look at poorly black and white photocopied facial expressions and choose from a list of what they were eg suprised shocked happy i did this outside while my mum talked to the lady anyway i went back in and she asked me about my childhood and because from grade my best friend was asian she was australian born not just some immigrant that couldnt speak english that that was a sign that i had asperger's and also the fact that i prefer other races to white people i am white myself i also suffer from depression and after years of being bullied at school for being 'ugly' not 'different' i find that constantly being scared of people calling me ugly is what makes me hold back in social situations i haven't told anyone this because im ashamed however on that basis do you think that my diagnosis was fair it wasn't my mum that said it and we went to the queensland asperger's clinic or something im in australia and yeah it was a proper psychologist thing if you are unsatisfied with your diagnosis seek a second opinion australia has fantastic resources for diagnosing aspergers syndrome including one of the worlds foremost experts on this topic tony attwood attwood http www tonyattwood com au has written many books on the subject which you can probably find at your local library whether the diagnosis is fair would be subjective if the clinic specializes in diagnosing aspergers syndrome then it would be more likely to be correct but mistakes can happen one of the main problems with diagnosing as is that it is a spectrum disorder when a person may have very mild symptoms or severe blantant symptoms to anywhere in between there is not one type of aspergers each individual with as has their own unique set of traits and level of severity furthermore many people who may have as but have not been diagnosed have learned to compensate their behaviors over the years and can mask some of their symptoms in public i would suggest that you read up more on aspergers and if you feel you don't have it write down the reasons why in preparation for a second opinion diagnosis it is very important that you do not withhold pertinent information about feeling ugly or being bullied from the person evaluating you needless to say that no one here can tell you if you have as or not over the internet and neither can i however you should be aware that many people who do have asperger's have what attwood refers to as mind blindness related to theory of mind which may affect ones ability to recognize symptoms in themselves as well as understand feelings and points of view of other people here is an article on theory of mind which will help explain what i am referring to people on the autistic spectrum those affected by asperger syndrome are most definitely affected by the triad of impairments namely impairment in language and communication impairment in social interaction impairment in imagination and flexible thought processes i language and communication people with asperger syndrome differ from those affected by childhood autism as defined by leo kanner in that they usually have fewer problems with language often presenting with a substantial vocabulary but their speech is often pedantic and stereotyped in content on close observation it will also be noted that even whilst their speech is fluent there is minimal notice of the reaction from the person who they are talking to nor interest in the verbal response given to them in addition there is a definite impediment in non verbal communication skills often speech seems to lack expression and tone differentiation and also the person with asperger syndrome struggles to understand other people s emphasis on words or altered tones used to specifically convey a certain message the use or understanding of body language facial expressions and gestures is impeded resulting in their understanding of communication being very literal ii social interaction the person with asperger syndrome will be noted to be socially insular and apparently not concerned about this issue there is a lack of understanding regarding the emotional aspect of friendships the person with asperger syndrome will want to establish friendships but they will lack the ability to develop and sustain such relationships anxiety and tension increases with greater demands for social skills an inability to read social cues is pronounced iii imagination and flexibility of thought often you will come across most capable skills and an obsessive fascination in dealing with facts and figures yet there is a poor or absent understanding of abstract or jargon due to the confusing presentation of abilities and the presence of a good intelligence and speech the public often take it for granted that these people can understand abstract and commonly known jargon a comment such as i nearly died laughing can cause great anxiety and fear for a person with asperger syndrome a strong rote memory is frequently noted which is extremely beneficial and is one of the reasons these people do exceptionally well in subjects which focus on facts and figures but a resistance to change an obsessive demand for the preservation of sameness and the strong adherence to repetitive activities can adversely affect their progress in life there is usually an inability to be able to think and play creatively as well as a problem in transferring skills from one environment to another theory of mind impairment and mind blindness when trying to modify and alter or modify the behaviours of a person with asperger syndrome it is imperative to consider the theory of mind impairment theory of mind can be explained as one s ability to be able to consider and understand other people s thoughts and feelings as this skill plays a major role in our interaction with others for the person with asperger syndrome this skill is severely impeded resulting in the following difficulties inability to predict the possible behaviours of others which can lead to the person with asperger syndrome developing a sense of insecurity and a resultant avoidance of people not being able to comprehend the intentions of those around him nor understanding the motivations of their actions a lack of understanding concerning their own emotions or the emotions of others this can manifest as a lack of empathy which is often not accepted or understood by the people within their social circle poor comprehension of how one s behaviour affects how others feel and think about you this can lead to a lack of motivation to please and a lack of conscience minimal understanding concern regarding what people know or want to know and a defective ability to detect or react to their audience s level of interest this can result in either the person with asperger syndrome speaking endlessly on a subject providing excessive detail or else providing minimal background material but just launching into a complex verbal account of a subject that the audience has no knowledge of or interest in minimal understanding as to why their focus of attention must change whether it be in a conversation or in a classroom setting etc for instance if the person with asperger syndrome is concentrating on a specific task or talking to you on a chosen topic and you want to move on to another task or alter the topic of conversation due to the impediment in the area of social interaction there is often a lack of understanding as regards the need to take turns in conversation and allowing others to talk without interruption or the need to take takes turns in the playground etc inadequate understanding of the action of pretending and an inability to separate fact from fiction or the ability to be deceitful is often present all of the above adversely affect the person s ability to establish and maintain friendships these areas of impediment also affect their ability to benefit from daily life learning and teaching a certain amount of social skills can be taught to the person with asperger syndrome but it is highly unlikely that these skills can ever be internalised naturally because of the mind blindness experienced by a person with asperger syndrome the learning of these skills is extremely difficult and stressful as it is not factual it cannot be seen nor explained on paper also it is difficult for the parents friends teachers etc to teach these skills which they never had to learn themselves hope this helps
