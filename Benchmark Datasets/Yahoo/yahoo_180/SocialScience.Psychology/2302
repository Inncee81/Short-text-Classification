psychological problems when i was about years old my best friend and i used to play a game where we were two characters after about years of playing this game there were other chracters we would also play ourselves my friend decided she didn't want to play anymore so i kept playing by myself but i ended up changing the whole story and keeping just a little part of it it's been about years since we stopped playing but i keep doing it when i'm alone i talk aloud and i've developed this whole person with all these things that happen to her it's been years of events so it's just like a regular life i also personify her husband and her sister and all other characters i guess my question is do i have some sort of disorder i know that there's noone there when i talk but i get really into the whole situation and i don't feel weird doing it can you tell me if you've heard stories like this before is there a name for this thank you thanks for the responses i don't think i could have dissociative identity disorder because i'm aware of when i'm me and when i'm acting i can't bring out the character when i'm not alone if anyone would ask me to speak or act like her in public i couldn't do it i've thought and tried writing a book but since all of it is dialogue it's really complicated i'd write it out into a book i read agatha christie's autobiography where she said she'd go on walks while thinking of a story and make up the dialogue talking out loud she wondered what people must have thought well if she was crazy she was rich and famous crazy as long as you recognize this as fantasy i can't think you crazy try putting you stories on paper how knows you might have a bestseller on your hands i write and talk aloud to see how things sound conversations between characters if you're crazy well so am i Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Milton H.
