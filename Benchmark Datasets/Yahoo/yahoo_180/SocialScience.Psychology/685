my neighbor has horrible mood swings and for no reason turns psycho and screams at me for hours out of nowhere i moved in to my house about months ago and the first few days my neighbor over the fence was kind and sweet even commented that unlike her other neighbors i was so nice and how happy she was to have me as her neighbor then she snapped now her verbal assault of mean hateful and evil things at me is as predictable as texas weather i have good character morals and compassion for others totally unable to harm anyone for any reason self defense only i have only said kind words to her compliments about her gardening offers to babysit her kids offer to have a bbq u have the grill and i have fresh chicken i truly am unlike most other people i mean what i say and say what i mean period i only want one thing for everyone and that is to be happy and have inner peace have a wonderful day i realize it is from her past but thats no excuse how do i get her to back off why is her behavior upsetting me so much i'm full of love peace and light for all why be so angry at me your neighbour yes i'm aussie sounds mentally ill it's hard to tell but it sounds like a form of paranoia you can't cure a mental illness with kindness they will find a reason to dislike you you're from the cia or the like you could try approaching the neighbour if and when it's safe sit down with them and talk through why they feel that way about you that might give you some insight into the true nature of the condition if you can get them into a situation of empathy not sympathy then you may be able to convince them to seek help or medication but chances are they will react to that badly if it becomes a dangerous situation then i hate to say it comes down to the authorities or just moving away i'll just quote hill street blues here though let's be careful out there Milton H.
