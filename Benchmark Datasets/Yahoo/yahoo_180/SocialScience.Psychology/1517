does luck exist i got a passing on the ap us history exam while so far everyone else i've heard from got a not passing on it one of my friends who took it said man you got lucky i'm just wondering if that was really luck or if it was my reward for all the time i spent studying for the exam another example is when i'm playing basketball and make a tough shot someone will say oh thats a lucky shot but is it really i practice everyday in basketball doing all types of shots so was that shot lucky or just skill does luck exist or does it only exist in certain situations so if a person guesses on all of the question in a question test and gets all of them right is that luck or probability what we think of as luck is really only random chance if you studied for the test and practiced basketball then making a better grade than others or making the basketball shot were things you achieved by preparing for them but there are a lot of things that just happen to us because we are at that place at the wrong time bad luck or right time good luck the other day a dump truck overturned at an intersection in town i was just driving around and passed through that same intersection minutes before the accident someone else not so lucky had a load of construction dirt dumped on his car the next day i wasn't feeling well due to a virus i came home at lunchtime took a couple of aspirin and feel asleep in the recliner when i woke up i went outside to water a couple of new trees i planted i discovered i had neglected to turn of the car's ignition so it had been running for an hour later i noticed my dog wasn't behaving normally he refused food and didn't seem to want to use his back legs somehow he had found the bottle of aspirin and had eaten or so tablets so i had to take him to the vet hospital where they had to keep him on iv fluids the bill was the next morning i found that with all the excitement about the dog i hadn't turned off the hose that i was watering the tree with anyway i feel lucky because it could have been worse i picked up my dog this morning and he seems to be ok then i read on ya that someone's german shepherd jumped up on the table and ate a pound of raisinettes i knew chocolate wasn't good for dogs but it turns out raisins are toxic to dogs also her dog has just started days of iv fluids Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga One Tree Hill (TV series) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story The Contender (television series) Reservoir Dogs Chris Amon Ron Weasley Iditarod Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Luck Time Out of Mind Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Oh My Goddess!
