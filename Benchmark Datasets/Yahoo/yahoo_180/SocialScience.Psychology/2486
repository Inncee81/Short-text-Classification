drug paranoia years later was it real in my 's i did a lot of blow i had the normal peeking through blinds thinking someone was there thinking i was being followed but there was one incident i swore was real and to this day i still think it was i had a girlfriend who i had loaned a lacy camisole to and one night i was high as a kite and saw her outside fooling around with a guy i had been dating i flashed the lights told them to go away actually saw her write i love you on the wall of my house with the house outside any friends or family i shared this with dismissed it as sick paranoia but she acted like she believed me and even years later asked me if i ever found out who it was i saw a therapist for other issues later on and she told me it was a sign that i was so far gone or that i could look at it as my having such awful friends that would do that to me my question is is there any way later on to undergo hypnosis or something to discover if something really happened or was my mind so tricked at the time that i'll never know i am happily married with all of this behind me but i would really love to know if that was real or imagined thanks hose not house the experience of stimulant induced paranoid hallucinations won't be able to found out on hypnosis you experienced it at the time believed what had happened since it wasn't isolated you were also peeking through blinds thinking someone was there thinking i was being followed and this is not normal then it's not much of a step to go from ideations to hallucinations when you're an active user Milton H.
