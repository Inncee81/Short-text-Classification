how can i become more tolerant of someone drinking from my straw or any seemingly normal activities it kind of makes me uncomfortable when people drink from the straw i'm using or even when a mother i know someone who did this smell their baby's booger to make them laugh seriously i don't wanna be the hag that get disgusted by the smallest things i'm not even that ocd but i still get turned off by these how do i ease up the people with whom i share my drinks are my closest friends and my family members i even get icked out when my mom does it and i feel bad for that what i try to do in these situations because i suffer from basically the same thing you do is remind myself of all the annoying things i do myself that way i'm less bothered by the annoying things around me i'd also try repeating a phrase to yourself in your head when something bothers you something counter intuitive like that's not annoying or whatever you'd choose it'll soon become an automatic thing also try just wiping off your straw before you drink from it again or remind your friends about viruses and the spread of disease i'm sure they'll understand you'll get over it just fine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune Obsessive-compulsive disorder Social rule The Smoking Room Pitaten Computer virus Shaggy dog story EastEnders Infantilism Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Alcoholics Anonymous Friends Nicomachean Ethics Fruits Basket Humphrey Bogart Phoebe Buffay's songs Kender Milton H.
