close friend is obnoxious in groups hey there i'm sure many of you have dealt with this before a seemingly sweet friend who turns into a blunt obnoxious little thing whenever anyone else enters the conversation the problem is that i've known her for almost years and know for certain that she's a very nice well intentioned person so there is obviously an understable reason behind why she does this it only recently became incredibly annoying so when i asked her about it she told me that it was because silence and awkwardness in groups causes her anxiety to act up and she doesn't think straight yet she barely took me seriously how can i get her to stop it's caused me to almost explode on her this evening she decided to comment on the crappy wine my workplace sells to a friend i hadn't seen in years and all it did was cause more tension between us and my old friend to take me less seriously i believe that she may be using the security of the group to express her true feelings she may be unable to confront you one on one about the issues that upset her about you and your relationship with her i suggest that you inform her that this dichotomy must stop you deserve to be treated in a consistent manner God Emperor of Dune Plame affair Ranma __ characters YuYu Hakusho Shaggy dog story Internet troll Sin City Hulk (comics) Friends Blood on the Tracks Sharon Tate The Apprentice 2 Full Metal Panic?
