why do girls find guys in collared shirts attractive guys and girls can answer it's just a basic psychological question that's all i've always been curious to find out what makes them so attracted to guys when they're wearing a collared shirt if a guy asks need fashion help or what should i wear the majority are females who answer with a suggestion to wear a collared shirt i mean why not a t shirt with jeans or something what makes a collared shirt so different from the rest is it the collar the fact that it can be worn open or closed whenever the fact it's the accepted standard for guy's clothing both formal and informal that it 'goes with almost any outfit out there' i've just been curious about it because i was never able to have it answered clearly i don't personally own one right now but if it generates some positive feedback i might be willing to try something new fashion wise let me know what you truthfully think okay we know about polos what about regular collared shirts like the button down shirt personally the only reason i'm wearing one in my profile is because the pose matches my personality which is rather laid back and relaxed because collared shirts gives the appearance of neatness neatness in turn give the appearance of a well kept man which leads a person to believe this man has self confidence it is a more professional look one a businessman yuppie of someone going up the corporate ladder would wear while it is not always true that men who dress better are smarter have better paying jobs etc a first impression means a lot this gives off a first impression of someone who knows who they are and have worked to get there i know all of this sounds kind of stupid but it is truthful Shirt Suit (clothes) White-collar worker Dress shirt Black tie Social aspects of clothing Skirt and dress Social rule Professional wrestling match types Heavy metal fashion Jesuit College Preparatory School Mario Plame affair Blue-collar worker Kilt Necktie Trailer Park Boys Aerial (dance move) School uniform American Psycho Mess dress Dilbert Paul Is Dead Sydney Riot of 1879 Waistcoat Starfleet ranks and insignia Tennis shirt Warrant Officer Beachwear Canadian Armed Forces Clothing Gurkha Contingent Gender role Clerical clothing Teen Girl Squad Manual transmission High school subcultures Family Feud Singapore Police Force Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The Apprentice 2 United States Marine Corps Jumpstart 3rd Grade Grunge music Modern Western square dance Priest Redneck Lindy Basic Schutzstaffel Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Infantilism Cowboy Academia Headgear Academic dress of Oxford University David Beckham Bob Jones University The Ashlee Simpson Show Coercion Goatse.cx Professional wrestling slang Socrates Little Britain Trousers Avenue Q Royal Canadian Mounted Police Surveillance Whose Line Is It Anyway?
