can you give me real insight to a desperate confused question what do you do when everything you've known true steadily dwindles until it is almost unapparent when it has almost disappeared completely and all that stands is traces of the reality you once knew loved strived for and dreamt of all the while spiritual emotional physical aspects of life slowly continue decomposing in a haze thanks to all you helped calm me down so i could breathe damn new gardener that was harsh but appreciate your bluntness well you have two options you can lie around and do nothing about your situation or whatever is bothering you this is called complacency it's not a happy place i've been there several times you let those things that have happened turn you into a bitter jaded cynical person and man there are already droves of those wandering around or you can use all of those things that have gone wrong for you as chances to evolve as a person take what you've learned and grow think about how something bad that's happened a boyfriend has dumped you you've lost a job etc and consider how much it's really going to affect you in the long run is it really going to matter so much in six months a year you'll find another job maybe a better one love always comes again etc etc even when something very traumatic has happened say a death you can still evolve and grow and keep moving with your life you know i'm speaking from experience i've had a lot of terrible cards dealt to me in my lifetime and i'm still here i don't think my life is that bad right now it's a lot better than it has been in the past but there's still a lot of room for improvement i wish you all the very best Pitaten Social rule Humphrey Bogart Human God Emperor of Dune Simone Weil Theory of conduct Numerology Past teachings of Prem Rawat Traumatic incident reduction Meaning of life Current teachings of Prem Rawat Milton H.
