how do you deal with a person who lies constantly some one i know lies right one after another and i know that she is lieing and she cant stop evidently the lies are getting out of control i tell her thats a lie and she denies it it is terrible makes me crazy sometimes the lie is hurtful but mostly just aggravating i am scared she is going to get me or some one else in trouble doing it what can i do do i just have to stay away from her i used to have the same problem when i was younger i used to lie all the time and i ended up compounding the lies because one lie led to the next and so on if you have a compulsive lier on your hands all you need to do is let them be sooner or later it will come back to bite them in the a as for getting others in trouble if you are a truthful person you will be ok lastly yes just get away from her once she realizes that lying is only going to alienate her from her friends she will get into the habit of telling the truth this is from personal experience the only way to help a chronic lier is with tough love there is no other way other than by getting them to talk to a psychiatrist about why they lie all the time also confronting a lier will just make them lie more One Tree Hill (TV series) Michel Henry Kodocha Anxiety Scenes from a Memory Chicago Bulls Alcoholics Anonymous Social rule Lie Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Eddie Guerrero Milton H.
