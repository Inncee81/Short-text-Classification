is it possible to forgive someone and still be angry with them what are you supposed to feel when you forgive someone or is there no criteria for this it is in regards to someone who i no longer have contact with never will yes i can tell you this from the bottom of my heart my mother was a severe rapid cycler bipolar who may have been misdiagnosed the meds did not help but made it worse she let her boyfriend into our home and let him molest me and my sister and we spent a year in court after only to have her turn around and blame us and tell us it never happened and we lied she called up names for years she tried to commit suicide over and over and was always about her she never came to a concert a play or a parent teacher conference she always embarassed us she did lots of terrible things to us hurtful things and said rotten things despite all of this i forgave her i forgave her to find my inner peace and move on with my life however i was still angry with her at what she did it is ok to be angry i knew she was ill and not right i forgave her for what she did but that did not mean i couldn't still hurt and be angry at what had happened just because you forgive someone does not mean the feelings go away i am a psy student it is perfectly normal to forgive but still have risidual feelings One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an About a Boy 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Domestic violence Kodocha Pitaten Bipolar disorder Friends Boston Public Theory of conduct Knots Landing A Course In Miracles Haibane Renmei Shaggy dog story Social rule Phoebe Halliwell Anger management Avenue Q Kimi Finster Mother Teresa Past teachings of Prem Rawat Grief College Roomies from Hell!!!
