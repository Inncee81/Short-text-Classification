how can i see the beauty in me in life even if it's not really there i just lost interest in almost everything in my life i don't see the point of it anymore even things that i used to like don't appeal to me anymore what should i do to be more optimistic and always see the best of things even it's so hard you could always try to look at it like i have learned to being in the military has opened my eyes to how some of the rest of the world lives let me tell you everything in your life is better than most people have it in let's say iraq afghanistan and most other hot beds of activity these days simply put most of these people are living well below any u s issued poverty line every time i have to drive through a suburban heck even a rural area out here here is where i am currently assigned i see things that make me so greatful for what i have have had and have awaiting upon my return i've got a future ahead of me even if it were to be a librarian or eleven clerk for the rest of my life i would still have it better than of the people i have had contact with or have seen i have seen people scraping to get by on that which most people wouldn't even touch i've seen children beaten so severly that it turned my stomach and i've seen alot and have a pretty sturdy constitution for things like that i've seen children beaten so badly it was a miracle that they were still alive once we got the lab results back so long story short too late i know you are you you bring something to the world no one else can you if you lose all interest that is one less kiss someone will receive that is one less voice or opinion that may matter to someone else that is one less person that may not benefit from a kind deed you might do for them the point to it all is is that optimism can keep you going even when you don't want to it's that drive to see what i can do to help out someone else to better myself heck just to see what will happen in the next minutes that keeps me going worse case scenario rescue a dog from a shelter give that gift of love to an animal that probably needs it and give purpose to your life again if you need it to provide and care for that animal that will most definately return the favor fold i hope that this hodge podge of reflection advice and perspective helps in some form or another best wishes cheers p s try adopting this personal motto i adopted when i was on the verge of a major breakdown the motto is no worries Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story Kodocha Social rule Fathers' rights EastEnders YuYu Hakusho AFI 100 Years series The Amber Spyglass Zhao Yun Humphrey Bogart Abortion debate Characters in the Smurfs Poker jargon Phaedo Past teachings of Prem Rawat Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Time Out of Mind Sin City Theodicy Avenue Q Christian eschatology The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Animal rights The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Capital punishment Current teachings of Prem Rawat Contract Discordianism Comanche Milton H.
