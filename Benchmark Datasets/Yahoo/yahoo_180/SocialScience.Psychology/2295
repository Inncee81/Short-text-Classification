how can i stop myself from getting so angry i let myelf get so angry over stupid things like if i get a bill in the mail and they overchange me or something doesn't go the way i planed i want to stop but its hard it's hard because you've buried the real reason for your anger so deep that you explode at little stupid things i used to have a really bad anger problem like that too i got therapy and found out that abuse i had experienced in my childhood was the root cause of it anger is a response to fear frustration and or pain take the word anger out of your vocabulary and replace it with one of those other words something happend to you in the past that hurt you really badly and you haven't faced it and dealt with it what helped me the most was to hire a reputable trained and experienced therapist to help me discover truth about where my rage was really coming from since we can't change what we don't acknowledge it is great that you recognize your problem and are willing to do whatever it takes to change good luck Alcoholics Anonymous Domestic violence Transactional analysis Transsexuality Shit Sin City Milton H.
