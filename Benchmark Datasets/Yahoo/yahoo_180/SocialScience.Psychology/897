how much memory can the human brain hold technically for most episodic memories the brain doesn't even hold the whole memory just the gist of it like some clip phrases and it will fill in the details whenever you think about the event to make it seem like they the details were there all along this theory can be proven to some extent by the fact that our memories are somewhat suggestible there was an experiment where people were shown a video of a car crash and most of them were more likely to say there was broken glass in the crash which there wasn't if the person conducting the experiment used the word 'smashed' instead of the word 'hit' when describing the video other similar experiments involving confabulation memory confusion or suggestibility have also been conducted with like results there are a few exceptions i would guess although i don't know for sure that a traumatic event would be an exception that because we can experience flashbacks after a trauma means the memory is stored in its entirety this can also be supported by the fact people tend to relate describe a trauma almost the exact same way every time they explain to someone what happened implying the memory is very solidified Post-traumatic stress disorder Traumatic brain injury False memory Traumatic incident reduction Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Doctor (Doctor Who) Abduction Phenomenon Psychology Rei Ayanami Repressed memory Vulcan (Star Trek) Cognitive science Psychosis Consciousness Paranoia Agent Rape Amnesia Theory of conduct Theory Schizophrenia Philosophical Investigations Hypnosis Telepathy Philosophy of language Motivation Free will Roswell UFO incident Neuro-linguistic programming Neon Genesis Evangelion Storytelling Dualism (philosophy of mind) Brain Left-handed Wheel of Fortune Infantilism Human brain Theodicy The nature of God in Western theology Stuttering Luminiferous aether CPU cache Autism Scenes from a Memory Whose Line Is It Anyway?
