has anyone had experiences after using a weeje board or has anyone just seen spirits ghosts or strange things i have had things happen to me with both using the ouiji board was the worst nightmare and i was wide awake i have been dealing ghosts spirits since i was years old and i am still dealing with them of course as a year old it was very scary and then all of that was explained to me by my grandmothers and my mom and one aunt so i had alot of training at an early age and was told how to deal with what i say and was told how to get rid of whatever was trying to scare me i and my husband bought a haunted house and we have things happen daily so i am pretty used to the ones in my house i am a paranormal investigator and researcher which i love to do and our group has members who i trust with my life we are all very well trained in many factions of these group my horrorific time with the ouiji board was when i was in high school i had done one when i was with an aunt and at that time it told us things about my aunt's house that she just ignored and after she had moved out a few years later we were told somethings that the board was telling us were indeed really true not so afraid of it but surprised that what it said had been the truth and there was eveidence and police involvement because it concerned a husband murdering his wife and just where she was buried the one when i was older i will never forget as it seems just like yesterday my best friend's parents were gone to a police convention and i stayed with her for that week end i was not afraid as her father had a very well trained police dog that stayed with us we or i should say she had just bought a new ouiji board and of course that is the week end we chose to try it out so we invited of our friends over and of course had to make sure there were some dudes with us ginger and i waited until dark of course and she and i did the board as the rest sat around us and they to asked questions we asked for a sign that the head dude of that board was there and the toilet seat upstairs started slamming up and down as hard as it could i quickly checked the room and all humans were accounted for we asked for it's name and even today i cannot write or say it i refuse to what we latched onto was so evil and loved to terrorize all in that livingroom we tried to get rex police dog to go upstairs with all of us in tow and it is so very true that a dog's hair does stand on end if terrified i was there i saw it and i still can't believe we were so stupid to ask some of the questions we did rex refused to even go to the bottom of the stairs so we all went up without him the seat and the cover had cracked so bad we had to try and think of what to tell her parents not easy to do since her father was the sheriff and knew how to read liars to well we all then went back downstairs and rex had his teeth bared and looking towards the kithcen rex's bearing of his teeth and the growl scared me so while we were trying to get rex to chill out we heard a man's footsteps coming up the basement stairs i felt at that point in such a panic i did not feel safe to ge anywhere in that house but to scared to go outside at the same time so we followed the four guys into the kitchen and the door to the kitchen was locked so if it was human it would have to break down a rather heavy door while we were in the kitchen i looked up to see the time and then the kitchen drawers started open and close by themselves and the toaster started popping up and down and in the face of the clock was a girl around or her face was in that clock with both hands to her cheeks and appeared to be screaming and i told ginger i had to get some air and we went onto the enclosed side porch and we of course we turned on the light and in a leather stuffed high back chair was a perfect impression of someone sitting in that chair i no longer wanted that air so we all ran into the house and locked the door the guys said they had to get home and let's just say they never went home as we threatened them and would tell everyone at school what happened and that they were there with us but became to cowardly to stay and left there best female friends to fend for ourselves that is all it took and they did stay ginger and i tried with all we knew to get that spirit back into the board and it would not go right away as soon as it was light out it went back into the board and we all ran that thing to the backyard where the burn barrel was and put all the lighting fluid her parents had onto it and burned it and it honestly sounded like it was sceaming out to us we did not care what we heard and burned the box and board till there was nothing left of it i to this day will not have a ouiji board anywhere near me i have so many more things i could relate to you but i have taken up enough space as it is all i ask is don't listen to anyone who ever tells you the ghosts or spirits or ouiji boards are not anything because it would just be a big lie and ones who say they are not real are only cowards themselves or just wast to be the joke of the party to have someone to laugh and make fun of you in
