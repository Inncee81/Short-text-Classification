are you a councilor can you please help me i was just wondering if there's a councilor or a psychologist on here that could talk to me i dont want to talk to the one at school coz im not comfortable telling anyone this in person im worried ppl might find out this is a serious question so plz dont say something like your family should go on jerry springer sometimes im attracted to my dad and i want him to be with me i feel guilty and i hate myself for having all these sick thoughts in my head i cant remember how it started but its not a crush its like love and lust he's not my biological father but he's still my dad from when i was years old its ruining our relationship i hardly ever talk to my parents anymore coz of this you have to really research things for yourself here why is it you are attracted to him is it because he provides for your family keeps you safe you like the relationship he shares with your mother his looks you need to identify what it is exactly that draws you to him when you find that you will be able to fix the situation yourself it is a normal thing to a certain extent but acting on it is not appropriate whether he is biologically your father or not so you need to come to terms with that as well Sexual orientation Friends Fathers' rights About a Boy Love EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) American Dad!
