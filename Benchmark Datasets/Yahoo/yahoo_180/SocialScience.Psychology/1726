if you have this sense that a person is lying why wouldn't you want to find out if you could i cannot understand for the life of me why a person wouldn't want to know the truth about something that could affect them and others they know what makes a person turn a blind eye to something when they really know that things don't add up is it fear and if so why keep bringing it up if you don't have doubts about it i know a person who just turns a blind eye to things and b c of it they make bad decisions and it affects them and others is this person scared are they this stupid i think they are lying to themselves is this a psychological condition as a defense mechanism or what if the not knowing is affecting your psyche your life someone else's and your mindframe wouldn't you relieve yourself by investigating into the truth knowing the truth is a powerful thing however what to do about it is entirely something else some handle truth better than others 'circumstances unknown' or 'doubts' are clear parameters needed here its good to talk to someone and exchange ideas on a broad level of life though understanding them completly as if you were in their shoes easier said than done perhaps the person you describe is not listening because of a parameter that is not set or not set correctly some truths are known however they need some clarification process that is unclear what is the source and how did they come by it chinese whispers and rumours can mean a lot of things to lot of folk who in the end would you rely on when push comes to shove it's basically down to the person and his her intentions of re working the problem in his her own way an example would be tolerence level orientated is it a good or bad thing to go with or not some see with a pinch of salt the basis again is this necessary if the truth didn't hit true then its clearly the wrong way to approach to problem head on if your friend didn't hear it the first time then perhaps its down to this folks have other things on their minds at all times and it takes a moment for the crap to hit the fan Theory of conduct Social rule Philosophy of language Scientology beliefs and practices Time Out of Mind Theodicy Epistemology Infantilism Alcoholics Anonymous Shaggy dog story Ethics Socrates Milton H.
