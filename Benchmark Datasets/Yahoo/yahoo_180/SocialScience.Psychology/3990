how long would you last if your worst nightmare came true i am terrified of insects and if i was ever trapped in a tight place or surrounded by them after like seconds i'd probably fant have an asthma attack or curl into the fetal position who am i kidding it would be a combination of all three if i was trapped in a room with spiders i'd first not know what was going on then i'd scream like a year old girl hyped up on sugar while climbing up the walls trying to get out just the other day i was playing video games i went to the bathroom to wash my hands then out of nowhere a flat black spider landed on my shoulder from the celing i slowly looked on my shoulder that's all i remember except for taking my shirt off and screeching like a wild howler monkey running into walls and feeling like i was drowning c'mon the spider was huge if anything that was the scariest moment of my life well except for when i saw my brother for the first time Blood (computer game) Doom enemies Prank flash Toilet humour Suplex Spider Aerial (dance move) Pok__mon Abilities Shen Gong Wu Invader Zim Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
