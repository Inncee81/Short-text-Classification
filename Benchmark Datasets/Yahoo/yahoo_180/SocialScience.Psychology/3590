how do i find out who i am half the time i just don't know why i do the things i do why i think the way i think and why i have the life i have i want to know what kind of person i am and i want to stop hateing myself and others for the person i'm not and the life i don't have alot i think has to do with not knowing my father not even a name nothing i feel like the other part of my life is missing i also believe it could be partial at fault for past failing relationships could this be the reason why i am the way i am it may play a part unless you're married your father is the most important male in your life but now what you've got to do something about it you may not appreciate this answer but i believe one's identity cannot be fully understood or valued unless we understand our relationship to god i am a christian i believe in the love god which is greater than all understanding i do know this the king of the universe became a humble man and died for me he died for my sins my suffering my hatred my hang ups my broken relationships my faults he loved me and loves me still he found me worthy of his love and he finds you worthy of his love too you are worth his life from this realization you can wake up each day and say it is a good day because of that knowledge that relationship from that point on ever problem every obstacle every pile of baloney life dumps at your door can be viewed as an opportunity to do something good about it or come out of it a better more tempered person all so that we may serve him by living a life worthy of his calling and love we never get quite that good of course but he loves us anyhow every day is new as a forgiven child of god Sin Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity John Howard Yoder Trinity Justification (theology) Theodicy Original sin Sola fide Summa Theologiae Charles Grandison Finney Eastern Orthodox Church God Past teachings of Prem Rawat A Course In Miracles Salvation Anselm of Canterbury Reincarnation Socrates Sexual orientation S__ren Kierkegaard Predestination Meaning of life Nicomachean Ethics Christianity Paradise Lost Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Merit One Tree Hill (TV series) Goodness and value theory Roman Catholic Church Rich Mullins Love Human Evil God the Father Chosen people Blood atonement Duties of the Heart Incarnations of Immortality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Phaedo Philipp Melanchthon Rei Ayanami Philosophy of language Ten Commandments Infant baptism Urantia Philosophy Satan Opus Dei Moral objectivism Michel Henry Guru Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Jon Secada Polyamory Friedrich Schleiermacher Mary Jane Watson Scenes from a Memory Homosexuality and Christianity Book of Isaiah Divorce Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword John Wesley Creationism Theory of conduct John Wycliffe Expert system Muslim ibn Aqeel Origin belief Guru-shishya tradition Religion and sexuality Jewish views of religious pluralism Religious views of suicide The nature of God in Western theology Contrition Baptism Current teachings of Prem Rawat Simone Weil Microeconomics Catechism Shaggy dog story Christian eschatology Sin City The Ashlee Simpson Show Earth Girl Arjuna Prayer in Christianity Devil The Merchant of Venice Marriage Christian-Jewish reconciliation Scrooge McDuck Soul Aristotle Sabbath Religion and sexual orientation
