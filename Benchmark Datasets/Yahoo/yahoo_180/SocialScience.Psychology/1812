don't you just hate dominating women i have a reason to do both my mother and sister were extremely dominating and my dad was a true gentleman and i have bad memories i was just scared of their loud shrill voices and unpleasant activities when i was in primary school i was molested by female teachers they would punish me the slightest gaffe and i don't exactly remember but i could have been sexually harassed back then in all my academic career i never enjoyed the company of female lecturers colleagues or faculty except for a few most of them are the real feminazi types and i hate those shrill voices my first girlfriend at was a dominating girl she controlled me through emotional blackmail and it gave me a lot of stress in life it was a nightmare and her commands and dominating personality crushed my spirit it was good thing that i was the one to end the relationship or else it would have me killed i only get along with submissive women tame and weak those kinds that depend on men is there anything wrong in it i just wonder what thrill do some men have in chasing dominas last i checked they were paying like hour for their sessions with dominatrix women why i got so much in my life for free the world is crazy kja if you are sure you really don't have a shrill voice and don't yell i don't consider you dominating i have no problems with independent self assured women as long as they don't try to dominate me kd you better f k off feminazi whore i have nothing to do with your types i do agree we all have degrees of masculinity and feminity you haven't taught a new concept and yes i have met several submissive women and none of them have any self esteem issues they may be a bit clingy and annoying and attention seeking but far better than the dominas its ok to be tame and weak in a feminine sort of way and dependant on men the problem most women can't find a man anymore that you can depend on so when men start becoming more dependable then maybe you will find that women become a little more surrendered by the way i do not have a shrill voice and i am not tame and weak i never raise my voice in an argument but i get my point across just the same i am not whiny and clingly either but i know what i want and i know how to get it and i long for a dependable and honest man Feminism Theory of conduct Avenue Q Social rule Infantilism Scientology beliefs and practices Boston Public Springfield Elementary School Female dominance Great Teacher Onizuka W.I.T.C.H.
