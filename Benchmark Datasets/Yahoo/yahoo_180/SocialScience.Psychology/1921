is it normal to talk to yourself alot i talk to other people but i act shy around them lately i've begun thinking about how shy i don't want to be around people and how much less i want to start talking to myself i don't talk to myself excessively or hold a full on conversation with myself but with small things like if i'm watching tv by myself then i'll say little things about what's happening or if i have thoughts that i just have to vent out and have nobody to talk to then i'll talk to myself about them deep down i'm really not a shy person at all but that's how i act around people even people i've known practically my whole life how do i get out of this 'shell' that i've been in for about years i'm and how do i stop talking to myself as much thanks for all your help you have to be more social there is no wonder potion or cure for shyness you just have to be around people more often and then you will actually have someone to talk to instead of yourself Social rule Shyness The Catcher in the Rye Transactional analysis Theory of conduct Milton H.
