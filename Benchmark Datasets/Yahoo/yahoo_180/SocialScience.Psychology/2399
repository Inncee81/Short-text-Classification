i have problem communicating with others plz help i'm very bad at talking to others i barely really barely utter a word during group to gethers during my child hood and teen i was not that bad at all but i can talk if someone asks me something i think it is affecting my work in office also i also get teasedabout this i go out with my office collegues and friends during lunch and evening for snack other than that i dont personally talk about general things i dont talk to my boss and senior ppl i work in a software company i'm good at technical things but i didnt get my promotion as i barely look or talk with my boss i suffer from being reserved and not knowing what to talk in different situations i'm yrs now and i think it will also affect me in my later years and pls help me solve this problem of being a non communicator thanks yes i used to be this way also for a very long time i am and can honestly say that i still get like that every now and then mainly when i meet new people but i have learned to sort of shake it off and be able to find my confidance again my main motivation was that over time i started getting tired of missing out on life to not take chances is to not only miss out on the good opportunities that are waiting there for us but also to miss out on the learning experiences that life has to offer we will be doing nothing but staying exactly where we are and if that is not where you want to be then a change needs to be made to lack communication skills is to drift through life without anyone ever having known you and that is the loneliest feeling in the world i can tell you honestly that it does take time no one who has actually gone through this before can tell someone else just go out there and do it they know that it is simply not that easy to suddenly be broken from it it is a process of gradual exposure and desensitizing yourself to these situations that will cause you to eventually break out of your shell completely no one goes straight from non communicating one day to suddenly being outgoing the next i don't know your personal reasons so forgive me if this advice is way off on what you are going through but the main reason that i personally noticed as to why i was withholding myself from others and had a lack of communication skills was because i was so afraid of how i would come across to people i wanted to be liked and accepted by everyone i went from trying to mold myself to be like others to eventually finding out that being fake did not work so i eventually just started withholding my true self altogether and this caused alot of hard times in my life this is sort of integrating some advice that i have given to a few people in the past one of them a very good friend who was going through something similar this is what i did what i realized that i needed to do first was to like myself for who i was this has to be the first step if you do not like yourself you will feel that others will never like you as well try your hardest to not compare yourself to others it is okay to find qualities in others that you would like to see in yourself that is good you can develop any quality that you want for yourself to have but never allow yourself to feel like you are less of a person than anyone else find the good things about yourself that you like and do not want to change and develop those maybe you are funny or maybe you have a knack for giving others advice something about your personality that you truly admire about yourself you've got to find a part of yourself that you like and that brings you confidance and feed off of that develop your good qualities and change those qualities about yourself that you do not desire to have it can take time especially if you have been dealing with this for a long time know yourself your likes and dislikes what type of sense of humor you have what you enjoy doing in your spare time what you enjoy doing alone what you enjoy doing in public etc learn about yourself and learn to like these things about yourself and begin to feel confidant about the person that you are when you are confidant in who you are you will begin to want to share your qualities with others you will not want to withhold yourself anymore next i had to realize that not everyone will like me no matter who you are or how you act even if you were the most confidant person on the planet you still cannot please everybody accept this and realize that even though it is impossible for everyone in the world to like you you are still an exceptional person and out there are many people who will like you what you need to do is find those people who will like you for who you truly are these are the things that i had to tell myself i had to get myself to stop trying to act a certain way and saying certain things to please others i had to constantly tell myself i cannot please everybody the people that i want in my life are people who genuinely appreciate me for who i am i want people in my life who know the real me and who will stick by me even after they know that real me it takes practice gradually begin to expose yourself to more social situations try to relax as much as possible and just remember that you cannot please everyone so just be yourself the more you get out there and try to be social the easier it will get you will start to notice how you act in public and how others act in public and you will start to understand how to react better in social situations and in conversations everything takes practice it is just a matter of repetition experience is the best teacher out there in the beginning i had to expose myself to social situations almost forcefully and some situations to be social were forced apon me and i had no other option but to adapt it is always difficult at first but overtime it will get easier and always remember that you are not alone on this many people are dealing with this and many people have overcome it as well just remember that it takes practice so never give up good luck to you Social rule Theory of conduct Infantilism Hearing impairment Second language acquisition Shaggy dog story Scientology
