how do i get this thought out of my head it keeps replaying re asking yes i am asking this question again i'll tell you why at the end ok so usually every night when i am laying in bed i start thinking what happens when we die and i usually end up imagining coming back as another person and so on then this though comes that is like this if we do come back as a different person every time we die then one day in the not so near future the world will end because the sun will get bigger and we wont be able to stand the heat so basically like what happens there will be no more earth for us to come back to we will be forever dead and it scares me really badly because i love life it's so hard to explain basically im so scared of the day that i die or the day when humans can no longer inhabit the earth scared the reason i am asking again is because the people who answered seem to know me so well saying such things as you really really need a girlfriend or time for bed kiddie well since you know me so well i would like to tell you a little about myself i am not a kid i am years old my occupation is real estate i sell luxury condos and private estates i make roughly dollars per year i have a fianc we have been together since our senior in high school i also have a degree in business as you can see i have my life pretty well in order so please do not include your childish remarks as they are completely inaccurate and you re just making yourself look foolish i appreciate anyone that can give me advice oh my god you sound like me i'm so quite a bit younger but these thoughts just wouldn't leave me alone i don't want to sound awful but like i think once you get to a certain sort of um intelligence you can't help but ask these questions but it's really not worth it that's what i learnt anyway you might completely disagree with me but i seem to find that whenever i'm stressed out or panicked about something which i find hard to deal with i just turn to other things and this thought pops up again in my mind and then i really start to panic like why we're here what happens when we die i will just be like nothing a dead lump of space etc but now i don't know it's like i've finally accepted it my dad laughed at me when i started shaking with worry and said why do you care you'll be dead so it won't matter i guess this is quite true so yeah the best thing to do is to forget it i guess you will get over it but i also think that sometimes we come back to these circular thoughts whenever something else is bothering us which we don't want to deal with our mind channels it into something else which panics us anyway i hope i was some tiny help but i probably wasn't i know this is stupid but it's probably something you'll come to accept it's just one of those things good luck Jon Secada Theory of conduct The nature of God in Western theology Social rule Avenue Q She Loves You Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Philosophical skepticism About a Boy Treehouse of Horror V Zhao Yun EastEnders The Fairly OddParents Phaedo Piccolo Junior Saga The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Death Gate Cycle The Amber Spyglass The Catcher in the Rye The Ashlee Simpson Show Time Out of Mind Game show Cliff Richard Philosophy of language Milton H.
