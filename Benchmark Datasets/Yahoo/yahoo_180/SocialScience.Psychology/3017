can you help me get more courage to state how i feel to people when they do things that upset me today my cousin came over and she went in my room and opened my laptop and got on w out asking i came in the room and all she said was it was already on but i didn't have enough courage to tell her to get off or tell her how i felt about it what i wanted to say was can you get off that's my personal laptop you can use the family computer in the living room but i was scared so i held back my feelings and said oh okay and it's been bothering me all day courage isn't the absence of fear but the mastery over it in other words don't wait for the courage to stand up for yourself instead say and do what you need to do to let others know that they can't walk all over you take advantage of you whenever they feel like it the feeling of courage will come after you do something courageous this has happened to me many times i always think of what i should have said but it was too late then i spend hours going over over the incident in my head i will imagine what a gutsy person would say if they were in that situation the more you speak up the stronger you get the key is to know what to say in advance then you just recite it like the winning actress that you are going to be for instance plan what you will say to her the next time she comes over also hide your laptop when she can't find it she might ask you where it is at that point you would say oh i stopped letting people use it you do not owe her an explanation if you give an explanation that is just fuel for her to argue with when she says why say because i feel like it practice saying that while you look at yourself in the mirror show no fear do not let her think that she can intimidate you if she thinks that she can bully you she will try it stand your ground and get a tough look on your face look right into her eyes when you say because i feel like it defend yourself it has been bothering you all day because you are angry at yourself for not protecting yourself from being bullied and taken advantage of the only thing you can do now is to plan your next defense good luck my friend i'm pulling for you Social rule Milton H.
