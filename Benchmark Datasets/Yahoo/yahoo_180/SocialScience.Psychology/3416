have you heard of sexual attraction between adult reunited birth family what if you have never had any thought of incest within your adoptive family as you have grown up with them and find the thought repulsive yet when you reunite with birth family you find yourself in a sexual relationship with your biological brother sister mother father you feel like you've known them your whole life yet they are complete strangers to you have you or would you act on it what is your oppinion about this situation in david brodzinsky's being adopted the lifelong search for self he makes an extremely short reference to this he says this is extremely rare but that in a few cases the reunited family members feel such a powerful sense of intimacy with each other and that they feel they have no choice except to act on it sexually he doesn't say anything more about it i would say that the feelings of intimacy are normal and understandable especially in adopted adults who may have come from a background where they have not felt this type of closeness before however i would also recommend that the person remembers that there are many ways to express intimacy with someone and sex is only one of them they do have a choice in addition as adults we should always be thinking of the consequences of our actions will this hurt ourselves or other people in the long run is it illegal or taboo how will i feel about this later there are many situations that adults face where they might have feelings about something but do not act on those feelings for whatever reason or find another way to express those feelings my personal opinion is that this situation would fall under this category i would recommend trying to understand those feelings writing about them talking about them and even seeking supportive and nonjudgmental counseling if needed Incest Infantilism Human sexual behavior Marriage Child sexual abuse Adoption Rape Love Lawrence v.
