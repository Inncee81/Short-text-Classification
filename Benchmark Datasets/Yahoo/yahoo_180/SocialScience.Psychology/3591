how do you feel when somebody else teaches you something new about yourself in a sense it's self disclosure from another how do you feel in that moment when someone seems to know you better than you know yourself it depends on how they've gone about teaching me this something new if they've been kind and compassionate and haven't demonstrated a holier than thou attitude then i'm usually greatful to learn sometimes the only way we learn certain things about ourselves is to have an objective outside party point them out to us of course if the person is gloating over their knowledge then i don't take it so well but anyway for me at least i find it rather comforting when a friend can tell me something about myself that i didn't know even if it's bad and still maintain respect affection and friendship for me it let's me know that they will accept me and both my good and bad qualities Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Theory of conduct Current teachings of Prem Rawat Infantilism Love Merit Kender Goodness and value theory Force (Star Wars) Socrates Ethics Tai Chi Chuan Corporate governance Epistemology Happiness Leviathan (book) Mary, the mother of Jesus Nicomachean Ethics Strategic management Evil Philosophical skepticism Social rule Alignment (role-playing games) A Course In Miracles Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Trinity Mojave people Pitaten Empathy Plame affair Milton H.
