pls read this and spread the word dont you agree pls school stinks ppl wake up its freaking stupid we must come together read ''dumbing us down'' and realize that the educational system is brainwashing us into thinking shit its not true pls wake up we have to destroy the school system and have a more positive approach to learning not through and hours prison cell called school pls i want to make a difference im not crazy i am pretty sympathetic to your plight schooling and education are not necessarily the same thing i sat through hours a day of crap um finished years ago now to learn stuff i would never need and can tell you i definately do not remember i did well at it too but let me tell you i have never needed any of the good grades i got don't let people try to tell you that you need good grades or you'll be a bum it's very blinkered and just not true my kids are entering the school system in september and i will be monitoring closely how they get on if they tell me at age for instance that they no longer want to go to school i won't make them i will work together with them instead to find out what they do want to do and help them wherever i can to learn whatever they want to school is not the only answer i am a level headed member of 'decent society' whatever the hell that is but i fully recognise that our schools fail hundereds of thousands if not millions of kids annually the school system aims to teach what 'our leaders' in their ivory towers feel they should learn not what our kids actually have an interest in and want to learn the emphasis is on grades and preparing kids to become competitive units and take their place in a competitive workplace the result is that a very many leave school forget what they have learned and end up hating learning at least for a while years in my case they often then go on to do a job that anyone leaving school at with no grades can do fact i recommend the book 'my ishmael' by daniel quinn as well as his others he goes into this in greater depth chat to your parents tell them how you feel look for alternatives to help your parents help you the system fails many it also works for many it is not the system that must be brought down it is an understanding of the system for what it is and an understanding for what else is out there that must be also know you are not alone in feeling this way Graduate school Education Education in the United States A Course In Miracles Education in the People's Republic of China Shit Ten Commandments Scientology beliefs and practices Milton H.
