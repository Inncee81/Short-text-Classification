do raw emotions need to be processed and expressed before they are interpreted as feelings thank you that's a big question and i'm not sure there is an answer for it read i'm not sure i have an answer but i'll give it a go because i think it is interesting in a sense there is no need for an emotion to be felt for it to be expressed and ultimately felt that is the emotion doesn't need to be consciously felt take for example love i love my wife i don't walk around all day every day feeling love for my wife i have a whole bunch of other emotions kicking around in my brain at any given time all the same the fact that i love my wife effects most of the decisions i make in a day even without pulling up feelings of love so i guess that means emotions don't necessarily have to be felt to be expressed which i suppose doesn't exactly answer your question i'm of the opinion we are able to interpret emotions as feelings without conciously processing them or expressing them the smell of libraries makes me be quiet without consciously putting together the pieces emotions are expressed by being quiet unconsciously however i believe that emotions must be processed at least in a sense to be felt and interpreted as a feeling otherwise we would just be helpless balls of random emotion expression feeling i think good question Dualism (philosophy of mind) Consciousness Objectivist philosophy Meaning of life Social rule Theory of conduct God Art Turing test Unconscious mind Causality Modernism Euphemism Mojave people Jiddu Krishnamurti Kurt Cobain Neuro-linguistic programming American Pie (song) Empathy Artificial consciousness Traumatic incident reduction Philosophy of language Transactional analysis Abortion debate Sydney Riot of 1879 A Course In Miracles Arthur Schopenhauer Free will Religion Atheism The nature of God in Western theology Narcissism Abstraction Past teachings of Prem Rawat Immortality Emotion Friends Blood on the Tracks Conspiracy theory Goodness and value theory Human Happiness The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex EastEnders Love Deconstruction Scientology beliefs and practices Glen Jacobs Meditation YuYu Hakusho Little Britain Vulcan (Star Trek) Meaning Philosophy of mind Soul Sadism and masochism Robert A.
