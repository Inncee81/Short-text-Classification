for all you love genius's out there i heard there are like or different types of affection example by giving a gift saying it in words actions etc i know there's some fancy smancy name for it like the levels of affection or something but does anyone know what i'm talking about and if you could explain it and each type thanks yes but no there's no system or career path there is knowing yourself and others and caring that lasts it lasts beyond acting to help people you like it extends to helping people you'll never meet or ever live to know there's also a sense of self which cuts out the pushy ones who want more than you are ready to give and who don't fret about what it costs you then there's the selfish kind which lost out and dreams up bitchy names and there's the trap of imagining that you are needed when all you show is how easy you are to manipulate and there's common sense which tells you eventually that you'll meet the right balance by winging it and being able to be a friend and have friends Jon Secada God Emperor of Dune Death Note Theory of conduct Altruism Scientology beliefs and practices Cyberspace The Emancipation of Mimi Hide and Q (TNG episode) The Lovely Bones Sant Thakar Singh Camp (style) The Ashlee Simpson Show The Battle (TNG episode) The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Friends Shaggy dog story W.I.T.C.H.
