i want to help hi i am really concerned about the worsening situaion in sudan last year we saw a presentation on it at school and i was horrified i really wish there was something i could do so didn't feel so helpless and guilty about my own blessings but i'm just a teenager any ideas thanks really good question i have been thinking the same thing lately this is pretty serious stuff and i feel the same way i would say that knowledge will be the best way that anyone can help spread the word about how this is wrong and evil this is and get people to realize that this is real and innocent people are being killed everyday the worst part is what is happening here in american people have become unaware of how far this has gone and would rather live in denial about it while still supporting the people who are behind this you see they are having so many guilty feelings combined with too afraid to admit they have made a mistake and continue to believe that they are right and never stop to rethink how the situation actually is tell people how wrong this is i think if we get enough people to realize and start to actually unite together we can save what is left of the people we are hurting us and them also don't be racist everybody is different and no two of any race is exactly the same so each person should be a person not an entire group of people Theory of conduct EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alignment (role-playing games) Jean Grey One Tree Hill (TV series) Theodicy Conscience Evil Milton H.
