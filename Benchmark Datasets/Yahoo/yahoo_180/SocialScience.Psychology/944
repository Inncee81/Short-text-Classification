why do we have a need for revenge i believe the desire for revenge is tied to a basic human need or instinct when assaulted or attacked we flee or fight we strike back when hurt by someone physically emotionally financially etc every time we recall the experience we feel the hurt and the instinct to strike back kicks in again this can inspire the desire for revenge this is why humans have invented the concept of forgiveness because the desire for revenge can not only consume us emotionally but if we act out our desires we could bring down on ourselves horrible devastating consequences best to just put it in the past and walk away from caring about it Lightsaber combat Revenge Kain (Legacy of Kain) Darth Vader Theory of conduct Tenshinhan Magneto (comics) Martial art Love K' EastEnders Domestic violence Eddie Guerrero Obi-Wan Kenobi Jean-Jacques Rousseau Forgiveness Anger management Simone Weil God Emperor of Dune Traumatic incident reduction Dog training Empathy Free will Protoss Force (Star Wars) Starfire (comics) Emotion Human sexual behavior The Merchant of Venice Shinn Asuka Skinny Puppy W.I.T.C.H.
