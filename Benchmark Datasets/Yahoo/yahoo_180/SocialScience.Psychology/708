have you ever been in a near death experience hi i was wondering if anyone has ever been in a near death experience if so what did it feel like i know it's a strange question but my mother and i were discussing it earlier and now i'm curious to hear other people's experiences i was at a party where i stopped breathing turns out my drinks were being laced with some nasty drugs i've never done i distinctly remember sitting on the couch and feeling like something was terribly wrong i couldn't talk and i couldn't move then i realized that i hadn't been breathing i tried but couldn't i remember seeing the clock and thinking 'great i'm going to die at am in this cockroach infested druggie house on spring break this isn't me at all this isn't how i wanted to die ' the last things i remember hearing was a ridiculous conversation with someone trying to convince someone else that cheerios were actually doughnut seeds then i remember this guy asking someone if i was alright because i looked grey i heard him say something to another guy about what the hell he was trying to do because he didn't need an ambulance or the cops there the next thing i remember is waking up in the er with nobody but a nurse and a police officer in sight apparently my 'friends' from spring break had been kind enough to drop me off and then take off before they had to answer any questions that was my first big taste of how people suck Milton H.
