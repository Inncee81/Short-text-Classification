ever noticed how the people who say they're selfish tend to be the most selfish of all why is that ok your gonna have to roll with me on this one lol i'm in one of my i wonder moods ever known someone like this the one's who walk around exclaiming how selfless they are but in reality their actions tell a different story a tale of selfishness yet of all the people i've ever known that i would consider selfless i've never heard one of them claim that instead i've heard most of them call themselves selfish and blame themselves for the actions of others though in most cases this blame is undeserved i wonder lol if the mere act of calling someone selfish is in fact selfish think about it this way why would anyone say that because they feel their needs desires are being overlooked right true or not just recognizing that is selfish no and for that matter uh oh here she goes is calling yourself selfless a contradiction of terms your thoughts that is of course if my wonderment is even coherent enough to make sense of lol i agree with you i think that for some folks not all but they call folks selfish perhaps because that inparticular person is not sharing or what ever with that them i agree that those folks might be soooooooooo into themself that if we do not cater to their whims we are considered selfish because we did not put them first haha a selfish thing in itself i agree with you Coercion Goodness and value theory Altruism Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Alignment (role-playing games) Evil Sant Thakar Singh Love A Course In Miracles Epistemology Consensus decision-making Patriotism Nicomachean Ethics Free will John Howard Yoder The Selfish Gene Religious Society of Friends The nature of God in Western theology Japanese values Jewish principles of faith English grammar Prisoner's dilemma New Age Parsifal Buddhism Egolessness Scientology beliefs and practices Truth Utilitarianism Philipp Melanchthon Blood on the Tracks Into the Woods Sexual orientation Bernard Williams Gratitude Psychosis Value system Atheism Simone Weil Guilt Supernatural Religion Charles Dickens Numerology Hindu philosophy Scientific method Advaita Vedanta Moral Politics Meme Ontological argument Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Appeal Childfree Theory of conduct The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Duties of the Heart Sant Mat Two Treatises of Government Contract Legacy of Kain John Wycliffe Obsessive-compulsive disorder Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Categorical imperative Anarcho-capitalism Socrates Happiness The Shining (film) Contradiction Philosophical skepticism Infantilism Ten Commandments Supply and demand Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Adam Smith Cenodoxus Sin Novel LOL (Internet slang) Falsifiability Reality Magic (illusion) Insanity defense Thomism Summa Theologiae Transgender Democracy Gantz Storytelling Public domain Meaning Philosophy of language Royal Assent Theory A.
