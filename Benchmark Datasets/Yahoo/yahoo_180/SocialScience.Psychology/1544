if creating a sense of purpose is the hardest thing to do which road do i take i have such trouble finding direction in my life and don't ya tell me to get a map i love humour just not today thank you any true insights i'm kinda in the same boat but i'm starting to think whether one direction possibly worth taking is to tackle something you feel strongly about eg i feel strongly about injustices it absolutely makes my blood boil when people are treated unfairly that to me suggest that perhaps i should consider studying law and defend those in weaker position where they are unable to bargain for more equity but there may be other related jobs career that doesn't necessarily involve studying law afterall these days it takes a lot of to get a degree perhaps you have been touched by something an experience that has greatly affected you i for example also feel strongly about neglected and abused children and have wracking my brain to think how i can do my bit even it is to relieve one child being abused or neglected that in itself would be rewarding enough the road you don't want to take is the road towards giving up i believe when a person takes that road is when they start losing hope and self esteem perhaps you can start thinking what you feel strongly about what makes your blood boil and perhaps you can do something about it i hope you find the right road to take and i wish you the best of luck Social rule Theory of conduct Narcissism Infantilism Goodness and value theory Karen Horney Stroke ELO rating system Dualism (philosophy of mind) Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Adult attention-deficit disorder Bipolar disorder Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Time Out of Mind Victor Cousin Abortion debate Blood on the Tracks Appeal Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Friedrich Schleiermacher Motivation Graduate school Drug addiction Schizophrenia Contract Anxiety Pitaten Psychoanalysis Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bruce Johnson Theodicy Philosophical skepticism Principal-agent problem Leviathan (book) Bernard Williams Chronic fatigue syndrome Economic inequality Arguments for and against drug prohibition Divorce Summa Theologiae Insulin Charles Grandison Finney Second language acquisition Objectivist philosophy Causality The nature of God in Western theology Philosophy of language Coercion Prostate cancer Psychosis Estoppel The Sims 2 Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Predestination Free trade Alcoholism Traumatic brain injury Maison Ikkoku Fecal incontinence Clinical depression Philipp Melanchthon Asperger syndrome Free will Rudolf Hermann Lotze Alignment (role-playing games) Autism rights movement Cannabis (drug) Domestic violence Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Friends Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Theory of multiple intelligences Magical thinking Alcoholics Anonymous Merit Pedophilia God Philosophy of space and time Adoption Addiction Milton H.
