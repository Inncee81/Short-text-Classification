can you please tell me what this dream means serious answers only plz this is serious i am a year old girl last night i had a dream about my ex in the dream my ex trevor brown took my hand and walked me outside this building which looked kind of like a school outside to this really green grassy area with this really beautiful fountain a couple of people were outside running or eating or something like that so we sat down on the edge of the fountain we looked into each other eyes for a few seconds then slowly went in for a kiss we just sat there kissing really romanticly and holding hands for a few minutes after we were done we smiled at each other that was all can anyone tell me what that means serious answers only please oh and do dreams ever come true in real life thanks for all your answers much appreciated oh and please no things about how im young ive only had kisses in my life sorry im i hit the wrong button haha oh and my dream didnt happen i never kissed him well in my opinion it sounds like you have made peace with the fact you and your ex are over you have come to a peaceful happy setting such as a park and sat by serine water fountain and did a kiss good bye especially since it was a romantic kiss and not a trashy makeout fest it seems that this was a mutual end i'm not sure how your relationship was or how it ended but it seems to me that you have pushed forward and you moved on if you both talk and have a ok relationship this could be coming through to show how again as i said you both have been able to mutually move on i'd say take it as a good omen that your heart has healed most people might say that it might mean that you want him back because you are in love and so on but i highly doubt that this is the case hope this helps Jon Secada Cliff Richard Shaggy dog story Hall & Oates Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The McGuire Sisters Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Current teachings of Prem Rawat Frankie Vaughan Social rule The Amber Spyglass EastEnders Theory of conduct Friends Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Marilyn Monroe Happiness The Isley Brothers Avenue Q 2000 Australian Grand Prix Carrie Jacobs-Bond Dundas Square Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Time Out of Mind Skinny Puppy Daryl Hall Negima Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers The Ashlee Simpson Show Blood on the Tracks Trailer Park Boys Human sexual behavior Care Bears Meaning of life Scenes from a Memory AFI 100 Years series Miss Saigon Rocko's Modern Life Friendship The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Mary Jane Watson W.I.T.C.H.
