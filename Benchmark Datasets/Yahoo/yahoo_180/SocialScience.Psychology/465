a shocking realization i've lived my life without a great deal of trouble i've had to struggle a bit but i've always came out on top i have a relativity stable family good friends working on a college degree health and a well rounded mind unfortunately recently while sitting with a small group of friends i came to a grim realization we were talking about life meaning and being when someone mentioned that while i'm a great person to be around and a good friend i don't let them know how i feel i thought for a moment and realized that i habitually suppress my emotion almost inadvertently that's just part of the problem as a direct result of this i also realized that while i am content with my life i don't believe i've ever truly been happy never been happy how can this be so i ask you what should i do to actively pursue happiness i want to be happy but i don't really have a strong definition of personal happiness as i said i've always had a feeling of contentment but not happiness you have just taken the biggest step to being happy and to self realization with this great breakthrough however if you really really want to be happy perhaps you should start sharing you feelings with others i suggest taking a notebook and picking the things you find that you are shortcoming on put one on each page as a title then under this write a step by step little baby steps way of reaching them never tackle an issue as just one big problem but as small pieces it is not as overwhelming then in another notebook write all of your triumphs in life and success's and strengths and dreams when you make a step in your other notebook add it to this one when you have a set back look in this one to cheer you up always look at your strengths and success's and forget setbacks hope this helps Jon Secada Nicomachean Ethics New York Giants Social rule Infantilism Alcoholics Anonymous The Ashlee Simpson Show Friends The Amber Spyglass Sex and the City Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Current teachings of Prem Rawat 2000 Australian Grand Prix Miss Saigon Happiness W.I.T.C.H.
