have you ever noticed that the guys who are arrested for enticing young women to go with them are really creepy looking and they will say how the guy is charismatic or something like that most of those guys are guys i wouldn't give the time of day because i would be kind of afraid of them and i don't understand why some of these young women would get in the car with them voluntarily or go somewhere with them i might understand if a naive young women got in the car with some really good looking guy but some of these guys are so unattractive or evil looking that you would think they the women would run and hide i didn't mean that because a man is physically unattractive that i wouldn't be nice to him or even date him but some of these guys are downright evil looking and yes i only see their mugshot where they are dazed from being arrested etc when the guys are enticing young women they don't present themselves like a still photo in a state of shock after they have just been arrested and fingerprinted they use gestures their voice body language gift of the gab if they are articulate and the woman is not she may feel stupid not trusting someone who seems to be doing her a favour going out of his way to offer her a lift that would cost him extra petrol and time he may have a dog with him that is licking him and seems to love him and that might make a man seem reasonable to a naive woman i saw something on tv a long time ago where people were shown photos of other people and they had to guess their occupation some of these were pics of killers and some were teachers there was no pattern to who was guessing correctly if you meet an ugly person you think geez he she is ugly but then if you see them regularly in passing and they always smile and wave and act friendly they look less ugly to you then you get in their car one day and whammo they start going in a different direction from where you think they are going to take you and you start to say something and they say just gotta go home and turn the gas off just remembered i left it on and then you feel well i'll give him the benefit of the doubt i have a job that lets me meet engaged couples and you would be amazed what ugly men some women will marry women can use cosmetics toiletries clothes and hair styles to improve themselves but there is not much to help ugly men look around at your own neighbours friends and rellies are they all oil paintings imagine a young woman being offered a lift by any of them when i was the man next door aged about and bald and overweight offered me a lift to the city to where i worked cos he said he was going in anyway so i hopped in the car he took me to meet all his male friends at their homes he said just wait here and then he would rush up to their front door and bring them down to the driveway and introduce me and then hop in and drive to his next mate's place i kept sayiing i am going to be late for work but he was very excited and drove to his next friends' place and so on i was hours late for work i didn't know what suburb i was in he spoke to all these guys in another language lucky for me he didn't touch me i was very cautious with any man after that mum had always reminded me of stranger danger but this man lived next to us for years and i was friends with his daughter i didn't tell my mother for fear she would curtail the little bit of freedom i did have your girlfriends' dads weren't they all ugly merely because you were and they were and that seemed really old but they were kind to you and when your own dad is a wifebasher you are interested in observing your girlfriends' dads when unsavoury men are approaching people they ask for something in such a way that it seems mean if you refuse like can i have seconds of your time just seconds what is seconds nothing so you hesitate and go to the car door then they hold up a road map book and ask you to point out where you are next thing you are being grabbed hope i have been some help Shaggy dog story About a Boy Sharon Tate Humphrey Bogart The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy One Tree Hill (TV series) Maison Ikkoku Sin City EastEnders Friends Theory of conduct Garfield Little Britain Neighbours Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kyle Broflovski Recurring South Park characters The Shining (film) Married... with Children The Smoking Room Jon Secada Springfield Elementary School Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Ocean's Twelve The Inside Moe Szyslak W.I.T.C.H.
