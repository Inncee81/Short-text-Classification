question for the men when a girl breaks up with a guy because he has hurt her so is it better to act as if nothing happened or to show that he has hurt her if not why not i truly value your opinions thank you i already showed him that i was hurt and he knew that and i feel like he thought that i would be a doormat to him so i had to put him on his spot which i did i miss him and i'm still hurt but i refused to let him know that so i'm trying to act like i'm fine without him which is true for the most part but i still miss him oh he knows alright but he doesnt seem to care which hurts me more i feel like he doesnt show that he cares in order to manipulate me but hell no that's not going to happen good question indeed this is where most girls fall for me as a guy and hope most of us have the same feelings if you really like the guy first show him that u are hurt but not too much or he wil feel superior over you then when you thin he can feel your hurt act like nothing had ever happend and that you can carry yourself without him go out with some other guys and the weakness of us guys will come out and dont tell this to no other girls plz cos we guys will suffer bye Atomic Kitten Jon Secada Memento (film) Avenue Q Theory of conduct Good Morning, Vietnam Humphrey Bogart Alignment (role-playing games) Hollyoaks One Tree Hill (TV series) Pitaten Pok__mon Live!
