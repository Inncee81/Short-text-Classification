when someone toots his own horn on a regular basis and waits for you to praise him what is the appropriate response should praise be given this is not a jealousy issue but just trying to figure out if compliments and praise feed this behavior or is this behavior perfectly acceptable any thoughts appreciated while i have been ignoring the boastful comments it hasn't worked over a period of years i also don't think negative confrontation is a solution i've tried positive confrontation but to no avail and i'm not really impressed that someone wants to impress me i guess it depends on how regular it is it could be that it is a craving for attention resulting from some other aspect of present or past life in this case compliments when justified would be appropriate alternatively it could just be an inflated ego in this case ignore them unfortunately telling one from the other is difficult Narcissism Microeconomics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Internet troll Taxation in the United States Drug addiction Propaganda Transactional analysis Philosophical skepticism Scientology beliefs and practices Christian-Jewish reconciliation Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Simone Weil Plame affair Economic inequality EastEnders Morality Theory of conduct Karma Motivation Externality Game theory Gestalt therapy David Hume Quantum mechanics Addiction Abortion debate Utilitarianism Free will Merit Alcoholics Anonymous Infantilism Jiddu Krishnamurti The writing of Principia Mathematica Supply and demand Milton H.
