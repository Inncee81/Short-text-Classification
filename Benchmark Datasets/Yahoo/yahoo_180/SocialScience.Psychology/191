variant iq test i've heard many times that the iq test is flawed but is there any alternative it may be more accurate to think that the interpretation of the iq test results are flawed rather than the test it is true that all tests have some error retake any test and the results are likely to be slightly different that is why many people are reluctant to report results in any other terms than ranges and with a certain degree of confidence e g there is a chance that the results are accurate that means that if you were to take the test times times the results would be significantly mistaken but assuming you have an accurate score and that is likely the bigger question is what that score means often times the score is given more importance than it deserves many times the score is limited in its ability to say much about a person and how they function in the world since most tests of this nature are scored on the basis of making a comparison to a normative sample it may not be accurate or meaningful to compare the performance to people of a different cultural background eductational experience or speak another language than the normative sample this is why many tests get periodically reviewed updated rewritten etc to try to eleimate a bias for example there are iq tests that require no language skills no visual skills etc there are test that attempt to take into consideration such factors as an attention deficit disorder or a developmental learning disability but in balance it is imporatnt to point out that iq test typically do correlate very highly with many behavioral indices used properly than can be a essential guide to educational and vocational planing among other things it is important to know that iq is not one factor but several most test are actually a set of many subtests all measing different abilities one could have superior spatial skills but below average verbal skills or vica versa iq tests have also been criticized for not including measures to assess such things as creativity and emotional iq or our ability to understand interpersonal and social situations and relationships that is why any effort to utilize such resources requires the supervision of a psychologist who has had years of specialized training to accurately use this resource they would be the best resource for determing the best way to meet an individual's need in this regard Second language acquisition Autism Psychology Asperger syndrome Mental retardation Standardized testing SAT Intelligence (trait) Dyslexia Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Race and intelligence Social psychology Cognitive science Antisocial personality disorder Psychoanalysis Normal distribution Myers-Briggs Type Indicator General intelligence factor Factor analysis Sexual orientation GED Reliability engineering A Course In Miracles Consensus decision-making Martial art Psychometrics Extreme Programming Test (student assessment) Strategic management ELO rating system Human Scientology beliefs and practices Bayesian inference Education in the People's Republic of China Bipolar disorder Economics Neuro-linguistic programming Economic inequality Parapsychology Transsexuality Personality psychology Clinical depression Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Human sexual behavior Supply and demand Hearing impairment Model (economics) Theory of multiple intelligences Hypoglycemia Graduate school Microeconomics Aphasia Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Controversies in autism Consciousness Culture Python programming language Homophobia Margin of error Psychological testing Franz Boas Principal-agent problem Pedophilia Contract Item response theory Schizophrenia Leadership Debugging Traumatic brain injury Literacy Education in the United States Music Biology and sexual orientation Education Psychosis Learning disability Alexander Technique Domestic violence Quicksort Affirmative action Cultural relativism Collision detection Adult attention-deficit disorder Gifted Unemployment Physical attractiveness Hypnosis Deconstruction Internet troll Software testing Medicine
