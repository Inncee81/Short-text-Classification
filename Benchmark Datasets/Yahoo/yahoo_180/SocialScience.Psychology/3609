is it possible to be addicted to the phone i have a constant need to talk on the phone since childhood i cannot ever unplug it or ignore it when ringing and most of the time i have to be the one to answer it or i become agitated and anxious i spend roughly hours a day on the telephone calling everyone i know and when i have no one to talk to i will even call up people from the past that i have had lost touch with just to hang up when they answer and at other times i will randomly call numbers from the yellow pages businesses to ask for useless information for example asking their operating hours or location just to have someone to call if during an argument someone hangs up on me i have been known to call constantly harassing them till they pick up again i am far too embarassed to ever ask someone about it in person i'm curious if this could be a byproduct of bi coastal parenting where the relationships were kept going through telephone what an interesting question due to the media portrayal of addiction and the interests of pharmaceutical companies most of us automatically think of physical addiction and its withdrawal effects the addict who has to have a fix because he she is going crazy with withdrawal symptoms the truth is physical addiction is only a facet of addiction and not the most important aspect psychological addiction is much more important think how many people have given up the physical addiction of smoking for example without any help they were able to do it because they did not have an overwhelming psychological addiction accompanying the physical addiction so can you or anyone else be psychologically addicted to the telephone the answer is yes you give some clues in your question to the importance of the phone to you when you speak of your bi coastal parenting therein could lie the beginning of a psychological dependence on phone contact in order to feel safe and secure there is no shame or embarrassment in that we all have needs some of which we don't even notice and some of which get in our way because of their intensity i would encourage you to learn more about addictions you're not alone you might want to read the heart of addictions by lance dodes md you might also find it helpful to consider how one goes about finding a mental health professional a good place to start is my non commercial website http www tandemjourney org page asp navid although the website is directed toward parents who want to help their teen the principals of finding the right therapist will work for you regardless of your age you have already shown yourself to be insightful with a little help you will be able reduce the addictive symptoms that you described good luck berater Autism Clinical depression Asperger syndrome Transsexuality Social rule Addiction Sexual orientation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mental illness Plame affair Child sexuality Narcissism Telephone exchange Psychotherapy Kurt Cobain Stuttering Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tobacco smoking Reparative therapy Drug addiction Procrastination Infantilism Alcoholism Cannabis (drug) Narcotic Motivation Medicine Sexual addiction Psychosis Traumatic incident reduction Surveillance Drug abuse Psychology Meditation Scientology beliefs and practices Arguments for and against drug prohibition Methamphetamine Borderline personality disorder Adult attention-deficit disorder Milton H.
