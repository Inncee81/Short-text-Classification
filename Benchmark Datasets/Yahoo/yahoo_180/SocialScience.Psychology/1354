nice people get no credit how can i change my personality i'm always sensible honest nice trustworthy and loyal but i never get any credit for that and i've been taken advantage of so many times and i currently have a bf who takes me completely for granted i'm years old and my question is is it possible for me to change into a tougher person and what methods can i use i know that it seems you're alone in being taken advantage of but you're not i don't necessarily think it has anything to do with being seen as too nice or a pushover but is more a function of your perspective and your reasons for being seen as a great friend or romantic partner it has been my experience that the one thing that people value in their relationships with others is predictability you are obviously stable but an unfortunate side effect of being seen that way is that you'll often be sought after by people in your life that are missing that valuable trait one way to help your friends develop that trait in themselves is to change up how you react to something that is a recurring issue between you nothing drastic necessarily but enough to make them question why you're not reacting as expected this will lead to some dialog where you can gently make your point which will help them see how their actions are outside of what you find acceptable and hopefully make them think twice the next time bottom line is that you are obviously sensitive compassionate and someone others will tend to want to lean on don't let these slights diminish people in your eyes instead choose to help them develop themselves so they can grow into the kind of friend that you're already capable of being you sound like a wonderful person and it would be a shame if you let yourself get jaded by some mistreatment that may not be intentional Social psychology Infantilism Animal rights Alignment (role-playing games) Coercion Expert system Economic inequality Gender role CPU cache Goodness and value theory Prisoner's dilemma Economics Strategic management Equine conformation Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Polyamory Zoophilia Transsexuality Theodicy Species Sexual orientation Bretton Woods system Borderline personality disorder Trademark Stuttering Franz Boas Sant Thakar Singh Human sexual behavior Social rule Abortion debate Predestination Philosophy of language Enneagram Transactional analysis Phaedo Scouting Leadership Intelligent design Socrates Meaning of life Microeconomics Homeopathy Dragon Booster Scientific method Intelligence (trait) RuneScape cheats Extreme Programming Ethics Milton H.
