does changing your avatar affect the answers of y a users to your questions i've been using the yahoo cartoon avatar since i started using this site i usually had mean and offensive responses to answers or my questions not being taken seriously only recently i changed it to a picture of my own self just a matter of letting people know who i really am right and there were less offensive or foolish answers as if people started taking me seriously i thought it was just a trend among y a users over the past few weeks but then today i changed it back to the cartoon avatar then posted a quite provoking question and the answers kept on coming one after the other most of them not sparing a bit of me the penny must have dropped somewhere when i decided to change it back to my photo and see what would happen people were suddenly not offensive anymore took their time to answer as good as possible and actually took me seriously maybe it's just coincidence but one hell of a coincidence no i would think it's because people are more humane the moment they realise it's actually a real person asking the questions or that they will just be kinder to someone they like looking at i refuse to believe that i'm liked to be looked at however yes it does persons tend to be more respectful when as you say they get cues that the questioner is a real person not just the cartoon character image that the users may see the coincidence that you witnessed with the answers to your question has additional explanations as well that do not necessarily cancel our your own explanation about that you changed to a personal picture avatar who chooses to answer also depends on the kind of avatars that the users have users like to answer the questions of persons who use the same kinds of avatars cartoon personal picture art that they use perhaps after you switched to a personal picture avatar you attracted more users who have experience with using personal picture avatars and the users who use personal picture avatars are not as offensive as the ones that use y cartoon avatars note that the first person who answered this question of yours also has a personal picture avatar it could also have been a time differential effect that can explain the change in answers that you received i find that when i ask questions the offensive answers are the first to arrive because it is easy to post a short insult and the more serious well reasoned ones come later because it takes more time to think of an intelligent response this is not always the case it is only a tendency Internet troll Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Expert system Microeconomics Theory of conduct Religion God Emperor of Dune Newbie Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Neopets Final Fantasy XI Social rule Supernatural Gaia Online Origin belief Avatar (virtual reality) Philosophy of language B3ta MMORPG Abortion debate Monty Hall problem Social psychology Plame affair Avatar Meaning of life Sexual orientation Law of value GunBound Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Password Scientology beliefs and practices General Mayhem Supply and demand Leo Wyatt Extreme Programming Dualism (philosophy of mind) GED Fermi paradox Kain (Legacy of Kain) Theology Time travel Coercion Downing Street memo Sant Thakar Singh Cheating in Counter-Strike I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Jumpstart 3rd Grade Atomism Unidentified flying object Philosophy of space and time Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Modem Internet phenomenon Free will Soul Magical thinking Dilbert Turing test Zeno's paradoxes Reincarnation 343 Guilty Spark Predestination paradox Autism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Origin of life Marvel Universe 9/11 conspiracy theories Photography Charmed Past teachings of Prem Rawat IBM PC compatible Ethics Asperger syndrome Philosophy of mathematics Halting problem Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Aesthetic Realism Ayyavazhi mythology The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Mojave people Tide A Course In Miracles Transsexuality The Subtle Knife Calvin and Hobbes Santa Claus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
