why are people so afraid to say what they think i feel that the world would be such a better place if everyone was honest about their thoughts feelings well the world would be a nicer place if everyone was honest about who they were and were still accepted as such as it is when people reveal who they are they are often rejected judged or hurt one person might share a deep fear or feelings to their partner the closer person they have in the world and that person may say insensitively get over it you're just overreacting maybe if you weren't such a baby you'd be happier in life and i wouldn't have to listen to your constant whining that response would hurt maybe even devastate the person trying to be open and just like physically people pull their hand back from a hot fire when they feel pain so emotionally people try to avoid pain by withdrawing after being hurt like that which all people usually are at one point or another they learn that the safest thing to do is be more distant and closed about who they are be less vulnerable and therefore not receive as much pain and we all are naturally afraid of intense pain some choose to let this fear effect their lives negatively in many ways but the fear is a rational fear and most people if you prove yourself trustworthy will open up about their thoughts and opinions fear is good if you don't let it control your life fear can keep you away from dangers and that's good but if it has a disabling effect then a person should look for answers so my answer is that people are afraid to be honest about their true thoughts and feelings because nine times out of time someone hurtful selfish or just insensitive will not accept that person for who they are even people who seem safe most of the time can betray and cause the deepest pain Theory of conduct Transactional analysis Adoption Traumatic incident reduction Evil Homophobia Diving Dualism (philosophy of mind) Alignment (role-playing games) Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Human sexual behavior Stoicism Scientology beliefs and practices Utilitarianism Happiness Borderline personality disorder Transsexuality Goodness and value theory Narcissism Religion A Course In Miracles Abortion debate Ethics Stuttering Theodicy Current teachings of Prem Rawat Anxiety Spanking Altruism Plame affair EastEnders Alcoholics Anonymous Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Meaning of life Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Jon Secada Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.
