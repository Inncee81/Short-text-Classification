extra extroidenary people and i'm just ordinary i try so hard in school yet there are millions of people smarter than i am i envy people with photographic memories i want one i want people to look at me and think i'm a child prodegy i want to be good enough to be on the oprah show yet here i am plain jane how is that so many people are gifted yet i'm just limited in my abilities i want to be a writer but still there are so many more writer who are better than i am and i often lay in bed having trouble breathing because i have a fear of what the future holds i think too much and it scares the heck out of me so confused azooga but it's tearing me apart inside and i just can't get rid of the yearning that easily i feel the same way not about writing so you dont need to worry about competing against me i believe that you have to live your dream if your dream is writing you will succeed in it greatly i also lay in bed at night thinking about what my dream is and how im going to complete it because it is almost impossible to do i believe ill do it though and i think you could write something great if it comes from your true heart and soul it may take a while so you must have pacience and true determination and love for what your doing and it will happen pray to god and ask him to help you if its what you want to do god will be fair because he will know if you dont do it you wont be happy in life Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Phaedo Jon Secada Sant Thakar Singh Atomic Kitten Lucid dreaming One Tree Hill (TV series) Scenes from a Memory The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Cliff Richard Bhajan Dream God Emperor of Dune Merit Simone Weil Avenue Q Goodness and value theory A Course In Miracles Tina Turner Christian eschatology Free will Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME The Catcher in the Rye Duties of the Heart Philipp Melanchthon Dean Koontz C__line Dion Carrie Jacobs-Bond W.I.T.C.H.
