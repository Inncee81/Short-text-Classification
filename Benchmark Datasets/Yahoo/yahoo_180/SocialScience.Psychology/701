why is that most cops have the same demeanor i am not being sarcastic when i ask this but every cop i meet generally has the same personality and i am excluding female officers from what i know is a huge generalazation every cop i meet tends to be very cocky distrustful and condescending even outside of work why i think it would help if they were more approachable my friends husband works as one and he seriously lacks social skills despite being nice to me directly he scrutinizes every person he comes into contact with because cops are fully aware that they live in a fuck the police society most of us hate cops when they bother us or other petty criminals but we love them when we need their help personally im the same way i know a couple cops personally nice guys and i chill with them but i hate that cops bother petty criminals i feel they should concentrate on real crimes like homicide and such the cops that sit around and try to catch speeders is the most annoying thing ever plus the cops that are involved with crazy things see some terrible stuff a cop i know saw a baby put into a oven cuz the mother was on crack plus they get angry about criminals and they know they cant do shit they have to restrain themselves from beating the shit out of some criminals some criminals get off the hook easy and they cant put out their anger to that person or the judge so they project their anger onto their friends and stuff Sin City COPS (TV series) Knots Landing True Crime: Streets of LA Domestic violence Kim Possible Shit The Marshall Mathers LP Reservoir Dogs Ranma __ characters Neighbours The Inside Hip hop rivalries Jam (TV series) Verlan Trailer Park Boys EastEnders Friends Sinfest Midnight Run Police Prisoner (TV series) Kyle Broflovski The League of Gentlemen (comedy) The Shield Alcoholics Anonymous The Smoking Room Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Child pornography KaBlam!
