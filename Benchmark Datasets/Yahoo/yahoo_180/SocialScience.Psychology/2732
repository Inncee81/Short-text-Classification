i feel so gloomy and sad lately how can learn to love me for me in the past few years i have been through alot and i find i am always unhappy with myself alot because i cannot pursue my dream the way i had planned due to an unexpected and critical hearing loss i find myself always wishing i was skin and bones and just alwyas altering my looks all of my best friends rushed soroities and i feel so left out can i say everyone is doing their thing and i feel like all i have is a person here and there and my boyfriend whom we have our own fair share of problems please help me please it's a good thing that you recognize that there is something that you need to change because that means you have a desire to change things in your life you are willing to work things out you are not giving up and this is a good sign rather than nursing your depression i've heard a good line in a movie where it says sometimes we have to readjust our dreams and that unexpectedly may give us more happiness find something else that you can look forward to something else that you love i'm sure you will be able to do something to keep you happy Pitaten Happiness One Tree Hill (TV series) Goodness and value theory Avenue Q Phoebe Halliwell Current teachings of Prem Rawat Knots Landing EastEnders W.I.T.C.H.
