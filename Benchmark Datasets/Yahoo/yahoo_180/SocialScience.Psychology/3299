a situation so i dont know what to do i am depressed all the time i try to be happy but i am not see growing up my mother would tell me things like my dad hates me i have mental problems and things like i am a liar even when i am telling the truth and to top it off she would check with me every week to make sure some of her friends had not touched me and i wasnt popular in school so i had kids being mean and just no escape even though she knows she is wrong she refuses to talk about it with me she is over it so i should be to she says to this day it bugs me it depresses me i dont know how to get through it people around me are tired of me being down about it i am trying to get over it i thought if me and her talked it out i would be better but she wont what should i do its just a night mare i cant escape even years later you could try to work it out on your own and try understand why she did it and where she was coming from then let it go or maybe you should let it go you should not let events or people even your mother stop you from living your life and being happy or try to build a relationship with your mother where you can talk about almost anything and then bring it up or corner her and make her speak to you about it if you think that that is the only way for you to overcome the depression you could also try seeing someone and or taking antidepressants About a Boy Friends Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Amber Spyglass The Human Stain The Catcher in the Rye Clinical depression W.I.T.C.H.
