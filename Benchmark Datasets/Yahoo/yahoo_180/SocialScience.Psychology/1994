is there a right way to grieve after a death my year old cousin died in a car accident about months ago and i feel sort of numb to the whole thing i come from a close family his death really hurt us all i keep hearing that i am not grieving right because i am holding it in this is the first death i have ever had to deal with and i just want to know is there a right way to grieve that's so sad about your cousin's death aidan what an awful shock i don't think there's a right way to grieve no there isn't a wrong way either two months isn't very long you need to give yourself time to come to terms with what's happened not put any time limits on your feelings i remember how ift felt when my mum passed away so suddenly too it's just an awful numbness and disbelief i think you'll find that the grieving will work itself through in stages i don't think you ever get fully over the loss of a loved one but in time it does get less painful believe me what do you think your cousin would like for you to do if they were here now probably to carry on and be strong and remember them in your own special way through your own life and to try to slowly move on as and when you feel you are ready i do hope things get easier for you in time just remember there are people around you who care about you and love you Grief EastEnders Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Jon Secada Scenes from a Memory Time Out of Mind Sex and the City Funeral Reaction to the assassination of John F.
