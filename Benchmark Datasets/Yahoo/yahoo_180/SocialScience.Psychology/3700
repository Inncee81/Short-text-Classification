self esteem issues i have huge self esteem issues i hate the way i look and everything about me i have tried so many things to make myself look beautiful my family gets mad when i say i'm ugly and some of my aquaintences can't call them friends say that i'm not ugly but no one would tell me the truth to my face i don't want to please others i want to please myself and i've told myself that i will not be happy until i do and it's not just my looks my weight my personality my talents i feel like i'm not good at or worth anything i know this is not good for me and i really want something to help i don't do well with therapists i have no friends to talk to i can't talk to my family because if i talk to my sister who had an eating disorder i may cause her to relapse if i talk to my mom she'll freak out and think i have an eating disorder i have no connection whatsoever to my other sister so can someone please help welcome to the human dilemma i would just say don't be so hard on yourself everyone everyone everyone everyone everyone deals with the issues at some stage in their life i would advise to not do anything rash and trust that as you get older and your perspective matures you will see your situation in much better light i have contemplated suicide before over this kind of stuff and i am so glad i hung on long enough to see that all of that was really just a lie and not who i am if you like to read i would say go read the book captivating by john and staci eldredge it's not a self help book by any means it's just some fresh ways for girls to look at their beauty and their lives and maybe get some answers as to way everything can be so damn hard it's christian based but even if you were to look past that it's a wonderful book that's helped a lot of girls i know i'm proud of you for being willing to voice your frustrations you're something precious don't be afraid to ask for help in this area because the alternative really sucks people care more then they let on hope you start feeling better life is so much freaking better then people let on don't let this define you now because there are so much more greater things out there to experience and be apart of empathic red Theory of conduct Goodness and value theory Kodocha Avenue Q Milton H.
