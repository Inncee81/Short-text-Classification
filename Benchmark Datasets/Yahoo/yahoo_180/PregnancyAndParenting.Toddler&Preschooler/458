my month old sleeping in our bed she used to be just fine in her own crib until about months ago now when she wakes a night which is still about times she wont go back to sleep in her own bed i get her another bottle she still wont sleep without one i put on her music and then try to go lay down but she will cry and cry until i go and get her and put her in bed with me and then shes practily asleep by the time her head hits the pillow as soon as she falls asleep i put her back in her bed but then it starts all over again within a couple hours sometimes even within minutes what do i do i need my sleep because she moves so much and kicks and takes up the whole bed you've started it now you have to break it the hard way and it will take considerable time and effort start by ignoring her when she wakes up crying do not respond at all for at least minutes she may cry herself back to sleep if not call out to her mommy's here it's ok go back to sleep but do not go to her say nothing else and wait at least more minutes before you go to her then don't take her out of her bed or say anything to her just stand near her bed and silently watch her for more minutes if she's still crying lie down on the floor yourself next to her bed for minutes finally if absolutely necessary pick her up and rock her in your arms until she goes to sleep then promptly put her back in her bed if she wakes up again after you put her back in bed you have to do it all over again don't give in you may have to do the whole minute routine a couple of times a night for a week or more but she'll eventually adjust just don't be surprised if after you have to spend the st night in a hotel again together or share a room at someone else's house that it will start all over again btw get her off that bottle to go to sleep she's too old for that and you will rot out every tooth in the child's head Mattress Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sin City The Shining (film) The Catcher in the Rye The Amber Spyglass Apollo 8 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Out-of-body experience Knots Landing She Loves You Sleep Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Daylight saving time Aerial (dance move) Otello Ben Johnson (athlete) Ocean's Twelve Miss Saigon Social rule Piccolo Junior Saga Avenue Q Blood Simple Donald Neilson Fancy Crane New York Giants Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare EastEnders Sleeping Murder Swingout Oasis (band) Friends Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Professional wrestling match types Sudden infant death syndrome Futurama (TV series - season 5) Blonde on Blonde Big Brother UK series 6 Jam (TV series) Russian joke Babe Ruth Kurt Angle 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Characters of The Sandman Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Public transport Hansel und Gretel Blankets (graphic novel) Manos: The Hands of Fate Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Kurt Cobain Narcolepsy The Family from One End Street Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) James Hanratty Attack on Pearl Harbor Skinny Dip Saturday Night Live Charles Peace Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Inside Forty-seven Ronin About a Boy The Contender (television series) Milton H.
