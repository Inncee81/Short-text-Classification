my son wants to use potty when he's bored argh my year old son has been potty trained daytime for about months now at home he can go a few hours in between potty breaks when we go out especially at restaurants he insists on using the potty every minutes i think he's bored so going to the potty is interesting for him after a few trips to the potty nothing even comes out but he insists that he has to go i'm happy that he tells us he has to go instead of having accidents but it's getting kind of difficult to have to take him over and over when he doesn't have to go is this just a normal phase for kids his age thanks for the advice mari it's normal but i'd suggest bringing cars and small toys he can use at the table explain that he can go potty before the food comes and again when you're ready to leave the restaurant but that he will need to hold it if he has to go in between if your son actually needs to go to the bathroom twice in that half an hour timespan then i'd take him to the doctor once he realizes that you won't take him he'll get the hint and stop asking or he won't be able to go out to eat anymore if he insists on getting up and he has a false alarm then his treat of going out to dinner is over and you need to take him home he'll get the idea very quickly Kitchen Colony in Space Episodes of Lost (Season 2) SpongeBob SquarePants Knots Landing Urinary incontinence The Fairly OddParents The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Little Britain 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Restaurant Toilet training The Apprentice 2 History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Stomach cancer Haven (TNG episode) Pok__mon Live!
