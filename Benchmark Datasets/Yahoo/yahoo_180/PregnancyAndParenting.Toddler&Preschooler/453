how do you cure a five year old girl of snippiness can someone give me any solutions for a little girl who likes to sass back roll her eyes at me and bob her head up and down mouth words you know the blah blah blah she just came to live with me from nana's house and has been terribly indulged time outs have proved fruitless i need a powerful solution that sends an immediate message also if i put her in a corner she shrieks at the top of her lungs help here please it is really easy to resort to violence isn't it i was thinking along the lines that the women have handed me thus far lol yes earplugs but what about the neighbours i may look at the book as well but believe me it is very tempting to resort to the spanking and 'popping' on the mouth i had even considered using a spray bottle but apparently that is considered abuse i agree with nick with katknit and maber but definately feel sorry for dani with much support and utmost respect i wish to speak out on this subject without meaning any insult or harm to all of us parents trying so very hard to raise our children or those of others dani with five children it isn't the amount of children you have sweetie you are always the boss and capable of controlling all of what your kiddo's do or don't do if you can't and continue to believe this theory each year that passes you will certainly loose more ground your children into their teens will continue to challenge you you will find you can't control them because you wasted valued time showing them in earlier years who was boss and when they are bigger they hit back and of course we have all heard of those who have turned totally against the parents to cause harm maber i think is the one who said that this is perhaps a larger problem and one that isn't being seen for what it really is with my experience over the years this is correct however the lady asking the question isn't the natural parent from what i understood and the problem is already there and seems to be a carry over from another household the book recommended to read is a good one but she might not have the correct time to read it along with other books i also don't know the family dynamics or the reason the child is now there or how long she is willing to try to care for the child the childs life constantly changing as to where she lives or who is caring for her is also a huge part of the past problem i'm sure my recommendation is the same as most of the ones who said she doesn't like the corner so it is correct information to continue to place her there however do not allow her to shriek at all when children need time out the best form is not into there room or another place as long as they remain quiet this is not a good rule to follow because the truth is they won and you lost no matter how you try to believe otherwise this is why you have a repeat problem if the parents choose the childs room now what about teen years do any of these parents realize the number of year olds and up that committ sucide when sent to their rooms and on another note never let the child close their bedroom door for privacy this is one wrong way parents are allowing children to think they are on the same level as the parents with the same rights and need for privacy an adult feels peace and privacy behind a closed door children tend to feel closed off and this is the first sign of pulling away from the family structure and the reason a child does it or wants to a corner of the room you are currently in is the best solution with the following points to ponder to correct children with problems calmly tell the child while making eye contact your behavior is unacceptable and this will not continue use an even voice tone and do not raise it you must show a flat even tone because this shows the child you are in control if the child refuses to hold eye contact make them by saying your time in the corner won't start until you show respect by holding eye contact i refuse to be rude to you by not having eye contact if they scream yell or other say the samething but change words to suit screaming if they insist on screaming raise the bar by showing control you can do this with severe screamers by telling them they will start standing in the corner till they stop screaming but the clock for the punishment doesn't start till after that time served it will just take you longer so you might want to reduce your time in the corner i do know of one who was such a screamer they told the child that for that part they would serve time in the corner with a book held out in each hand as it was much harder to scream and be rude while holding the books at arms length but i never had to do this myself and still undecided myself but it did work and in theory stiffer crimes stiffer punishment after screaming punishment is served if it was needed then tell them you are in the corner until such time you can tell me what you did wrong why it was wrong and what you can do the next time as a better choice i swear this works in this way you are not excusing the behavior allowing them off with time served allowing them the opportunity to think about it themselves and to be accountable for their actions if you see them playing with the wall or singing gently say don't forget you can't get out and us move on to happier fun times until you have given thought to what you did and we discuss it if they aren't standing tell them to stnad or the clock will get turned back or time added if it is dragging on for too long to mins make a phone call and discuss with the air how you are going to call a sitter because jane is having a problem and you might need one if you and hubby are still going out to dinner when they come to discuss this issue let them talk and answer each point mentioned above if their answer was appropiate then state that fact that they must have really given this correct thought tell them that we all make mistakes but if they repeat the very same one the time in the corner next time will increase if the answers were correct tell them good job but you need to return to keep up the good thoughts your almost done younger children you can ask questions from if they didn't cover all the answers correctly by suggesting correct ones and watch their attitude when you excuse them to walk away it is a good practice to say we all make mistakes but learn from them over and done when we can be consistent with our words it is these very same words later that control our children in the public eye without others hearing the screaming and show that follows the simple words and eye contact showing your displeasure of their actions does work saying your behavior is unacceptable is enough to control a child later on if not remove them into the lady's room and tell them they will be removed if necessary and return home to be delt with don't use the word punishment if possible this tells their small mind that they will punish you back good luck isn't needed you just simply take over calmly and get the job done but you can do it parents must be stronger then their childs will their will as they get older only increases Scientology
