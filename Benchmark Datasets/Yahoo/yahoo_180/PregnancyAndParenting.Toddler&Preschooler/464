my two year old son doesn't answer me when i ask him a question what is another approach i can take rather than simply asking the question again get down on his level tell him to look you in the eye if he looks away stop and tell him to look you in the eye make sure he is looking you in the eye while you ask don't let him walk away or not answer he must then answer and will stand there till he does another thing to add to this is if the question is asking him to do something he is not allowed to go do it till he responds with a yes mom while looking you in the eye or something to that equivilant that is right for his age eye contact is a huge thing cause then he can't say even later in life i didn't hear you cause he was looking you right in the eye he might not talk lots yet but he understands so much more start the good habits while he is still young this takes some consistency but when he figures out what is expected it works wonders Social rule Milton H.
