is it okay to let a years old boy to try to masturbate a years old boy is trying to masturbate while watching a cartoon for example and he can do this when he is with others i would like to know if it is the age or what ever reason there can be to let him behave this way you should not reprimand him at all it is perfectly normal just tell him that it is something done in private to him it is not sexual this answer was posted on the parenting magazine website about a young girl age i think who was mastubating the doctor gave this answer your daughter has discovered what is pleasurable and makes her feel good just as she's exploring the feelings and workings of other parts of her body she's also appreciating the feelings that touching her genitals give her this is a normal stage of body discovery and does not mean that your child has an underlying psychological problem like all pleasurable activity however genital play can become emotionally and physically harmful from a physical standpoint excessive rubbing can result in urinary tract infections especially in girls due to the shortness of the urethra the urinary opening between the bladder and the vagina if the genital play becomes so frequent and intense that the child withdraws from other normal childhood activities and interactions as your child seems to be doing it's wise to intervene try these techniques distract and substitute get her attention and substitute a more attractive activity such as an outing to the park a movie or some playtime together continue to keep her occupied with social activities by inviting friends over and arranging for her to go to their homes too be sure the children are supervised when they play together in her room keep an open door policy so that you can intervene when she begins genital massage while her friends are visiting give alternative tension releasers you may be right that she's using genital massage as a tension reliever when she begins touching herself take it as clue that she needs soothing offer to give her a back rub while you play a calming song whatever techniques you employ be sure to encourage your child to appreciate how marvelously designed her body is you don't her to grow up believing certain body parts are bad or that it's wrong to touch them as she matures her preoccupation with her private parts will subside within a couple years she'll be too aware of appropriate behavior to keep fondling her genitals in public Urinary incontinence Masturbation Infantilism Human sexual behavior Prostate cancer Penis Female genital cutting Intersex surgery Strap-on dildo Massage Child sexual abuse Childlove movement Domestic violence Narcissism Autism Circumcision Drug addiction Milton H.
