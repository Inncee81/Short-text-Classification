my year old daughter is scared of the dark and wont sleep alone i have a year old healthy daughter who's turning soon she won't sleep alone in the dark in her room unless me or her father is beside her untill she falls asleep she says shes scared if someone comes into the house to hurt her she had a scary dream around a week ago and it made it worse is this normal how can i help i'm almost and i don't enjoy sleeping in complete darkness myself either i mean the kind of darkness where you can't even see your hand in front of your face it's claustrophobic to me i enjoy having the soft light from a streetlight outside my window or at least the glow of the clock our bedside clock has a particularly bright display so it's helpful so it could be something as simple as that or as others said it may be that the fear is stemming from something else something frightening may have happened to her it seems that to be scared of someone coming inside to hurt her might indicate that this has happened to her or almost happened to her does she date did some guy try to do something with her that she didn't want to do did she have a frightening episode at work is there a coworker that freaks her out is there someone at school who is bullying her bullying doesn't just happen in middle school it can take on lots of forms it could be tons of things the best thing you can do is talk to her and try to figure out together what is really scaring her if you can't get anywhere with her and this continues then there is nothing wrong with getting some counseling it is in my opinion abnormal for a yr old to be that scared of sleeping alone something had to have caused the fear i feel awful for her because fear is such a paralyzing thing best of luck and i hope it gets better soon god bless Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Out-of-body experience EastEnders The Subtle Knife The Death Gate Cycle Pitaten The Amber Spyglass One Tree Hill (TV series) W.I.T.C.H.
