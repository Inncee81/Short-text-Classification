what do you do with a month old and a four year old i babysit a month old and a four year old and i am just wanting some ideas on what they could do together or what kinds of activities i could do with them just something to do indoors or outdoors thanks you could play little games with them such as roll the ball back and forth to each of them or have them roll it to eachother or take them outside for a walk if you can handle that cause i know kids and one adult on a walk kid running right the other running left and the adult pulling her hair out or if its hot enough out let them play in a sprinkler or a pool or find something that pleases the month old and let the yr old do it with the younger subling so they are both occupied or just turn up the radio and dance with both of em my kids love that i found that bouncy balls are very effective my oldest daughter loved playing ball with her younger cousins good luck Tag Billiards Baseball Water polo Squash (sport) Rod Stewart Football (soccer) Indoor soccer Softball American football Volleyball Swingout Pinball Sheryl Crow Janet Jackson Lucille Ball Field hockey Aerial (dance move) Four square Kender Hot Dance Music/Club Play Rugby union Dancing at Lughnasa 1957 World Series Van Halen Lacrosse We Belong Together Football Adult contemporary music The Supremes Cleveland Browns 2005 World Series Table tennis Snooker National Football League Lore EastEnders Domestic rabbit Textile manufacturing Swimming pool Canadian football Lady Bouvier's Lover Rugby union positions Irrigation Jerry Coleman Koopa Kid Red Hot Chili Peppers Our Gang Professional wrestling aerial techniques The Adventures of Pete & Pete Fast bowling Hall & Oates Hey Jude Piccolo Junior Saga Super Bowl XXV Indoor football Lorraine Baines McFly The Fairly OddParents Bouncy techno Pedro Mart__nez Marching band Rugby football Silent Night, Deadly Night Humphrey Bogart The Shining (film) Circle (dance move) Ultimate (sport) Major Indoor Soccer League Super Bowl XXXVIII Pitaten Cricket Ben Johnson (athlete) Laws of cricket Cliff Richard Vegeta Eight ball Glossary of American football Archery Golf Billboard magazine Dodgeball About a Boy Bob and George Shaggy dog story The Isley Brothers Brian Close Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Beavis and Butt-head 2004 World Series Luke and Laura Spencer The Karate Kid Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Anne Murray 1986 World Series Madonna (entertainer) Eric Cartman Day care House music Valleyfair!
