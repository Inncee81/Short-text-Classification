birthday party ideas for year old party in october last year we did a family only party due to money time and the fact that he has no idea it is his birthday and what it means anyway because we didn't do anything last year our church threw him a last minute party after i told them i wasn't doing a big party for him it was rather embarrassing and i want to avoid that again this year i need ideas on what to do he is the youngest besides his mo old brother and the other kids will range in age up to i have decided it will be at my house to save on money and i'll make pizza and nachos but i don't know what to do with kids that are that varied in age i need ideas for inside and outside due to not knowing what the weather will be like in mid october also my house isn't very large and there will be kids plus all their parents so i need activities that will not involve being extremely active while inside there is just no way to play a lot of games inside oh i don't want any specific theme please kids that age are very easily entertained i woudn't worry my sons year party was at our house in feb and there were kids up to years old there also we bought pizzas put on the toddler tunes and let them dance made cupcakes and let them put their own sprinkles on them and got a pull string pinata great idea for kids that age even the year olds loved it don't make the mistake of overinviting and then worrying there will be too many people in your house that's my only advice i got so worried about it that i ended up breaking it up and having a family party on saturday and friends daycare friends party on sunday bad idea and very stressful Shaggy dog story EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Poker jargon The Adventures of Pete & Pete The Fairly OddParents The Ashlee Simpson Show The Family from One End Street Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Garfield Pitaten Craps Our Gang Piccolo Junior Saga Little Britain Hey Arnold!
