year old throwing tantrums in store everytime i go into the store with my year old if something catches his eye he begins screaming for it at the top of his lungs and i mean loud and dramatically i have a new baby also so this is making things very hectic for me during shopping usually dad goes with us to help out but dad is deploying so i need to learn to cope with both of them together while shopping back to my two year old i have tried just about everything from ignoring him to spanking rewarding it has continued even worse now i had one friend suggest dropping everything i am doing to walk out to the car with him but that seems unrealistic due to having a newborn and not near enough time in the store in the first place i am in need of some advice on what i should do to get these tantrums to stop he acts fine at home and the tantrums are very mild as opposed to the ones in public the tantrums are worse in public because he is aware you wont punish him as much there i suggest getting a babysitter for shopping you should take some time off while your husband is deployed anyway hire a young girl to puch the children in a cart or to take them for a walk while you shop arrange for someone else to go with you a few times dad will do and at the first sign of tantrum have dad take him to the car for a few minutes until he calms down worse comes to worse buy the child a treat to munch on while you shop hes less likely to melt down over something else when he has something already patience soon he will start to be able to behave better in the store depends a lot on verbal abilities he will understand a lot better when you say if he is good he can get something if you have no money tell the children this is a free day they can be good for mom and she will give them a treat when you get home and he will understand it better an hour seems like an eternity to a and year old so an hour in the store must seem like a long time Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct The Adventures of Pete & Pete Autism Infantilism Treehouse of Horror V Asperger syndrome Hearing impairment Dog training The Inside Microeconomics The Family from One End Street Social rule Mr. and Mrs. Turner Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Babe Ruth Breastfeeding Jam (TV series) Motion picture rating system The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Teen Girl Squad Garfield Static Shock Public transport God Emperor of Dune Calvin and Hobbes Unreal Married... with Children Shopping cart RuneScape quests Doug Child abuse Baseball Spanking Child time-out Tag London Congestion Charge MapleStory Charmed Avenue Q Friends Father's Day (Doctor Who) Fred Phelps Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Earth Girl Arjuna Free will Contract 2000 Australian Grand Prix For Better or For Worse The Apprentice 2 Scenes from a Memory Grandview, U.S.A.
