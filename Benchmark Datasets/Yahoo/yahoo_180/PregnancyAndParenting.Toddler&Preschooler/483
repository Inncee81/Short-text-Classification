can i start potty training before my son can talk my son is years old i assume he is like every other normal child he can say a few words here and there can't put any words together yet though or if he can he just hasn't done it he knows what his mother and i are saying to him when we ask him questions and give him commands he answers our questions and obeys our commands for the most part and he knows when he has done something wrong does anyone have any good suggestions about how you can potty train a child that can't talk or should we wait until he can put words together so far our efforts of showing him the potty and getting him to sit on it alongside mommy and daddy and trying to anticipate his potty times aren't working we can sit him on the chair and he won't do anything but right after we get him off like minutes not always that soon later he will go in his diaper please help out of ideas father just continue what you are doing when you go to the bathroom just sit him on his little potty while you go have mom do it as well he may take a while but do not make a big deal when he wets his diaper or anything i started doing this with maya well before she could talk we started when she began walking and it took about months for her to become completely potty trained granted we started a lot earlier but i think that this no pressure way is much better for the child then just one day telling them oh you have to use the potty now no matter what age you start it needs to be a process maya started at about nine months we did it not for potty training at first i just did it because she would freak if i tried to leave her when i went to the bathroom just be patient wait until he accidentally uses the potty then do the praise thing don't go overboard just say wow look you peed in the potty like daddy good job he probably won't even know how he did it at first but he will try to do it again once you are sure that he has control over those muscles then start trying to put him on after meals and drinks etc also the best time to start getting the first accidental pee or poop is in the morning when he wakes up or after a nap it is almost an automatic reflex so watch for him to start stirring and get him on the potty as he is waking up Shaggy dog story Toilet humour Urinary incontinence Milton H.
