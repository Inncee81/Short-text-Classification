my son had his month check up today and he lost weight the doctor said she wasn't too worried but scheduled him for another weigh in in two weeks she gave me a list of higher calorie foods and i'm kind of worried about him should i be worried he only lost ounces in the last three months but the nurse said we'll try to figure out what's going on he is a pretty good eater most of the time and likes to snack durring the day he also still has a bubba at night and durring nap time does anyone have any suggestions for me i could really use some feedback on this if he's getting really active now like running around a lot and just moving and playing with his toys then don't worry about it my son was the same way he would gain a few ounces or maybe a pound or but would easily lose the weight because he is so active and he's getting taller and not wider Breastfeeding Pound Super Size Me Dieting Obesity Extreme Programming Ton Marilyn Monroe Bodybuilding Alcoholic beverage The Contender (television series) Little Britain U.S. customary units Atkins Nutritional Approach Humphrey Bogart British coinage Hamburger EastEnders Urinary incontinence FoxTrot United States Postal Service Binge eating disorder Prostate cancer Cooking weights and measures Gold standard Doraemon McDonald's Medical prescription Fasting Tocopherol Pig (zodiac) Anorexia nervosa English unit Weighing scale Adjustable gastric band Imperial unit Money in Harry Potter Kodocha Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Dialysis Metrified English unit Kurt Cobain Hamster Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Cheese Sport utility vehicle Mass AFI 100 Years series Ty Cobb Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bicycle lighting Computer numbering formats Ben Johnson (athlete) Baroque chess Chlorpromazine Passenger car New Morning Coffee Piccolo Junior Saga Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Sleep Stomach cancer Calorie Gene Tierney MyPyramid Reiki The Ashlee Simpson Show Unemployment Microeconomics Weight British Rail Class 42 Weight loss Anchor Duodecimal Big Brother UK series 6 Childbirth Sperm Whale Slot machine Major League Baseball television contracts Milton H.
