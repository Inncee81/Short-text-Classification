yr old still has low fever while on amoxicillan for days we went to her pediatrician on friday found out she has a throat infection she had a mild cold a week prior and was pretty warm but i thought it was because of the degree weather we were having daily then one day she felt very warm and her temp was that's when i took her to the dr so she's been running a temp for at least days but has been on the antibiotic since friday i plan on calling her dr first thing in the morning but wanted to know if other moms experienced this is it normal to have a fever for so long btw she is acting normal still eats plays and is her typical sassy self maybe a little bit more irritable and goes to bed easier i'm trying not to worry because she's acting so normal but can't wait until tomorrow morning to talk to the doc thankyou for all your kind and friendly answers yes i have been giving her tylenol every hours as needed per drs instructions and the fever doesn't really go down that much which i think is strange i am not totally freaking out because as i mentioned she is still active and laughing etc update we went to the e r this morning mon because she was up all night with a fever of and screaming that her head was in pain i she was feeling bad despite my regular doses of fever pain reducer just my luck we get to the e r and her fever has gone down to and she is talking and laughing non stop the e r people thought i was the sick one at first because i looked horrible meanwhile after a hour wait with only one other patient in the whole dept we finally saw a doc he didn't even examine her he just said it's normal to have a long fever with infections even for another week and sent us home i was so tired i realized once we were home he didn't even check her ears throat nothing i think that's the least he could've done anyways i'm so tired right now hopefully my daughter will go to sleep with me right now thank god i am not working today i don't know how i would've done it i'm a single mom ok thanks for listening occasionally antibiotics can induce fever your daughter might be acting normal because of the motrin if you are not already doing so i advise taking either rectal or oral temperatures if she is mature enough to hold the thermometer in her mouth axillary underarm temps can be quite innaccurate keep a record of her temps highest lowest and times etc to report to the nurse when you go in in the morning compresses of tepid water on the forehead neck in the armpits groin and behind the knees or just a bath is another alternative if her temp spikes and is not due for more motrin Thermoregulation Breastfeeding Common cold Prostate cancer First aid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Psoriasis Chlorpromazine Group A streptococcal infection Radiation therapy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pneumonia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Fever Pharyngitis Social rule Paracetamol Dialysis Hyperthermia Malaria Childbirth The Adventures of Pete & Pete Diving The Amber Spyglass Diarrhea Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Inside Ron and Fez Traumatic brain injury Milton H.
