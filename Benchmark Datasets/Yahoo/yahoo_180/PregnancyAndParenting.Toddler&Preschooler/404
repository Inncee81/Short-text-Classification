please any parents out there help me im taking care of a child for a week ive never had any children before he's months old and yesterday the babysitter was horrid she put the child to bed at pm in clothes that were soaking wet with mashed up food and juice now his bedtime is pm so he ended up being awake at pm so i of course changed his diaper and clothes feed him and then spent two hours playing with him to tire him out he ended up being tired and cranky but didnt want to go to bed so i spent minutes simply saying its bedtime sweety and placing him in bed and then he'd cry and get up and come out then id do the same thing sorry sweety its bedtime and place him in bed this went on for minutes i was shocked i didnt think they had that long of an attention span my friend not the parent told me that was compleately out of line i shoulda let the kid stay up i was trying to get back to the schedual was i wrong right what could i have done better that getting out of bed thing you're surprised that it went on for thirty minutes when i was teaching my son to sleep in his own bed alone at about that age he would keep getting out of bed for up to four hours several times a night is he already used to going to bed properly or is he accustomed to sleeping with someone else a parent or sibling a thing to remember is that playing with young kids to tire them out can actually just make them too tired and wound up to go to sleep before bedtime slow down with the playing do boring soft gentle things keep the tv off slow things right down try to stick to the schedule if this child is already used to a schedule on the other hand remember that being with someone else perhaps for the first time overnight is going to be a real surprise for a young child and they may not respond to their schedule as well as they did before it sounds to me like you were really patient and good about it so long as you always respond to problems patiently and kindly as well as firmly there can't be any problems too big to work through young kids are very flexible and the only really important thing is that you are patient and loving good luck Care Bears Urinary incontinence Sleep Social rule EastEnders About a Boy Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mattress Humphrey Bogart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Milton H.
