roseola ok here is whats going on my daughter has been sick since the rd high fever at and she says her throat hurts she was in the same waiting room as a baby with roseola on the st her fever spiked on the third but so far no rash the docs don't seem to think it's anything else she's been twice i haven't gotten her to eat since sunday evening i'm worried that the docs aren't looking into it enough she was tested for strep but thats all i hate to see her like this as she is crying with pain and they said not even any numbing lozenges any advice is welcomed she is rarely sick so i'm not used to it she is drinking well though thanks when sick the main thing to worry about is keeping fluids up if she is drinking well then that is good if she got dehydrated that is when things can get worse i would take her to another doctor or emergency room at a hospital and demand something be done if you are worried and get a proper diagnosis only a doctor can tell you what to do better to be safe then sorry as if a fever becomes to high seizures can occur a luke warm bath will help with fevers as water draws heat away from the body just keep the fluids up it will also help with fevers Group A streptococcal infection Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Roseola Breastfeeding Decompression sickness Rheumatic fever Pneumonia Infectious mononucleosis Diarrhea Common cold First aid Lyme disease Lupus erythematosus Traumatic brain injury Malaria Seizure Fecal incontinence Childbirth Marburg virus Stroke AFI 100 Years series Dehydration One Piece minor characters Gout Terri Schiavo Chronic fatigue syndrome Escherichia coli O157:H7 Medicine Dengue fever Teen Girl Squad Pharyngitis Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Intravenous therapy Insomnia Rocky Mountain spotted fever Diabetes insipidus Diabetes mellitus Sin City The Shining (film) Multiple sclerosis Sento Smallpox Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Epilepsy Rash Sauna Jam (TV series) Hiking Social rule Lassa fever Breathing gas Shaggy dog story Rubella Humphrey Bogart Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Darth Vader Mesothelioma Eucharist Allergy Foodborne illness Hay fever Kodocha Food allergy Comanche Cytomegalovirus Sleeping sickness Emergency Medical Services Fasting Gonorrhoea Syringomyelia Typhoid fever Diabetic coma Coeliac disease Dysentery Oral sex Sulfasalazine Jackass: The Movie Urinary incontinence Muslim ibn Aqeel Beavis and Butt-head Hypoglycemia Anxiety Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breech birth Carburetor Acetazolamide The Doctor Dances Hydrotherapy Cat Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Streptococcus The Inside Babe Ruth Aortic dissection
