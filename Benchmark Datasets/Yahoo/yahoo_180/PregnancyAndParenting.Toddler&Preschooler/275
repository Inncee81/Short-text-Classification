year old comes into parents bed every night my and a half year old has been sleeping in his own bed for almost a year he has always woken up at least once during the night but up until recently i could put him back and he would go back to sleep within a few minutes however four months ago we moved house and since then he wants to sleep in our bed he will however go to sleep in his own bed at bedtime but comes into our bed during the early hours if i try to put him back in his bed we end up having a tug of war with him screaming and trying to climb out of the bed and he gets very upset about it if i do manage to get him back to sleep in his bed he will often wake up again an hour or so later and i have the same problem again and again sometimes he wakes up or times a night i used to lay down with him at bedtime and thought that maybe this was the problem so stopped doing this weeks ago but it hasn't helped at bedtime i now sit at the foot of his bed until he falls asleep and he is ok with this thanks sharon when this first started happening i was happy for him to snuggle up with us in our bed but he wriggles so much i dont get much sleep and after months i am exhausted my hubby usually ends up sleeping in my son's bed and my son ends up sleeping with me he wont sleep with daddy so maybe it is a bit of separation anxiety i know that this is wrong but at am i am too tired to keep taking him back over and over again he does sleep really well if it is just the two of us in our bed so i am thinking that like you it is better not to pick sleep battles at this time hubby however is not too happy to be sleeping in a single bed every night i could have written a portion of your question myself our year old has always had problems sleeping since the day we brought him home we no longer pick sleep battles since we all need sleep and have to get up early everynight he wanders into our bed and snuggles up against one of us then my husband would carry him back to his bed and lay down with him sometimes he fell asleep and stayed there overnight it's a queen sized bed so there is room for now it works for us because we all get sleep we have tried various methods of laying down slipping out of the room putting him back into his own bed times a night it's a hassle but the reality is that for now my son sleeps through the night when he shares a bed with either me or hubby it works for our family so that is all that matters so all i can offer to you is perhaps allow your son to get some comfort in your room that doesn't have to be in your bed though maybe an air mattress or foam pad at the foot of your bed or even a comforter on the floor for his special place is comfort enough it sounds like the recent move might have been scary and this is his only way to cope with change good luck to you Sleep Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Daylight saving time Social rule The Amber Spyglass The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe The Shining (film) Insomnia Out-of-body experience EastEnders Sleeping Murder 2000 Australian Grand Prix Milton H.
