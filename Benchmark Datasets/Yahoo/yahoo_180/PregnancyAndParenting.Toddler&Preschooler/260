my son wont talk my month old has issues with speaking and i am need advice he is months old and rarely says anything he only says word at a time like mama dada ball he wont put words together and i think its time he needs to form senteneces i have sessions with him everyday for hours i make him sit and i make him repeat words that i sa and if he dont we sit til he does after the sessions he just runs around and plays and dont even pa attention to what i said he acts like he didnt even learn anyhting im woundering if he is going to have learning issues in school like maybe be in the slow learning class i dont want that my gosh how can i helkp him more whoa jessica take it easy here i am a teacher and in studying to be a teacher i had to learn a lot about child development every child is different plus you have a boy most of the time they are slower than girls in this area making a child that is this young sit for three hours while you are forcing words down his throat is completely useless and abusive of course he just runs around and plays afterwards he's too little to comprehend what you are even doing to him any child would need to run around and play after being forced to sit for that long at that age give him time many times children don't really start to talk until after years old there is not certain age that a child must talk by an example my aunt didn't speak until she was almost seven years old now she is highly successful and the top human resources manager for a huge insurance company even einstein didn't talk until he was and look how he turned out someone above mentioned autism and they are right about that i wouldn't worry too much but if it is autism what you are doing will never work with an autistic child if you are really concerned and he is still not talking more by the time he turns in months then talk to his pediatrician he or she may do some testing or recommend you to a specialist if they are concerned of course it is okay to teach him words here and there show him things and repeat what they are called but not for hour stretches i teach th grade and we don't even let students sit for that long because even at and years old they are not capable of concentrating for that long give your child and yourself a break let him be a toddler forcing him to do otherwise could really do damage and actually cause a problem when there was never one to begin with p s the best thing you can do for your son is you want to help him is to read to him every single day for to minutes this will help with everything his reading abilities his communication skills etc trust me on this as a teacher read read read Autism Autism rights movement Asperger syndrome Education Ethical challenges to autism treatment Education in the United States Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Gifted Controversies in autism Education in Romania Autism epidemic Graduate school Propaedeutic value of Esperanto IBM PC compatible Education in the People's Republic of China Milton H.
