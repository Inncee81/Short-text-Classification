how do you get a yr old to go to bed at night i guess it's our fault for never starting him out with a bedtime but he was little and we didn't really think about it now he's and if he doesn't take a nap he'll go to bed at or but even if he takes an hour hour and a half nap which is required he lay down at least that long at daycare he is raring to go til at night he is always awake by no later than it's getting tough because my husband and i never get any alone time by the time our son goes to bed we're ready for bed too any helpful suggestions and no he doesn't eat candy all day or drink sugary drinks or any kind of pop with caffeine in it if any at all it's just a habit he has we had the same problem here is what you do you set a bed time and minutes before that time you start to settle him down don't let him play up until bed time with us a bath worked good right before then say goodnight place him in his crib and close the door with a monitor he will cry for about an hour maybe more but eventually he will go to sleep make this your nightly routine and by the end of the week he will not make a sound and just go to bed the first night is going to be very hard because he will cry but you have to let him cry himself to bed each night after that the crying gets less and less until one night you will both realize he is asleep one warning if you go in at any time during the night and he sees you it will restart the clock and you will start over with the hours worth of crying but once they realize you will not come into save them they will roll over and go to sleep we also left a stuffed animal to cuddle with so they had something to comfort themselves with good luck Insomnia Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Siesta Grandview, U.S.A.
