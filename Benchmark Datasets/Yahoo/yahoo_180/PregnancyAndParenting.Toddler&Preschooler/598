how much should i charge an hour for babysitting i am i work full time go to school i have done it in the past when i was about i worked at a pre school for years have credits in child development i have gotten fingerpritned and background checked and i know cpr and first aid i know it would depend on age number of children etc but what is a fair for both parties starting point if parents are looking for a cheap sitter they can get a high schooler but since you are and experienced i would charge at least dollars an hour i get paid an hour to watch a baby and thats hardly any work i think when you have skills and are particularly trustworthy it is worth it for parents to pay more you can always negotiate if someone feels it is too much also if you provide your own transportation that is reason to charge more gas is expensive Day care Student loan Education in the United States High school Credit card Education in the People's Republic of China Education in England Graduate school Adoption The Amazing Race Social Security (United States) Public transport Economic inequality Canadian Pacific Railway Predatory lending United Kingdom corporation tax Insurance Economy of Pakistan Homeschooling Education in Germany Education in Australia Freeters Explosive material Childbirth Mutual fund Poker jargon Flat tax Infantilism Montessori method Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead Thermal power station Inflation Hyperinflation Drowning London Congestion Charge PE ratio Unemployment Octopus card Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 TransUnion Publicly funded medicine ELO rating system Lincoln-Douglas Debate Filling station Triage Copyleft Background check Road pricing Internet fraud Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hearing impairment Cheque First aid Scholarship Marshall Plan Democratic Party (United States) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Conscription Credit score Efficiency wages Education in Scotland Parenting Hydrogen economy Danish Folkeskole Education Diving cylinder Middle school Oyster card Homemaker Enron Corporation RuneScape Tax Dog agility Economy of the United States Tuition Broadband Internet access Automatic number plate recognition Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Driver's license Sento Supply and demand Blackjack 1973 oil crisis Pregnancy Caltrain Abortion in the United States Open access Video game developer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Welding Electricity meter Gas metal arc welding FairTax Air ambulance MMORPG National Insurance Non-governmental organization Emergency medical technician Centrelink A.
