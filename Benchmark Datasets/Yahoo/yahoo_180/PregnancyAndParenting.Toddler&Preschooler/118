am i losing my mind my daughter crys non stop i have to stroll her though the house all day some times i just want to let her cry am i losing my mind any suggestions thanks my daughter crys she is months old i have to stroll her threw the house all day some times i want to let her cry i feel so bad for it sometimes she never stops crying is it wrong that i just want to let her cry so i can thanks this depends on the age of your lil gurl if she's within a few months old it could be colic they have lil pills in the baby meds at your local supermarket these are great for colicy babies if it is this talk to your babies dr and see what type of formula is best for her if your wife is nursing she may have to change her eating habbits to prevent colic when my first born son had colic i too had to walk around at night with him to calm him fresh air seemed to work best also tightly bundling them i used to put him in a front pack and just do early morning walks if she's at least months she may be teething cold soothys cold wet rags and maybe a small dosage of meds that the dr recomands for her age and weight and it may also just come down to her sleeping habbits if the two things above are not the reasons you are goin to have to set a new schedule for her watch her for a week write down her nap times and how long they last even factor in her food bottle intake find soothing music for her to listen to at night fisher price makes this lil light up fish tank thingy that hangs up on the side of the crib that has soothing lights music and some models have a vibration attachment others have a remote control that you can use in your room to turn on without having to go into your child's room but since you said it lasts all day there could be something wrong i strongly suggest you take her in even if its something simple it'll give you a piece of mind and maybe some much deserved rest be strong after being a mother of and with a new one on the way i found that yes i too thought i was loosing my mind and truthfully dont think i ever got it back maybe after all is said and done and nothing else works dr spock if you have followed up on him does suggest on just letting them cry this is called the tough love method please read up on it first before trying it i found it too hard on me and my children to try it i liked using tons of love rather than tough love with my evil runts and amazingly we have all survived each lil fit each teething each potty training each moment of new found indapendance i wish you all the luck in the world and hope her crying stops with simple methods good luck and god bless Breastfeeding Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Urinary incontinence Jam (TV series) EastEnders The Amber Spyglass The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Time Out of Mind Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story The Contender (television series) Poker jargon Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Jon Secada John the Baptist Social rule Mattress Atomic Kitten Night (book) Theory of conduct About a Boy Knots Landing Kodocha The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie 2000 Australian Grand Prix Miss Saigon Friends The Curse of Fenric Sant Thakar Singh Ranma __ characters Hip hop collaborations Characters in the Smurfs The Inside Clinical depression Sudden infant death syndrome Sharon Tate Animal Crossing Simone Weil Abortion debate Paradox Toilet humour Kimi Finster Japanese toilet Anchor Pitaten Scott Storch Prayer Common cold The Shining (film) Fancy rat Big Brother UK series 6 G-Man (Half-Life) Milton H.
