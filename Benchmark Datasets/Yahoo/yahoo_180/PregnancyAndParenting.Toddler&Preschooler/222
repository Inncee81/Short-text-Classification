my daughter has a phobia of spiders need help my year old within in the last mos has become extemely phobic or spiders she hyperventilates screams cries shakes at the site of a spider there was no incidence that has caused this and no one that i know is scared of spiders i'm not sure why this is happening but could use some advice from anyone who wants to help thanks when i was young i was afraid of spiders i think that was largely because of my mother's fears i had a bigger problem with daddy long legs harvestmen which are not true spiders when i lived in georgia for two years nevertheless i overcame my fear of spiders and harvestmen by learning more about them how beneficial they are etc indeed i began to develop a fascination for them i caught a wolf spider as a teen one summer and kept it for awhile when i entered college i bought my first tarantula it was a beautiful pink toe sadly it died so i bought different one a zebra leg it died too i now own a beautiful rose hair and i've had it since i bet you didn't know that tarantulas can live that long anyway i understand your daughter's reaction toward spiders but i advise you strongly not to reinforce her emotion by injecting your own fears and dislikes you'll only make the situation worse don't kill spiders either use every occasion when you encounter a spider as a teaching experience educate her about the many different species of spiders go to the library and check out some books about spiders visit the pet store and look at the tarantulas when you find a spider in your home capture it and release it outside some event precipitated your daughter's attitude toward spiders it might have been a family member or another relative or friend who reacted negatively she may have encountered one in an unguarded moment and it frightened her so severely that she now reacts the way she does nevertheless i think it's important that you uncover the root cause of her fear and educate her so that she overcomes it there are only two species of spiders in the united states that you should really worry about one is the black widow but if you keep a clean house you shouldn't have to trouble about it all because it's a cobweb weaver and it prefers undisturbed locations most often outside the other is the brown recluse and it's largely found in the southern midwest and southeastern united states if you don't live in these areas then there is little to fear from recluses you may want to consider buying a tarantula i know that seems counterintuitive given your daughter's present feeling towards spiders but it may in fact help her overcome her fear of them i've let spiders crawl on me without reservation including my tarantulas it tickles tarantulas have tiny little claws in their feet that they use to grip onto surfaces as they climb them she could watch you feed the tarantula too i especially loved watching my pink toe eat i'd add some crickets to her glass aquarium then she'd climb down from her perch pink toes are arboreal and hang within an inch or two of the ground cover and snatch the crickets as they hopped around the perimeter of the tank it was amazing to see her feed because she was lightning fast and she converted a mass of crickets to a bolus in short order if you're lucky and you take good care of your tarantula you might even see it molt while i've not actually watched my spider molt i've found her shedding later it was so cool to examine the fangs in particular closely i overcame my fear of spiders through immersion that is i learned a lot about the various species and i developed an understanding of how they benefit humankind i suspect that if you truly educate your daughter about spiders she can do the same here's a link you might find useful for your own edification http science howstuffworks com spider htm The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Shaggy dog story Minor Harry Potter Beasts Anxiety Fast bowling Ranma __ characters Dragon Booster Darth Vader RuneScape quests Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Moult Blood (computer game) Garfield Dog Diving Brown recluse spider Spider-Man Doom enemies Milton H.
