spoiling your child do you think spoiling your child is a bad thing i have a year old son and most of the time i buy him what he ask for but i always make sure he has what he needs first he is the only child so i can't help but to spoil him but are there any parents out there that spoiled their child and now regret it well i grew up without alot have you heard the saying dirt poor and worked hard to get college scholarships and worked and paid my living expenses through college while taking out loans for what i couldn't afford so initially i thought i don't want my kids to go through that i don't want them to ever have to worry about money and i just want them to have the things they want and enjoy their childhood so i bought them whatever they wanted had elaborate birthday parties and christmases by the time my son was five and daughter was they had everything they could possibly want and were getting bored now what they weren't ready for a jet ski or car yet i also see how things have no meaning after a while and the expectation of just getting things without working for them makes them feel entitled do we really want to raise kids who feel entitled without having to work what happens when they reach adulthood think about the masses of adults who are raised with that self centered mentality what is our society going to be like so i started making my kids do chores clean up around the house and help me out it was hard at first but it got easier when they reaped rewards i still give them a dollar a week for their ages ex year old would get dollars a week i think this has helped teach them that you have to work hard for your money nothing is given to you and they get really excited about that toy when they have worked hard and saved up their money thought about it and wanted it and planned for it and earned it even on three year olds or younger there are still things they can do like put the toys back in the toybox i hope this helps i want my kids to grow up and succeed in life and be hard workers that won't quit when things get tough i hope you do too EastEnders Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart Infantilism Jon Secada Knots Landing The Apprentice 2 The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Social rule Education in the People's Republic of China Justification (theology) Procrastination Capitalism Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Contender (television series) Child The Fairly OddParents Tony Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) About a Boy W.
