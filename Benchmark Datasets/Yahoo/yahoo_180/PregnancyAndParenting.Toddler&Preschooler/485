i share a room with my yr old sister and she won't go to bed its a constant battle with her to get her to go to sleep last night she was up until in the morning shes either hungry thirsty isn't tired etc what can i do to help her get into a habit for school this isn't normal she throws a fit when i tell her to go to bed my parents don't help cuz they have to sleep for work i dunno any suggestions she doesn't eat sugary stuff or anything if the tv is off she just keeps talking and won't sleep i try a lot of stuff yes i know my parents should be responsible but i've played mommy for quite a while i'm only my parents are seperated and i share a room with her at both houses the problem is she will stay awake even if i fall asleep but she will wake me up well she's seven and it's normal for her to have tons of energy so thats what you need to do burn all that energy so when it's sleepy time shes very sleepy make sure you burn it around the time she sleeps since she's seven it shouldn't be too hard burning the energy you could either dance with her to her favorite video let her run go bike riding make her do chores let her swim in a pool let her do diffrent activites one after the other letting her eat and etc is bad food gives her more energy so no late night snacking for her only let her drink water Shaggy dog story Insomnia The Shining (film) Homer's Enemy Oh My Goddess!
