does anybody know a fool proof way to potty train a boy i have tried almost everything but nothing seems to work personally i dont think he is ready but everyone else think he should be trained by now he is years i just potty trained my son and daughter and i used the potty stool http www thepottystool com i started by just setting it at the toilet my kids immediately climbed up on the stool and discovered that they could safely use the toilet this got them very interested in using the toilet and they were potty trained very quickly it really helps boys to pee standing up so they can see what is happening and connect the sensations i like that i don't have to double the steps of potty training by training them first in a potty and then training them to stop using a potty and not dumping and cleaning a potty each time is great the best thing is that kids use it for years i hope this helps you Toilet Toilet humour Toilet training Fecal incontinence Elimination communication Sento Japanese toilet Urinary incontinence Shaggy dog story Aerial (dance move) SpongeBob SquarePants The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Urination Kimberly-Clark Corporation Stomach cancer Feral child AFI 100 Years series El Chavo del Ocho Parenting Bristol Grammar School Kimi Finster Washroom Uniform Resource Locator Alan Arnett McLeod Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Jackass: The Movie Urine Train station The Sims West Bromwich Albion F.C.
