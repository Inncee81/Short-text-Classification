help with carseat booster i have a year old and a month old they both have the britax roundabout but my oldest is about grown out of it i love the britax and also would like to stick to a point harness but have no objection to boosters either i was looking at the britax regent does any one have this carseat and what do you think about it what are some other ones that you recommend i would like something that i can get for my youngest now too i have the britax husky but they don't make it anymore the regent seems really nice i'd go with it i've tried graco cosco safety st and evenflo seats the britax is far superior all of their straps twist easily and don't seem as thick and secure as a britax seat however at age your son doesn't require a pt harness if he's over lbs he's too big for the latch attachment for your car and you need to use the seatbelt to secure the seat in your car i'm all for a pt harness but a booster's fine i'd get a high back booster as opposed to the backless booster as long as he's yrs old and lbs he's fine to use the booster seat if he's slightly less than that he'll be fine the boosters can be used at years and inches tall Car safety Seat belt Textile manufacturing Dragon Booster Equine conformation Knife Paragliding Kitesurfing Horse tack Crash test dummy Baby transport Parachute Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Climbing equipment Skateboarding trick Carburetor Textile manufacturing terminology Yu-Gi-Oh!
