question about child a d d i have a very very very active yr old he's been that way since he was about now i've notice that he can't sit still or keep quiet for like more than seconds its getting on my ever lasting nerve no matter how i discipline him or try to get him to stop moving he can't he fidgets all the time he either has to be moving or making noise and any and all noise i think he has a add because he serious lacks any and all focus but when i asked my doctor she of course said he was way to young to be diagnosed so my question is for moms who thought there child had add and then was told by doctors they didn't what age the hyperness goes away and to moms of kids w add did you have a feeling that your child had it before he she was old enough to be diagnosed hey tha g child go fuck yourself i don't my child to have problems in school and not get a proper education and become some jackass that mooches off of society like you p s i don't want to put him on drugs i have a niece that had it and her mom drug the hell out her and i don't want to do that w my kid i have had two of my children diagnosed with a d d and yes they were definitely different from my other were tha g child is an idiot who doesn't know what the hell he's talking about and probably doesn't have any kids at all my other children loved to sit and have me read stories to them at like yrs old the with a d d were just like you described yours i can tell you that discipline is a waste because they cannot control these actions tough it out until he gets into school and then ask to see a specialist because it is not fair to the child to try to make them adapt to such a structured environment when it is impossible for them to do so and i wouldn't wait until he was my son was on meds for year then told me that once he realized how things were supposed to be he didn't need the meds anymore i took him off of them and he's doing fine this was yrs ago my daughter however still needs them for school and she is a junior in high school she doesn't take them on summer break though i agree that these meds can be way over prescribed but when it effects the child's learning something has to be done i hope everything works out for you Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Shaggy dog story Kodocha The Marshall Mathers LP Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Piccolo Junior Saga The Amber Spyglass Ben Johnson (athlete) Humphrey Bogart Milton H.
