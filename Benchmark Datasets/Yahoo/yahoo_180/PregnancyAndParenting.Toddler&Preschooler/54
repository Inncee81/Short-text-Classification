how can i make him stop throwing things hello i have a son who is almost years old he has autism spectrum disorder and sensory needs i have him in behavior therapy hours a week as well as hours of speech and ocupasional therapy i can not get his behavior under control he throws everything toys food drink etc everything he gets his hands on he throws he even hurts people by throwing toys intentionally at them i don't know what to do i have tried spanking tried slapping his hand tried time out tried re directing him to something else to play with tried picking up the toys and asking him to hand them to me or put them away i have tried everything i have heard to try i even did what the therapist sugested and still he keeps throwing argggg if you have any sugestions please help thank you most year olds experiment with cause and effect and throwing is unfortunately a great way to learn how things work he throws something at someone and it gets a reaction be it positive or negative so a perfectly normal year is likely to experiment with throwing objects since your son has a spectrum disorder you may be battling with it for a bit longer than others but if you are consistent it should subside with time how is your son at communicating the throwing behavior especially at other kids may be his way of expressing frustration or distaste for the situation being autistic he is likely easily upset and if you are able to get him out of the situation before he reaches the boiling point you can avoid some of the throwing scenarios you can also offer him plenty of soft toys so that if the throwing continues at least he won't hurt other children around him good luck and remember that at he really isn't doing this behavior to hurt others or cause you any heartache he is simply trying his best to figure out the world around him Autism Controversies in autism Traumatic incident reduction Sensory Integration Dysfunction Dog training Obsessive-compulsive disorder Autistic spectrum Transactional analysis Pervasive developmental disorder Spanking Milton H.
