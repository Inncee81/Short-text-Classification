how can i stop my som from biting himself my son is and was born with spina bifida he's paralyzed from the waist down so he can't feel anything in his legs yesterday when i got home from work and took his socks off to give him a bath i noticed he had a red mark on his ankle when i looked at it closely i saw that it was a bite mark and it was the size of his mouth my mom babysits him and i know she didn't bite him so that is not an issue he must have done it after he woke up from his nap cause he likes to play quietly for a while after he wakes up before getting out of bed mom didn't notice because he had his socks on how can i stop him from doing this again i know he can't feel it but it's still not good for him to bite himself well thats hard cuz its when no one is around my son bites himself cuz he has autism and what i was told to do is if i see him doin it to go get a toothbrush and brush his teeth cuz he just needs that of stimulation right now i dunno its a sensory thing but maybe if he does it while somones around u can try it but i doubt its the same thing your son just doesnt know it hurts cuz he cant feel it it was probably just something to do right then and there he might never do it again if u tell him that its not good for his body or something like that best of luck Spina bifida Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Out-of-body experience 2000 Australian Grand Prix Autism Sinfest Jon Secada Milton H.
