do pull ups really works for a yr old my kid is and he dosen't want his diaper any more and i've been wanting to get him the pull ups but i'm not sure if they work do they really know when its time to go potty see it my first kind i'm only and don't know what to do my mom never used those things on us so i don't know if they really work do they i just potty trained my son and daughter and i tried pull ups but my kids could not tell the difference between pull ups and diapers what worked for me was the potty stool http www thepottystool com i started by just setting it at the toilet my kids immediately climbed up on the stool and discovered that they could safely use the toilet this got them very interested in using the toilet and they were potty trained very quickly it really helps boys to pee standing up so they can see what is happening and connect the sensations the potty stool lets boys pee standing right into the toilet with no mess i like that i don't have to double the steps of potty training by training them first in a potty and then training them to stop using a potty and not dumping and cleaning a potty each time is great the best thing is that kids use it for years i hope this helps you Kimberly-Clark Corporation Fecal incontinence Aerial (dance move) Urinary incontinence Toilet Urination Toilet training Elimination communication Diaper Shaggy dog story Jackass: The Movie Social rule Infantilism Humphrey Bogart Sento Milton H.
