my mother in law thinks i should put bars across my yr old's windows so that he won't fall out is she crazy a lot of young children are seriously injured in falls from windows and one of the suggestions to fix that is to put bars on the windows so that they can not fall out especially if you are not in a one story although significant injury can occur then too in my personal opinion the bars are a bit extreme there are certainly other safety measures you can take here are a few ideas get a locking unit for the window which your child can not open but you easily can in an emergency very important make sure there are no toy boxes or other furniture near the window which could be used to climb upon and try to open the window or fall through the closed window just as dangerous if not more so than falling out of the open window talk to your two year old about the danger if there has been behavior that has your mil worried two year olds understand a lot more than we give them credit for and if you say mommy does not want you to open the window because you could fall out and get hurt they understand better than if you only say do not do that i always told my children why they could not do something and i think it helped basically just use your common sense as i said i think the bars are a bit extreme but it is a valid recommendation perhaps an incident has happened in her life or to someone she knows that makes her extra sensitive to the issue i do not think she is crazy she sounds like a concerned grandma i wish you the best Traumatic brain injury Hamster Theory of conduct Rape The Shining (film) Autism About a Boy Second language acquisition Philosophy of language Infantilism Kodocha Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Microsoft Windows Salad Fingers Social rule Political economy Psychoanalysis Sexual orientation Road traffic accident Dog training Gravity Road safety Extreme Programming Milton H.
