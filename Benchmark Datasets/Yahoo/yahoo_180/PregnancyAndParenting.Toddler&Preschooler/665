what to do when yr old daughter not wanna go to kg and weeps i found when my own daughter when to kindergarten she was shy and scared at first i suggest several things firstly don't make a big deal of it when you drop her off just give her a cuddle and say goodbye i will be coming back later then walk straight out the staff should then be good enough to distract her with an activity or toy talk to the staff about it they see this type of thing all the time and can give good advice to overcome it it should only last a couple of weeks i found that the more upset i was the more upset she got so don't let her tears affect you once you are out the door she will be fine best wishes Spice Girls Jon Secada Social rule Shaggy dog story Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) RuneScape quests The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Avenue Q The Ashlee Simpson Show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Jazz Singer The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Strap-on dildo The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Kodocha Tina Turner Shen Gong Wu Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cliff Richard Max Martin The Isley Brothers Cleveland Browns The Lovely Bones Le Malade imaginaire Babe Ruth Blonde on Blonde One Tree Hill (TV series) I Don't Wanna Cry Treehouse of Horror V The Death Gate Cycle The Inside Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 New York Jets The Star Wars Holiday Special Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Children of Dune Milton H.
