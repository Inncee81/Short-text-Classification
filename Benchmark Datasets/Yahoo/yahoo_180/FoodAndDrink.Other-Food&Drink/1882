does anyone else get small cuts from tootsie roll pops i don't know why i'm asking this but i've noticed that many people after eating a tootsie roll pop get small cuts all across the from part of their mouths i think its because of the small trenches around the lollipop that close in sharply it also depends on how you suck on the lollipop but does anyone know what i'm talking about this only happens with tootsie roll pops by the way for me hey i get those i don't really know why tootsie pops are really sharp i don't get why it's only tootsie pops though and not any other kind of lollipops Lollipop Tootsie Roll Industries Tootsie Pop Rod Stewart Happy Tree Friends AFI 100 Years series Sherbet Who Shot Mr. Burns?
