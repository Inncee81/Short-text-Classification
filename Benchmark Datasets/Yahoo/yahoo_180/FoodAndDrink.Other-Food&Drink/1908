ideas for light and healthy dinners we were thinking of cutting out a big dinner type meal in the evenings usually we're all tired out and it just seems weird eating such a big meal so close to bed time so we were trying to come up with meal ideas that would require not too much preparation like hummus and pita bread good bread and cheese raw vegetables olives baked sweet potatoes what else would be good and easy nachos are a nice simple dinner i use canned beans heat them in a pot with a tiny bit of water when they are hot pour over tortilla chips that are already in a baking dish or pie plate add olives cheese tomatoes and peppers put the whole thing in the oven and bake until it is warmed and the cheese is melted not long at all pick a great salsa or make your own and relax and enjoy Pizza Breakfast Bread Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Barbecue Japanese cuisine French cuisine German cuisine Hot dog Pancake Cuisine of Turkey Vegetarian cuisine Hamburger Sandwich MRE French fries Roman eating and drinking Dumpling Cuisine of Greece Cajun cuisine Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Cookware and bakeware Cuisine of Brazil Domesticated turkey Cha chaan teng Tofu Soul food Bengali cuisine Food Bagel Tomato Dim sum Rice pudding Tortilla Potato chips Kitchen Korean cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States British cuisine Cuisine of Argentina Coffee Meal Passover Cheese Nachos Pie Hummus Potato Street food Fish and chips Serbian cuisine Kraft Dinner Kosher foods Cuisine of Malaysia Russian cuisine Hamster Pasta Tea Pea soup In-N-Out Burger Biscuit Japanese tea ceremony Food preservation Tapas Salad Fondue Cuisine of Africa Curry Taco Sauce Common bean Pita Mexican cuisine Quesadilla Hot pot Cholent Soup Flour Ketchup Chocolate Chicago-style pizza Cookie Cuisine of Singapore Apple pie Cooking on a campfire Empanada
