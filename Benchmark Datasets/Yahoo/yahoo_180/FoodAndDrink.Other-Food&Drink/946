microwave and raw meat i'm a newbie for cooking so this question may sound a bit ridiculous i would like like to know if it is possible to cook raw meat in the microwave instead of over a stove or in a conventional oven i have a few raw chicken patties that i would like to microwave to be fully cooked but i'm not sure if it's safe to do so if it is possible to microwave raw meat poultry how much time should i set it to cook for thanks you can definitely cook chicken or any raw meat to a perfectly safe cooked temperature in a microwave it is hard to say how long without knowing the size weight of the patties put them in a circular pattern on a microwave safe plate and cover with waxed paper i would start at about minutes and check to see if they need be rotated and add another minutes keep checking until they are done you can tell if they are done just like you would if they were cooked on the stove or oven figure about minutes per pound if you know how much they weigh you can easily add more time when microwaving but you can fix overcooked food so just stop and check often here is a website to let you know that i know what i'm talking about http www goodnuke com recipes index htm Microwave oven Hamburger Cookware and bakeware Kitchen Idli Stove Barbecue Microwave Chili con carne Slow cooker Egg (food) Pizza French fries Food Escherichia coli O157:H7 Jewish cuisine Veganism Hot dog Domesticated turkey Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Raw food diet Wok French cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Cavity magnetron Recipe Steaming Agar plate Stock (food) Bacon Tire Bengali cuisine Sauerkraut Cuisine of Laos Compact disc Curry In-N-Out Burger Solar power satellite McDonald's Tofu Korean cuisine Portable stove Sausage Cosmic microwave background radiation Cooking on a campfire Chicken Kebab Hand grenade Cuisine of Brazil Russian cuisine Cat British cuisine Haggis Cajun cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Dim sum Peruvian cuisine D__ner kebab Bagel Kosher foods Sandwich Salad Cuisine of Thailand Permittivity Vegetarianism Cholent Cochineal Hot pot Diseases of the honeybee XML Major appliance Plastic Cheese Oyster Vacuum tube Capercaillie Ham Chicken soup Burger Searing Risotto CPU cache Hangi M16 (rifle) Amateur telescope making Heat Space Shuttle program Roman eating and drinking Atkins Nutritional Approach Fried chicken Fire Kashrut Mayonnaise Foodborne illness Bread Vitamin C Polarization
