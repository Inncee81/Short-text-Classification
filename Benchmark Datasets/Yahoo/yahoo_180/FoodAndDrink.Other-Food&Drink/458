which meal best exemplifies your country this can be from your country of birth or country of residence please describe the very best meal that you'd serve or recommend that sums up the best tastes or cuisine of your country please state the country it's from and please describe what's in the meal because not everyone will know what certain dishes are if they're unfamiliar thank you the q is which meal best exemplifies your country hi although mansaf is not my favourite meal it's one of my favourites the national meal in jordan is mansaf this is rice with a yogurt based sauce with pieces of meet lamb cooked in it the yogurt sauce is made from something called jameed which is dried yogurt it's much richer than normal yogurt when soaked in water and crushed in the blended to get the sauce jameed pieces look like white rocks if you taste one you'll see it's very salty when soaked they become soft and can be blended in the blender with water the resultant is a very thick sauce that is diluted with chicken or meat stock a lot of gee is added to both the yogurt and the rice traditionally the meat is placed raw in the yogurt and cooked in it nowadays though no one does that and we cook the meat before hand by boiling it with flavourings and then just placing in the yogurt to exchange flavours the proper way of eating the mansaf is with the rice spread in a very large dish with all the meat arranged on top and decorated with nuts then you pour some of the yogurt in front of where you re standing and eat by hand it sounds nasty i know but it's a lot of fun and very hard to master the skill of caa'balleh which means of ball making that's because when eating you literally make a ball of rice with meat in it and then eat it without ever having your hand touch your mouth because that's very rude so you kinda flip it into your mouth when it's close by in a small family setting women may like to eat with their hands as well and this is very acceptable although they generally dislike it as they are delicate flowers lol even though this is the traditional ay of eating mansaf variations include eating with a spoon from he huge dish instead of by hand or just eating seated and using plates the latter is what happens most of the time now it s considered girly of men and boys who choose to eat with plates when the rest are eating by hand from the main dish the rice and yogurt are usually coloured to be slightly yellow when someone wants to poor some yogurt sauce in front of his area he must always ask everyone else if they would like some first failing to do so is seen as unwelcoming and selfish also if i'm standing next to my grandfather for example it's his duty traditionally to place pieces of meat on the rice i'm eating from as a sign of taking care of me but this is rarely done nowadays it's absolutely unheard of that one east with both hands the other hand is always kept behind your back traditionally the host must not stop eating until the guests do to make the feel comfortable and continue eating as much as they like also when finishing the guests should say some thing like yekhlif alaykum or daymeh which is an evolved phrase that means may your banquets always last i love the tradition of mansaf as it's such a powerful connection to our traditions and a way of gathering the family if anyone wants the detailed directions for making mansaf i can give them to you don t worry there are alternatives for jameed that you can easily get your ands on it s delicious Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Dim sum Dumpling Ramen Cuisine of Denmark Cantonese cuisine Chinese cuisine Bengali cuisine Customs and etiquette of Japan Curry Cuisine of Laos Hamburger Roman eating and drinking Cuisine of Brazil Soup Russian cuisine Jewish cuisine McDonald's Hot pot Kelantan Chopsticks French fries Idli Cuisine of Singapore Pasta Meal Vegetarianism Cha chaan teng Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Argentina American Chinese cuisine D__ner kebab Cajun cuisine Soy sauce Donburi Cuisine of the Southern United States British cuisine Tea Satay Kebab Sushi Textile manufacturing Nabemono Sandwich Fish and chips Egg (food) Sauce Pancake Hot dog Food Cuisine of Turkey Mayonnaise Chili con carne Yum cha Wine Kosher foods Kitchen Vegetarian cuisine Rum Culture of India Bread Cuisine of Greece Cheese Rice Stock (food) Bento Bacon Fecal incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Volleyball Pottery Potato Salad Horse meat 613 mitzvot Pea soup Chicken Domesticated turkey
