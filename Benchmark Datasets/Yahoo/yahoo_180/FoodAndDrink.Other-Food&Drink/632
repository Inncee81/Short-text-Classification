how do i put items such as candy etc into jello do i need to add anything i have to make a model out of food for my science class and i was thinking of using jello can i just add objects inside of it will it set well or do i have to add something else the things i'm thinking of adding are candy noodles etc not sure about this i added candy worms to jello once to hang over edge of container the part that was in the jello absorbed the liquid and became kind of bloated looking you know the difference of how raw noodles look compared to how they look after being cooked that is because they absorb the water if you do this experiment i suggest you not add anything until the jello is almost set up to avoid the absorption problem it will be tricky to time it at best because if you wait too long it will be too late i would add stuff to the jello that would not be affected by the water such as fruit and marshmallows or vegetables you might try a dry run of your experiment with small qty to see what happens good luck that is all i can say Hamster Tofu Japanese cuisine Ice cream Food preservation Soup Korean cuisine Cantonese cuisine Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Malaysia German cuisine Microwave oven Food Kosher foods Veganism Vermicompost MRE Russian cuisine Jewish cuisine Breakfast Oreo Salad Chicken soup Japanese tea ceremony Chinese cuisine Ammonia Confectionery Dead Kennedys Pot Noodle Nuclear power Textile manufacturing Fire extinguisher Philosophy of language Vacuum Nabemono Pasta Mid-levels Omega-3 fatty acid Campfire Dietary fiber Cuisine of the Philippines Pancake Prostate cancer Hydroponics Crohn's disease Beef noodle soup Gelatin Cuisine of Brazil Plastic Rebreather Color Jello Biafra Star Trek Customizable Card Game Explosive material Cuisine of Singapore Glass Carbon dioxide Cray-1 Rice Luck Solar cell Objective-C Bengali cuisine Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Taiwanese cuisine Vegetarianism Durian Inflation Solar power Shanghai cuisine Thermal power station Folic acid Engine cooling Neutrino Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables Atari 8-bit family Bulk vending Raw food diet Chernobyl accident Casting Diarrhea Bacon Glycerin Laserdisc Organic food Cha chaan teng Professional wrestling match types Beavis and Butt-head Insulin Sushi Knife Microeconomics Milk Escherichia coli O157:H7 Black hole Atkins Nutritional Approach Sauce Peanut Law of value
