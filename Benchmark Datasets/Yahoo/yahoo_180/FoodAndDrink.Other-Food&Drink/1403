has anyone ever ordered a cake from dairy queen the site makes me so mad it only shows you like the shape of the cake you can get i remember last summer i went to one of the stores in some other city and saw a hello kitty cake and ever since then i've wanted it but problem is i don't remember where that one is all we have around here is dq stands also the site doesn't show decorative character cakes so i was wondering how some of you went about ordering a cake this answer mostly applies to people who live near dq stands not the big restaurants i work in a dq stand in a mall most dqs sell cakes no matter the store type and have people who can decorate them when people want to order a cake we find out who the cake is for male female age so we can get a better idea how to decorate it and if there's any kind of theme they want we also have a binder of cake designs that customers can look through by the way i remember seeing a hello kitty design at our store all you need to do is ask for it make sure you do this before you need the cake usually at least days the reason for this is so that there can be someone who does cakes to do it for you and you'll get exactly the cake you want there are also different sizes you can get for your cake and and blizzard cakes also come in and most places have sheet cakes which are around by hope i helped Homestar Runner Dairy Cookie Birthday The Apprentice 2 Christmas tree 7-Eleven Bulk vending McDonald's Mid-Autumn Festival Cake My Little Pony Japanese New Year Pizza Mooncake Dim sum Dairy Queen Random Harvest Little Britain Emergence Phantasms (TNG episode) Escalator Mochi Doughnut The Ashlee Simpson Show Social rule Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Theory of conduct Plame affair CPU cache Hello Kitty The nature of God in Western theology Expert system Garfield You Don't Know Jack The Star Wars Holiday Special Garth Brooks David Icke Seinfeld Zellers Computer Sears Holdings Corporation Bread King cake Roman eating and drinking Epcot Cuisine of Denmark Fireworks Sento Joy Division (band) Japanese tea ceremony Wright brothers Diablo II: Lord of Destruction StarCraft Episode VI German cuisine Spidey Super Stories Wallpaper group Sukkot Fecal incontinence Textile manufacturing Eaton's Ren and Stimpy Firework Bon Jovi Sealab 2021 Lego Tofu Software engineering Inheritance (computer science) Computer numbering formats National Day Parade Social aspects of clothing Violin Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Floppy disk Socrates Halloween Married... with Children Frank Herbert 99 Ranch Market Customs and etiquette of Japan Whose Line Is It Anyway?
