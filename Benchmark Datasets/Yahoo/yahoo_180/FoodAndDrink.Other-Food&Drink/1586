chicken noodle soup why do people eat it when sick never really understood that chicken soup has all kinds of beneficial properties which promote good health personally when i am sick i like to have chicken soup not only because it's great comfort food but you honestly need clear broths fluids to clear out mucus in your body to get better here is the official answer courtesy of cnn chicken soup is medicine u s scientists confirm washington scientists say they have confirmed what grandmothers have known for centuries that chicken soup is good for colds chicken soup as made by grandma contains several ingredients that affect the body's immune system a team at the university of nebraska medical center found specifically it has anti inflammatory properties that could explain why it soothes sore throats and eases the misery of colds and flu dr stephen rennard and colleagues said monday chicken soup may contain a number of substances with beneficial medicinal activity the researchers wrote in their report published in the journal chest my wife was making chicken soup one year for the jewish holidays and we were talking about its effects on colds rennard a specialist in pulmonary medicine said in a telephone interview i said 'well maybe it has some anti inflammatory effect ' and she said 'really ' and i said 'why not ' and i said maybe we could find out in the lab as it turned out rennard's lab was well suited to making such tests in the lab we study inflammation and injury and repair mechanisms in the lung as related to asthma and emphysema and so on he said so rennard's wife barbara rennard made up a batch of her grandmother's chicken soup which includes chicken onions sweet potato parsnips turnips carrots celery stems and parsley rennard said his wife added no salt but did include matzo balls a kind of dumpling then they ran laboratory tests not only did they test the soup as a whole but they separated out the components these tests were in the laboratory and it doesn't test chicken soup clinically in colds rennard stressed neutrophil movement stopped they found that chicken soup and many of its ingredients helped stop the movement of neutrophils white blood cells that eat up bacteria and cellular debris and which are released in great numbers by viral infections like colds neutrophil activity can stimulate the release of mucous which may be the cause of the coughs and stuffy nose caused by upper respiratory infections such as colds all the ingredients were found to be inhibitory including the boiled extract of chicken alone they wrote rennard said vitamins and other agents in the ingredients could plausibly have biological action the researchers also went to the store and bought different commercial brands of soup to test about a third of them were more active than grandma's soup rennard said adding that he could not remember which kinds of soup they were one or two of them had very little activity at all vegetarian vegetable soup had some activity to be safe they also tested plain omaha tap water which to their relief had no effect if tap water were active that would be disturbing in a number of ways rennard said some researchers have suggested in the past that perhaps the steam from the soup or the chicken fat may play a role in soothing inflamed airways rennard said this was possible he also said there could be a tlc tender loving care factor if you know somebody prepared soup for you by hand that might have an effect he said rennard said he had no immediate plans to test chicken soup any further i have no doubt that generations from now people will read this and the only thing of interest will be the recipe he said it really is good soup Homeopathy Allergy Acute respiratory distress syndrome Jewish cuisine Traditional Chinese medicine Japanese cuisine Tofu Mesothelioma Cantonese cuisine Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Bronchitis AIDS Veganism Korean cuisine Folic acid Coeliac disease Wound healing phases Antiviral drug Brain Yarrow Tobacco smoking Apoptosis Medical analysis of circumcision Cuisine of Denmark Influenza Virus Polish cuisine HIV test Pharmaceutical company Tocopherol Methylsulfonylmethane Animal testing Stem cell German cuisine Gastroesophageal reflux disease Cuisine of Singapore Pulmonary alveolus Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Diabetes mellitus Hay fever Egg (food) Carbon dioxide Immunosuppressive drug Lupus erythematosus Cuisine of the Philippines Paracetamol Hamster Conjunctivitis Food Peruvian cuisine Potato Herpes simplex virus AIDS reappraisal First aid Cajun cuisine Omega-3 fatty acid Dim sum Crohn's disease Psychosis Dumpling Medical cannabis Chinese food therapy Ulcerative colitis Chinese cuisine HIV
