have you ever consumed an awful tasting homemade dinner only because the ingredients were expensive yes i was raised by penny pinchers and it makes me very mental about throwing away anything that cost money i hate to throw out leftovers too i get all bitter when i clean out the fridge and have to throw out mold food this little cash register in my head goes off and i think we will always be just getting by because we throw away so much money sick i know another factor can be the amount of time spent making the nasty thing and the fact that there is no longer time to make something else Microeconomics Chocolate Organic food Inflation Food Bread Gross domestic product Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
