do you like tinned packet food or do you just eat it for convenience does anybody choose tinned food over fresh for taste i believe that most of the people that use it is because of convenience i personally preserve foods all summer and some in the fall for use all winter i prefer fresh and home preserved but there are occasions that i have used 'tinned foods for some that use them it might be because they do not know how to do home preserving and do not have the finances to get the proper utensils to start doing it sad though nothing like fresh and or home preserved Japanese tea ceremony Local food Sausage Jewish cuisine Ramen Kitchen Hamster Canning Foodborne illness Meal Fast food Tea Sauerkraut Organic food Cookware and bakeware Nutrition Tofu Ketchup Cheese Cuisine of Denmark Food storage Convenience store Food Hiberno-English Pasta Yum cha Black pepper Korean cuisine Fork Fish and chips Food preservation Garlic Urban sprawl Vegetarianism Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Laos French cuisine Wall Street Bread Tin Potato chips Curry __stanbul Peanut butter Chopsticks Pickling Mojave people Breakfast Eating Snack food Embalming Puerto de la Cruz, Santa Cruz de Tenerife Pepsi-Cola Cha chaan teng Stir frying MRE Historical roots of Catholic Eucharistic theology Watermelon Cuisine of the Philippines Lent Full English breakfast Food science Eid ul-Fitr Cooperative Domesticated turkey Cuisine of Thailand Tlingit Aphid Healthy eating Chili con carne Laksa Milk Blood plasma Bong Sushi Apple Hamburger RuneScape skills Hygiene Futures contract Oyster Fast-food restaurant Convenience food German cuisine Street food Sea-Monkey Breakfast cereal Fugu McDonald's Aztec Chinese cuisine Food additive Community-supported agriculture Blackfoot French fries Kashrut Sailor Tin Nyanko Food irradiation
