philly cheese steak i need to know how to make a philly cheese steak my uncle is a senior and he is from philly he wants the real deal like at home so if there is someone from philly that can help me well ask him if he wants provalone or cheez whiz this is a big debate among philly cheese enthusists ingredients pound rib eye frozen then cut very thin onion mushrooms provolone cheese or cheese whiz hoagie rolls directions meat make friends with your butcher you need him to partially freeze a hunk of rib eye and then slice it very thin you want it sliced thin even though common sense tells us that thick is better you can buy the hunk of rib eye and freeze and slice it yourself but the butcher generally does a better job than i do i can only get it about thick and he does less bread this is the hard part if you aren't in the tristate area and can't get amorosos rolls the only thing that is really good on a cheesesteak then you have to find a substitute squishy sub rolls will not do they do not hold together under pressure refrain from buying those hero rolls too a good hoagie roll is almost rubbery in texture but quite soft the best substitute i have found is a loaf of french bread not as good as the real thing but hey beggars can't be choosers toppings all of this is personal choice i like fried onions and mushrooms myself cheeses used vary i hate to admit it but i think cheese whiz tastes the best provolone is awesome too and that's what i would use if i was afraid of the plastic orange stuff called whiz cooking the steak in a cast iron frying pan or a grill pan heat some oil saute toppings until pliable make them however you like them remove them from pan and set aside pour some more oil in the pan i use olive oil but if you have access to the stuff they use in restaurants on grills it would taste even better on medium high heat place to of a pound of meat in the pan lying the pieces flat and overlapping to form a shape that will fit nicely in a bun when the meat turns gray with doneness flip it over and if you are using cheese slices now is the time to lie them on top of the meat add the other toppings back into the pan next to the meat and allow to reheat cover the pan to allow the cheese to melt this should take minutes if the meat looks overcooked that's ok it should be gray this is the time to toast the bread if you so wish i don't like mine toasted at all warmed is ok if you are using cheese whiz warm it in the microwave pick up meat and melted cheese with a spatula and deposit on the roll if using cheese whiz use a butter knife or chopstick to smear whiz next to the meat push the meat on one side of the roll and deposit the toppings next to it this is important because if you put the toppings on the meat they will not be in the bottom of the sandwich which really sux you should get meat toppings and cheese in every bite D__ner kebab In-N-Out Burger Cheese Chili con carne German cuisine French cuisine Bagel Fish and chips Risotto Bacon Philadelphia, Pennsylvania McDonald's Steak Grilled cheese sandwich Sushi Jewish cuisine French toast Cuisine of the Philippines Korean cuisine Casting MRE Cuisine of the Southern United States Cajun cuisine Recipe Dim sum Bengali cuisine Cha chaan teng Knife Cuisine of Argentina Cookie Fast-food restaurant Welding Pancake Plastic Peanut butter Cantonese cuisine Street food Cuisine of Greece Meat Loaf Oregano Textile manufacturing Dairy Kosher foods Toast Soup Chicago-style pizza Full English breakfast Halva Russian cuisine Cuisine of Austria Potato chips Donburi Quesadilla Cuisine of Malaysia Burger Curry Mattress Processed cheese Wok Cuisine of Turkey Stir frying Seitan Chinese cuisine Blintz Apple pie Spatula Cuisine of the Midwest Muffin Horse meat Motor oil Taco Happy Tree Friends
