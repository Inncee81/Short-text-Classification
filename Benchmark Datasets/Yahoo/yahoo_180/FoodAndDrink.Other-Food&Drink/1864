tortilla pinwheel wraps etc how long do they stay fresh i successfully made the tortilla pinwheels thanks to answers here now i am wondering how long they will stay fresh in the fridge i mixed cream cheese with salsa and chopped green onions spread on tortillas then put slices of ham or beef on rolled them up and covered each one with saran wrap ready to slice into pinwheels when i need them but now i am wondering how long they stay fresh thanks j as long as their ingredients still have some fridge life left and the spread on wasn't overly gooey as in it could soak into the tortilla too much you should have a few days grace go with your ingredients as to length ham beef and cheese would last longer than chicken or turkey right if you put shredded lettuce or alfalfa sprouts then all bets are off they wilt down into yuck in a day green onions wilt too but are still tasty with some crunch left in the white parts pinwheels get kind of 'gummy' if the spread soaks in too much but that's a matter of esthetics rather than food safety Hamburger MRE Hot dog Cuisine of Denmark D__ner kebab Sandwich Japanese cuisine Bread McDonald's Taco Peruvian cuisine Breakfast Pizza German cuisine Salad Chili con carne Tofu Cuisine of the Philippines Bagel Chipotle Mexican Grill Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Cantonese cuisine Domesticated turkey Polish cuisine Soul food Cuisine of Vietnam Quesadilla Bengali cuisine Mexican cuisine Burrito Cuisine of Cambodia Cuisine of the Southern United States Dim sum French cuisine Tortilla Cuisine of Singapore Korean cuisine Fish and chips Onion Cuisine of Argentina Meatball Pancake Cajun cuisine Cheese Sausage Fajita Escherichia coli O157:H7 Tamale Soup Subway (restaurant) Sushi American Chinese cuisine Sauce Meatloaf Haggis Curry Risotto Cuisine of Malaysia Gyros Tea Stock (food) Chicken Cha chaan teng French fries Bacon Cuisine of Greece Burger Pickling Dumpling Pasta Cuisine of Austria Organic food Muesli Taco Bell Corned beef French toast Kebab Cheesesteak Cuisine of Turkey Salsa (sauce) Vegetarianism Menudo (soup) Hakka cuisine Porridge Butter Pie Tapioca Shanghai cuisine Rice pudding Vegetarian cuisine Ham Ramen Soba Irish cuisine
