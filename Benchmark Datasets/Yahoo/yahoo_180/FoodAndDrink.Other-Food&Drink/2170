how do they get the chocolate onto m m's without a flat spot ok choc peanuts raisins they're all the same but how do they manage to cover them in chocolate without a flat edge is it similar to ball bearings where they drop it down a long shaft while the chocolate cools one of the unsolved wonders i saw this on a show called modern marvels on the history channel last night the show was all about chocolate and they showed the process of making m m's they first mold them into little buttons and let them cool a bit then they put them into a machine that spins them around it looks like a mini cement mixer and they knock into each other and this rounds out the shape a bit then while they're still spinning they add the candy coating they only showed them making plain ones but i think it would be a similar process for the peanut or almond ones M&M's Drill bit Chocolate Casting Peanut butter Textile manufacturing Peanut Glass Cookie Oreo Screw Internal ballistics Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Bullet Heath bar Twix Amateur telescope making Sega Saturn Rifle Ice cream Dog Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Fried dough foods Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Snooker Bulk vending Confectionery Plastic Golf club (equipment) Bread Oscilloscope Woodworking Cartridge (firearms) Robot Wars Fan (implement) Almond Lathe Tire PEZ Cold Stone Creamery GunBound Table tennis Knitting Sand casting 2000 Australian Grand Prix Corset Mouse (computing) Concrete Billiards Happy Tree Friends Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Skateboarding trick Compact disc Veruca Salt Planet of the Daleks Communicating sequential processes Wood carving Ceramics Terminal ballistics Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Spark plug Professional wrestling throws Hersheypark Gramophone record The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Mars Bar Thermal power station Injection moulding Genericized trademark Cocoa Candy bar Wheel of Fortune Breakfast Forge Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Wok Babbitt metal Windsurfing Strap-on dildo Cadbury Schweppes Honda CX series Opportunity rover Conker's Bad Fur Day Vision mixer Rolling-element bearing Four square DVD Manual transmission Kid Chocolate Toffee Pottery Timpani The Price Is Right Tag Happy Meal Winning Streak Charlie Brown Social rule
