do you eat organic food why do you eat it i have so many people ask me about this and i would like to give them some other opinions we eat organically all the time for the health benefits and because we've done a lot of homework and understand how completely terrible the processed food industry in this country usa is we also look at new studies that are suggesting and we agree that diet is most likely the cause of many many health problems we're seeing at such alarming rates you don't catch cancer or diabetes or heart disease you don't get a headache because you have an aspirin deficiency you can't eat poisons year after year and not expect to pay the piper sometime people are being conned by corporations and their own government have them do some checking and find out what chlorine and fluoride do to your body since it's in your water ask them to investigate aspartame how did such an awful drug pass muster it's an ugly story and splenda and msg not the naturally occurring kind but the other stuff what really is in 'fast food' it's just endless but most folks don't know and that's the really sad part do they know about gmo's be afraid be very afraid truely once you do understand what's happening you have no choice but to go organic and i know you begin to sound like a nut when you try to tell people what is really going on with their food so now i just tell them to investigate for themselves we have been totally organic for a couple years now and are old hands at finding great prices canning for winter etc etc but we're both over i'm completely off all medications my husband is off all but a very few and we're hopeful that he'll be able to come off those as well that is a profound statement if you think about it living drug free our organics consist of raw milk cow share program from an organic herd ionized water with reverse osmosis free range grass fed beef pork buffalo chicken no hormones steroids antibiotics pesticides herbicides or chemicals of any kind fresh organic fruit veggies nuts raw cheeses breads candy cakes you can do it all just takes some foresight and planning so i hope that helps but it may be more info than you were looking for lol Vegetarianism Organic food Veganism Food Hypoglycemia Milk Genetically modified food Raw food diet Omega-3 fatty acid Folic acid Sugar substitute Nutrition Aspartame Hamster Chronic fatigue syndrome Organic farming Dairy Prostate cancer Livestock Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Healthy eating Stomach cancer Escherichia coli O157:H7 Foodborne illness Crohn's disease Hamburger Hormone replacement therapy (trans) French cuisine Growth hormone treatment Vitamin D Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Denmark Fecal incontinence Insulin Soft drink Medicine Vitamin C Breastfeeding Acne Chocolate Natural Hygiene Dieting German cuisine MRE Atkins Nutritional Approach Sucralose Obesity Tocopherol Asthma Guinea pig Diabetes mellitus Factory farming Vegetarian nutrition Cheese Japanese cuisine Stroke Cuisine of the Philippines Kashrut Pasteurization Breakfast Pizza Taboo food and drink Peanut Fancy rat Sewage treatment Pneumonia McDonald's Kevin Trudeau Tooth enamel Pharmaceutical company Tooth Urinary incontinence Jewish cuisine Health insurance Chili con carne Hypertension Polychlorinated biphenyl Shrimp farm Food preservation Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Chicken Coffee Trans fat Anorexia nervosa Caffeine Diarrhea RuneScape quests Mercury (element) Low-carbohydrate diet Sausage Roman eating and drinking Elephant Soul food
