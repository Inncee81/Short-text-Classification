this box of frozen chicken says sell by jun should i eat it serious advice is appreciated but feel free to give your honest opinion as of right now i plan to cook it thuroughly in the oven then microwave it for about mins its been frozen and doesnt smell that bad so what should i do i appreciate all of your answers so far im cooking it now and it smells pretty good like normal it was frozen but i will go check for fungi i just hate throwing food out it makes me feel like a jerk when i think of those kids in poor countries that just drink dirty water and cardboard ok so far smells okay just dry and not too good kind of tastes like assorted glazed pastries which is weird and im eating it with ketchup so hopefully this works out if i dont come back then i guess this is goodbye well i survived and it wasnt actually that bad thanks for all the input if it's been frozen the whole time if you keep food frozen it stays good longer but it wasn't that long ago anyway so i'm sure it will be fine if tastes funny though stop eating it who eats food that tastes funny anyway not good funny like screaming hair when harry potter says we all have something voldemort doesn't like bad funny like the funny you get when it's thundering real bad and your playing on the computer Cuisine of Denmark Food Fish and chips "Weird Al" Yankovic Hot dog Tofu Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Tea Ron and Fez The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Cuisine of Malaysia Japanese cuisine Halitosis French cuisine Pizza Jewish cuisine Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Poker jargon Bread Atomic Kitten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shit Trailer Park Boys Charmed Harry Potter (character) Kodocha Theory of conduct Futurama (TV series - season 5) British cuisine Cookware and bakeware Pie Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
