where can i find heinz baked beans in the us there are plenty of sites where you can have them imported i would prefer to find someone here in the us the cost seems to be high for imported food items plus the weight of the cans would be costly for shipping i am looking for a us based distributor um yes i do know what a grocery store is and we have them where i live seriously this product is not available to the us market unbelieveably i am one hour from pittsburgh which is ironically the place where heinz is based you know heinz ketchup heinz sauce etc they are the biggest name in this area besides carnegie but for some reason they do not distribute their version of baked beans they are particularly nice and different from most us brands because they are only made with tomato sauce and have no pork base they closest i have found is our local grocery store krogers they have a store brand that is vegetarian my husband who is british likes these very much but says they are exactly heinz it would be cool to find these at a reasonable price most that i have found on the net are around per can which is a little steep with shipping costs seeing that they only cost about p in britain typo i meant to say they are not exactly heinz when i compared my husband's opinion to our local store brand sorry my local giant eagle has just been remodeled and it has a huge international aisle i've noticed heinz baked beans in the british food section hope this helps Ketchup Supermarket Hamburger H.
