is it true that red meat has to rot in your body before you can digest it i just cut pork out of my diet and i was told that red meat is good for you but in order for you to digest it it has to sit in our body for a little while until it pretty much rots is this true this will determine whether or not i'll be cutting red meat out too actually this is true most people believe it to be false either because they want it to be or they just can't believe anything that gross of a food they enjoy but it is definitely true i am a nursing student and we have covered this sort of topic a few times i tell you it's pretty nasty and no i don't eat red meat either oh and yes the stomach acids do start to break it down but not enough as it continues down your intestinal area that is where it rots basically it takes a few days for you to digest meat but veggies and fruits take only a few hours i see people are giving my answer the thumbs down but think about this too meat is flesh when you buy it it is already rotting how many days do you really think it can last refridgerated or not as soon as the animal dies nature takes it course and the flesh starts to decay i find it really sad how many people are so ready to defend a food just because they like it facts are still facts people just because it sounds nasty and you don't want it to be true doesn't mean that it isn't Vegetarianism Foodborne illness Vitamin C Tooth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an YuYu Hakusho Pork Cat Kashrut Stomach cancer Stomach Decomposition Trichinosis Theory of conduct Meat Comanche Gastrointestinal tract Carnivore Social rule MRE Veganism Cuisine of the Philippines Fasting Gray Wolf Fecal incontinence Crohn's disease The Amber Spyglass Sant Mat Family farm hog pen Chicken Hamburger Raw food diet Folic acid Adjustable gastric band Insect Nutrition Kodocha Kosher foods Fugu Mango Halting problem Colorectal cancer Buddhism Hamster Mummy Dietary fiber Carnivorous plant 613 mitzvot Dim sum Soul food Coconut crab Ruminant Dog Flatulence Burial Food Vermicompost Harp Seal Invader Zim Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Taboo food and drink Barbecue Tlingit Salmon Egg (food) Vegetarian cuisine Cheese Shaggy dog story Coeliac disease Food storage Digestion Vomiting Cuisine of the Southern United States Mnemonic Capercaillie Domesticated turkey Sin City Clean animals Sausage Timeline of alternative rock Gastroparesis Healthy eating Sperm Whale Aztec Insulin Protein Time Out of Mind Domestic rabbit Salad Fingers Ramen Earthworm South Beach diet Cantonese cuisine Unclean animals Cuisine of Denmark Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism
