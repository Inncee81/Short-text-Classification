freeze dried vs dehydrated i want to know what the difference between the two are like as in with fruits jerky camping foods etc and also i'd like to know how each process is achieved with freeze dried the product is frozen and pressure is reduced then it is heated and the water turns directly into gas rather than melting to water and then evaporating this is sublimation dehydration involves just drying the product to reduce the water low enough so that no bacteria etc can grow so the water evaporates from the product Food preservation Carbon dioxide Freeze drying Dehydration Water vapor Water Instant coffee Evaporation Renewable energy Water (molecule) Hydrogen Phase (matter) Nitrogen Tofu Irrigation Lake Ammonia Casting Ocean thermal energy conversion Boiling point Dairy product Sulfuric acid Welding Polyethylene terephthalate Explosive material Fuel cell Desert Solar power Sewage treatment Autoclave Terraforming Sublimation (physics) Photosynthesis Acetic acid Autonomous building Brewery Sugar beet Phase transition Vacuum Fire extinguisher Nutrition Distillation Alcohol fuel Ethylene glycol Food Jerky (food) Energy development Incandescent light bulb Coffee Snowball Earth Temperature Haloalkane Fog Steam engine Milk Gas absorption refrigerator Freezing Ice cream Alternative biochemistry Cider Hiking Hydrogen peroxide Refrigeration Helium Sugar Climate of the United Kingdom Pebble bed reactor Hemp Fossil fuel power plant Ice Rice Dead Sea Tissue engineering Alkane Earth's atmosphere Kitchen Humidity Refrigerator Cheese Industrial process Water resources Common cold Compost Halitosis Weathering Hydrogen economy Portland cement Sodium chloride Polymerase chain reaction Ceramics Survival skills Thermoregulation Petroleum Breathing gas Thermostat Soy protein Bacteria
