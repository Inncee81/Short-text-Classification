i ate a piece of a cookie well my mom made chocolate peanut butter cookies and they came fresh out of the oven a few minutes ago i took a piece decided it was too big broke it and then just ate what was left in my hand when i looked down at the tray i realized that the smaller part of that piece the one that was not in my hand was smaller and i should've eaten that one instead now i'm feeling so guilty because i was being stupid and i should've checked the sizes first before sticking the piece in my mouth i'm feeling bad because i ate something unhealthy in a bigger portion than i could have easily had if i had just looked at the tray first don't worry about it i eat one chocolate chip cookie a day it is good to indulge every now and then hope this helps Cookie Oreo Chocolate Poker jargon Peanut butter The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Hamster Kodocha Idli M&M's Shaggy dog story Cookie Monster Sandwich McDonald's Snack food Bread Joke Houseplant Saint Nicholas Teen Girl Squad Cuisine of the Philippines The Life and Times of Juniper Lee 2000 Australian Grand Prix Coffee Girl Scout cookies Ron Weasley Cold Stone Creamery Kit Kat One Piece minor characters Bart Sells His Soul Food Chocolate Salty Balls Fecal incontinence Japanese cuisine Spidey Super Stories Mnemonic Pop-Tarts Eric Cartman Twix Plastic Happy Tree Friends Chopsticks Cigarette Smoking Man EastEnders Alice B.
