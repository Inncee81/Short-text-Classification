americans do you eat healthy what is your diet like i have a few american friends and it seems like they eat a lot of garbage seriously like tv dinners for breakfast lunch and dinner isnt that sick i mean to eat it once or twice a week for one meal is fine but to eat it like times a day every single day don't u think that is absolutely repulsive would you date a girl guy who eats garbage all the time or does it not matter i won't lie my diet could use some work however i do try to eat fresh fruit every day and when i eat fast food i tend to go for the healthier alternatives like grilled meat rather than fried when i go to taco bell i often get my food fresco style which means they use a salsa instead of cheese and fatty sauces i also try to limit my portions tacos or one burritos junior burger rather than double etc while my diet isn't ideal i must not be doing too bas since my cholesterol levels tend to be in the ideal range Hamburger Breakfast Veganism Sandwich MRE Fast-food restaurant Cuisine of Denmark Taco Vegetarian cuisine Vegetarianism French cuisine Meal In-N-Out Burger German cuisine Japanese cuisine French fries Food Atkins Nutritional Approach Cuisine of the Philippines Mexican cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States Healthy eating Egg (food) D__ner kebab Chipotle Mexican Grill Pizza Tomato Nutrition Fish and chips Low-carbohydrate diet Burrito Korean cuisine Jewish cuisine British cuisine Omega-3 fatty acid Cuisine of Malaysia Snack food Tooth Kebab Irish breakfast Taco Bell Obesity Organic food Fasting Domesticated turkey Cuisine of Argentina Full English breakfast Delicatessen Cuisine of Laos Trans fat Street food Hypoglycemia Dinner Bacon Cha chaan teng Bengali cuisine Coronary heart disease Food guide pyramid Raw food diet Binge eating disorder Hiberno-English Cuisine of Brazil American Chinese cuisine Rice pudding Oily fish Brain Brunch Quesadilla Hamster Chili con carne Cuisine of Singapore Milk Bread A&W Restaurants Vitamin C Barbecue Peruvian cuisine Cuisine of Vietnam Vegetarianism and religion Burger Cuisine of Africa Folic acid Tea (meal) Swedish cuisine Christmas worldwide Pork rind Cuisine of Thailand Kashrut Roman eating and drinking Lunch
