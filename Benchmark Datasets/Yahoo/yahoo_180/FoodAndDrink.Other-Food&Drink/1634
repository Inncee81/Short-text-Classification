i tried to freeze my water in the freezer then i took it out and it wasn't frozen popped the top and it froze in my hand what happend boy the answer is bouncing around in there but just won't pop out it is a basic principal of water chemistry physics okay the water cools loses energy in the freezer the as the density increase the water molecules align themselves to form a perfect matrix grid this is when the water expands to allow this alignment now i have three thoughts to the climax the popping of thebottle released the last bit of heat energy to a degree that the water could now freeze the popping also helped with molecular alignment this is my favorite nucleation site a tiny piece of ice caused a cascade effect in the water leading to its solid state perhaps was also required for the ice to form as well well i am not getting any chemistry books out so i await the answer Water (molecule) Temperature Refrigerator Phase (matter) Ice Explosive material Brewery Water Ice cream Vacuum Standard enthalpy change of fusion Chemistry Freezing Air conditioning Fog Sea ice Energy Glass Heat Weathering Computational chemistry Nuclear magnetic resonance Origin of life Hydrogen economy Corrosion Frost Entropy Solar cell Bong Supercooling Amorphous ice Alkane Physics Solar power Severe weather terminology (United States) Spacecraft propulsion Hydrogen Enzyme Microwave oven Polymer Moon Carbon Liquid crystal Robot Master Thermohaline circulation Molecular dynamics Glass transition temperature Nucleation Orbital hybridisation Autonomous building Hydrogen bond Energy level Ice core Vacuum tube Biochemistry Electron configuration Fast bowling Methane Alternative biochemistry Molecule Plasma (physics) Ice Ih Spectroscopy Planetary habitability Pressurized water reactor Nitroglycerin Hydrogeology Supernova Freezer Permian-Triassic extinction event Jennifer Lopez Atom Water vapor Items in the Metroid series Quantum computer Aurora (astronomy) Glacier Big Bang Cryonics Pebble bed reactor Aluminium Helium Food preservation Refrigeration Ice skating Science Quantum chemistry Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Equation of state Central processing unit Greenhouse effect Transformer Renewable energy Flood geology Sodium chloride Lightning Magnetic resonance imaging Viscosity
