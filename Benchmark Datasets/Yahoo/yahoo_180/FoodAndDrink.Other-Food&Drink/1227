why do poptarts come wrapped two in a pack do any of you like it that way the serving size is one even if you have someone else to eat one with you you probably want different flavors i don't know anyone who eats them both the second one always gets stale even if you put it in a ziploc bag i once emailed the poptart people to ask and they said our research shows that most of our consumers either eat both or split with another family member but that's back talking because people only do that because they don't want to see the poptarts go to waste i'm sure they'd prefer a prisintely wrapped one for the next day i can't believe those thin silver wrappers really cost that much more ya know i agree i never eat both and the other usually gets thrown away it goes to show ya these large companies are just out to save a buck well more like cents because like you said those cheap little wrappers don't cost that much Bread Domesticated turkey Tobacco Tofu Pop-Tarts Ramen Cigar Plastic bag Sushi Chocolate Peanut Dairy Hot dog Printed circuit board In-N-Out Burger Plastic Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fast food CPU cache Tea Dim sum Horse meat Cantonese cuisine Milk Potato chips Tootsie Pop Menstrual cup Fish and chips Chopsticks Coffee Cuisine of Denmark Digital photography Ice cream Movie theater Japanese cuisine Internet fraud Advance fee fraud Jute Korean cuisine Glutinous rice Yerba mate Poker jargon Futurama (TV series - season 5) T___t Sari Cuisine of Malaysia Outsourcing Solar cell Conker's Bad Fur Day Mattress Confidence trick Saint Nicholas Grid energy storage Homer Simpson Domestic goat Customs and etiquette of Japan United States dollar Illegal drug trade French cuisine The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Meal Sanitary towel Hip hop collaborations Pea soup The Best Page in the Universe Objective-C Planned obsolescence Natt__ Call centre Bento Cuisine of the Philippines ITunes Music Store America Online Live 8 Dow Chemical Company View camera Durian Calvin and Hobbes Pancake Japanese New Year Spanish verbs Local food Microeconomics Singlish Soba IPod Kit Kat Food storage Solar power Anorexia nervosa 50 Cent Banana Energy development Time Squad Game show Oreo Bulk vending Scuba set Bengali cuisine
