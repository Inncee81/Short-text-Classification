how do the resee cup guys get the peanut butter to be so powdery i mean the other day my mom comes home from the grocery store and she has resee peanut butter but when i opened it it was creamy and not powdery why if it's fresh it's suppossed to be creamy just not as creamy as when you put pb on bread if it's powdery it's dried out i hate them like that there's also another possibility reese has a new one with caramel and pb in chocolate the wrapper is the same except for saying caramel at the bottom front my son loves it but i don't care too much for all together you might have got that one w o realizing it as i tried my first one with all by accident but if you don't like the pb real creamy get the kind with no oil added it's texture isn't as crunchy as the reg crunchy pb but it's not as creamy as the kind you use on bread btw artificial stabilizers have to do with the shelf life the amt of oil used determines it's creaminess Peanut butter Cold Stone Creamery Breakfast Bread Kit Kat Coffee Cuisine of Brazil Chocolate Tofu Peanut Cuisine of the Philippines Ice cream Japanese cuisine Sandwich Dairy Cookie Hamster Cuisine of Denmark Chili con carne Maple syrup French cuisine M&M's Bengali cuisine Food science Cocoa Twix Butters Stotch Pizza Fecal incontinence Peanut butter and jelly sandwich Tobacco In-N-Out Burger Jewish cuisine Girl Scout cookies Cheesecake Peanuts The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Bagel Cream (food) Bacon Kraft Dinner Brewery Yerba mate Oreo Eric Cartman Fish and chips The Hershey Company Philadelphia, Pennsylvania SpongeBob SquarePants Yoplait Dumpling Recurring South Park characters French fries Gumbo Snickers Futurama (TV series - season 2) Microeconomics Curry Friends Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Soup Kyle Broflovski Barbecue Whole Foods Market Milk Cigarette Smoking Man Bubble tea Domesticated turkey Supermarket Serial comma Yoghurt Baking Cadbury Schweppes Paint E number Hey Arnold!
