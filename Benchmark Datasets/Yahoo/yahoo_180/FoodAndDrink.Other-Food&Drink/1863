why do onions make you cry they make me cry p when you slice through an onion you break open a number of onion cells some of these cells have enzymes inside of them and when they are sliced open the enzymes escape the enzymes then decompose some of the other substances that have escaped from sliced cells some of these substances amino acid sulfoxides form sulfenic acids which then quickly rearrange themselves into a volatile gas the gas reaches your eyes and reacts with the water that keeps them moist this changes the chemical's form again producing among other things a mild sulfuric acid which irritates the eyes the nerve endings in your eyes are very sensitive and so they pick up on this irritation this is why our eyes sting when we slice onions the brain reacts by telling your tear ducts to produce more water to dilute the irritating acid so the eyes are protected your other reaction is probably to rub your eyes but this will actually make the irritation a lot worse of course if you have onion juices all over your hands Ammonia Enzyme Biochemistry Sulfuric acid Hydrogen sulfide Acetic acid Formic acid Sulfur Explosive material Hydrogen Hydrochloric acid Riot control agent Insulin Eye Amino acid Alcohol Protein Origin of life Staining (biology) Acid Battery (electricity) Bread Poison Titanium Hypoglycemia Photosynthesis Tears Air pollution Paracetamol Neurotransmitter Carbon dioxide Chlorine Aspartame Hydrogen chloride Chemical reaction Alcohol fuel Creating chemical solutions Formaldehyde Nitric acid Flue gas desulfurization Hydrogen economy Energy development Silicon Ultraviolet Iron Citric acid cycle Natural gas Allergy Gastric acid Smoke-screen Nutrition Nutrient Psoriasis Ozone Coulometry Cracking (chemistry) Cyanocobalamin Bipolar disorder Glucose Francis Crick Dimethyl sulfoxide Alkane Signal transduction Transaminase Concentration Grasshopper Carnivorous plant Tay-Sachs disease Eczema Protein kinase Folic acid DNA repair Acid chloride Vitamin C Hydrofluoric acid Aniline Glucokinase Methanol Nitrogen Carboxylic acid Mitochondrial genetics Whole proteome analysis Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Sugar Limonene Use of poison gas in World War I Swern oxidation Radical (chemistry)
