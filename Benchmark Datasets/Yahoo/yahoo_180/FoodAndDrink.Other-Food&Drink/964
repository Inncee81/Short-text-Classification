aprox how much heavy whipping cream will it take to get oz or whipped topping and is cool whip measured by volume or weight thank you i mainly needed to know if cool whip was measured by weight or volume because a recipe called for cool whip but i like making my own so since its' measured by weight well thats helpful lol thanks oz whipping it doesn't add weight to it only volume cool whip is measured by weight additional this reminds me of when i took baking classes and a classmate had to sift some flour for a recipe she thought that sifting the flour would make it lighter so was wondering how much more flour she would need to add to it to compensate for that additional as a person below points out if you mean how much liquid heavy whipping cream would you need to whip in order to fill a ounce container used for dry measurements then that's a different story because then you are speaking of volume and not weight and the answer of ounces is about right between and ounces would do it Cooking weights and measures Cake Pancake Cream (food) Ice cream Cheesecake Coffee Milkshake Puff pastry Carbon dioxide Flour Brewery Bread U.S. customary units Volume Martini cocktail Helium Density Transformer Casting Ton Chocolate Japanese cuisine Alcoholic beverage Pizza Leather Gallon Explosive material Weighing scale Soy protein Potato Apple pie Golf club (equipment) Porosity Soup Motor oil Dim sum Tamale Meat analogue Temperature Cocoa Breastfeeding Whip Metrication Tank B__chamel sauce Mooncake Gumbo Cajun cuisine Food preservation Tea Curry Hamburger Idli Dumpling Campfire Tofu Car handling Imperial unit Alcohol fuel Paint Cuisine of Austria Pasta M16 (rifle) XML Cannabis (drug) Carburetor Waffle Handloading Nuclear fusion Vacuum Avalanche Relative humidity Butter Baking Cray-1 German cuisine Systems of measurement Engine cooling Ceramics Castlevania: Lament of Innocence Biscuit Cream puff Cuisine of Brazil Polish cuisine Russian cuisine Bagel Weight Ramen Milk Sand casting Internal ballistics Jewish cuisine Cold Stone Creamery Experiment French toast Custard Fried dough foods Atkins Nutritional Approach
