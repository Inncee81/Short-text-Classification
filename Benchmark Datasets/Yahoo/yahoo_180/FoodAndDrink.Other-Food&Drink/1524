question for chinese members feihe milk from american dairy i'm researching this company american dairy and wonder if anyone has experience with their feihe milk brand product in the p r c american dairy is a chinese company and their products are sold only in china if you have any personal experience with their milk soy or other products i'd like to hear about it things like have you heard of the feihe brand is it a well liked brand is it widely available throughout china do you like their products and i've heard parents in china have been using more milk products formula for children in recent years do you think this is true thanks for your response i am an american expat living in beijing i think i can offer a partial answer to your questions i am more familiar with fresh milk brands like san yuan yili and meng niu which now makes a deluxe milk that is overpackaged overpriced but very rich and tasty feihe specializes on powdered milk products i found some interesting info on their company off of reuters link provided below if you are researching them you have probably already seen this info i am not familiar with the brand but it would be helpful if i could see the chinese characters i may have purchased their walnut powders in the past as powdered walnut makes a nice hot cereal type snack but i can verify that milk products are indeed booming it's not traditionally a staple food but much milk consciousness was bolstered by the sponsorship by a milk manufacturer of the chinese version of idol a few years ago the show name translates clumsily into super voice girl or just super girl for short it was enormously popular and totally made meng niu the supercompany it is today there was already increased awareness of the possible health benefits of cow milk as an ethnic chinese of above average height i was informed repeatedly by local friends that my difference in size is because i drank milk growing up but super girl and meng niu really made the idea of drinking milk youthful fun hip and ubiquitous there are lots of milk related products commercially available in the local supermarkets of beijing many familiar to us in the west like skim and low fat milks flavored yoghurts and processed cheeses that make velveeta seem gourmet but there are also some new products specific to this market like milk candies and milk dietary supplements the latter is a kind of dried milk tablet i guess for people who don't actually like the taste or can't take the lactose of fresh milk i tried one once about as good as it sounds but as far as brand identity i would say that if advertising is any measure it would seem that the fresh milk brands have a much higher profile in beijing over powdered the china market however is enormous and it may be better to think of it as several markets rather than a single one for example although i can buy fresh flavored yoghurt fairly easily here in beijing if i were to go to say liaoning province a few hours away i might not be able to find any fresh milk products but i might be able to get the weird milk tablet supplement i would definitely be able to buy milk candies white rabbit which are a classic candy out of shanghai some brands which claim 'national distribution' or 'national recognition' will do so by just focusing on the top cities and urban areas where higher income brackets mean more bang for their marketing and distribution buck even if that amounts to a potential market of million people in the major cities alone there's still another billion yet to be reached i would guess that a powdered milk brand might not need to be top tier in beijing and shanghai to be a quality product with an astronomical customer base they may focus on delivering milk to markets that do not have refrigeration or drink enough of milk to warrant purchasing it fresh just my two cents or two fen hope this helps Ice cream Tea Vitasoy Breastfeeding Cheese Vegetarianism Advertising McDonald's
