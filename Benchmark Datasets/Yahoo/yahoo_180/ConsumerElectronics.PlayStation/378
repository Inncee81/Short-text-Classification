are ps games playable on a ps yes however because the ps uses software emulation to pretend its a ps or ps there are currently some games that may not run perfectly apparently sony decided it wasn't cost effective to include the chipset from a ps slimeline as originally planned hence the software emulation instead the good news is that it's mostly ps titles that are effected rather than ps and sony are constantly releasing firmware updates to gradually rectify this issue Nintendo Revolution Modchip PlayStation Portable Nintendo PlayStation 2 Apple Macintosh MAME PlayStation 3 Regional lockout Amiga Xbox Sound Blaster Nintendo DS MSX Emulator DVD Resident Evil (video game) IBM PC compatible Nintendo Entertainment System Sega ATI Technologies Sega Saturn History of computer and video games IPod Console emulator Wine (software) Maxis Verizon Wireless Tungsten Handheld Microsoft Linux Action Replay Microprocessor History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Descent (computer game) Commodore 64 Championship Manager Apple II family AmigaOS Super Nintendo Entertainment System Sega Dreamcast MMORPG Resident Evil Adventure game Copy protection Computer and video games Ultima Online Final Fantasy VI MIPS Magnum PlayStation (original) BIOS Game Boy Advance MIPS architecture Rootkit Patch (computing) Debugging Teletext Spider-Man (games) Sony Computer Entertainment Wipeout (game) ZX Spectrum GP2X Xbox 360 Abandonware Atari ST Mac OS X Microsoft Windows Game Boy Apple Intel transition Blu-ray Disc Anti-virus software Platform game Final Fantasy II SAM Coup__ Commodore International Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII CD-i Final Fantasy VII Computer software Nintendo 64 Mega Man Legends Mozilla Firefox Enhanced remake Homebrew (video games) Rambus Colecovision Sensible Soccer Universal Media Disc GBA Movie Player FireWire Doom Rare (video game company) Half-Life Intellivision Game demo TiVo TurboGrafx 16 NVIDIA Berkeley Software Distribution
