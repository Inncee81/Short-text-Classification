how many of you like the legend of zelda twilight princess i'm thinking about buying it for gamecube and i want to know what you thought of it legend of zelda twilight princess is my favorite game ever it's also my first zelda game i played it on the wii but the gc version has the same graphics sounds story etc just that the both versions are mirror images of each other so if you're on wii the desert is on the east side of hyrule but on gc the desert would be on the west same thing with items in the maps even midna's helmet covers her left eye in gc and her right eye in wii i love twilight princess for these reasons awesome storyline the detail is great the characters are great and the twilight realm is an awesome addition to the loz world wolf link is also really cool as is midna great graphics although it's a cube title it shows that a system doesn't need to have a cell chip or some burn a hole in the floor if not properly cooled graphics processor to render nice graphics the texturing is really what does it for tp awesome controls though you won't get the full experience in gc but the wii controls fit a zelda game perfectly from slashing swords to aiming arrows woah i used some literary junk there and i hate english class the wiimote does it all great music and sound effects the music brings back some oot songs though since tp was my first zelda game i didn't recognize it until after when i played oot in an emulator i want to get it for vc though and the sound effects are great overall twilight princess is the best game you'll ever play unless you already have oot set in your mind as the best game ever it might only be second best but in my opinion tp beats oot i'd definitely get it even if you get it for gc Link (Legend of Zelda) The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time The Legend of Zelda series characters The Legend of Zelda series enemies Ganon The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time characters The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask The Legend of Zelda The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time places Legend of Zelda series songs Koji Kondo Zelda II: The Adventure of Link Super Mario 64 Hyrule BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask characters Nintendo 64 Nintendo Revolution Sacred Realm Fire Emblem Alan Moore Master Sword RuneScape Super Smash Bros.
