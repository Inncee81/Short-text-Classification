xbox or ps i need to know which one to get within the next month or so ive seen price drops on both and ps and to tell you the truth price isnt an issue i own a ps and a ps so it almost makes sense to get a ps since ive been a fan since day ive played the and i just cant get used to it dont get me wrong the graphics are freakin sweet especially in hd but does the ps have more to offer will it look better in hd than the also im a sports fan and ive tried nba live on the and the gameplay feels waaay too slow the response time was sooo frustrating because for instance you hold down b to shoot the ball there's a lag from when you release the button to when the player shoots the damn thing almost always resulting in a missed basket i gave up on it as a sports racing fan instant response time is vital to playing the game which system will wow me i kno people will give me opinions as to which system is the best and honestly i dont need the ps sucks xbox rules or vice versa type of crap i just want some intelligent comparisons between the two so if youre here to rant about which one sucks dont bother then again some people are just idiots and will do just that for points spare me ask yourself do you ever plan on having an hd television if you do not already bluray already has shown to be the favorite amongst studios developers rental industries fans save yourself some time and aggrivation not to mention money and buy the complete package ps people use the fact that has more games well of course if you want to wait a year from now then see who has more games its going to be the same its common sense and i think the systems will coexist but for my money i want the most advanced game system bluray and the sixaxis is pretty sweet too to tell you teh truth i dont remember the rumble ever being a part of the fun of playing a game besides people started saying it lead to arthritis or something around ' probably isnt true but regardless i began turning off rumble since then i just dont like the tactics of ms they are losing so much money on the xbox in order to get the system out in people homes well i dont want to be persuaded to buy a system because it is if i can buy one for with all the bells and whistles i know sony is losing money as well but at least i get more is all im saying id love to have the but as someone put it its more of a xbox meaning it obviously is advanced but its like they just threw a bunch of the same technology in the same area instead of introducing new and advanced technology exclamation innovation ps Computer and video games Sega Nintendo Poker jargon Counter-Strike Xbox Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 NBA Finals First-person shooter Game controller Nintendo GameCube Major League Baseball television contracts Craps Bubble Bobble Kurt Angle Pure Pwnage Sega Dreamcast Console wars PlayStation 2 Final Fantasy Mouse (computing) Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Pinball Wheel of Fortune Gradius Grand Theft Auto III IBM PC compatible 2000 Australian Grand Prix Baseball Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Computer role-playing game Ives Manufacturing Company Nintendo Revolution Handheld game console American football Electronic Arts Rare (video game company) Twisted Metal Norway national football team Conker's Bad Fur Day Jack Thompson Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Nintendo 64 FIFA Series Game programmer Theory of conduct Monkey Island Resident Evil National Football League ATI Technologies New York Knicks Pump It Up Ecco the Dolphin Nintendo DS Queen (band) EverQuest Double Dragon Intellivision Michael Jordan Time Out of Mind Monopoly (game) Advanced Squad Leader Golden Age of Arcade Games Spider-Man (games) DVD NVIDIA Tag Legacy of Kain Guilty Gear Perfect Dark History of computer and video games New York Giants Yao Ming Quake III Arena Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 The Joker's Wild Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Wave Race: Blue Storm Paintball SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Softball Sega Saturn Chrono Trigger The Amazing Race Chicago White Sox Hollywood Squares Dance Dance Revolution MMORPG Shaquille O'Neal Deus Ex: Invisible War Four square Basketball
