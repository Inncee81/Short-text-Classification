harry potter and the chamber of secrets in ps i need a really good guide that helps you beat the game step by step i am stuck on how to get out of aragog's lair please help me once you start small spiders will jump from aragog's web to where you're standing and attack you blast them and proceed down the ramp in front of you if you turn to the right the ramp keeps going down and ends at a treasure chest with a chocolate frog in it take the frog and climb back up then follow the trail around the trees down in a corner of the next large area is a treasure chest with a wizards card get it then burn the webbing on the wall opposite the chest and go through up on a cliff you have to jump to is a chest with another chocolate frog in it get it if you need it then continue on you'll come to a cliff with spitting spiders on the far side of a pit to your left you'll find aragog and his web burn the corner of it and he'll send more small spiders to where you are deal with them and move on past where you just burnt his web climb up the large stairs and burn the next section of his web he'll send more small spiders over move on through and you'll see a split in the trail caused by a pit in the ground take the left hand side killing spitting spiders as you go until you come to the end of the path you now have to jump across the pit onto the other side clear it of spiders first then make the leap a few steps to the left and you'll be at another pit jump to the platform on the left and then walk to the back of it you can climb up back here to find a chest with a wizards card get it then slowly climb back down the cliff you just came up jump across to the next area and burn the web blocking the way in this next room you'll see a bunch of strands of web running from above you to the ground if you touch one a spider will race down it and attack you the music will also stop and you can hear harry's heartbeat also as soon as you kill one of the spiders on the ground one will drop from above to replace it move along the right side of the room and then walk across the branch to the left side when you reach it you can use the zoom buttons to see the strands of webbing in the air so you don't run into them getting off the log is hard because there are webs connected to the far end of it run through them turn right when you hit the wall then turn left and run up the ramp to a treasure chest turn and kill any of the spiders that are following you alternatively if you have steady fingers you can try and sneak through the webs without disturbing them it's possible but hard to do in the chest is a chocolate frog now proceed back to where the large web blocks your path and burn it to proceed in the tunnel you'll come across a chest with another chocolate frog in it burn the web to the left of the chest and keep walking along you're now far below aragog's web and a new type of spider is on the cliffs ahead it's silver and will spit a paralyzing attack at you kill it and the others off quickly then move past where they were you'll come across another web barrier to be burnt out of your way go past it and move up the hill to another chocolate frog in a box get it and continue moving up the hills at the top are a bunch of puffapods and part of aragog's web on your right burn it and kill the small spiders that jump over to you stand were the webbing was and kill the spiders on the cliff to your right then remove the puffapods blocking your progress you'll now have to creep along a narrow ledge on the wall once on the other side kill the spiders in the room and proceed up the ramp on the outside wall burn the piece of aragog's web kill his spiders he sends and move to the next room kill the spiders on the wall and look for the chest to your right hidden in the bushes with a chocolate frog in it hidden in the bushes in front of that chest is another one this time with a wizards card get them and burn the final piece of aragog's web the web will no longer be able to support his weight and aragog will fall into the pit as harry stands there watching the rock ledge he's standing on gives way and he tumbles down as well you're now trapped at the bottom of the pit with aragog who isn't very happy he'll charge at you and stomp on the ground to send out a shockwave that will knock you over he will also spit poison once he's taken enough damage the only spell that will hurt him is incendio and he has to be rearing back on his hind legs exposing his belly to be hit when you hit him there's a chance of a sac of items beans wizard treats etc falling down or a spider might fall from above and attack you cast incendio to break the sac and get the items every other hit aragog will pace along the outside of the room before roaming around it again after eleven hits aragog will charge harry but ron will show up in the flying ford and get harry out after you're back on hogwart's grounds hit x in your rememberall to end the day detailed
