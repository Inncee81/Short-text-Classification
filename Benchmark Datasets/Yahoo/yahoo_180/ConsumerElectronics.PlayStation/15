why won't my pokemon gold version save even when i save it it says new game but it's weird bexause sometimes it says continue but i don't want to get too far in the game becasue i m not sure it will save surely it's happened in my crystal version too please help me fix this promblem ok the answer here is that the games battery has run dry the game uses a battery to keep the save data memory active when youre not playing it when this battery gets low or runs dry it is unable to store its save data anymore it is possible to replace the battery but you have to take it into an electronics store i took mine into a battery store and hope that they have the right battery it needs p s please make sure you post your questions in the right category Game Boy Missingno.
