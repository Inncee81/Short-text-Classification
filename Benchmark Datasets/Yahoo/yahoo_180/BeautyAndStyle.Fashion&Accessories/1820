do you let your clothes make who you are or do you feel confident when you are wearing really nice things be honest i know i do very unfortunately when i don't feel very confident sometimes i look down on my purse and it's like a confident booster all of a sudden but i never buy something just because it says dolce and gabana or derek lam across the chest or anything to logo y for that nature that's too much for me personally i know it must sound pretty awful that my clothes make me feel good or even better than someone somtimes but i just want to know if anyone feels the same sometimes looking nice is a confidence booster but not necessarily the price tag on what i'm wearing nice clothes clothes with popular labels helps me feel more appealing to everyone else but ultimately i know i am what i make myself clothes look nice and help me look nice but the label and style is jest a reflection of where the clothing was purchased my confidence isn't from what i wear i'm just self confident by nature but i defiantly like looking nice i could look good in any style so its really just a question of where i want to buy things from but i think girls have a different take on why they buy certain things since in general they like brands that cost them or rather their parents more money although that is just western standards of beauty class and wealth clothing and other things become reflections of that Clothing Boy Scouts of America Barbara Boxer Canadian Tire Hulk Hogan Blackshirts Darfur conflict American Red Cross Darfur Comic Relief Gurkha Contingent Heavy metal fashion Adidas Traumatic brain injury Official Monster Raving Loony Party Everton F.C.
