my vans slip on shoes i just got a pair from an online store they seem to be a tad bit tight and i was wondering if they'll stretch a little to make the shoe more ''breathable'' i just don't want to go through the hassle of shipping them back for an exchange for the next half size yeah all shoes are like that at first you need to break in them which will probably take about a week so just have fun with your vans for now HyperText Transfer Protocol Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
