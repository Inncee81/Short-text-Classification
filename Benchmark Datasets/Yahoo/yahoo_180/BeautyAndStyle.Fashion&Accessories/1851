if you are in high school please answer i'm going into high school soon i will be going back to school shopping for school supplies pretty soon too lol p i'm not sure what is the easiest way to organize everything a binder for each class one binder for all how to carry everything around a back pack just to carry homework and to and from school a tote bag to carry throughout the day i'm really cofused i want the easiet way to keep everything organized last year i was pretty unorganized so i want to be more organzied this year any tips thanks i think i'm gonna get some ring binders for each class then put in them some of those notebooks with folders in them they sell them at staples then i don't always have to carry the binder around just the notebook but i will have to carry the binder some of the time i'm probably gonna use a backpack and put it in my locker then i will get a tote and use that day to day class to class and put everything i need in it then at the end of the day i will put the tote in my locker and empty my h w and whatnot into my backpack to complete at home the reason i will use both is because a backpack will hold alot more than a tote and is more comfortable in the morning to lug all my studying books to school than in a tote i suggest to get both i don't think im gonna get that hurley bag because in total it will be like just for a bag and tote so i will probably get just a normal back pack Converse (company) Poker jargon Shoe Chuck Taylor (salesman) Married... with Children Sneakers (film) High-heeled shoe Footwear HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Andy Warhol Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Bubble Bobble New York Giants Paul Is Dead Counter Chess strategy and tactics Gerhard Berger Athletic shoe Irish dance Bon Jovi Apache HTTP Server The McGuire Sisters Keith Richards Texas hold 'em Leaf Pachypodium brevicaule Wheel of Fortune Breakdancing Girly Chuck Jones Phoebe Buffay's songs National Football League Lore Pachypodium baronii Physical attractiveness Hiberno-English Chuck Berry Cliff Richard Whose Line Is It Anyway?
