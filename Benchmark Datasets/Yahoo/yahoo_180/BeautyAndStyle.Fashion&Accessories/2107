what shirts go best with khakis and solid black dress boots i wear khakis and kenneth cole reaction dress boots solid black i typically wear dress shirts or polo shirts only solid colors and only button ups i'm wondering what color of shirt would look striking with this combination and if you happen to think black boots are a no no with khakis then go ahead and answer for wheat brown since i also have timberlands just please make sure to clarify which color you're commenting on and thank you i wanted to mention that i'm ' '' white and i have brown eyes and dark brown hair that looks black oh yes and so far everyone sounds like fashion experts i e they don't agree dark colors would be the best to go with khakis and your black boots i think a solid white may work also but nothing like bright red blue green like lime or yellow green or yellow for polos you could probably do navy black brown white tan and perhaps green colors like navy maroon green will probably work better with brown shoes for dress shrits i think maroon navy black white beige or green will work fine in general i would just say to stick with the darker colors Kimono Kilt HyperText Transfer Protocol Suit (clothes) Uniform Resource Locator Shoe Bangle Bon Jovi Tour de France Gothic Lolita Vehicle registration plate World Wide Web Clothing Gucci Reservoir Dogs Earring Heavy metal fashion Drag racing PlayStation 2 Uniform Resource Identifier Bracelet Rail tracks Japanese tea ceremony Nakoruru (Samurai Shodown) Escalator Pink Floyd discography Nintendo Revolution Nintendo DS Milan IMG (business) Web server Social aspects of clothing Chair HTTP cookie Tariq Ali Black tie Watch Suede (band) James McNeill Whistler Singapore Police Force Sock Climbing equipment JPEG Jim Steranko Nintendo GameCube Squid cache Point of sale Coffee Lance Armstrong Death rock fashion Sega Dreamcast Mattress Bondage (BDSM) Oasis (band) Tincture (heraldry) PlayStation Portable Domain Name System IPod Xbox 360 Troll Firozabad Money Dunman High School Fashion design Barbie Resident Evil 4 Gaia Online Taunton, Massachusetts The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Yoanna House De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter Punk fashion Drill bit Codename: Kids Next Door Silver Patent The Penultimate Peril Slash (punctuation) Skinhead Metal Gear Solid My Little Pony Software patents under the European Patent Convention Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Mid-levels Zipper Nunchaku Hyperinflation Diving suit Gyoji Meryl Silverburgh Air Jordan Hill tribe Mozilla Firefox Andre Agassi Tea Mario Knitting Bicycle Electronic commerce
