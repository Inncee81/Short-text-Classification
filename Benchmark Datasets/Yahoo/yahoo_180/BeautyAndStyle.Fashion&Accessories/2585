what should i wear on my first day of freshman year im years old and im starting my freshman year im a little over and sorta average body type not too skinny but not too fat i wear pretty much anything but i need help with a look that fits with my casual style sorta like jeans with a pair of chucks converse hopefully someone can help me by choosing a cute top im open to any suggestions i wanna start out my high school year with a new fashion sense thanks a lot you're exactly like me p my casual style is skinny jeans with chucks and im totally lost on what to wear for first day i'll try and help you though for myself i've pretty much set down the same idea as you jeans and chucks i've also been thinking of a top to wear i've ruled out band shirts i mean unless you wear them practically everyday then of course thats perfect for you but i wear them every once in a while and would prefer to go for something more 'cute' i guess i was thinking a cute tanktop would be good not to show too much cleavage or to give the wrong idea just a basic cute tank also i've been leaning towards hte idea of skinny jeans flats long shirt with beads i'm obsessed with that style right now perhaps if you want to start your high school year with some new things how about getting a haircut or highlights i know i probably didnt help much but still good luck Suit (clothes) Kilt Jeans Skirt and dress Punk fashion Social aspects of clothing Bob Jones University Coat (clothing) Trousers Clothing Skinhead Undergarment Clothing terminology Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
