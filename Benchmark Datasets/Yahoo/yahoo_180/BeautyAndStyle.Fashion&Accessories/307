what would look nice on me i am years old i run cross country track and i dance hip hip like a crazy woman i am pounds at ' my measurments are i am african american and i have a large backside i have a flat tummy and nice arms my thighs are muscular and i have nice legs my dad used to choose out my clothes so i really need some ideas on what fashions and stores to try please i have i want to have a good idea of what would possibly be flattering lol you already asked this and i already answered here it is again i'm rather like that only shorter and i don't quite have the flat tummy yet lol okay here we go as far as pants go stay away from skinny jeans you might want to kill me for this but it makes everyone's hips and thighs and backside appear larger which is fine if you are a six foot size zero model with no hips on your pants make sure the back has pockets and that the pockets don't have flaps this helps with the backside trust me i am a pro at this skirts are great just not tiny miniskirts as they can make your backside look larger same with short shorts for tops you will have to do more of your own picking if you love it go for it given your measurements i would go with at least a couple of deep v necks with camisoles underneath they create a great balance the camisole part is important for shoes don't get heels higher than two inches because you are already quite tall flats are great and they are in style this fall as far as the money don't think that because you have a lot of money that you can buy more expensive stuff quality yes high price just because of the brand no jeans should be under and most tops under target kohl's j c penney forever and payless will give you more for your money than name brand mall outlets without compromising quality obviously if you love the name brand stuff you ought to get some things from there but not the majority remember to leave lots of money for accessories they can completely transform an outfit whatever you buy make sure that you love it don't just buy something because someone else said to including me lol i hope this has helped good luck Equine conformation Undergarment Aerial (dance move) Skateboarding trick Trousers Strap-on dildo Mattress Skirt and dress Professional wrestling holds Shoe Figure skating Skinhead Shirt Buttocks Professional wrestling attacks Sears Holdings Corporation Swingout High-heeled shoe Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Piledriver (professional wrestling) Chair Dragon Booster Brewery Glossary of ballet terms Mutual fund Glossary of partner dance terms Guitar Billiards Tesco O scale Marching band Microeconomics View camera Triathlon Double bass Textile manufacturing Gross domestic product Married... with Children Escape from New York Physical attractiveness Professional wrestling aerial techniques Clothing Kimono Knife Breaststroke Tyrannosaurus rex Belly dance Fashion design Jeans Horse Social aspects of clothing Paragliding Inflation Theory of conduct Dial M for Murder Nintendo Care Bears Professional wrestling throws Phoebe Buffay's songs Clown Journey (band) The Shining (film) Binoculars Teen Girl Squad Lionel Corporation Gramophone record Jennifer Lopez World Championship Wrestling Boxing Suit (clothes) Japanese tea ceremony Advertising Bicycle Miniskirt Bob Jones University Fast bowling The McGuire Sisters Softball Little Britain Supply and demand Baseball Stars Scale model Mr. Olympia Stocking African American Vernacular English Empire Burlesque Upholstery Lindy Basic Mario Bonfires of Saint John
