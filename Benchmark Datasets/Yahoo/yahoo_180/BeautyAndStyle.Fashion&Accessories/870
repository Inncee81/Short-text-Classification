do girls realize how ridiculous this is i think its really stupid looking when i not only see a girl jack her pants half way up her back but also when they sit down put the hand on their lower back and then yank their shirt down oh but it gets worse they'll grab away at the back of their pants and pull up some more till its 's of the way up their back it think its ridiculous and funny when girls get mad if the put a rip in their shirt or pants doing this i know why they do it but my opinion is if your worried about it showing then dont wear it dont get pissed and start screaming and complaining when something shows hmmm you're way too observant before people would complain about girls pants being too low and g strings sticking out now this poor girls no wonder why its hard to have good self esteem too much criticism something will always be complained about Beavis and Butt-head SpongeBob SquarePants Ripped Pants I Am Furious Yellow Aerial (dance move) The Shining (film) Garfield Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Trailer Park Boys Eric Cartman Shaggy dog story Newcastle United F.C.
