what's up with all the make me an outfit questions from people who shop at a f and hollister don't you think they would at least know how to make themselves look good without other people's help if they're going to pay so much for their clothes i don't see the point of buying those clothes if they're just going to make themselves look bad it's just a waste of money they're spending all that money on clothes to look so 'fabulous' when they can't even make themselves one outfit what are they going to do when yahoo answers gets sick of making them outfits for every day of the year does anyone else agree with me mrs zac efron if i could check your questions i'm sure i would find a question reading make me an outfit for the first day of school i won't even mention how rude that was but if you can make your own outfits why do you ask everyone else to do it for you rude much two get a life 's in only one question you can not seriously tell me that all of you that have been asking those questions can make your own outfits i've seen some questions that say is this cute if not can you edit it so it will look cute and a blind person could probably make a better outfit than some of them i've seen kar thank you for being so polite because obviously some people could have disagreed the way you did get a life so rude i don't really care but i am curious and tired so asking questions keeps me up and about and it's just something to do i sometimes wonder if these teen girls asking for outfits are actually pinstripe suited middle aged men who work in advertising and see this as a very insidious method of free advertising it gets the eyeballs of their target market demographic looking intensely at their website it gets the kids they want to sell to thinking about their clothes and maybe they get the ultimate pay off moment of hey that's cute i need it i should buy it now maybe this is a very subtle way for advertisers to manipulate their market maybe this is a very clever form of spam and maybe this is just a new form of playing dress up instead of paper doll cut outs and making scrap books from old magazines and catalogues or trying on everything in mom's closet it's a way for kids with a common intrest to share their interest i'm reasonably certain that these kids aren't buying everything they see in these outfit discussions it's mostly harmless and they aren't doing anything illegal Little Britain 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Ashlee Simpson Show Avenue Q Pitaten Skinhead Jesuit College Preparatory School Jean Charles de Menezes Friends Mario Ed, Edd n Eddy Teen Girl Squad Shirt Student EastEnders Chuck Cunningham syndrome Barbie Good Morning, Vietnam Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Extreme Programming Undergarment Kodocha Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga The Devil Wears Prada Care Bears Theory of conduct The Contender (television series) Napoleon Dynamite The Chemical Brothers Mnemonic Figure skating The Warriors Doctor (Doctor Who) Animal Crossing Humphrey Bogart Heavy metal fashion George Costanza Bob Jones University Poker jargon Quizbowl FoxTrot About a Boy History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Blood on the Tracks Big Brother (USA TV series) Education in the United States Ultimate X-Men The Strangerhood Jennifer Lopez One Tree Hill (TV series) The Beach Boys Teacher's Pet (Disney) The Apprentice 2 The Fairly OddParents Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Texas A&M University Suit (clothes) Family Feud Unreal Okashina Okashi RuneScape quests The Wotch Great Teacher Onizuka Bomberman Harrow School Salad Fingers Bonus Stage Shaggy dog story Boy Meets World The Emancipation of Mimi Neighbours Spontaneous human combustion New York Giants The Star Wars Holiday Special AFI 100 Years series Aerial (dance move) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Tic-Tac-Dough Texas A&M University Corps of Cadets My Life as a Teenage Robot Time Out of Mind Double Dragon School uniform GED Hollywood Squares Sydney Riot of 1879 Redneck Bicycle lighting Buddy Guy Montreal Canadiens Pure Pwnage Paul Is Dead
