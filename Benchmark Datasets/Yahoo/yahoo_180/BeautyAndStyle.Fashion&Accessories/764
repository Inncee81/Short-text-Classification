women do you would you wear trousers in order to look attractive when i was a girl i used to wear my older brothers' old shorts to play in and the fact that they had had good use out of them and they were still fit for me to wear shows that you don't need teflon coating on children's clothes but my father out a stop to that when i was about thirteen and looking back i am glad for it i certainly would not have been allowed jeans nor were my brothers even for play i never liked trousers on a women even an expensive trouser suit and have i never worn such as an adult these days many young women think it smart to go out in jeans and some even wear men's underwear boxer shorts are they afraid of their femininity policewomen and others may wear trousers so did the land army women during the war but off duty you can be sure that they dress as women what is the problem with celebrating what we are rather than aspiring to be like men as regards dress and in other things too well my mother did buy me a pair of shorts to replace those i had been wearing but they were girl's shorts and i turned my nose up at them much to my cost as i was marched back to the shop to exchange them for socks and underwear with a spanked bottom for being ungrateful the point is that at that age i wanted wear my brothers' shorts to be like the boys my father saw that and put a stop to it and i am glad for it i still think that trousers are seen as men's wear even subconsciously hence the 'phrase who wears the trousers and in that figurative sense i did in my house i have already accepted that trousers for certain types of job are fine but that is not a case of trying to look good just practical workwear i personally think a woman can look very feminine and sexy in trousers or a business suit you just have to girl it up a bit a silk and lace cami underneath some nice jewelry and some killer heels and she can look hotter than a girl wearing a dress hands down times have definately changed and it is totally acceptable for women to wear jeans pants shorts whatever they want i have different looks for different things sexy dresses for nights out with my husband pants and suits for work khaki pants and button up shirts for casual days and then i have jeans shorts capris for when i'm playing with my kids there is a time and place for everything Trousers Undergarment Social aspects of clothing Suit (clothes) Skirt and dress Jeans Cross-dressing Buttocks Skinhead Black tie Kilt Characters in the Smurfs Kimono Shirt Gender role Marilyn Monroe Jackass: The Movie Cowboy Beachwear Nudity Shoe Knots Landing SpongeBob SquarePants Tightlacing Humphrey Bogart Clothing Mess dress Shorts Coat (clothing) Swimsuit School uniform Trailer Park Boys Little Britain Kimberly-Clark Corporation Singapore Police Force Spanking Irish dance Drag (clothing) Boy Scouts of America One Tree Hill (TV series) Diving suit Court dress Infantilism Professional wrestling slang Textile manufacturing terminology Figure skating The Contender (television series) Leggings Morning dress Jesuit College Preparatory School About a Boy Waistcoat Boxer shorts Friends Japanese tea ceremony Gay slang Bart Simpson Hasidic Judaism Breeches Beavis and Butt-head Social rule Sock Sea Scouts (BSA) EastEnders Sento Breeches role Hazing Plastic Jam (TV series) Aerial (dance move) Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Culture of the United States Softball Woman Married... with Children Harmony, Minnesota The Fast Show Ed, Edd n Eddy Wonder Woman (television series) Cliff Richard Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Ranma __ characters Boxing Spidey Super Stories Brassiere Comanche Debra Marshall The Devil Wears Prada Customs and etiquette of Japan Sin City Sharon Tate Gurkha Contingent Overall Totally Spies!
