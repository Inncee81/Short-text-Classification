working at abercrombie and fitch hi i start working at a f in my hometown on saturday but on aug i'm moving two hours away for college i feel really bad about applying so late and i don't think they know i'm leaving i'd like to work during the winter and spring holidays and maybe even next summer how should i handle this situation also i'm a little bit confused about the initial discount details do i just pick stuff out that's on the mannequins the conflict is not between me working there and going to college of course i am going to college i'm asking for people with experience at a f what to do here since i want to work there during school holidays ok as far as the working situation all stores are different but where my sister works the managers are really friendly and if you just talk to them and explain the situation they will probably let you still work for them my sister said there are actually several people at her store that go to college out of state and just work during the summer when schools out they will probably be happy you are willing to stay at their store especially during the hectic winter holidays as for the discount i believe as a new hire you get like off certain items and off all items throughout the store ask your manager for a print out of the off items good luck hope this helped Daylight saving time Animal Crossing Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
