why is everyone so against fake brands i mean honestly there's nothing wrong with someone who doesn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a purse or a shirt or shoes or something they're the smart ones who don't spend massive amounts of money on something frivolous i don't get why you're looked down upon if you have a fake or knockoff lv or chanel bag or something my friend's like that she loves vera bradley and when she sees bags that have similar designs she's like 'ew very fradleys ' i don't get it just because you have more money doesn't make you superior so get over yourself i totally agree i mean as long as the thing is really cute not messed up feels and works good it dosn't matter if it's fake or not not all of us have the kind of money to spend on all that brand name stuff most of it isn't even better quality ok maybe once in a while we can afford to treat ourselves with something expensive but not all the time like some people and there is no need for people to brag about it i also don't get why people are against buying clothes at like wet seal charlotte russe macys marshalls jc penny platos closet and cheaper places than like abercrombie hollister ralph lauren etc i mean as long as its totally cute and fits good i dont see a problem with it people just like spending extra money so they can feel superior to others it makes them feel special or something honestly i don't care if its brand name i dont understand why people spend so much when they could get a fake one that looks exactly the same for soooo much less so i agree wit ya Friends Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Microeconomics Gucci The nature of God in Western theology Shit Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
