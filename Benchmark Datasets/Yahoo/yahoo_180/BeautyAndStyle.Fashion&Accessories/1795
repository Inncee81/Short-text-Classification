designer clothing sizes for men are designer clothing sizes smaller than regular sizes i know that with women this is more of a problem but is a or a on a brand like diesel the same as it would be on levi's and what about through the leg k well i went through a designer phase and now i wear levi's albeit washing them with a whole bottle of fabric softener and some sandpaper goes a long way so i know about this but generally levi's are regular rise so they sit at the waist whereas most designer stuff is low rise so it sits below the waist the sizes are the same but it depends how you want it to fit designer jeans are going to be softer and more well fitted so you can buy a smaller waist without feeling uncomfortable but no generally designer stuff is not necessarily smaller when it comes to men's most people buy designer stuff in smaller sizes is why you see guys wearing them tighter Jewellery Earring Bulk vending Wedding ring Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Jewellery Quarter Strap-on dildo Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom Glossary of climbing terms Caller ID Sponge Fractal Headphones Stairway Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) The Hobbit M1 Garand Birmingham Pearl Diamond Lawn mower RuneScape skills BS 1363 Canon T90 Oscilloscope PC Engine Ocean's Twelve Trish Stratus Art Nouveau Electric guitar Skateboard Akatsuki (Naruto) Hope Diamond Bread Shadow the Hedgehog (video game) Parachute RuneScape weapons Sanitary towel Repeating rifle Connecting rod MSN Messenger Condom 2nd Ring Road (Beijing) CD and DVD packaging M60 machine gun Dollar store Maximum Exposure Lighting Tag team Abbey Road Studios Dinghy Pump It Up Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Wodeyar Jewel (singer) Apollo Guidance Computer Turbocharger Wok Speedloader Sega Dreamcast Gemstone Gymnastics Prince Albert piercing Irish Crown Jewels Sea-Monkey Bling-bling Nintendo GameCube Mouse (computing) Boxer shorts Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Google Business-to-consumer electronic commerce One Ring Rail tracks Boots Group Scalable Vector Graphics Market Snowboard Horse tack Sumo Ultimate X match Crown jewels Dad's Army Boxing Middle-earth Pocket knife Seismometer IPod Professional wrestling match types French Crown Jewels Clipping (computer graphics) Papa Lazarou My Girl (song) Acorn Electron Wrestlecrap All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship Fuse (electrical) Little Britain Archery Sonar
