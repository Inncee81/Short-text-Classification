boy clothes help so this morning my grandmother who is raising my year old cousin called and asked my sister to go school shopping with them she figured that we would be able to give him an idea of what high school boys wear he's going into his freshman year i'm a sophomore and my sister is a junior in college i wasn't really sure what to get so i texted my boyfriend my cousins and basically everyone in my cell phone contacts i got back a lot of answers like jeans and t shirts obviously but he's really afraid of being considered either a dork or gay we ended up getting him pairs each of blue and black jeans t shirts with sayings or pictures on them and button up shirts to wear over them he tried them on when we got back to the house and they looked really good on him he was also very happy with our choices the reason i picked out this sort of clothing is because it's what the popular guys wore last year so my question are these clothers poser ish or are they good ok some more info that i should have added before thanx for the answers btw i tried to get him into polo's that was a no go what are chucks he has a fleece vest that he likes and he'll probably wear that i think he'll be fine i've been helping my older brother pick out clothes going to be a senior in hs and picked out pretty much the same things instead of black we got light jeans but that could just be whats in where we live basically if he likes and will wear the clothes he can't really go wrong this is what i always ask myself when helping to pick out clothes if i saw a guy walking down the hall in them would i think he looked good forget he's your cousin for like seconds and really think about it works every time lol good luck Jewellery Wedding ring Diamond Engagement ring Gold Jennifer Lopez White gold Money Hip hop fashion Filigree RuneScape weapons Platinum Wedding Precious metal Gold album Iron Cross Body piercing Legion of Merit We Belong Together Star Alliance Collar (BDSM) RIAA certification Pearl Mand__ Evening gown Order of Canada Wedding anniversary Metal Ace of Base Amway Black tie Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles U.S. ten-dollar bill Team Rocket Marie Antoinette Colours, standards and guidons Silver United States dollar Platinum group Order of the Bath Bracelet Power Rangers Green Lantern Lhoba Barbra Streisand British coinage Titanic (1997 film) Barbie Pikachu Mithril Class ring KISS (band) Piranha Mr. T Royal Canadian Mint Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Pope Jewish view of marriage RuneScape skills Archery Michelle Kwan Niddah Barbell (piercing) Noble metal Fiddler on the Roof White wedding Group 11 element Green Day Aka (tribe) Collectibles in Bionicle Astronaut Badge De Beers Order of Orange Nassau TLC 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships Shen Gong Wu Order of the British Empire Rainbow flag One Ring Palladium Pyrite Arleigh Burke Tincture (heraldry) Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Evander Holyfield United States coinage Royal Victorian Order Professional wrestling match types Affair of the diamond necklace United States dollar coin British Rail Class 508 Backstreet Boys Mandarin (comics) Torc Nine Inch Nails Sari Korea at the 2004 Summer Olympics
