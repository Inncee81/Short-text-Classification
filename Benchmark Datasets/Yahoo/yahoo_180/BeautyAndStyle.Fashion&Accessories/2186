should i wear this help me seriously um i'm planning on wearing long spandex leggings with a long black shirt and black heels it's cute and i think i look pretty in it a little too pretty in my opinion but that s what i m scared of because i am sneaking out of my house with these clothes on and getting picked up by this friend who will give me a ride to my boyfriend s work and he works in a gas station i don t want to look like a retard in nice clothes in that gas station but i only wear nice clothes i rarely wear jeans and a shirt but i think that maybe i might have to be forced to wear it tonight because my original choice may not be suitable for the environment do you think that i should just not give a crap and wear my regular attire or wear the jeans and an abercrombie hoodie i picked out sorry if this post seems too superficial but i just don t want to embarrass myself oh yeah and it's am since it is am i wouldn't wear it i would save that outfit for a date or going out with friends no offense or anything but at am who really cares what ur wearing especially since ur going to a gas station i would definitely go with the jeans and hoodie Married... with Children Sex and the City Phoebe Buffay's songs SpongeBob SquarePants Shoe Punk fashion Sonic the Hedgehog Sock Marching band Michelle Branch Prince (artist) The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Skinhead Ren and Stimpy Function (mathematics) Lucille Ball Guy Sigsworth Butters Stotch Clothing Yu-Gi-Oh!
