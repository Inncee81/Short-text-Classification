wedding tomorrow my dad is getting married for the th time tomorrow it's a small wedding about people what should i wear i know a dress but what color type style or whatever and what type of shoes thanks i would suggest a cute short dress something summery or perhaps a nice black dress that will be suited for the evening peep toe shoes are very cute this time of year and are little different than regular strappy sandals you can always opt for a simple black dress with some great accessories and a good bag if it's the th time what did you wear to the other weddings HyperText Transfer Protocol Black tie JavaServer Pages World Wide Web Web browser Website Suit (clothes) Uniform Resource Locator Jill Valentine PlayStation Portable Web server Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Jakarta Tomcat Ajax (programming) Mess dress Uniform Resource Identifier HTTP cookie Bow tie HTML Lostprophets Internet Proxy server Japanese tea ceremony Starfleet ranks and insignia Evening dress WebDAV Shoe Spyware Representational State Transfer Social aspects of clothing Java Servlet Application server Squid cache Kylie Minogue Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Singapore Police Force Mario Lotus Notes Skinhead United States Air Force Beret Kimono Wireless Application Protocol The Warriors Mozilla Application Suite Gothic Lolita Konqueror Garfield Apache HTTP Server Mozilla Firefox Web page Web design Cascading Style Sheets Keith Richards The Wiggles Gmail Paul Is Dead Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway School uniform Electronic commerce Double Nickels on the Dime Necktie Vanilla MTV Europe Music Awards MegaMan Battle Network 5 Customs and etiquette of Japan Common Unix Printing System Doug Billie Jean Slash (punctuation) Pat Boone Salute Academic dress of Oxford University Thumbnail gallery post Virtual hosting Doctor (Doctor Who) Web crawler Adidas "Weird Al" Yankovic PHP PBY Catalina Phishing Blink-182 The Smashing Pumpkins Sigur R__s Diana Ross Morning dress Skirt and dress Cross site scripting Netscape Communications Corporation Robert Palmer (British singer) Eddie Kramer Clothing Teal'c Primus (band) Shrek 2 Jennifer Lopez Mydoom Alex Chilton
