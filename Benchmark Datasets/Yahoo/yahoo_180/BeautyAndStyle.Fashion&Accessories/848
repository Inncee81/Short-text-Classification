funky hair do i have thick ish long blonde hair look in my other questions for bits of pictures and anyway i am sick of just putting it up in a pony tail for school if i wanna wear it out i know the usual way is to layer it or give it a side fringe but they are what everyone has in their hair and i want something original i also would like it to be low maintanance and able to be tied up without losing too much length so any photos pictures or sugestions on an unusal but awesome hair style would be greatly appreciated a long bob will give you lots more body and your natural curl will show up it's shorter in the back so there is a lot less combing the front is still long so you can play with fun sparkly barrettes and clips i have a shoulder length bob with no fringe and lots of natural curl it's totally wash and wear or i can put hot rollers in it to look a little more dressy or glamorous for work i wear it down with a pretty clip or just up in a pony if i'm having a bad hair day have fun Haircut Hair The Ashlee Simpson Show Skinhead Equine conformation Kodocha Horse Drill bit Textile manufacturing Dreadlocks Comanche Curling Emo fashion Marilyn Monroe Baldness Ponytail Brush Fast bowling Beavis and Butt-head Shirt Mattress Professional wrestling throws Diving suit Dog Show hunter Wig (hair) Beard Wheel of Fortune Irish dance Keeshond Floppy disk Moustache Gramophone record Shampoo Heavy metal fashion Kilt Leather Hair conditioner Avenue Q Sento 2000 Australian Grand Prix Afro textured hair Tefillin Rastafari movement McFly Bob and George Blond Gray Wolf Powerbomb Knife Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In MAD Magazine Universal Century Technology Kimi Finster Mullet (haircut) Jackass: The Movie Aerial (dance move) Volleyball Paul Is Dead Scapula Totally Spies!
