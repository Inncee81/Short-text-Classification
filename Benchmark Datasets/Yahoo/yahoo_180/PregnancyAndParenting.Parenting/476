does anyone else find it disturbing how kids preteens dress nowadays i'm and i admit to shopping at abercrombie hollister ae etc but that's not all i wear and i don't brag about it but when i see little girls like age even trying to be cool and hott when they shop at those places it makes me first gag then laugh when i was or around that age my friends and i still wore nike clothes or stuff like that we didn't care and the guys still liked us what ever happened to being a kid and not caring about how you looked yeah its rediculous ive seen year olds in shorter skirts than i have ever worn in my opinion its because of a lack of parenting not all but alot of parents just dont see a problem with the way kids are dressing when i was little i could wear walmart brands and nobody would say a damn thing kids these days do need to learn how to relax and just be kids the pressure to fit in is affecting kids younger and younger pretty soon abercrombie and hollister will be making diapers if ppl dont see that looks dont matter as much as personality ok im done ranting have a good day Kyle Broflovski Marilyn Monroe Humphrey Bogart The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Infantilism Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
