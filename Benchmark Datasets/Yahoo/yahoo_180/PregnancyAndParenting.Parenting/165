parents would you let your daughter smoke if your teenage daughter came home one day reeking of smoke what would you do omg i remember when i was i was grounded because my parents found cigarettes in my room i was supposed to be grounded for a month because of this however i still continued to recieve an allowance during this time i actually had a friend buy them for me and throw them up on the roof outside my window and i would climb out there and get them and throw her the money so here i was grounded for smoking and they caught me smoking in my room well they decided that i was too stubborn for their punishments to make me quit and from then on i was allowed to smoke as long as i did it downstairs instead of in my room since they were afraid of me burning the house down with one of my makeshift ashtrays many years later i quit smoking and have a daughter of my own i know in about yrs i may go through this with her but unlike my parents i just dont think i will be able to give in to stubbornness while i do not in any way fault my parents with the habbit i picked up and had such a hard time quitting i am determined that i will at least try a little harder to make her quit and i sure as heck will not allow her to do it under my supervision because of the health risks as well as the fact that it is illegal for her to smoke i would do everything in my power to make her stop even if it meant making her life miserable a friend of mine had a mother with an interesting idea that actually worked she caught her smoking so she went out and bought a pack and at dinner she offered her a smoke well after she smoked that one she made her smoke another and another until she bacame quite ill she never smoked another one after that i guess it must have been a pretty awful experience she didnt want to repeat Tobacco smoking Divorce Cigarette Smoking ban Abigail Folger The Smoking Room Friends Health insurance Knots Landing Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Illegal drug trade Sub-Zero GunZ The Duel Fancy Crane EastEnders Shaggy dog story Craps Mutual fund Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha Jam (TV series) About a Boy Jean Grey Cigar The Virgin Suicides The Star Wars Holiday Special Days of our Lives Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bristol Grammar School Arguments for and against drug prohibition Little Britain Causality The Masters Apprentices The Shining (film) Amedeo Modigliani Calvin and Hobbes Charles Peace Nico Robin Good Times Katelyn Faber Tobacco advertising Humphrey Bogart Kurt Cobain Carl Barks Cannabis (drug) Sigmund Freud Sin City Rovers Return Milton H.
