re should i allow them out thanks to everyone who answered just to add i have tried sitting out front with them but i end up with every child in the place in the garden i even had parents lift there child over the gate and ask if they can play it was turning into a creche for everyone i tried inviting other kids in to play but parents again took advantage and would leave them all day i often gave them lunch and dinner no one would come looking for them so now i just keep to myself i had enough of it but every time i walk out my door i get looks or else they all turn there backs to me i try to just ignore it but its not easy at times to be peoples enemy for no reason my kids are happy out and have cousins coming to stay tonite and thery are great buddies and play great together also its not just small kids here its teenagers too and they get a great kick out of teaching them bad language ive even seen them drinking and kids sitting in the middle of it very good linda c maybe im just too quiet and i have to say life is more peaceful since i put an end to it you would be within your rights to tell people to go home if it isn't convenient tell them people can't take advantage of you without your permission so don't be concerned about what they think they don't respect you i often had kids just show up wanting to play that's okay but i make them call their mothers and set a specific time limit if they couldn't contact their mom they couldn't stay every time i was doing yard work my kids liked to help so did half the kids in the neighborhood i was a working mom and most of the moms in the neighborhood weren't so i couldn't understand why my yard was such a magnet i made sure the kids went home very dirty and the visits stopped maybe you could work out something like that when my kids were in high school there were rules at home such as no kids can visit when mom isn't home no drinking smoking or swearing at our house violators banned for life unfortunately not all parents make rules like that i was a divorced working mom so i didn't have time to mess around with disciplining other people's kids behave or leave if the parents want to chew me out they can leave too i thought of putting a sign on the door that said did i invite you if not go home i guess you could call me the meanest mom on the block here's another one top this kids playing basketball in the street in front of my house until p m shouting and screaming i had to be at work at a m so needed my sleep i talked to the kids but it didn't do any good i called the parents and it didn't do any good so what i did was call the parents when i had to leave for work in the morning just thought i'd let you know that your kids kept me awake last night and i'm returning the favor for some reason the basketball players found a different place Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Social rule Volleyball Tag Muslim ibn Aqeel EastEnders Satchel Paige Kodocha Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Catcher in the Rye The Inside Pitaten The Marshall Mathers LP Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Kyle Broflovski Futurama (TV series - season 5) Customs and etiquette of Japan Laura Schlessinger Avenue Q Poker jargon Rosa Parks Cindy Sheehan Rent (musical) The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Milton H.
