i don't know what to do currently i live with my boyfriend of just over a year i knew he came with baggage when we first got together and i thought i was strong enough to handle it he has two daughters aged and who constantly whine and snivel and misbehave and he doesn't do anything about it he just does whatever will shut them up and then he'll take them out later he is in the middle of a custody battle and wants to come out looking like the good guy but i seriously don't think that spoiling children no matter what the circumstances are is an okay thing to do i have discussed this issue with him and he said he will work on it he's not working on it and i'm finding myself in a hard place i don't have children but if i did i wouldn't let them get away with the stuff he lets his daughters get away with i don't know how much longer i can deal with it because in the end of it all they are not my children and i shouldn't care what if we got married someday any thoughts also the girls do not live with us they come over two days a week and he makes excuses saysing i only see them two days a week this isn't a relationship you should be in i can see lots of trouble down the road especially if you guys got married with you being a step mother i'm not saying you would be a bad one in anyway but you trying to correct the children's behavior and do the right thing will definitely cause trouble between you and your boyfriend and eventually the girls' mother i remember this happening with my own family they seperate when i was my brother was and my sister was my dad spoiled us rotten to make us happy and his girlfriend really didn't approve of it he'd get annoyed and when she tried to help us out or tell us to stop doing something one of us would tell our mother and she would flip these children really seem like they're stuck in the middle right now between their parents and most likely get whatever they want from both sides it's not something you want to deal with trust me i would consider leaving this relationship it seems like you yourself aren't sure of it yourself best wishes Friends EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Pitaten Hollyoaks Kodocha Social rule The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy About a Boy One Tree Hill (TV series) Shaggy dog story The Catcher in the Rye Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Calvin and Hobbes The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Badly Drawn Kitties Boston Public Charmed Saved by the Bell Time Out of Mind Kurt Cobain Neighbours Full House Little Britain Pok__mon Live!
