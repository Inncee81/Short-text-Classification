retracting son's foreskin please answer only if you have kids with foreskin we went to the doc for his yearly checkup and she said we need to start retracting the foreskin he is five and has never retracted it she showed us how it was dirty and needed cleaned my son winced when she did that i'm sure it was uncomfortable now we tried bathing him and hubby was helping him he cannot do it yet so hubby was showing him how he started screaming and saying it hurted it hurted so then there was soap stuck and we had no choice but to get it out i waited till he calmed down and tried to explain everything we needed to do so he would understand we can't just leave the soap in there that is what was stinging he wouldn't have it kicking and everything else we finally got it clean but this was a nightmare has anybody ever had to do this before and was it that hard i'm just ready to leave it dirty now i don't want my kid traumatized your son is probably just frightened because it's something new and scary for him if his pediatrician was able to retract his foreskin in the office without any resistance then your son should be able to do the same at home is it possible that your son was picking up on you and your husband's apprehension the next time your son has a bath allow him to pull the foreskin back on his own this way he willl be able to control how hard far quickly the foreskin is retracted then a quick wipe with a warm soapy wash cloth will be more than enough to get the job done if he continues to complain about pain give his pediatrician a call it's possible that his foreskin is still a bit attached if that is the case it should not be forecibly retracted Phimosis Textile manufacturing Soap Aerial (dance move) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The Shining (film) Smegma Strap-on dildo Sento Medical analysis of circumcision Masturbation Penis Breastfeeding Foreskin Knots Landing Shaggy dog story Diving Cleveland Browns Hulk (comics) Garfield EastEnders 1957 World Series Jackass: The Movie Futurama (TV series - season 5) Fecal incontinence Piccolo Junior Saga Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Oral sex Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Charles Peace Babe Ruth Condom Beetle in an Anthill Menstrual cup Circumcision Electrophysiology Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Tattoo Erection One Piece minor characters Pitaten Operation Market Garden Traumatic incident reduction Tire The Inside Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Contender (television series) Glans penis Kodocha Japanese toilet Balanitis Escape from New York Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Pok__mon Live!
