what to can i do when school starts for my six year old my six year old son has never had anything on his feet he is always barefoot he has been at preschool for two years barefoot what would be good for his feet to start wearing because my old son ten years old only wears crocs to school and is barefoot all the rest of the time there are schools that allow crocs flipflops and even bare feet but in the us they are very rare if you can't find one nearby print some of the material in the source and see if you can convince the teacher to let him go barefoot at least at his desk the anti barefoot dress codes are usually based on unfounded fears about injury or disease while in fact going barefoot is very healthy for everyone but especially for growing children it's sad so many people in the us believe in all these unfounded myths about injury and disease in most other countries including the rest of the western world more people know it for a healthy habit Barefoot Johnny Appleseed Flat feet Social aspects of clothing High-heeled shoe Modesty Horseshoe Foot Paul Is Dead Duesberg hypothesis Disease Montessori method AIDS Spanking Foot-and-mouth disease Gender role Diving Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Crocodile Urinary incontinence Public health in mainland China Irish dance Supernatural Steve Irwin Shaggy dog story Poliomyelitis Dissociative identity disorder Carpal tunnel syndrome Siege of Jerusalem (1099) Lhoba Columbine High School massacre Clothing Education in Taiwan Foot odor Mission UK School uniform David Beckham The Wiggles Whose Line Is It Anyway?
