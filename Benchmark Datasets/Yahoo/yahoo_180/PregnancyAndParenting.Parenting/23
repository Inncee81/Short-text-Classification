did any of you ever fight back against your parents while being disciplined some people don't like talking about this but i want to bring it to our attention the last time i was physically disciplined by my mom was when i was about i came home late without calling the house my mistake and as soon as i came hom my mother whacked me across the face and started yelling at me i couldn't take her jumping right to physically attacking me anymore so i shoved at her and she fell to the ground i didn't even shove hard my mother then was screaming i'm calling the cops i'm calling the police now and i told her to go ahead and call and when they get here they will know that you attacked me first and you will be in trouble she put the phone down and i went up to my room and that was that she never physically punished me since did anything similar happen in your house yes my stepfather was all for the physical style of punishment he enjoyed it greatly right up to the point i laid him out cold on the kitchen floor sometimes parents are just like any other bully they keep on it until you stand up for yourself its sad though because parents arent supposed to be that way with their children Shaggy dog story Tag Silent Night, Deadly Night Skateboarding trick The Inside Reservoir Dogs Piccolo Junior Saga Spanking Professional wrestling attacks Great Teacher Onizuka Kitchen Humphrey Bogart Malcolm in the Middle One Piece minor characters Milton H.
