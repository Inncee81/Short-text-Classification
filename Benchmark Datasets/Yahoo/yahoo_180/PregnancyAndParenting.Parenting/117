discipline help okay this is lonnngg but here goes of my boys ages along with one of their friends just said some very nasty things to my neighbor when they were outside yesterday 'ha your too weak to start your mower nice butt great rack run over your dog we all hate her' when i get home my neighbor comes to the edge of her lawn andyells to me that this is an everyday occurance from mouthy jonny and that when they are outside they swear and cuss at her and at the other neighbors she said that when the other nbrs rip on me she stood up for me but no more their mouth attitude is a reflection on my family and that now she knows the others are correct and i am a horrible so called 'parent' i could not believe this no one has ever said anything to me before about his here they've been saying there is no reason my yard has to be a mess or not mowed every days saying my boys hit baseballs into their windows golf balls ruin their mowers and so on and not one of them has ever said anything to me our yard is huge so i can't always hear the kids when they are outside and i have central air so the windows are shut then the one neighbor my cousin said my boys were hitting her dog and at the time they were at the pool so the friend is no longer welcome here he has had one to many chances i had them go over to apologize to her but she said she would not accept it my boys lost tv games bikes boards blades allowance and have to do double the chores are not allowed outside without an adult are not allowed to go to friends homes and have to mow her lawn for the rest of the year i just don't think they 'get it' they don't seem phased at all any suggestions please i've never had to deal with this personally i've been trying to think what i would tell someone else to do and i just can't think thanks momma p my boys have always been respectful to other adults like i said this is the first i have ever heard of things like this from them they even admitted what they said to her i was thinking maybe it was this friends influence about a month ago they were with this one and another and said that the two friends were smoking and drinking beer at and called them names and told them to leave because my boys wouldn't do it i have never in a million years ever even had an inkling that my boys were this bad they have always been nice to everyone they say the right things and have true feelings for adults in my presence my dad's and also my brother's we would have kicked their a es otherwise and they know this and is a very impressionable age and unfortunatly though it's hard for parents sometimes it's hard for neighbors too when i was around this age one of the other kids that hung out with my brother and i was acting up and doing stuff to our neighbors by association we got blamed for this kid's crap too also if your neighbors are adults they shouldn't be talking behind your back and not confronting you when your kids did something for what your kids confessed to they need to be punished but they need to be punished in a way that makes them realize it's because of what they said to the neighbor not because they told you the truth it's hard to punish kids this age i was nanny for these ages for two years and trust me i know that it's hard by no means should you spank or smack your children they are too old for one and for two they will never confess when confronted if they are severely punished what needs to be done is confronting the neighbors about what you heard and explain to the neighbor that told you what was going on that you are sorry and the kids will make it up to her by helping her with mowing the lawn and walking the hated dog on a daily basis secondly do you know the friend's parents if you do you should tell them what is going on if not or if they don't seem like the kind of parents that give a then tell your kids that they can only see that kid at your house while supervised you can't tell your child to not be friends with someone but you can supervise their time with that friend and make sure things don't get out of hand also if your neighbors property is being damaged why wouldn't the neighbors come talk to you when it happened i think that your neighbor was just upset and lashing out without even talking to the other neighbors and if she won't forgive your kids for being kids then it's her problem and you shouldn't punish your kids more for this finally if you haven't already now is the time to have the birds and bees talk because they obviously are curious about sex to be saying crude things to your neighbor be understanding that it could be uncomfortable but they obviously are in puberty and should know about things before there is another teen pregnancy posting also talk to them about drugs and alcohol and be open to listening about the peer pressures they are facing the more listening and open and honest you are with your kids about sex drugs alcohol etc the more likely they will turn out for the better and bad behavior will turn into a good relationship anyway this is my advice take it or leave it hope it helps and best of luck Theory of conduct Social rule Shaggy dog
