what to do kids kissing ok so my cousin's girls came over today one is and the other is they've play with my son who is well me and the yo were in my room online and the other two were in my son's room behind the bed and guess what i go to check on the and they were kissing the girl had her mouth wide open and my son was kissing regular like the way i kiss him i don't know if that matters or not i really don't have much experience with this sort os thing i asked them what they were doing and my son replied nothing real quick so obviously he knew he was doing something wrong so i called them over to come into my room to come join us on the comp i called my gma who is kind of like my mom since she raised me to tell her about the situation and how i should handle it i didn't get an answer so i called my aunt which is another person that i talk to a lot and that i'm close to and i told her what happened and she told me this is the second time something like this has happened i was furious my son often spends the night at my gma's house who watches the girls my aunt told me that the little girl was on top of my son i don't know the details because that's all she told me i def plan on telling the mother my cousin i've also heard another story about the little girl that my gma told me months ago she tols me that the little girl was how can i word this playing with the penis of her male dog i told my hubby and he said that we should ask the mother if it is possible that anyone is sexually abusing her but i have no idea how to approach this to her if i should at all what do i tell my son i plan on doing some research but any advice on this topic would be greatly apprciated and on how i should handle this situation well i did tell the mom what happened today and that i found about the other instance when they were under the blankets would i be out of line to suggest her daughter may be being abused my dh thinks not but i'm not sure how to even suggest to her mother my cousin this how about kids being curious if you want to see evidence of abuse i am sure you can interprete anything you see as such your kid replying 'nothing' real quick has a lot to do with the look on your face and your tone of voice when you ask the question kids see these things all around them all the time all it takes is a tv and kids are naturally curious especially when it concerns things that you won't talk about or feel ashamed about you make the direct link with sexual behaviour but it's just investigation to them it must be interesting because they notice how touchy the subject is with you sorry but it sounds like you're freaking out Milton H.
