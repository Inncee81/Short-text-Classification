what do you guys think about this a six year old child hospitalised for treatment due to malnutrition this is the son of a 'friend' of mine he's got cavaties wear and tear of a year old and is losing enamel of most of his teeth the reason for this takeaway meals a day most days no water or milk to drink ever and lots and lots of sugar lollies and sweet drinks he's calcium and vitamin deficiant and had to be hospitalised recently for four days to be given laxative meds through a nasal tube because he was so badly constipated this woman gets over a fortnight through maintenence and social security we live in australia and has huge problems looking after her son obviously oh and child welfare says there's nothing they can do sorry for the rant i had to get this off my chest feel free to comment katrina no that wasn't me who saw her friend hit her child for breaking the console but i'm glad i didn't have to see that i like all your suggestions but i've tried everything with this girl and she won't listen she thinks she's a good mum the reason welfare can't do anything is because they can't prove that what she is doing is causing 'lasting' harm cr p i know i'm a foster parent and i believe she should have this kid taken away until she gets her act together how frustrating it is to have to see this child being abused that's what i think it is and not being able to do a darn thing about it i guess if i were you i would try to insert myself into that child's life as much as possible is there a foster child you have close to his age i'd have your friend's son spend the night at your house a lot and also document everything that you see going on even look for things such as bruises etc please stay strong and don't lose hope that you'll be able to impact this child's life thank god he has you Tooth Anorexia nervosa Fecal incontinence About a Boy EastEnders Pitaten Urinary incontinence SMTV Live Folic acid Hypoglycemia Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milk Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Alcoholism Coeliac disease Social rule Diving 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Nutrition Veganism Oasis (band) Food The Catcher in the Rye Humphrey Bogart Domestic violence Jon Secada Methamphetamine Soft drink The Contender (television series) Ellen Foster Sharon Tate One Tree Hill (TV series) Fluoride Characters in the Smurfs Cocaine The Emancipation of Mimi Rickets Vitamin D Crohn's disease Diarrhea Chronic fatigue syndrome The Inside Self-harm Cliff Richard Common cold Infantilism Liam Gallagher Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rais massacre Theory of conduct Queen (band) Hearing impairment Adoption Osteoporosis Red Hot Chili Peppers Empire Burlesque Kodocha Fathers' rights Laura Schlessinger Traumatic brain injury Vitamin C Ex-gay Spice Girls Avenue Q Dairy Protein-energy malnutrition Divorce Fasting Sigmund Freud Vegetarianism Green Day Hiberno-English Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Abortion debate LiveJournal Rick Santorum Coffee Acne Tooth enamel Knots Landing Charles Darwin's illness 2000 Australian Grand Prix Insulin Garth Brooks Ron and Fez Garfield John Lennon Eric Cartman Hikikomori
