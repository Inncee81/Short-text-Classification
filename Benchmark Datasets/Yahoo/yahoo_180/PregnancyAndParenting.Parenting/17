how young is too young to start a childen in ballet or tap classes just so you know she is not quite three and she got the idea in her head a few months ago that she was going to grow up to be a famous dancer so we took her to a day camp thing for little kids and she learned a really easy dance and just fell in love with it but i am just not sure if she is ready to commit to an on going thing like a dance class i got to take a mommy and me class where you take your child as young as years old mom or dad gets to stay and they teach basic moves the kids do it because mom dad is doing it and they just mimic but it is exercise and flexibility plus little girls get to wear their cute tutu's i'd say younger than that and they probably wouldn't sit still focus or understand and if you sent them by themselves at it wouldn't be too productive but if mom dad goes it is usually fun and an intro to dance The Adventures of Pete & Pete Lindy Hop Irish dance Aerial (dance move) Pok__mon Live!
