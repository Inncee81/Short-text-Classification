how can you tell if a lice egg is dead does anyone on here know how to tell if a lice egg is dead someone told me that when you pinch a live lice or live egg between your nails it pops and when it's dead it won't i want to make sure the lice on my daughter's head are all gone i checked a few days ago and recently just checked again i found two lice eggs but they didn't pop when i pinched them between my nails i figured if it's been a few days and all i've found after a thourough search is eggs that possibly that means there are no more live ones because there would be more eggs laid i want to make sure any eggs i may miss though are dead anyone know if the pop thing is true i couldn't find it on the net anywhere one way to know is if the lice egg is dead is if its white or grey if its brown or black its still alive also the pop thing is true if you kill it with your finger nails like that it basically squishes their body pretty flat which kills them if you find one that doesnt pop and its brown or black then its probably a lice egg that recently died Head louse EastEnders Lou Gehrig Jean Grey Nine Inch Nails Minor Harry Potter Beasts Crab louse Neighbours Poker jargon 1957 World Series Ocean's Twelve Egg (biology) A Simple Plan Queen (band) Sonic the Hedgehog Xenomorph Methos The Subtle Knife Milton H.
