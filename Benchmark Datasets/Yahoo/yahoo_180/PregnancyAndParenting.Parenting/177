can she stop him my partner is going for a contact order to see his son the mother has stopped him because we asked her to sign for the money we were giving her thing is my partner smokes weed on a weekend can she stop him seeing him or have his visits to be supervised because of this he is not a drug addict and he works in a good job to support his family and our kids are happy and well looked after like i said not a drug addict and actually one of the nicest people ive ever met only on a weekend wow its really strange that i found this question my partner is going through the same thing with his ex partner he even stopped making maintenance payments so she would contact him so he could try and come to an agreement with her about access not a smart move and not reccomended at all my partner used to smoke quite a bit of weed whilst he was with his ex and even though he hasnt touched it since they split she still uses this against him although the fact that he no longer smokes has given him a little bit of help as with your partner he has a very good job and although we dont have children of our own yet he has always been as good a father as he could be to his son even when he wasnt making payments to her he was putting the money to one side so that he could pay it all when they reached an agreement he has even opened a bank account in his sons name and puts money in there each week for his son when he is older the only thing i can suggest however is for your partner to stand a fighting chance in court to see his son he needs to give up the weed at least until the case has been dealt with whist hes still smoking it he doesnt stand a chance and if she uses this against him which no doubt she will he will get tested and fail and the case will be thrown out of court in her favour good luck hope i have been of some help and just remember to be there for him its gonna be hard Divorce Knots Landing Contract Schabir Shaik Trial SCO-Linux controversies 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Drug test Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Theory of conduct Plame affair Contract bridge Schapelle Corby Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Fathers' rights 1919 World Series Poker jargon Friends Kasparov versus The World Atomic Kitten Octopus card Incarnations of Immortality Domestic violence Cigarette Smoking Man Child support Probation officer Cyprus dispute Vernon Schillinger Only Fools and Horses Appeal Health insurance ITV Monetary policy National Football League Sant Thakar Singh Illegal drug trade War of the Worlds (2005 film) Nicomachean Ethics Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Japan-United States relations The Star Wars Holiday Special Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Syphon Filter Katelyn Faber Dead Like Me Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Fathers' rights movement in the UK Vegeta Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Arguments for and against drug prohibition Continuation War Aerial (dance move) Government of India Act 1935 Swingout Meat Loaf Cheating in poker One Tree Hill (TV series) Apology (Plato) Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Estoppel Fire fighting Baseball Liam Gallagher Piccolo Junior Saga Medicare (Canada) Cannabis (drug) Cannabis rescheduling in the United States About a Boy Volleyball Advance fee fraud Pittsburgh Steelers Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Little Britain Consensus decision-making Tobacco smoking Muslim ibn Aqeel Sydney Riot of 1879 Operation Market Garden League of Nations Avenue Q Shaggy dog story Same-sex marriage in Canada Drug abuse Rich Mullins Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Consensual crime Good Times Ben Johnson (athlete) Unemployment Marshall Plan Bradley Nowell Dancing at Lughnasa
