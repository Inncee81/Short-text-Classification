do you believe that children should be smacked by their parents as punishment i don't mean horrible things like hitting them with belts and stuff i just mean if a child is being naughty and he she has had lots of warnings and if he she is really playing up and won't settle and the mum or dad gives them a smack on their bottom or something my mum did it to me and my brothers and we turned out fine do you think it's a good way of punishing your children i was smacked a lot as a child and it didn't do me any harm but it did teach me the difference between right and wrong pretty fast i didn't need to smack my kids very often but i'm not adverse if the situation calls for it as kids get older getting 'down to their level does not work and that's when as teenagers there lack of discipline as a child becomes apparent i hate these softly softly people they are the bloody cause of teenagers behaviour and lack of respect edit and i totally agree with phobius hit the nail on the head Spanking About a Boy Silent Night, Deadly Night Little Britain Corporal punishment Sampling (music) EastEnders Teenage pregnancy Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Eddie Guerrero Theory of conduct Rich Mullins Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Evil Theodicy Milton H.
