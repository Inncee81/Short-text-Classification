parents what is crossing the line in correcting someone elses child i am recently engaged and my finace has a god daughter the problem is she is three and misbehaves unfortunatly she loves me and will follow me around everywhere she has to sit in my lap when im eating plays in my food sits in my lap and wants to remote control or is at the computer with me typing over me it annoys me that her parents just let her do whatever but the child really does like me if i very politly correct her she screams bloody murder and runs to go tattle it annoys me so bad my question is when is it ok to correct her and how do i do it without making the the parents feel that im crossing the line the other issue is that she is the flower girl in our wedding i am not going to get upset becuase she doesnt want to walk ot wear the dress im laid back about it i knew when picking her she was too young the issue is she doesnt listen and i dont want her talking crying through my ceramony what is the nicest way to tell the parents what my concern is let me re phrase my question i am going to correct her but i need to do it in the right way i refuse to let her bang on my laptop play in my food or yank the remote out of my hands she may be three but she knows what she is doing she has full vocabulary and will roll her eyes and point blank tell you no i hate to be the bearer of bad news but the little darling doesn't love you or even like you for that matter she simply enjoys the adult that lets her push her around and do whatever she wants and responds so quickly when she goes crying to mommy her parents aren't about to correct her because they obviously have no control over her themselves so when she is on your lap they can heave a sigh of relief at not having to deal with the little angel for minutes or so the way i see it you have two choices here have her as your flowergirl to try and maintain family harmony with those two parents and believe me the rest of the family will think you are either stupid or a saint because they already recognize the princess for what she is and be prepared to kiss your day goodbye because she will wreck it or grow a backbone discuss it with your fiance' and tell him you love the little girl but are not prepared to give up your big day simply to please a year old brat that won't even remember the day a year down the road the parents might be miffed on the surface but will totally understand in private while the rest of the family will admire you for having the courage to stand up for yourself and what is right to answer your question about when is it ok to correct her anytime she crosses personal boundaries you are within your rights to say no sorry you cannot sit on my lap etc etc if she screams off to mommy that is her problem not yours as far as educating her or teaching her forget it that is the parents job and you cannot correct a lifetime of bad behavior and training in a hour visit or even a day for that matter what you can hope to achieve is that she will learn she cannot push auntie's buttons or run roughshod over top of you she will hate it now but years from now she will respect and like you if the little darlin' survives that long lol j k do yourself your fiance' and the whole wedding day a favour and ask her parents to find a babysitter for the wedding day if you want to be real nice offer to pay for the babysitter yourself and count it money well spent Little Britain Social rule Pitaten Jennifer Lopez Friends Infantilism Theory of conduct Sin City Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Kodocha Characters in the Smurfs EastEnders Japanese tea ceremony Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
