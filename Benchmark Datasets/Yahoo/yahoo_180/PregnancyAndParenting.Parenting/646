preschooler having problems with transitions my child starts kindergarten in sept and we having a huge problem with transitions when something ends someone leaves something changes he gets really upset sometimes he'll scream other times he'll cry incessantly we've tried forewarning him with min notices and so on we've tried coaching him with statements like come on we've got other stuff to do we've also tried admonishments and ridicule out of desparation does anyone have any ideas on how we can teach him to accept change i would suggest a thorough eval by your pediatrician and asking for an eval from a either a devlopmental pediatrician or a child psychologist psychiatrist the level of anxiety and transition issues you describe could point to other issues that until they are known and worked with will leave you without a clear idea on how to help it sounds like you have tried a lot of the things that i would recommend minute warnings reminders of what to do next etc and i can understand feeling desperate enough to end up trying punishment and teasing a lthough as you have found they generally do little to make things better and at times can make things worse so what to do my first question would be to ask how your child does with a set schedule if things go as they do on a daily basis does he do better if he does then the key is to work school into that schedule and that will mean following the same schedule as much as possible all the time weekends and school holidays as well at least for now if he must get up at for school than do it every day do breakfast brush teeth and get dressed since he won't go to school on weekends have something for him to do those days watch cartoons for an hour work on a small project tile lunch a trip to the park etc make a picture schedule and post it and go over the coming day every night before bed and every morning when he gets up it a major change is coming a doctor appointment going to visit grandma put it on the schedule at least a week in advance and every time you go over his daily schedule remind him that the change is coming remember instead of going to baseball on thursday we'll be meeting grandma for dinner at denny's the key with kids with transition issues is to make as few of them a surprise as possible use a timer to mark how long he can watch tv how long until it is time to leave for school everything it may help him know what is coming of course there will be last minute changes be prepared for what you know is coming if possible have someone there with you to help with the child while you deal with the issue they can sit in the car and read or play while you make that last minute stop at the post office if you can't find an extra set of hands try to have something special for him to play with at just such these times hand held video games can be a good one keep it tucked away to be used when something happens unexpectedly and you need your child's compliance school will take some work even before classes start you should inform the teacher and administration of this issue and request a formal evaluation to see if your child will qualify for an iep or do not wait to see what the doctor says school do not accept findings from private practioners as proof of the need for an iep or and would test him anyway get the process going now if he qualifies the iep or will help set up accomodations and stuctures to help your child in school this could be important if his tantrums cause major disruptions in the class or if he begins to throw items or strike out this is not going to be an easy fix it will take a lot of effort and trying different solutions to find the one that is right for your child use whatever services and professionals you can it may take the first few months of school to get a feel for what is going on but i have no doubt this is somenthing that can be dealt with once youhave a better idea of what is going on Transsexuality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Special education EastEnders Education in the People's Republic of China Shaggy dog story GED Education in the United States Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Sydney Riot of 1879 Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Scientology beliefs and practices Education in Romania About a Boy National Football League 2000 Australian Grand Prix Education in Japan Current teachings of Prem Rawat Graduate school Milton H.
