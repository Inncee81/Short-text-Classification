why spend so much money on education to be a housewife i was thinking about my friend's mom and how well educated they are but how they spent all their time at home since their first child was born some of them re entered the workforce after their youngest got old enough but that is still a very large chunk of their life most of these women went to great schools living on the eastcoast as expected they went to small expensive private liberal arts schools a couple of them even had masters degrees that would make them set for huge careers the and their families must have spent atleast on education but they put that all down to stay at home and take care of their kids i dont understand it they dont have to be stay at home moms they could work abd still be great mothers and have kids that grow up to be great friends and sons and daugthers i just want some inside opinion and enlightment of why it is worth the trade off do any stay at home moms feel they could do more wow so many great answers i always appreciated that you stay at home moms and working moms and moms in general do i just wanted to see the otherside as my mother was always working and raising us i dont know how to choose an answer i would like to add in no defensive manner that as both my parents work worked full time both of my siblings went to great schools and i am on the path to enter a strong university where i can focus on what i want to do so i dont think there is a better way or a way to guaruntee good kids why not be the best educated mother you can be both my parents were widowed in their early 's they met each other years later and married that can happen to anyone and if it does the mom has the education to help her family survive monetarily families are different yes mothers can work and be great mothers with happy and wonderful children in our family i don't think that'd work i love staying at home with my children and they have all expressed how proud they are that i'm able to do the things i do things i could not do with a career i can be pta president i can be homeroom mom i can volunteer at the school my husband completely respects what i do and is grateful that i stay at home and no he never expects a clean house or dinner on the table i use my education on a daily basis with my kids with the school with life in general it's so worth the trade off i read my child's school journal one time with her permission lol one writing assignment was my proudest moment was and she finished it with when my mom came to all performances of the school play i could not have done that if i had been working there are plenty more examples and all of them trump the work factor in our family i may go back to work when the youngest goes off to college i may not it depends and i might just do volunteer work i've seen a lot of working parents make great successes of their families they make it work but i've also seen a lot of children who had to be consoled and comforted because their parents couldn't show for plays field days holiday parties student conferences which parent do i want to be which child do you want to be Laura Schlessinger EastEnders Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart One Tree Hill (TV series) Economic inequality Cindy Sheehan Theory of conduct Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus About a Boy Charles Dickens Hikikomori Kurt Cobain Abortion debate Futurama (TV series - season 2) Divorce Social rule The Adventures of Pete & Pete Grief Education in the United States Adoption Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Teresa Heinz Kerry Married... with Children Blankets (graphic novel) Abigail Folger Little Britain Education in the People's Republic of China The Apprentice 2 Pitaten Honey and Clover Melanie Wilkes Education in Portugal Gender role Mother Teresa Homemaker Kimi Finster The Family from One End Street Rent (musical) Thai royal and noble titles The Amber Spyglass Master's degree Education in Japan Intelligence quotient Polyamory Desperate Housewives Freeters Thinks ...
