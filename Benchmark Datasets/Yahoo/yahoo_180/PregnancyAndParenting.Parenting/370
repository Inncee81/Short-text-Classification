why are some parents so self righteous and think that anything other than their way is wrong such as daycare such as with daycare staying home breast feeding everyone is different some parents have to work i am lucky to be able to stay home with my kids but some people can't make it on one income period some downsize their homes have old cars no cable no extras and they still can't make it on one income that's life daycare is the only option and it isn't the horrible place that some people make it out to be another thing is breastfeeding it just doesn't work for some people whether it be for medical reasons or physical reasons that's just the way it is why do some still have a holier than thou attitude towards others and why are they so quick to judge why do they belittle others who don't make the same decisions does it make them feel better about themselves they're not helping matters they're making them worse why do people feel they must pass their one sided judgement on other people's questions does it occur to them that their way might not be the right way alot of people have a problem stepping off their high horses and realizing that life is different for everyone i know how you feel i was unable to breastfeed because my body just didn't let me and i to got downsized i also stay at home with my children and not because i have to but because i can sure daycare is fine but i have the opportunity to watch them grow up in what i believe is the most precious years for both us and them and i to get downsized but really its all about how you take it sure they can talk and criticize but does it really matter is their ranting and pointing of fingers going to make you change your life style or look at yourself as being a great mom to your kids cause in the long run its really about them not these idiots that rather talk about you instead of paying attention to what they should reallybe paying attention to like themselves Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Laura Schlessinger Procrastination Milton H.
