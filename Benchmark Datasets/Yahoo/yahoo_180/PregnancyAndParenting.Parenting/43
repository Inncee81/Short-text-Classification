what do you think when you see a child or a teenager cuss drink and smoke in the presence of their parents i wonder how a parent would allow their child to cuss drink and smoke in their presence not only that they allow them to have their girlfriends and boyfriends spend the night also they have the nerve to tell their parents what they ain't going to do i am over and to this day when my parents tell me to do something i do it no back talk or anything i would never form my mouth to cuss in front of my parents i would still be wearing the handprint accross my bottom then you see the gross disrespect for adults i could not act up in school because the teacher would get my butt then i would get it again when i got home before anyone says that i don't know what it is to be a parent i am a parent of a year old and we do not tolerate disrespect in our home or to other adults what goes through your mind when you see all that parents are letting their kids get away with nowadays i'm and pregnant with my first my two younger brothers and i would have never done that stuff growing up my husband and i won't tolerate it out of our child yes my brothers and i fought like any siblings will but we respected adults and generally did what we were supposed to occasionally if we back talked we go in big trouble we knew not to mess with mom or dad or there would be consequences we are now and and none of us has ever been in any real trouble my parents have even told me that they feel lucky and blessed to have had such good kids i think it's irresponsible to let your kids drink smoke and excessively cuss in front of you if they get away with doing that in front of their parents imagine what they do when alone with friends and no supervision parents need to be the ones to step up and teach their kids what is right and what is wrong because no one else is going to do it for them i've heard parents say i'd rather them do that with me then where i have no idea what's going on but if you allow them to do it with you they will just do worse when you are not there but of course what do i know i'm just a year old i know there are people who won't agree with me but this is my opinion Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Laura Schlessinger Avenue Q Friends Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Recurring South Park characters About a Boy The Adventures of Pete & Pete 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Infantilism Boston Public The Catcher in the Rye The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Great Teacher Onizuka EastEnders Kodocha Calvin and Hobbes The Smoking Room The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Hollyoaks The Fairly OddParents Pitaten Witches (Discworld) My Life as a Teenage Robot Once and Again FLCL Springfield Elementary School Malcolm in the Middle For Better or For Worse Teachers (film) Doug George Costanza Raisins (South Park episode) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Milton H.
