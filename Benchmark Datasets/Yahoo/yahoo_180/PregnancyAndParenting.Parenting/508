why do so many people condemn other people when they decide to have a baby when they are not married i can understand for youn teenagers but what about people who are in their mid to late 's or even early 's i had kids without being married and i wouldn't have changed a thing sometimes marriage isn't for everyone and if there is nothing wrong just being in a comitted realtionship without marriage times are changing people i'm and recently married but i see it on here all the time with people in their mid 's trying to conceive and people always saying why aren't you married yet or something to that affect you don't have to be married to be a loving supportive father or mother i agree with you and i see you have attracted just some of the people you were talking about there's nothing wrong with not being married i have been in a very stable relationship like marriage in all ways except the paperwork for years we don't have any kids yet but if we did happen to get pregnant what difference would it make if we were married none he will be an awesome dad whether he marries me or not and would i be less of a mother for not completing a certain ceremony i don't think so Friends Marriage Neighbours Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Knots Landing EastEnders Divorce Pedophilia Laura Schlessinger Days of our Lives About a Boy Teenage pregnancy Fathers' rights Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Polyamory Homosexuality and Judaism Rick Santorum Charmed Father Human sexual behavior Stewie Griffin Fiddler on the Roof Keith Richards Incest Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Same-sex marriage One Tree Hill (TV series) Philosophical skepticism Henry Fonda Sharon Tate The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Ex-gay Ayyavazhi mythology Love The O.C.
