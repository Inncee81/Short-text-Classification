year old daughter likes self stimulation my five year old daughter has found well herself i've always planned on raising her to be sexually healthy and read all the books about talking about anatomy correctly not calling it your teetee or nunu or anything like that and i know that in theory that means that i should not put negative connotation on her self exploration i do not however know how to start the conversation i was prepared for a little bit older than this has any one addressed this with your child what worked i'm more worried about the why questions that will come from it than anything she is perfectly normal my year old has discovered herself as well she doesn't see it as a sexual thing so you don't have to worry about having a full blown sex talk yet just keep it simple i do not discourage it but i do tell her that it is something that she does in the privacy of her bedroom and not in public so that she understands that it is by no means a bad thing and that this is a special part of the body that is just for her and touching should be done at home it would also be appropriate to add that no one else should ever touch it except a doctor or a parent who is bathing them hope i helped and please ignore the people who are trying to tell you that she has been molested there is absolutely no correlation between innocent exploration and sexual abuse Infantilism Child sexuality Sexual orientation Theory of conduct Abortion debate Incest Childlove movement Prostate cancer Social rule Human sexual behavior Sexual abuse Child sexual abuse Dissociative identity disorder Rick Santorum Extreme Programming Anne Rice Philosophy of language Reparative therapy Phoebe Halliwell Nudity Justification (theology) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Computer numbering formats Dead Like Me EastEnders Goodness and value theory Gay Motion picture rating system Transactional analysis Economic inequality Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal The Human Stain Motivation Avenue Q Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Rape Breastfeeding Singlish Sento Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Video game controversy Masters and Johnson Richard Feynman Philosophical skepticism Plame affair Mary Wollstonecraft Domestic violence Milton H.
