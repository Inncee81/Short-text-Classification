at what age should discipline begin and what method s should be used and what should you do for discipline obviously a young toddler is too young to be grounded and a teen too old to be spanked i am very curious to have other's input because there are so many opinions on this subject and i am in the process of doing a very informal local study of the behavior of friends kids who use various discipline techniques and what age they began using them i have had people tell me i am too easy on my youngest months and others tell me i am too hard on her to date the worst punishment she has ever had was a tap on the butt and me yelling no when she tried to bolt into the street after discovering how to unlatch the gate but no gets used a lot in this home and that's a no no bad for baby so she gets that it's bad or can hurt her i have no qualms about tapping that diaper but i save it for the real serious stuff so it retains it's shock value the bible says from infancy it also speaks of knowing your children because each is different my year old can just get a look from me and she straightens up but my year old is one that responds to spankings or the threat of one my year old needs to be talked too and occasionally tapped on the rear but like you said not often so the shock value is there Spanking Infantilism Erotic spanking Kimberly-Clark Corporation Buttocks Beavis and Butt-head Parenting Stewie Griffin Teen Girl Squad Corporal punishment Human sexual behavior Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theory of conduct Child Ron and Fez Rich Mullins Child abuse Paddle (spanking) Boston Public Ageplay Breastfeeding Plame affair Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Rocko's Modern Life Science Child sexuality Child time-out Codename: Kids Next Door Recurring South Park characters Hazing The Sims 2 Second language acquisition Jennifer Lopez Opie and Anthony Computer science Milton H.
