what do small children call the birth father they see a few times a year for a few weeks i live in canada and my nd year old kids are with thier mother and step father in ohio the kids see me times a year for about weeks at a time the step father has been in the picture since the childrens birth and so have i though not as much for obvious reasons i love my kids and pay support and consider myself thier daddy the kids refer to the stepdad as daddy and my ex now has the kids calling me by my given name i am not comfortable with this as i was raised to believe it is disrespectful to refer to your parents by thier first name i would like to ask people to put themselves in the position of the birth father the mother the stepfather and the children and come up with an idea of what the children should be encouraged to call me the birth father you are the father your ex is trying to replace you with the stepdad and that is not fair to the kids the kids are too young to understand what she is doing if she keeps going on with this with them calling their own father by his name when they get older they will get confused she is trying to replace you and use him as a subsitute for you for the kids tell her that you don't like this and how this will affect the kids when they get older and find out that their dad is not even their real dad i call my stepfather dad because i dont have a real dad he left my mom when she was pregnant i have never met him or even heard from him but you are in the picture and they need to know who their father is About a Boy Fathers' rights Humphrey Bogart Melanie Wilkes Kyle Broflovski Springfield Elementary School Situation comedy Billy the Kid Friends Dad's Army American Dad!
