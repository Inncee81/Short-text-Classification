how can i get a condom out of my vagina please dont report this is serious please dont report me last night i had sex and the condom slipped off well when we realized that the condom slipped off we thought it was on the ground and just continued without well when we were finished we searched around for it and then i thought it was in my vagina well i had my sister check it and is in there but we cant get it out anybody ever had this problem how did u get it out please go to the gynocologist or if you don't have one your family doctor i have never personally had it happen but smack the guy who did that because the base of the condom should be held during the removal of the p nis from the v gina and he should've known that if he didn't know that then he is too immature young to be having sex in the first place if the condom was in your v ginal canal then there is a possibility that the s men released in the condom may have leaked out of the condom into your v ginal canal if a condom is your only method of birth control then you should see your health care provider to receive the emergency contraception pill the emergency contraceptive pills ecp are estrogen and or progestin compound that can decrease the chances of pregnancy after unprotected intercourse ecp is most effective soon after unprotected sex and is of no less if started after hours but can still be effective for up to days after unprotected sex best of luck Emergency contraception Oral contraceptive Condom Birth control Fertility awareness Safe sex Menstrual cycle Intrauterine device Sex education Oral sex Anal sex Sexual intercourse Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cup Endometriosis AIDS Hormone replacement therapy Herpes simplex virus Sexual abstinence Depo Provera Urinary incontinence Androgen insensitivity syndrome Harm reduction AIDS pandemic Teenage pregnancy Gonorrhoea Sex toy Cervical cap Strap-on dildo Rape Abortion debate Sexual revolution Barebacking Masturbation Diaphragm (contraceptive) Progesterone Sexual dysfunction Gay bathhouse History of intersex surgery Prolactinoma Pornographic movie Crystal methamphetamine and sex Cancer Vagina Obstetrics Fecal incontinence Childbirth Coitus interruptus Abortion Hypertension Progesterone only pill Unsafe sexual practices Human sexual behavior In vitro fertilisation Personal lubricant Humanae Vitae Douche Twin Apollo 8 Caffeine Medical analysis of circumcision Prostitution Gliding action Herbert Garrison Acne Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vagina dentata Estrogen Breast Biology and sexual orientation Genital wart Prostate cancer Ectopic pregnancy Human sexuality Migraine Margaret Sanger Cervical cancer Triage AIDS in Africa Orgasm Lawrence v.
