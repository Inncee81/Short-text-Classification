my mom said my leg looks swollen i broke my leg about years ago every now and then it hurts but this is the first time my mom's said that it looks swollen sort of related but if you broke your leg when you were ten is that leg going to grow slower than the unbroken one my mom's trying to figure out why my walk is weird she's considering taking me to the doctor or back to my physical therapist thanks if you broke your leg years ago maybe it did not heal right i have heard of situations where the leg was not healing right and the doctor had to break it again and then re set the leg so the leg could heal properly maybe this is the case with you your mom is absolutely right in taking you to the doctor you need to get an x ray and have the doctor look at your leg immediately he will then decide if you need to see the physical therapist or maybe have an operation to correct it i personally think the leg did not heal properly when you broke it about years ago and since you were still growing the leg did not grow properly along with you i think that maybe you should see an orthopedic doctor please go as soon as possible and don't be scare i believe that this can be corrected i wish you the best of luck Hip fracture Piccolo Junior Saga Weight training Medicine Orthopedic surgery Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Diving Shaggy dog story Spina bifida Massage Aerial (dance move) Great Teacher Onizuka Avenue Q Iliotibial band syndrome Milton H.
