what can i do for a pulled muscle in the back of my leg i pulled a muscle in my leg probably three weeks ago when i initially did it it was just stiff but now the pain is unbearable people have told me because it's healing is the reason it hurts so badly it is the worse in the morning after i have laid in bed i wake up crying and can barely walk i have severe muscle spasms and shooting pains down my leg after i get it moving the pain decreases enough for me to bare it and get through the day any suggestions on what to do to make the healing process better is it true as it heals it hurts worse i have iced it elevated it and taken pain medication why does it hurt so badly in the morning or if i'm mobile for a period of time i haven't been to a doctor yet because i was trying to see if i can do something beforehand and it is worse in the mornings after laying mobile for the night you got to do some physical therapy out stretch it out alternating ice and heat i ripped my hamstring and it took months to heal it can be a season ending injury for football players the most important thing is get that leg moving and stretching try to stay off of it all the time it will take longer to heal see your dr and get a referral to a pt clinic good luck Myocardial infarction Milton H.
