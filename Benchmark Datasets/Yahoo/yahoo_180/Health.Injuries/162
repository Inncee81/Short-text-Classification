should i go to the doctors or er the day before yesterday in the pool i think i twisted my ankle but when i got out it just felt weak but didnt hurt yesterday i woke up and it hurt to walk and it was swollen but no bruising so my mom said to put my ankle support on and carried on limping today i have woken up and it had swollen again and i can barely walk without my ankle support and is painful to walk even with my ankle support on so i have iced it and the swelling has gone down but it feels like its getting worse should i go to the doctors or er or just leave it to heal on its own by the way i'm mary xxx hi mary it sounds as though there is a strong possibility your ankle has a fracture a fracture is damage to a bone it could be just cracked but a crack is still a fracture if it is fractured it will usually take a while for bruising to appear and you will probably be in too much pain to leave ice on it to be certain your doctor needs an x ray of you ankle he can see the problem clearly if it's the bone that's injured if your ankle is only sprained the following treatments should have helped rest stay off it as much as possible ice use cold packs to reduce the swelling compression wrap a rollar bandage around it for support elevation keep it up and rested the more your feet are low the more gravity will send blood and swelling there and increase the pain Bruise Equine conformation Hip fracture Bone fracture Professional wrestling holds Carpal tunnel syndrome Traumatic brain injury First aid Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Pain Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Hiking Chronic fatigue syndrome Osteoarthritis Intracranial pressure Spanking Kurt Angle High-heeled shoe Weight training Penis Cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Myocardial infarction Aerial (dance move) Jessica Lynch Osteoporosis Wound Cocaine Stress fracture Paget's disease of bone Tattoo Cellulitis Diablo II Items in the Metroid series Anterior cruciate ligament Naruto jutsu Professional wrestling slang Psoriasis Yosemite National Park Chiropractic Multiple myeloma Radiation therapy Human adaptation to space Physical examination Knife Poker jargon The Dalek Invasion of Earth Snakebite (bite) Decompression sickness Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Avalanche Traditional Chinese medicine Drowning Babe Ruth Foot Leukemia Andr__ the Giant Intravenous therapy Inflammation Triage Skull fracture Tobacco smoking Pope John Paul I Group A streptococcal infection Blood (computer game) Hydrotherapy Seismic retrofit Diabetic retinopathy Obstetrics Dairy Harp Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Urinary incontinence Suplex Diabetic neuropathy Self-harm Childbirth Iliotibial band syndrome Platypus Hemorrhoid Hal Trosky Post Polio syndrome James Augustus Grant Alternative medicine Poliomyelitis Fracture 21st Century Fox The Shining (film) Massage
