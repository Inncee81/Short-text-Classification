my son's fever my ten month old son suddenly came on with a fever thursday night around i was visiting my folks and i noticed he was hot i figured no big deal because he's hot natured when i got home i took his temp and it was at gave him ibuprofen and it when away well it's been like this for a day now i'd say hours fever goes away with fever reducer but comes back hours later when the medicine wears off so what do i do he's not lethargic he's not too cranky about as cranky as a baby can be with a fever he's sleeping well and eating a bit he's aslo drinking lots of clear fluids like gatorade and pedialite so he seems fine other than the fact that this fever wont leave he's not coughing or sneezing not even grabbing for his ear and it's not teething that's just a myth i'm just worried that there may be an underlying factor here that's causing this temperature to rise thus fighting off an infection i didn't take him to the doctor yesterday because additional details seconds ago they were closed and i don't want to take him to the er because it's not that big of an emergency unless his fever gets any higher with treatment i just don't know what's going on with him and would like some opinions on what i should do i was thinking a minor emergency center but then i'd have to not treat the fever so i don't bring him in without a fever because he was given medicine but then i don't want to not give him medicine just to show the doctor that he's feverish but i don't want to make him miserable ahhh i'm worrying too much help me please thanks his fever has been up and down since thursday night ranging from never higher and sometimes lower just thought i'd add that your baby should be fine he may have a little bug and the fever is his body's way of getting rid of it youre doing everything right if his fever is still present tomorrow then take him to a minor med place Common cold Urinary incontinence Malaria Fever Group A streptococcal infection Childbirth Chronic fatigue syndrome Hyperthermia Medicine Breastfeeding First aid Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pneumonia Rocky Mountain spotted fever Asthma Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Gout Ebola Traumatic brain injury Hay fever Thermoregulation Stomach cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Foodborne illness Charles Darwin's illness Alternative medicine Humphrey Bogart Tuberculosis Billboard Hot 100 Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Roseola Piccolo Junior Saga Dialysis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) EastEnders Knots Landing Hypoglycemia Angel One (TNG episode) Stroke Multiple sclerosis Insomnia Prostate cancer Ron and Fez Sleep apnea Infectious mononucleosis Sunburn AIDS Soap opera Folic acid Psoriasis AFI 100 Years series Vampire Cliff Richard Al-Razi Yellow fever DDT Influenza Mosquito Mesothelioma Bipolar disorder Intravenous therapy Marburg virus Rais massacre Aerial (dance move) The Shining (film) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Carpal tunnel syndrome Shock Diabetes mellitus Paracetamol Osteoarthritis Ocean's Twelve Hepatitis C Snake History of medicine Bubonic plague Climate of the United Kingdom New York Giants Drowning Fancy rat Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Motor oil Fertility awareness The Contender (television series) Lyme disease Cancer Chocolate Blood pressure Hiccup
