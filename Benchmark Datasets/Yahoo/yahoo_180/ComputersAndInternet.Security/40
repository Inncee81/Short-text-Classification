what is the purpose for quarantine if the spyware virus is quarantined does it mean that its deleted from my computer and if i go to the quarantine box and check remove does that mean that the virus is deleted or sent back to infect files im sorry guys im not really computer literate when you quarantine a file you place it in a specific folder that your antivirus is watching it cannot copy itself worms normally do this and the file cannot be executed from an outside file i e another piece of the virus that may not have been found yet viruses or bugs get placed into quarantine when they don't have a way to heal the file some viruses change other files and infect them rather then deleting an important file that's infected you can sometimes heal from the virus and still have a perfectly fine file without the problems of the virus by quarantineing an infected file you can then fix the file and return it back to normal operation without deleting an important file when you remove a file from quarantine you are deleting it off your computer Computer virus Malware Anti-virus software Windows XP Computer security Spyware Trojan horse (computing) Stopping e-mail abuse Rootkit Microsoft Windows Computer worm Quarantine File system Mydoom Filename extension Software bug Trusted computing Virus Java programming language File Allocation Table ITunes Linked list Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Computer file Windows 2000 Library (computer science) Internet security CIH virus System/34 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome System/36 E-mail spam Blue screen of death Bluetooth Mouse (computing) OS/2 NX bit Surveillance Resident Evil Outbreak Diablo II: Lord of Destruction C programming language Hash table World of Warcraft Resident Evil Outbreak: File 2 Macintosh Finder Gmail AmigaOS MDAC Peer-to-peer Virtual memory Backup PaX Computer Internet Explorer System 7 (Macintosh) Pneumonia Common criticisms of Microsoft Outlook Express Medical prescription Cytomegalovirus Sobig worm Magic number (programming) Cascading Style Sheets Kazaa E-mail Progress of the SARS outbreak MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Buffer overflow Foodborne illness Steam (content delivery) CPU cache Timeline of notable computer viruses and worms H5N1 John Sheppard (Stargate) History of Microsoft Windows Software testing Host file Enterprise content management Red-black tree HyperCard Mac OS X Rabies File format USB flash drive Hacker (computer security) The Cursed Videotape Computer surveillance Screensaver Directory Spam (electronic) JavaScript Morris worm Web crawler Partition (computing) HIV test
