is it illegal for employers to ask for experience my sister said she tried to put an advert out for an experienced stylist for her salon but was told its illegal to ask for experience as its discrimination i am looking for an it career for the first time and the vast majoirty of jobs ask for experience does this mean anything so basically they ask for experience if they are told not to they just wont hire anyone without experience anyways i have seen jobs in it at entry level in the last weeks of job searching the rest all require years experience or something which normal people cant experience unless your in a corporate environment to use the software to begin with so basically is it just best to apply for all possible jobs uk law in october the employment equality age regulations cam into force this law basically made it illegal to discriminate on the grounds of age both old and young in your sisters case for example putting in a job advert saying that you require applicants to have a certain amount of experience may be discrimination on the grounds of age because in short you are asking older people to apply i e an older person is more likely to have more experience than a younger person however there are circumstances when it is legal to discriminate but there has to be a 'genuine occupational requirement' goq for example an actor may have to be a certain age or it is justifiable to ask for more experience another example if you were looking for a manager to lead a team of people it may be justifiable to ask for applicants that have people management experience or degree educated but only if you feel that you can prove the job needs it if you have applied for a job but have been told that you do not have enough experience you can challenge the decision and ask the company how they have justified it whilst the age regs where well reported when they received royal assent and became law many companies have fallen into the trap of discriminating against employees and applicants in discrimination law you do not need to be an employee of a company in order to claim against it recruitment is a good example of this good luck Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Affirmative action Civil rights Trade union Economic inequality Appeal Equal Protection Clause European Convention on Human Rights Charter of the French Language Immigration to the United States Royal Assent Unlawful combatant Psychology Legal aspects of transsexualism Business ethics Same-sex marriage Australian constitutional law Wal-Mart Gay rights Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Corporate personhood Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Israeli Arab Apple Computer Judicial review Labour economics Life insurance Microeconomics Software engineering Microsoft Free trade Health insurance Workers' compensation Price discrimination Lawrence v.
