standardized exams i say that standardized exams are given for reasons to make money because each test taker has to pay a lot of money for a test s that he or she may not pass before or tries to control the amount of applicants for a job if there are too many people applying for a job only a chosen few can be hired this is very true especially in big cities like ny or chicago to discriminate against people who do not have a solid educational background in other words not everyone can get a private school education your view um no first sometimes private school education is often worse than public school education that's particularly true of the parochial schools they aren't made to discriminate the tests are supposed to measure your skills or knowledge in certain areas i don't think it is good to judge a college applicants based off of their sat or act scores alone but the tests can give good guidelines obviously if a student only makes a on one section on the test and the school normally accepts most students that are in the low six hundreds or above in that section the student who got the probably wouldn't be prepared to do the work at that college also test are the only way to compare students fairly how can you compare two students' grades when you can't take into account factors like one kid had a harder teacher if you have no way of knowing that information you cannot so you need the tests to level the playing field and the same goes with work tests for instance would you want to send your taxes to be worked on by an accountant who didn't pass the cpa exam no because you wouldn't be able to trust that the person working on your taxes actually knows what he she is doing if he she didn't pass the cpa exam and i'll agree the tests are expensive but we need them Education in the United States SAT College admissions Graduate school Affirmative action GED Education in the People's Republic of China Test (student assessment) Grade (education) Education in Romania Education in Portugal Theory of conduct Education in Germany Juris Doctor No Child Left Behind Act Microeconomics Numerus clausus Gross domestic product Law school School choice Tripartite System Public education A-level Homeschooling Standardized testing Philosophical skepticism Item response theory Economic inequality Inflation Education in Taiwan American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Education Certified Public Accountant ELO rating system Coalition Provisional Authority Plame affair Charter school Education in Hong Kong National Certificate of Educational Achievement Notary public Education in Australia Taxation in the United States Intelligence quotient Supply and demand Boston Public IB Diploma Programme Life insurance Professor Medical College Admission Test Establishment Clause of the First Amendment James Randi Independent school (UK) Unemployment Secondary education in France Accountancy Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) The Princeton Review Student loan Fair use Tax Education in Singapore Medical school Higher education in Japan Lawyer Credit card Computer Education in Austria Equal Protection Clause Psychometrics Prostate cancer Software engineering Paralegal Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination 401(k) Flat tax Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Insurance Private school High school Race and intelligence Poker jargon Social Security (United States) Physician Doomsday argument Public good Education in Finland Stuyvesant High School Education in Sweden Martin J.
