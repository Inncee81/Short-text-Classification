where exactly thesis statement should be located prefer you taken act test okay here's the problem throughout what i learn from high school and while i was studying for the act writing test i knew that thesis statement should be at the last sentence of introduction however sparknote guide for the act said first sentence of introduction with general supporting details behind it does it even matter to the writing standards for act test usually it is the last sentence however with the act writing test as well as the sat writing test if you ever take that you won't want to spend your time writing a fluffy introduction they don't tell you much anyhow so keep it short i only gave my introduction two sentences a thesis statement as the first one and a little bit to elaborate on the thesis in the second sentence when i did the sat writing test you'll want to spend more time writing about the examples in the body paragraphs GED Graduate school TeX Essay Bogdanov Affair Logic Ludwig Wittgenstein Plame affair English grammar Epistemology G__del's incompleteness theorem Ethics Donald Davidson (philosopher) SAT Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Juris Doctor IBM PC compatible Causality American and British English differences Visual Basic Law School Admissions Test First Amendment to the United States Constitution Written Cantonese Taiwanese (linguistics) Philosophy of language C plus plus Markup language Guy Davenport Turing test Perl Python programming language Democracy Germaine Greer Socrates Education in the United States Greek language Guide for the Perplexed Appeal Whose Line Is It Anyway?
