how to ace the lsat i'm considering law school after college graduation is at least two years away how do i prepare for the lsat i'm particularly concerned with the logical reasoning and analytical reasoning sections both of which i tanked on when i took the sample test thank you in advance for your assistance if you are scoring low either take a prep course or get personal tutoring however since you probably won't take the lsat until next year you shouldn't start one of those now wait until the exam gets closer and in the meantime do some self study for studying on your own these were the best books i used powerscore logic games bible powerscore logical reasoning bible kaplan lsat the first two actually cover the two topics you mentioned as being a problem so i'm betting those would help you out the third book covers the test in general and has some good tips you will need to practice what you are learning so get actual tests from law services the people who make the test the next actual official lsat preptests more actual official lsat preptests actual official lsat preptests lsat prep tests individually numbered if you work through the first three books on the list you would be in pretty good shape in terms of strategies and then do a ten or twenty tests from the second group of books after that the following books give explanations for test questions lsat superprep get prepped lsat explained powerscore games setup guide the decision to take a course after self studying probably will rest on how well you are scoring if you are doing well then skip the course if not then maybe a course can get you over that final hurdle i'd play it by ear and see how the self study goes first i actually think taking a prep course is the most efficient way to prepare if you have a short amount of time but you have over a year so if you do decide to take a course the main benefits of a class are that a they lay out the strategies for you so you don't have to figure them out on your own you also have a source to go to when you have questions or need help b they provide plenty of study material and that material is directed in a particular way c they structure your preparation in a way that self studying cannot d you meet other people in the same position you are in and it helps to have friends who can motivate you to study do the classes help like a lot of things part of it hinges on whether you put the time in i took powerscore and i ended up scoring well i do know that i worked pretty hard though whatever class you choose find a class that uses a lot of real lsat's and find out who your instructor will be try to get someone with a lot of teaching experience and a high score having a good instructor makes a big difference good luck GED Law school Education in the United States Logic The Princeton Review Theory of conduct Graduate school Kaplan Economics Legal research Education in Romania Poker jargon Medical College Admission Test Prostate cancer Education in the People's Republic of China Causality Ra (board game) A Course In Miracles Game theory Test (student assessment) Science Cricket Philosophy of language Expert system Dog agility Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Advanced Placement Program Ethics Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses The nature of God in Western theology Strategic management Extreme Programming Cognitive science Altruism Expository preaching Betting (poker) Aristotle Juris Doctor Intelligent design movement Scientific method Education in Germany Normal distribution Mathematics Social rule Biblical inerrancy Explosive material Law of value Music Theodicy Second language acquisition Intelligent design Pitaten Martial art Education in Australia Alcoholics Anonymous Doomsday argument Quizbowl Fair use Chess strategy and tactics Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Philosophy Craps Japanese tea ceremony Homeschooling Sheepshead Professor Education John Lott Predestination Current teachings of Prem Rawat Bayesian inference Laws of cricket Texas hold 'em Baseball Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Summa Theologiae Physics Quicksort Philosophy of mathematics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Information Services Procurement Library Education in Taiwan Urantia Alexander Technique Dyslexia The Book of Five Rings Plame affair Rudolf Hermann Lotze 2000 Australian Grand Prix Talmud
