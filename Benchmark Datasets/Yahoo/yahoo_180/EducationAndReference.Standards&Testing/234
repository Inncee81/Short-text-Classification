how can improve on my math section of my sats is there any way i can improve on my own as i look for a tutor anything will be helpful thanks please don't just tell me practice i obviously am if i asked this question as i teach my own child mathematics i start to understand a lot more about teaching being good at maths when i was young has little to do with my ability to teach my own child i find out that the ability for a child to understand mathematics well is the ability to think relate and handle abstract ideas and if the child is gifted with this ability it will be very easy to teach otherwise it's a very difficult thing therefore you would need to assess yourself or ask some one who knows to help you to assess your inner mathematical ability then some ideas can be drawn about how you should learn mathematics you can also look at all your school reports and past tests to see how you score in different sections of mathematics you will find that you won't be good on all of them you should do this with help from a teacher or experienced adult it depends on your endowment of mathematical ability to choose how you study if you not gifted then the only way is fall back to mastering the basics well it's quite surprising that mastering the basics well can eventually lead you to wake up the hidden abilities in your mind if you feel that you are not good at maths you can embark on a journey back to the past you pick up your maths text for year and rapidly relearn the concepts from year all the way to your current year while you do this you might like to pretend that you are a teacher just put a doll in front of you and pretend that you teach a child and find different ways to teach same idea to the child the broadening of approaches to the understanding of the same problem will help your nerves to connect many hidden abilities together it's like having abroad foundation will allow you to build a very tall building i also heard that now you can get a tutor via the internet from india and pay quite little that's one option to explore too but the first step is to self assess your mathematical ability good luck Mathematics SAT GED Education in Romania Education in the United States Extreme Programming Second language acquisition No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Homeschooling Scientology beliefs and practices Current teachings of Prem Rawat Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Swami Vivekananda Education in Germany Alexander Technique Western philosophy Scientific method Charter school Infantilism Theory of multiple intelligences Dyslexia Autism Craps Literacy Standardized testing Incarnations of Immortality Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Education in Hong Kong About a Boy Cognitive science Reiki Psychoanalysis Richard Feynman Graduate school Gifted Jiddu Krishnamurti Theory of conduct Science A Course In Miracles Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Economics Socrates Arthur Cayley George Lakoff Randomness W.
