are you studying for the lsat which sections have you found most difficult do you have any tips i'm not studying for the lsat anymore but i did study for it before i think most people find logic games the most difficult but for me i found the logical reasoning section to be the trickiest i did everything you pretty much can do to prepare took a class read a bunch of books even got a little tutoring if you don't take a class make sure to get some of the better books out there the two powerscore lsat bibles and kaplan's seemed like the best to me after you read those make sure you take a bunch of real practice tests buy a couple of the lsac real lsat books and practice with those exams religiously and time yourself constantly if you do take a class i took powerscore but i hear some of the others are pretty good too just make sure you find a class with a high scoring teacher and one that uses a lot of real questions good luck SAT Kaplan The Princeton Review Medical College Admission Test Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism GED Law school Education in the United States Bar examination Grade (education) Education in Romania Graduate school Test (student assessment) Logic A Course In Miracles Advanced Placement Program Theory of conduct The Sims 2: University Graduate Record Examination Expository preaching Debugging Intelligent design movement Martial art Productive and unproductive labour Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Philosophical skepticism Social rule Friedrich Schleiermacher Classical education Final Fantasy XI Lawyer Bernard Williams Joke Great Teacher Onizuka College admissions Jacob Neusner Team Fortress Classic Church of Christ, Scientist You Don't Know Jack New England School of Law Expert system Academia Separation of church and state in the United States Prices of production Jewish philosophy Homeschooling Hogwarts subjects Popular culture studies Halakha Education David Hume Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Time Out of Mind Kodocha Ludwig Wittgenstein Vacuous truth Sydney Riot of 1879 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Hogwarts Complexity classes P and NP Extreme Programming Origen Regression toward the mean Arianne Creationism Education in Germany Pitaten Jeopardy!
