would an ap passing score over ride that same subject previously taken at a local college example i got a b when i took u s history at our local college but it is mandatory for me to take u s history in high school right now so i choose to take the ap u s history course to keep up my ranking when i pass the ap u s history test will the ap score over ride the previous b i had for that course when i took it in college thanks personally i think you should go talk to your guidance counselor about the fact that you have taken us history in community college you might not have to take ap us history or any us history course which would really be a waste of time and i think when you go to a year college you will just end up receiving transfer credit for a b in both of the college courses you took in the us history survey luckily transfer credit is not used in calculating your college gpa Grade (education) Education in the United States National Certificate of Educational Achievement College admissions Education in Germany Advanced Placement Program Law school SAT Affirmative action Community college Education in Sweden Graduate school University of Michigan College Board GED High school Hunter College High School Medical school Education in Romania Torquay United F.C.
