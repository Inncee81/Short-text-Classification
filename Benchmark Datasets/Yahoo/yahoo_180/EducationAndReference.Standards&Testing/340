best way to prepare for the sat acts should i try a tutor or just use those study books i'm not stupid i do well in school and everything but i dont want to be under prepared for these tests i purchased a study guide by the princeton review with practice sats and practice psat the edition with explained answers well here's what my teacher said last year if you're pretty well off in school like a gpa of then you probably don't need a tutor and just having a book is enough i've done practice sats now and i'm really confident that i'll get a very high score especially since it has the new essay section so if you get a book i highly suggest this one remember most people take the sats about times so study hard but don't be too nervous about it also online at sparknotes com you can get sat questions and a lot more help with school alright do what you do peace GED The Princeton Review PSAT/NMSQT Kaplan College admissions Standardized testing Homeschooling Test (student assessment) Education in the United States United States Academic Decathlon Intelligence quotient Scholarship Law School Admissions Test Grade (education) Baccalaur__at Affirmative action Education in Hong Kong A Course In Miracles Graduate school Medical College Admission Test IQ and the Wealth of Nations Extreme Programming Belmont Abbey College A Tale of a Tub Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Education in England National Certificate of Educational Achievement John Rawls Theory of conduct Graduate Record Examination Law school Education in France Democratic peace theory Advanced Placement Program Martial art New Trier High School Education in Romania Charles Darwin's education Psychology Eugene Wigner Federalist Papers Treehouse of Horror V No Child Left Behind Act College Board Marshall McLuhan Cognitive science Sex education Education Science Bernard Williams Stevens Institute of Technology Many-worlds interpretation Current teachings of Prem Rawat Philosophy of mathematics Consciousness Nicomachean Ethics Benjamin Jowett Model (economics) Jonathan Edwards (theologian) Education in Germany Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Chiropractic Social rule Parapsychology Economics Legal research Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kodocha University of Southern California Meditation Saved by the Bell Japanese tea ceremony Tutor Avenue Q Charles Darwin Zen Aristotle Teacher Cult She Loves You Harrow School Physics The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Aikido Federalist No. 10 Philosophical skepticism Education reform Catechism Hogwarts African American contemporary issues Medical school Adult attention-deficit disorder Frank Herbert Juris Doctor Development of Darwin's theory Dilbert Education in Taiwan The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy British House of Commons
