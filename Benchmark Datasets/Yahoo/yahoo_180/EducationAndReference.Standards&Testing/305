tutorfox sat guide has anyone had success with it it seems like the people who claim that it helped are the ones affiliated with the site thank you for noticing that i personally haven't heard anyone say good things about it but the people person affiliated with the site if you do a google search for tutorfox it brings up a scant thousand results almost all of which are from yahoo answers or similar sites where one or two people all the same guy in my opinion with different accounts have been flogging the book there was just the one guy on yahoo answers who was copying and pasting the exact same thing basically an advertisement for the book into every question about the sat when someone called him on it by asking a question similar to yours two or three other accounts on here popped up to defend it but you can see that they were just created after the questions were posted now that his first account has i think been deleted since using yahoo answers for advertising purposes is against the community guidelines he's got a new female version of himself giving the same copy and pasted answer you ve probably seen it when i first took the sat my score was low in the mid s but then i got the sat guide from tutorfox http www tutorfox com satguide html and my score went up to math writing reading i highly recommend this guide for anyone wishing to get a higher sat score when it was the old version of him it was the exact same thing only with if i recall a overall score or somewhere thereabouts it seems all of the answers he gave were deleted with his name though because i can t find them anymore even where i know he posted them he has gotten cleverer with it though and he ll actually give you a question specific answer on one account but it s easy to see that the very first answer he gave i dare say the reason that account was created was this question http malaysia answers yahoo com question index ylt apm zm elzyyuygawcjnxls qax qid aapm nj show profile info uvis unaa i m talking about benrosenstien but richard gomez is the same and it s easy to get best answer when you ve got multiple accounts to vote for yourself and almost all of his are chosen by voters not by the asker it s all about name recognition i suppose maybe it s a good book maybe it has some good tips in it but it s still very annoying to me the way he flogs it and i still recommend that people get something with credibility Theory of conduct Gmail HTTP cookie SAT Neopets Slashdot subculture HyperText Transfer Protocol GED Website Internet troll Search engine optimization Plame affair Google E-mail spam Cross site scripting Legal research H2G2 Plurality electoral system World Wide Web CPU cache Web traffic Open Directory Project The nature of God in Western theology English grammar Nicomachean Ethics Game show Google bomb The Apprentice 2 Karl Rove Google search Wikipedia Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act John Titor Expert system Ajax (programming) Representational State Transfer Slashdot trolling phenomena A Course In Miracles Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Match Game BitTorrent Scientology beliefs and practices Normal distribution Kasparov versus The World Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Goodness and value theory Spyware Bayesian inference Whose Line Is It Anyway?
