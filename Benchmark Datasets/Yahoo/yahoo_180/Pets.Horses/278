what to give her my horses are pastured down the road in a cousin s pasture with her horse i grain my horses every morning mainly to put weight on my mare and would like to give the other mare something so she does not feel left out and to make friends with her the thing is the mare is fat and does not need the sweet feed that i'm giving my horses what can i give her cheap that would not put more weight on the mare or will the little less then a of a scoop grain that i'm already giving her be fine what i mean by fat is a heathly wieght one more thing the horse is only on grass also i like to keep her away from my gelding when he eats because he is very agressive towards other animals at feeding time not humans i missed used the word fat what i had ment was she is fatter then my mare who is skinny i am not going to ride her she is yrs and unbroken and is not messed with that often i'd suggest just feeding her carrots not feeding her anything at all can cause some behavior problems because your other horse is getting grained you can feed quite a large amount of carrots without seeing any adverse effects on your mare so just tossing a handful in a bucket and giving it to her at the same time you feed your other horse is a good option Hamster Dairy Livestock Guinea pig Chinese New Year Breastfeeding Foie gras Equine conformation Sorghum Bread Anorexia nervosa Weed control Milk Chocolate Vegetarianism Cat Agriculture Charisma (horse) Jewish cuisine Mosquito Arabian horse Everton F.C.
