my school horse share your stories and answer my question please i've recently started lessons and i've fallen in love with the horse i'm on she's a buckskin quarter horse mare after a few months of riding i'm thinking of asking my instructor if i can ride her a bit out side of lessons what do you think if you have any stories about your horse or the school horse you ride please share them and also give your opinion for my question thanx in advance first you should definitely ask your instructor see if the horse that you're riding needs to be ridden outside of your lessons if she is under exercised on the days that you're not riding when you're really comfortable with her have a talk with your instructor ask her if you might be able to take the horse out on a couple of trail rides with another more advanced rider or another instructor ask her questions about what the mare is like on the trails remember before you go out on the trails you should be perfect at a walk and trot and be able to canter and jump at least a small fence this is for your safety once you've been riding out on the trails for a while and you're comfortable with it try to take the tests and apply for a license for riding on the trails on your own ask your instructor about getting a license as well even if you don't eventually get to ride her completely on your own still grab any opportunity to ride her during breaks that you have if you're in school lease her see if you can lease her for one or two weeks a full lease take the responsibility it's a great opportunity it will give you the chance to really experience owning a horse muck out the stall handle feeding and treats turn her out take her to the field for grass ride her in all of the lessons that you can and alone clean her tack and tack her up and untack her everything is a new adventure with horses basically take any chance that you get to be around her you never know someday you may be looking to buy a horse and the experience will have been very valuable to you i ride many many school horses i've had some good and bad experiences though one of the girls that i ride with is a pretty good rider and she rides some of the toughest horses at the stable i've seen her thrown and bucked and reared once a horse even bolted out of the door of the inside ring and right into the courtyard it was scary she was also testing for a higher level and in the warm up before the test her horse threw her and when she was still on the ground the horse stepped on her arm ouch i've also had an experience when i was bolted by a hugeee horse that was scary once when i was helping out around the stable my friend and i heard this clatter of hooves and all these people running around we ducked out of the barn and saw all of these people running towards the street with treats and hay a horse had escaped a paddock jumped the fence and trampled a whole field of tulips and gotten into the street i've also had amazing experiences the nervousness of testing i've even gotten a ribbon for top of the class once and once i got the opportunity to ride this white horse along the beach cantering it was amazing anyway this is already long have fun all the best nicky Equine conformation Hunt seat Horse tack Eventing Seabiscuit Martial art Cross-country equestrianism Motorcycle Milton H.
