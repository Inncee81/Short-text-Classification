have an extremely aggressive horse i can not get any groundwork done with one of my horses he is amazing in the show ring undersaddle but on the ground he has no respect for any human i have even had differnt trainers work with him and none of them are able to do a thing with him because he is to dangerous if you try to work on something simple like backing when you ask he just puts his ears back like yeah right then if i start to tap him on the chest with the whip hes rears up over my head and comes down at me striking out and choping his teeth if i try to lounge him he is constanly kicking at me with both feet on the lounge i do not let him run over me i always get him to do what i ask him to but it never seems to get any better and we just have a huge fight i dont like fighting with my horse i have tried methods straight out of my john lyons and clinton anderson books and get no results i have never met a horse like him he just despises people is there anything differnt i can do alright i will anwser some of your questions here he has always been fairly aggressive in the two years i have had him after the first two months i had him he was steadily getting more and more irritable i did have him check by my vet who found a pretty large bean in his sheath once that was removed he calmed down slightly but the agression never went away he is totally healthy now i have had proffesional trainers tell me to put him down because hes vicious i just really dont want to give up on him he is an amazing talented horse and has won me many blue ribbons in the time ive had him killing him just isnt an option i cant even tell you how many hours we have spent in the round pen with no improvement and i am very calm and paitent with him i dont get whip happy he just kindof comes after me and i stand my ground when he rears and such and dont show him that im afraid but really he has me terrified he has put me in the hospital times with those hooves i have been thinking about just quiting the groundwork because it seems to do nothing but piss him off he is a pretty good horse when hes only being worked undersaddle im just looking for an alternative to selling him or giving up on him i need some fresh idea of what to try with him ive been throught all of the hoorsemanship books watched all the tapes and i am stumped i'm assuming he is a gelding my first thought is that maybe he is a chryptoid that is he retained a testicle up inside of him and when they gelded him they decided not to do surgery to go get it these sound like stud dominance issues the reason why most horses are not left stallions is because they demonstrate these behaviors i would try to track down the owners that had him gelded and ask if this is the case surgery is expensive but can fairly easily be preformed i think for around good luck Equine conformation Poker jargon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Horse gait Shaggy dog story Seabiscuit Social rule Dog training Gray Wolf Theory of conduct Kurt Angle Boxing Horseshoe Piccolo Junior Saga Guinea pig Dog 1957 World Series Dog agility Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Beavis and Butt-head World Championship Wrestling Dragon Booster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ben Johnson (athlete) Hamster Arabian horse New York Giants Extreme Programming Fast bowling Professional wrestling attacks Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Professional wrestling throws Unreal Milton H.
