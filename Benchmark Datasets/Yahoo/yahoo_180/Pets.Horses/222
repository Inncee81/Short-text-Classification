is my mare pregnant hello everybody quick question for ya i bought a new mare a few months ago and she's been changing a little here lately i thought her teets looked a bit big when we got her but they said it was nothing then she started looking a little hollow in her flanks and i thought she needed to gain a little weight well she's on perfect fresh grass as much as she wants and the hollowness in her flanks is getting more pronounced now she has huge veins visible under her belly she is constantly lipping at us and rubbing her head on us for attention and tonight i noticed her teets are looking even a bit bigger when i got ahold of one to see if there was any waxy build up there was milk lots of milk i felt like i was milking a cow her udders aren't getting fuller but she had no shortage she's not getting wide from side to side when i look at her from the front but is there any other reason besides pregnancy for a horse to have milk oh i forgot to mention she's a y o hh percheron supposedly she's never had a foal before and i have no reason to believe the man i bought her from lied about that or anything else he told me about her if she's bred it's most likely with an american spotted draft that's just a little bigger than she is if she is pregnant how far from foaling is she considering she's got milk thanks a bunch guys can chaser i'll be calling the vet tomorrow right now it happens to be sunday night there don't seem to be any signs of imminant labor so i don't consider this an emergency thank you for your input but i was just hoping for some answers until i could get ahold of my vet first thing in the morning this is totally unexpected we're unprepared but it's still very exciting nina we paid for her assuming she wasn't pregnant she's extremely quiet and loving a very gentle ride she lives up to the breed expectations of personality guys i'm not milking her like she's a cow lol i was just saying it came squirting out really fast and plentifully in a steady stream i was expecting to see drop of wax not streaming actual milk i know how important colostrum is don't worry i'm not too bad of a beginner it would be my first foal but i've got horse expert friends on the phone with one right now and they'll be here in a moment's notice to help me if i need it i'm just really hoping this means she's pregnant i hope it's not the hormonal thing like the first answerer said i'm too happy and bouncy right now can i'm not upset at your answer at all i know alot of people come on here with the stupidest questions who really need to call the vet and not waste their time here i'm on the phone with a back up vet right now can't get ahold of mine don't think i'll be able to get ahold of mine until tomorrow morning can't get his pager number it very much sounds like your mare is pregnant and due to deliver soon where do you have her a birthing stall should be huge especially for a draft mare it's actually better for the mare to give birth in a pasture with nice grass birth for the mare will either go one of two ways horses almost always birth when your back is turned you may go inside for a minute nap and come out and find a foal that's great if the mare does all the work it's highly unlikely she needs human help however if things do go wrong they usually go horribly wrong for horses get some iodine for the foals umbilical cord spray or dip the umbilical cord as soon as possible after birth with iodine that seals up the cord and prevents the foal from getting an infection traveling through the wet umbilical cord worm your mare after she gives birth her hormone changes are signaling the worms in her gut to grow quickly and get ready to depart her body in mass this is the worms way of immediatly infecting the foal with worms very young foals will eat nibble on their dams manure this is entirely natural and along with worms if the mare is unwormed they are actually helping populate their own guts with very bennificial bacteria your mare is very friendly right now she may not like you at all after the birth of the foal my arab is like that she will follow me around me like a puppy begging me for attention and trying to follow me into the house once a foal hits the ground she hates me and all other humans she will do anything in her power to keep a foal away from humans for the first year of it's life start researching right now about imprinting a foal at birth you have a few hours time frame in which to acomplish this after the foal is born imprinting is basically touching the foal all over and in ways it will be handled as an adult you keep up the touching until the foal relaxes if the foal is tense or trying to pull away you have to keep up the lesson if not you have taught the foal when it's only a few hours old that it can dominate its will over a humans so to imprint that it's ok to have its feet handled i have the foal laying down with it's head in my lap i pull a foot gently to me if the foal tenses or trys to pull away i keep steady pressure until the foal gives in and relaxes firmly with the flat of my hand i slap the bottom of the hoof over and over again this mimic a shoe being nailed on the foal usually jumps a bit but then relaxes and lets this weird person do as they want since the foal knows no better touch the foal everywhere make sure they relax don't forget inside the mouth the bit inside the ears and under the tail if the vet needs to take a temp some time in the horses life you should get something like plastic surveyor's tape usually neon pink or green and go to town marking your fence so the foal will really be able to see the fence line i had a foal run into a barb wire fence and it was born in the middle of a acre field fortunatly it was imprinted so it was totally calm about me helping her out of the fence and she was unharmed if what you use to mark the fence it plastic only leave it up for about a week after that the foal will know the bondaries but may become currious about that plastic stuff and eat it by the way if you have other animals like a dog and the mare has been good with them she may kill them after the foal is born do not just let a smaller animal in with the mare until you are sure of her reaction teach the foal to lead and tie starting the day after birth it is much easier while they are still small to teach a foal to tie and keep the foal safe tie a soft rope around the foals chest just behind its front legs take the end of the rope between the foals front legs and run the end of the rope through the ring on the bottom of the noseband of the foals halter tie the end of the rope you need a long soft rope to do this by the way to a safe imovable object my personal preferance is a very large tree on the mare couldn't pull out the foal may have an abosolute temper tantrum rearing up and even throwing themselves on the ground in a total fit i call this temper tantrum the dead pony act just stand back at a safe distance holding the mares lead rope the foal will quickly tire itself out talk very calmly to it and pet it when the foal is being calm and good even if it's laying on the ground do not speak to it or touch it no reward when its having a fit within a few days you will have a foal that will stand tied safely and this is so important for an adult horse you run the rope around the foals chest and between it's legs for a reason as the foal pulls back and fights the rope the pressure is on the foals chest where it cannot be damaged if you just tie the foal by the halter the foal may injure it's neck in it's struggles since all the pressure will be on the neck instead the number one cause of foal death is leaving a halter on either the mare or the foal foals are very playful and get their legs caught in halters all the time struggle and break their leg don't leave halters on in the pasture or stall don't forget to take pictures on the legal side the person who sold you the mare may be financially responsible for the foal since they sold you a mare which was not pregnant make sure the mare has a salt mineral block she need's it lot's of fresh water and plenty of good food do not overgrain her she does not need more grain right now hope some of this info helps you garnet homesteading farming over years horse owner for over years 2000
