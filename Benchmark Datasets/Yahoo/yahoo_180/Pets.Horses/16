how do you fill out a horse hip bone area my horse who was a saved horse is having problems filling out in her hip bones she looks great in the stomach legs etc but her hip bones butt area just stick out how do you get this area to fill out first you need to make sure that she is meeting her daily nutritional requirements and is allowed to graze on high quality grass at least two hours a day the longer the better also you need to consider switching her to a higher quality feed if she is years or older i strongly suggest purina s senior feed this feed concentrates on the problem areas that are typical of most older horses back point of shoulder and hips if grass is scarce then you might want to add two flakes of hay that have a higher amount of protein such as alfalfa combined with costal etc what you have described to me are called rafter hips rafter hips are caused by a lack of muscling so combined with better nutrition you need to increase the amount daily exercise your horse is getting it is crucial that you keep increasing the physical demand and also the difficulty of your lessons while still remaining appropriate to age ability and skill level before and after each exercise you need to record your horses pulse number of heartbeats in a minute respiratory how many breaths your horse takes in a minute rate and your horses recovery rate how long it takes your horses breathing and pulse to return to normal after exercise this is important in judging your horses fitness level and knowing how and when to increase the amount of exercise that being said it is
