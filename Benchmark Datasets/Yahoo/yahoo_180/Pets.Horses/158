really green horse i am rding a really green horse her name is dixie but we call her dee she is a quarter horse mare when i ride her she has problems when going in one corner a i think its becasue she wants to ge see her friends b i think its just her i don't know what to do also she refuses jumps alot and thats a big problem so plz tell me what i can do for theese problems i myself would give her plenty of extra leg when you get to that corner if she fails to yeild to your commands then i would resort to spurs don't worry you don't have to spur her to death usually the feel of the spurs is enough to get the horse to move but make sure you use the spurs only when necessary if she isn't focusing on you then make her work do turns pivots circles transitions leg yeilds etc to make her listen and then continue on with what you were doing and with the jumping make sure she gets checked by a vet because if it just started lately she my be experiencingback pain also get her teeth checked because she may have dental problems also check yourself too to make sure you are riding properly make sure your position is correct heels down head up secure leg etc especially while going over the jump because if you are unbalanced you may be accidentally hitting the horse's mouth so now the horse associates pain with jumping also make sure that you are confident and not hesitating yourself because the horse will sense that and think something is wrong if you are uncomfortable with jumping then i would go back to cavalettis and smaller jumps and then work your way to higher jumps make sure that the horse is going fast enough so he has the impulsion to jump it make sure that she's meeting the fence squarely and if you feel her hesitating give her an extra squeeze with your leg again if you have to resort to a tap on her side with the spurs if she has been refusing a lot she may have begun to learn that she can get away with it if the horse has been over jumped then she may have begun to hate it so work in other things besides jumping to balance it out hope this helps Equine conformation Horse Diving Aerial (dance move) Horse gait Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling holds Show jumping Professional wrestling attacks Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Dressage Social rule Swingout Professional wrestling throws Taikyoku shogi Milton H.
