please only people with real horse expeirence i have a year old qh gelding i bought him as a yearling and trained him myself something i have been doing all my life he is a workingcow horse bred horse and is a ton of fun to ride i have used him at ranch rodeos trail rides and to work cattle at home he like all of our horse has been exposed to a lot of stuff and is ridden quite frequently times a week he has awesome ground manners and is very responsive to ride okay with all that said here is the flaw he bucks it happens randomly i can lunge him and be min into a ride and it will happen it can happen right away he has thrown me more than any other horse has and i train horses as always i get back on if i have been thrown and continue the workout if i know he is going to do it i can usually stay on and get after him the vet says he healthy i am really tired of it and trying to decide if there is anything that i can do or if i should sell him and get another any thoughts the first thing to do is determine why the horse is bucking have your dvm go over the horse again and look for things that might contribute to this behavior are you using a good farrier that is confident the horse is not having any pain or issues if the feet aren t feeling their best that can lead to some issues think about a woman in tight fitting high heel shoes that hurt to walk in what equipment are you using have you checked to see nothing is pinching rubbing slipping irritating equipment can change and we may not be aware of it but the horse certainly will be are you asking the horse for the same response on the line or riding that may be causing the bucking if this is happening when asking for an upward or downward transition it may be something related to the actions involved how is the horse s balance could the bucking be an answer to being off balance do you have someone who can watch you from the ground and help evaluate why this is happening if you have an extra set of experienced eyes you might be able to see the issue right away videotaping is another way to see what is going on when you are not involved in the activity has anyone else lunged or ridden this horse and had the same results or no bucking at all if they are using your equipment it might be something physical that is occurring while you are riding how you and the equipment interact we have certainly had some horses over the years that enjoyed bucking lots of them were from the same basic breeding lines too the old adage comes to mind here a mule can t kick and pull and the same time and neither can you same with the horse if he is moving forward with impulsion bucking is counter indicated Equine conformation Horse gait Milton H.
