slowing down my mare rushes her jumps she has a naturally fast canter anyway but its getting dangerous im scared shes going to trip or something and fall i can keep her steady until about a stride or two away but then she just gallops over the jump she seems to use speed to get over the jump instead of staying in an impulsive but steady canter as a result she flattens out and often hits the pole i do alot of gridwork with her but it just doesnt slow her down i do alot of schooling and things like metre circles and i have been practising transitions etc but its hasnt helped alot with her rushing the jumps any ideas of how i can slow her down i ride her in a hackamore because she hates having a bit in her mouth yes she has regular visits fom the dentist and theres no problems with her teeth etc so please dont say use a stronger bit because she is impossible to ride in a bit i had a stage vet check done weeks ago and shes in no pain she just gets way over excited p s ive tried doing half halts and she pretty much ignores me and hints on getting a better half halt from her any take a deep breath both you and your girl i've done this one and it can be done sounds like you've been doing a lot of work on the flat and that's a great start i'd recommend coming down to a smaller fence for awhile until this is straightened out it will make things calmer for both you and your horse my horse will also blasts through gridwork so i feel your pain i had a clinician tell me to just let him race through it and that he'll learn not to do that my stubborn beastie jumped both of the jumps in a bounce at the same time scared the beejeebies out of the clinician i don't recommend letting a horse that really rushes a fence 'figure it out' in a grid in small doses i would agree with stopping your horse coming into a fence and setting her on her butt if necessary to do it if you start it make sure you can finish it if you fail and she goes over you're doing more harm then good once she has stopped calmly pet her and turn her to walk away she should be willing and able to stop coming into a fence and after the first couple of times she's going to be listening to see what you have up your sleeve being unpredictable can really help in this kind of a situation i have actually done a m circle that just happened to pass by a fence and one time out of every seven or so we would go over the fence instead of by it no real time to anticipate and get excited but this only works if the rider can stay calm and not telegraph to the horse for you sit up breathe slow and steady hands steady and soft not open fingers that's the last thing you want with a horse that's going to rush if you start a tug of war with a thousand pound animal you will lose and it doesn't matter what you have in their mouth do not look at the fence look past it count the rhythm and ride the rhythm call out as you approach calm and steady do this after you've set her on her butt once or twice don't ride the fence ride the rhythm don't get anxious and anticipate her rushing and really really don't lean forward sit back sit down relax and assume that she will be a complete lady if you feel her start to build turn her away or set her on her butt one more time if you're soft and listening you'll be able to feel it before the desperate last two strides on the other side of the fence stop her in a straight line give her a nice pet and a scratch then walk away the hardest part to learn and something you are only going to really learn through doing is to hold with your back and not your hands pull on her face and she's going to pull back it's a vicious cycle you have to hold with the muscles in your back if your arms are getting sore or tired you're hanging on too tightly resist any change in rhythm with your body and this is where calling the rhythm out loud is excellent this is a subtle move and that's why i recommend setting her on her tail once or twice first so you have a fighting chance do not set her on her tail very often or she can start backing off of fences another scenario for learning to ride in this way that takes a heck of a lot of guts and a good trainer is lunging the trick no reins start out with no fence and do your transitions without your hands once you've got the idea it may take a couple of lessons work over a fence use your body to control her rhythm comming in it's nerve wracking at first since you feel like you have no brakes and the fence is comming and oh my goodness we're all gonna' die once you get the hang of it though you will know how to truly ride from you leg and back and the control you get is truly worth the hours spent going in a circle you are quite correct about the stronger bits and vet checks and i applaud you on your mare's behalf many times a horse does rush a fence out of fear if your girl has been given the green light it may be nothing more then remembered fear bringing down the fences also decreases the possiblity that she's rushing because she's not sure she'll make it over once her confidence is set it should be easier for her to stay calm moving up to a bigger fence Eventing Milton H.
