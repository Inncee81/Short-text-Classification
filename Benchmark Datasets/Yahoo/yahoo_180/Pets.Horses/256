what can i do tomorrow i will be looking after horses and after i ride some of them i tend to get bored of riding duh so is there anything i can do to occupy myself out in the middle of nowhere there is only satellite tv and no internet i could sweep out the barn but that only takes like minutes i'm going to be there for days what can i do outdoors to keep myself occupied oh and i look after some injured horses which takes about minutes to an hour other than that i'm pretty much bored for the day until i feed them and just hang with them out in pasture lol i go to this place every day of the week practically and the barn is already clean so are the stalls because we put all the horses out to pasture and they arent in use all the brushes are clean and i can't ride all the horses because some havent been started yet they are too young and others are broodmares which we don't ride there are only about horses at the time that are ridable because the other broke horses injured themselves in the fencing out in pasture and i would ride the newly broke horses only if my horse trainer was around for supervision been there done that it can be soo boring what i would do would be to take walks read books and play with the animals just sit in a chair and relax it can never hurt to relax hope you can find anything to occupy your self best wishes Milton H.
