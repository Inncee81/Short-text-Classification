horse emergency need answers now we took our horse to the vet this morning and the vet said he has an impaction they administered oil through the nose and said that should help he is wanting to lay down and won't eat or drink he did have a little bowel movement but he is still agitated banomine does help he acts as if he wants lay dowhn but would that be a bad thing he is very exhausted first call your vet back this is a serious situation and your horse needs help while you are waiting i would very definitely keep the horse on his feet and moving longeing him gently at the walk and a slow trot notice the emphasis on the word slow will help to stimulate his gut so that he can pass the impaction and get some relief from the pain if the horse has already had oil then you should start to see that coming through in the manure about to hours after it's administered to the horse oil has a very definite smell so you will be able to tell when it starts to come through and your horse begins to pass it the trick with impaction colic is to keep the horse moving long enough that it can stimulate the gut and let him have a bowel movement this may mean walking the horse by hand or it can also mean something like free longeing in a round pen at slow speeds this is not the time to force the horse into hard work it will only exacerbate his pain and make his condition worse one other alternative which you can try is to take the horse for a short ride in the horse trailer as soon as they get in the trailer the first thing most horses do is poop i had to load my mare this morning so that i can get her checked for pregnancy at the local clinic and of course the instant she got in the trailer she pooped so i know that this works with some horses banamine when administered correctly is very useful with colicky horses it sometimes can slow the gut down though which is why you need to keep walking your horse until he passes the impaction if your horse will lie down quietly and not roll or thrash around because of the pain then you can let him rest for short periods while he's being watched as far as food goes i would offer the horse some hay and a bran mash made with salt molasses and vegetable oil make sure he has plenty of water that is at least room temperature not cold cold water will shock his system and make his condition worse so you need to avoid this the salt in the mash will make your horse thirsty and encourage him to drink which in turn will make it that much easier for him to pass the impaction bran is also an effective laxative one thing you definitely want to avoid if you can is letting the horse get dehydrated as this will only cause more problems and can lead to founder among other things keep an eye on your horse's manure output and also on the amount of water he drinks the vet is going to want to know this information anyway good luck and i hope your horse recovers soon Equine conformation Horse colic Fecal incontinence Horse Laxative Poker jargon Guinea pig Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Hiking Clinical depression Shaggy dog story Guilty Gear Famine Diving Horse gait Thermal power station Social rule Prostate cancer Trailer Park Boys Drowning Dog training Sin City Diarrhea Toilet humour The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Coffee Theory of conduct Fancy rat Brewery Inflation Knife Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dehydration Dietary fiber Bread Swimming The Wack Pack Skateboarding trick Renewable energy Battles of Lexington and Concord Bubble Bobble Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Urinary incontinence Hyperthermia Allergy Irritable bowel syndrome Goodness and value theory Spanking Weight training Hypoglycemia Water Laminitis Crohn's disease Certified Nursing Assistant Chronic fatigue syndrome Insulin Traumatic incident reduction Aerial (dance move) Asthma Tenshinhan Constipation Vomiting USS Tunny (SS-282) Apollo 8 Sailing Ben Johnson (athlete) Sugar beet Electrophysiology Sodium chloride Abortion Psoriasis Triage Operation Market Garden Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Marching band Energy development Out-of-body experience 1957 World Series Coeliac disease Microeconomics Menstrual cup Happy Tree Friends Livestock Horseshoe Automobile Stuttering Foodborne illness
