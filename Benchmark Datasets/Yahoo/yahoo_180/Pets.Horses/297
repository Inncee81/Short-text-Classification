anticipating hey everyone my horse laredo tends to dance and really get anxious when i shorten my reins at a walk trot he thinks i'm going ask him to canter because when i was teaching him to canter from a halt and walk i was told to shorten my reins but now he's anticipating me in the show arena in flat classes equatation my trainer wants me to shorten my reins and have steady contact but he gets anxious and goes fast then he halts and when i ask him to move forward again he almost goes into a canter any ideas on how to make him just chill out oh and please be mature thanks taylor thank you paint pony this sort of problem is a horse personality problem more than a training problem some horses that are a bit more reactive lively or forward tend to start anticipating their forward transitions they aren't trying to be bad but they are guessing and fretting other more laid back and lazy type horses have the opposite problem at times they are waiting and anticipating the down transitions please let me stop oh i think you're going to let me stop hurrah with a horse such as yours its important that you don't avoid shortening the reins instead spend alot of time shortening your reins as part of your daily training and vary the things you are going to ask from him when you've shortened reins basically it's okay for him to realize that a shortened rein means to pay attention and that he's going to be asked to do something but he needs to wait to see what you ask i would really spend ten twenty or more times each riding lesson shortening your reins briefly giving him a cue doing the job and then going back to riding with your normal length reins examples of cues could be pivot on the hindquarters pivot on the forequarters half halts haunchs in up and down transitions work on the diagnial backing etc don't be in a rush to execute each job just go about things slowly and steadily if you're riding on the rail gather your reins don't worry if your horse starts rushing just pull him back and ask for the next cue say it's a pivot on the forehand when he's done it praise him and carry on five minutes later gather the reins and ask for something new if this hasn't become a really deeply engrained habit you should be able to teach him fairly soon to listen instead of getting in a flap and it will also make your horse more responsive and talented as he works on all these other excercises lastly with this type of horse it's really important that you don't loose your patience with them and get too heavy handed or heavy legged rough contact out of frustration or impatience often really frazzles this sort of horse and makes the problem worse instead try to remain slow and patient in your cues good luck Horse Horse gait Social rule Show hunter Milton H.
