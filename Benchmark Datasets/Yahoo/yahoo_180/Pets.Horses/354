is there any cure for side bone in horses can you ride the horse are there any special shoe jobs you can do i am looking at this horse because the mare is the mother to my gelding she is currently a broodmare is there any hope for this mare thank you just to let you know sidebone isn't the same as ring bone contrary to your first answer this condition is defined as the laying down of calcium ossification in the cartilage wings of the pedal bone this is caused by increased concussive forces on the back of the pedal bone which will predispose to sidebone formation and is a result of poor or delayed shoeing andlong periods of work on hard surfaces i would get the vet out there to look at the horse if sidebone is the causing lameness grooving the hoof will allow the foot to expand and relieve pain if the sides of the hoof are putting pressure on the ossification otherwise rest and treatment with nsaids is probably the best course of action the key to not developing lameness in these horses is to keep them trimmed and keep lots of room for heel expansion i would get the vet to x ray the horse so you can see if it really is side bone and if so how much ossification there is if the horse is in no apparent pain then i wouldn't see any reason not to ride her but make sure to get the vet to look at her before you buy her just to make sure you are buying a healthy and sound horse good luck Equine conformation Laminitis Horseshoe Osteoarthritis Bone Horse Mandible High-heeled shoe Paget's disease of bone Decompression sickness Traumatic brain injury Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug Temporal bone Cancer Horse gait Professional wrestling holds Tetrapod Evidence of evolution Skull Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Vomer bone Palatine bone Scapula Arabian horse Osteoporosis Frontal bone Ethmoid bone Stomach cancer Fast bowling Cephalic disorder Endochondral ossification Radiation therapy Chronic fatigue syndrome Tooth Ulna Sternum Rheumatoid arthritis Milton H.
