curb chain we were wondering if you mount from the left as a tradition from when men wore swords and we ride on the left to be able to effectively draw weapons if challenged everything is fastened on the left so it can be easily checked before mounting i guess why the devil does the curb chain fasten on the right it's fixed on the left the hook is closed it's brand new and when we thought about it all the ones we know either fasten that way or come right off mine has a leather strap attached to the chain so that it can fasten on either side but i'm aware of the ones you're referring to interesting question i really don't know xd perhaps they didn't fasten that way in medieval times and now it's evolved over the centuries to be like that maybe curb chains were once fastened from the left and the act slowly switched over time so that they were fastened from the right for some reason again really good question i'll try to do some research and see if i can find anything for now i give you a star for bringing this up edit grr still nothing this is a toughy i thought of this while researching though stablehands held the horse for the knight when mounting did they not i mean that chainmail must've been heavy and the act of getting up in the saddle difficult for a fully armored man the stablehands might've been standing on the right side and they would fasten the chain as a final measure before letting the horse go out onto the battlements doesn't really make sense but it's a thought xd Horse tack Armour Chainmail Rigging Professional wrestling match types Rail tracks Archery Stryker Skinhead Cowboy Strap-on dildo Cavalry Chariot Coat of Arms of Lithuania Bull riding Glossary of nautical terms Bow (weapon) English longbow Equine conformation Upholstery Shirt God of War Firearm Anchor Medieval warfare Gag (BDSM) Colours, standards and guidons Team Fortress Classic Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Appeal Billboard (advertising) Plate armour Social rule Tire Crash test dummy Timpani Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Order of the Garter Sewing machine Socrates Undergarment Martial art Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Milton H.
