my horse poops in his waterbucket i took my horse to a show that laster days long he was in the stall much of his time simply because it was hot and some days i didnt show i filled up his water bucket gave extra hay and yet the next morning his waterbucket was shaped weird and there was poop in it i was watching him and he tried to do it again he sat on it pretty much what should i do hes bored try putting those likit chews in his stall and a jolly ball or something also make sure you leave the window part open so he can watch whats going on and ppl will probably come by and pet him so hell have some attention if he keeps doing it then maybe hang the bucket on the outside of his door so he has to stick his head out and drink or hang the bucket up higher so he cant get his butt on it good luck Teen Girl Squad Toilet humour Aerial (dance move) Bong Sento RuneScape quests The Dalek Invasion of Earth Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Teacher's Pet (Disney) Shaggy dog story Horseshoe Sin City The Wack Pack Dairy Customs and etiquette of Japan The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Textile manufacturing Firefighter The Pet Sounds Sessions New Morning Clown Poker jargon Professional wrestling match types Sailing Dog training Richard Chase Treehouse of Horror IX Santa Claus SR-71 Blackbird The Catcher in the Rye Tooth enamel Krusty Krab Hash table Strap-on dildo Time President (game) Glossary of nautical terms Whose Line Is It Anyway?
