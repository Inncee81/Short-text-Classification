pony or mini horse ever since i worked for riding lessons a thing i had to give up recently due to my unreliable dad being unreliable and mom being very pregnant i have wanted a horse i have been thinking very far in the future about my own kids i would like them to start riding and caring for one at a young age because we all know its great exercise and teaches responsibility don't get me wrong if they want to stop then they can stop i would gladly care for it one question still dangles in my mind mini horse or a pony i will probably give riding lessons when my kids outgrow them so they're still in use like i said if they don't like it then i will gladly take on the job of caring for it i read and heard that you should fit your partner if my kids are too small for a big horse then they won't learn to ride properly like i said if they don't like it then i will gladly take on the job of caring for it i read and heard that you should fit your partner if my kids are too small for a big horse then they won't learn to ride properly minis have very choppy trots i suggest a good welsh pony or poa you can get a section b or a welsh pony and get something medium sized amung the ponies also poas have color and great temperment for a well trained pony you'll have to pay money but it is worth it you don't want your kids on something unmanagable or maybe if you know someone in the future who is smallishly built and can ride ponies and is an expirenced rider Pony Equine conformation Horse Welsh Cob (Section D) Hunt seat Welsh mountain pony (Section A) Milton H.
