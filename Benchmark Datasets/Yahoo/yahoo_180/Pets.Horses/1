conformation i saw someone else do this a while back and i thought i might give it a go i myself don't have much of an eye for judging conformation but i'm sure many of you on answers can tell me right off the bat what's off on my horse so here's some photos and please tell me what faults you can see in ol' dakota's conformation judging by these http www flickr com photos samurai lullaby http www flickr com photos samurai lullaby i'm sure he's got plenty and i can be assured that his bad points outweigh his good xd lol he's nothing special as far as horses go thanks in advance everyone yup he's a fatty xd i have him on feed supposed to aid in weight management we'll see how it goes he gains weight very easily agreed bama i haven't been riding him as much as i should these past few weeks as my tractor has broken down and shredding is therefore impossible my area is rattlesnake city so going for a long ride in overgrown pasture is not exactly safe i've been lunging him however but that still doesn't seem enough to get that fat belly of his to go down and yes as you guessed a gelding please toni no need to be kind xd i've put him on the chopping block i'm asking for it lol mostly i just want to know if there is anything severe other than weight that i need to watch out for hmm i don't believe he has cushing's he doesn't show any signs not sore or sluggish no heat in the hooves sheds his coat out fine no curly coat doesn't eat drink or pee excessively i have him get regular vet checks and he always checks out fine the vet also mentioned that he needs to lose weight but said nothing else thanks for the concern perhaps i'll mention it specifically to the vet next time first of all he need to slim down a bit he is a good looking horse but this is what i came up with first of all his neck and throatlatch is really thick and ties is too low on his shoulder i would like to see a shoulder that is more angulated as well as his hip they both should be at a degree angle and if you were to draw a straight line on the angle of his shoulder and the angle to his hip it should meet over his back to form a degree angle i also would like to see a deeper girth from the top of his whithers to the bottom of his girth and from the bottom of his girth to the ground should be the same length his hip is a little short to because from the point of his shoulder to his withers should be the same as the length of his barrel and his hip and his his is a little too short he has a nice strong back and loins his pasterns are at a nice slope and his front legs look awesome when it come to structure short cannons and he's very straight his hind legs are good too but i would like to see him stand with his hind legs more under himself and he looks like he is camped out a little but it could be just the way he's standing too i do like his head very much as it gives him a nice masculine look overall he is a very nice looking horse and is a pretty color too have fun Horse Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Knife Poker jargon Horse gait Theory of conduct Weight training Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Fancy rat Swingout Glossary of climbing terms Professional wrestling attacks Boxing Drill bit Volleyball Dressage Suplex Guinea pig Diving Evolution of the Horse Powerbomb Sin City Wood carving Skateboarding trick RuneScape quests Softball Anchor Strap-on dildo Tank Diving suit Vegeta Chair The Shining (film) Breaststroke Swimming Dragon Booster Garfield Casualty lifting Hair Little Britain Cat Chess strategy and tactics Physical attractiveness Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mattress Double bass Tetrapod Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hip fracture Table tennis Arabian horse Mnemonic P-61 Black Widow Norway national football team Bicycle frame Dog agility Appaloosa Recumbent bicycle New York Giants Backstroke Professional wrestling aerial techniques Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Muay Thai Seabiscuit Glossary of nautical terms Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Show hunter Wood Milton H.
