why is my vlc player acting funny please help whenever i play a dvd using vlc the movie always acts a bit funny it would play and everything but it's like 'lagging' it's constantly pausing very briefly then continues it's driving me nuts the odd thing is when i first downloaded vlc and put in a dvd it worked perfectly without any problems but that was just one time i deleted the program then reinstalled it but it's still doing it what could be wrong i am not sure of the answer however i can tell you that vlc uses its own codecs decoders that are built into the program rather than the codecs that you might have installed on your system while vlc is a great easy to use program that plays lots of different formats sometimes it can have trouble handling some of the newer file formats i would advise you to download and install the newest version of vlc in hopes that it plays your file in a smoother manner make sure your system isn't too busy doing background tasks if you are doing a lot of disk access the video may freeze momentarily when vlc tries to fetch data from the disk cache example i was having trouble playing flash videos in flv format but updating my vlc to the newest version did the trick now they play perfectly and i didn't need to install the flash decoder on my system Jon Lech Johansen DVD player Theora Warez FairPlay Vorbis Ragnarok Online Comparison of media players DVD MP3 Digital rights management Grand Theft Auto 2 Game Boy Advance FFmpeg Dave Matthews Band ITunes H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Xbox Live Ware MPEG-4 Part 3 Blackjack Nullsoft Streaming Video Asterisk Chess Scrabble Xenosaga WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Party Game$ Regional lockout Chris Ware SUSE Linux RealPlayer Windows XP Marilyn Waring Minesweeper (computer game) Volleyball Zones of EverQuest WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$ Digital audio player Z__oty Snooker Metallica Karaoke Unreal Tournament 2004 Chess opening IPod Romansh language Mario Kart DS Xbox ITunes Music Store Violin Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Porcelain Web crawler Darts Copy protection Anamorphic widescreen Podcasting Tag Chinese export porcelain Japanese pottery Matmos Pornography Harvey Award String Cheese Incident Jets'n'Guns Capture the flag Counter-Strike Slot machine Bass guitar Halo 2 Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Eric Prydz Big band Ultima Online Half-Life 2 Softball High-definition television Wipeout (game) Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Bj__rk Radio drama Xbox Media Center Unreal series Attack of the Show!
