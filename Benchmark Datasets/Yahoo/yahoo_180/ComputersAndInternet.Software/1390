microsoft word copy and paste okay i copied a very important document not in microsoft but elsewhere it was a couple of pages long and i can never get that back i copied it and it showed up in the copy tab on the right of the microsoft word document i then exited out of that and accidently deleted the microsoft document i need to get the copied part back but no matter how many times i try i can't find it on the copy tab on the right of a microsoft word document i want to know if it's possible to ever get that back please it's very important someone help me i don't want to have to be the person to tell you this but i'm sure others will if i don't i'm afraid that the clipboard is a temporary storage for holding information if microsoft word was closed and you've re opened it tried pasting ctrl v and it still doesn't appear i regret telling you that there is no way to recover that to my knowledge there is no log files of clipboard storage and the data is stored temporarily in the ram something which is unrecoverable once lost i know this answers your question and doesn't give you the hope you were looking for but at least you now spend your time re writing creating the information you lost rather than wasting time trying to recover it hope this helps Windows 2000 Windows 3.x Beverly Hills, California Booting Computer virus Linux 64-bit Perl Virtual memory UK telephone numbering plan AmigaOS Windows Vista Mac OS X OpenGL Emacs Apple Macintosh History of Microsoft Windows DR-DOS Elevator File Allocation Table PHP Pump It Up Blue screen of death Knoppix Renting Library (computer science) Forth programming language Patch (computing) Windows Server 2003 Copyright infringement of software Component Object Model Unicode Telephone numbering plan German car number plates IBM PC compatible Terminate and Stay Resident Vertical service code Windows XP Apollo Guidance Computer Common Lisp Yu-Gi-Oh!
