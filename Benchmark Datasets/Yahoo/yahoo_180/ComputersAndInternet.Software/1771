excel advanced lookup question okay i am a little lost i am using excel and basically i need to create a spreadsheet that will allow users to select one of something choices courses of study in this case and then have the table autopopulate the course type hours and evaluation i think i can use the lookup but am unsure of the method formula is that clear i need excel to autofill in the value of three other cells all in a row based on the value it's text of the first cell any help would be much appreciated forgot to add this in the course name cella the student can type in a course that will not be found in the lookup range is there anyway to get excel to display something other than an n a or error message when this happens let's say the course information is on sheet in a d with course name in column a type in b hours in c and evaluation in d on sheet is where users select the course and you autofill the information so you would have the following for example on row in a course name selected by user in b vlookup a 'sheet ' a d false in c vlookup a 'sheet ' a d false in d vlookup a 'sheet ' a d false a is what it's looking to match in column a of sheet a d is the range it will look in for data the offset of or is how many columns to the right it will go to find the data the range must be wide enough to accomodate the offset obviously if you try to go to the th column it will return an error the false means that the data in column a doesn't have to be sorted it also means it will look for an exact match in b the vlookup looks for the course name in a in column a of sheet when it finds it it goes to the nd column in the range i e column b to brings back the course type in c if goes to the rd column and gets the hours and so on if sheet is in an different file from sheet then you would have this vlookup a ' other file name sheet ' a d false if you set up the formulas with the other file open you don't need to fill in the path excel will fill it in when you close the other file any questions add detail or email good luck edit if the vlookup doesn't find a and returns an error you can look for that and display a blank instead if iserror vlookup a 'sheet ' a d false vlookup a 'sheet ' a d false Windows 2000 Copy protection The Sims 2 Blue screen of death .NET assemblies Machinima Cmd.exe MegaMan Battle Network 2 Ebook Digital rights management Modchip Mod (computer gaming) Warez Windows registry Simplified Chinese character Files-11 The Sims MegaMan Battle Network Computer virus System 7 (Macintosh) Steam (content delivery) Trojan horse (computing) Windows Vista Wget Disk image Bluetooth Hot Coffee mod Windows API Buffer overflow BitTorrent Visual Basic Macintosh Finder Stardock Tribes 2 Btrieve NTFS Kazaa Perl Patch (computing) MediaMax CD-3 Malware Microsoft .NET MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Pneumonia Half-Life 2 Big Brother (USA TV series) PHP Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing Dave Sim Bish__jo game LiteStep Terminate and Stay Resident Compiler COMMAND.COM Rootkit The Sims 2: Nightlife Magic number (programming) Halo: Combat Evolved ITunes Mandriva Linux Lotus Notes DVD Windows XP Backup OpenBSD Anti-virus software Mega Man Baseball CPAN Chrono Trigger soundtrack Library (computer science) Spyware REBOL LiveCD Military history of Australia Mozilla Application Suite Mercury (element) PlayStation 2 WordPerfect Windows 3.x Dynamic-Link Library Enterprise content management Partition (computing) MAME Object Desktop Public domain Colossal Cave Adventure Windows 1.0 Resident Evil (video game) APL programming language Homestar Runner Gmail ILOVEYOU Flight simulator Danger Hiptop MSH (shell) Mac OS X RAR Windows Me User agent
