excel help hi ok here is my problem should be easy to fix say i have one row and columns in each column i have a number and at the end is the total and now my formula at the end is say a a a etc now i have a client cancel a order but we need the numbers to remain in the system now this is done on a large spreadsheet with alot of linking tabs formulas say the order is for i want to just go to the order and put x or a crossout but not have it read in the formula is there an easy way to do this and if it is a little complicated could you quickly prepare a excel file and send it to megaupload thanks if you use x to denote a cancelled order and you use a a a it will return an error as you may have found out but if you use sum a a a or sum a a it won't include it in the calculation and won't return an error since there a lot of links you would want to be sure that the x isn't referenced somewhere where a text field is going to cause a problem select the cell and do tools formula auditing trace dependents to see where it's referenced good luck ITunes Dialer Computer virus IPod Internet Message Access Protocol Pretty Good Privacy Outlook Express Telegraphy Gmail E-mail spam Danger Hiptop Windows XP Modem AOL Instant Messenger America Online Control Panel (Windows) MSN Messenger Internet Explorer Copy protection Internet forum Communications protocol Mozilla Thunderbird Prodigy (ISP) Spyware Steam (content delivery) Microsoft Office Post Office Protocol Skype Usenet Bulletin board system Voice over IP Computer security SIPRNet Internet Opera (web browser) Google Desktop Internet fraud Webmail Mac OS X v10.4 Rootkit Hotmail MDAC File Transfer Protocol Phishing Proxy server Microsoft Windows Google IS-95 Data retention Malware Intranet Windows Mobile Mozilla Firefox Kazaa Internet service provider Internet Relay Chat Unicode and e-mail GameFAQs National Weather Service Wi-Fi Floppy disk Windows Vista BitTorrent ICalendar Blue screen of death Anonymous remailer SCART ARPANET Enterprise content management Comparison of web browsers Computer insecurity Melissa worm Mozilla Application Suite Captcha Website Internet pornography Ethernet TRS-80 History of the Internet Portable Document Format Private branch exchange DragonFly BSD Domain Name System Apple Open Collaboration Environment Web hosting Spam (electronic) Online service provider Greeklish Aerial (dance move) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Computer and video games Ebook Anti-virus software Broadband Internet access HTTP cookie Microsoft Outlook MUD Password
