how do you open pst files when outlook won't let you i have a pst file which is a copy i had made from my previous job before i left it's password protected but i know the password obviously however when i try to open the file using outlook i get the message file access is denied you do not have the permission required to acess the file xxxx the system was win k and i did not have admin rights i have no business interest in reading the files the messages are all about years old but i would like to read some of the messages for sentimental reasons note that the file is encrypted so it can't be opened with something like wordpad for example any help would be appreciated thanks to mark f i am now able to open the file without the pesky no acces message however now i get there are no items to show in this view i did try the software reader that was suggested but that didn't help i know there's stuff in the file because it's mb any other ideas hooray i've opened the file successfully thanks everybody you've all been very helpful copying the file to my own machine solved part of the problem as i said in my last update importing sort of helped inasmuch as outlook didn't complain but said there was nothing to read then i renamed the file i was trying to import from outlook pst to test pst and imported that instead that was a bit of a pain itself because i had tried importing it and outlook wouldn't let go of it so i copied the original to another directory renamed it there then imported it hey presto i've got all my messages back i'm now torn for who to give the best answer accolade to it's a fight between ivan r and mark f i'm giving it to mark f because he was closer to the mark if you'll excuse the pun and he followed up too however if i could award it twice ivan r would get one too especially considering the amount of typing he did thanks again everyone i'm a very happy bunny this can happen if the mail file is on another machine on your network if this is the case then try copying it to your local c drive and opening it from there good luck updated ok at least you can now access the pst file you might have a version issue try running the inbox repair tool on it from the microsoft site to run the inbox repair tool follow these steps click start and then point to find or to search depending upon your operating system in the search for files or folders named box type scanpst exe double click the scanpst exe file to open the inbox repair tool type the path and the file name of the personal folders pst file or click browse to locate the file by using the windows file system click start if this still doesn't work then continue to post updates here there are more things to try Delhi Khatushyamji Jaipur Singapore Changi Airport Agence m__tropolitaine de transport TransLink (Brisbane) Ravi Shastri Bharatiya Janata Party Rajput San Francisco Municipal Railway Bhuj London Buses Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) SmartRider Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 21 July 2005 London bombings Rajasthan Indian nationality law London Underground Metcard Metro Transit (Minnesota) Narita International Airport Las Vegas, Nevada Allahabad Airline Manchester Metrolink Las Vegas Monorail Meenas Mahajanapadas Kiran Bedi Ranthambore New World First Bus Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Caltrain Octopus card Bus MetroCard Ajmer Rajputana MTA New York City Transit buses Khotan Dublin My Mother the Carjacker Muni Metro Jean Charles de Menezes Public transport KCR Western Railway (India) Sisodia Bus stop Edwin Lutyens Newark Liberty International Airport Vadodara KCR Light Rail Jai Singh II Buses in London Aurangzeb Flag of India Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi Marwar Karisma Kapoor Rosa Parks Train station Bus rapid transit Air Deccan Jaisalmer March 2005 in India Indian Air Force Personal rapid transit Road transport Battle of Marston Moor Taxicab Coach Air Sahara Brahma RoadShow WheelTrans Marc Aurel Stein Hitchhiking Chicago Transit Authority United Kingdom general election, 2005 January 2005 in Britain and Ireland Final Fantasy IX Jack the Ripper Price discrimination Tabu (actress) Back to the Future Jodhpur K.
