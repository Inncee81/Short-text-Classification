using adobe photoshop i'm pretty new to using adobe photoshop and i can't figure out how i can remormat a word to change it's shape for example if i want it to be an arch or a rounded top help please i think what you want is the text warp when you click on the text tool from the tools in photoshop it should let you click where you want to type in the photo and a text toolbar should show up at the top of your picture window where it lets you change the font type etc there is a button on there that is a text warp button choose your style from the drop down menu the text warp button should be a capital t with after it and a little arch line under it depending on your version of adobe i have photoshop elements Java programming language Forth programming language Web crawler Hash table Dynamical system XML Pointer AmigaOS Web browser Domain Name System Microsoft Array MDAC Expert system Central processing unit JavaServer Pages Computational fluid dynamics Lisp programming language Rootkit Opera (web browser) Scheme programming language World Wide Web Algorithm Mach kernel Geographic information system WebObjects Mathematics Buffer overflow Mac OS X Associative array Stopping e-mail abuse Microsoft .NET C plus plus Cross site scripting CPU cache Ebook Numerical analysis Programming language Hydrogeology Redundant array of independent disks Genetic algorithm Database management system ALGOL 68 Windows Vista Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Wiki Wget Fortran Website Grid computing Internet Relay Chat Phishing HTML Spam (electronic) Library (computer science) Lotus Notes Component Object Model Object Desktop OpenOffice.org Compiler optimization Cognitive science Computer science C syntax HyperText Transfer Protocol File system
