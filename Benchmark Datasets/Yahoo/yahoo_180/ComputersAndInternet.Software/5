is there any program that can recover deleted items in my pc i want to retrieve a document file deleted last month there are several but what you're asking to do may be a tough order first make sure it's not in your recycle bin if there then just click on it and select restore if it's not there the chances of being able to recover it are low because when a file is deleted only the name is removed from a table of all files on the system when it's removed from that table the system can then reuse the space on the disk where that file used to reside if it does then you file cannot usually be recovered you can search the net for undelete software there are several and some even have free trials that let you see what files it can undelete Virtual memory File system NTFS Linked list Data remanence Macintosh Finder Btrieve Malware Mouse (computing) Shred Spyware Macromedia Flash Freenet SQL Web crawler Dustbin Recycling CPU cache Backup Windows XP Library (computer science) File Allocation Table ITunes Hard disk Files-11 Atari DOS Linux USB flash drive Forth programming language Berkeley Software Distribution Disk formatting Java programming language Database Enterprise content management Microsoft Jet Database Engine MDAC Password JavaScript Norton Utilities Cache Screenshot Plaintext Page table Kazaa Windows 2000 Translation memory GNOME Disk image Unicode Windows Vista Waste management System 7 (Macintosh) Portable Document Format ISO image Gmail Blue screen of death Pretty Good Privacy AmigaOS Computer security NTFS junction point OpenDocument Master Control Program Common Unix Printing System Microsoft Windows File format Windows API Stardock WordPerfect Filename extension Emacs C programming language SonicStage Journaling file system Embedded system Disk cloning Wiki Mac OS X Symbolic link HyperCard Mozilla Firefox ALGOL 68 Anti-virus software Fossil (file system) Netfilter/iptables Data recovery Metadata WordStar ZIP (file format) Trusted computing Host file Defragmentation Redundant array of independent disks IPod Partition (computing) Microsoft GNU Ultima Online Computer file
