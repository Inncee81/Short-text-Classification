is vista better than xp should i make the switch and why in my humble opinion no vista is not better than xp i think in maybe a year or so it will be as good as xp but it has a long way to go to be better than xp vista still has a lot of gliches than need to be sorted there is still very little software that is compatable with vista there is a lot of manufacturers who are reluctant to produce drivers for hardware for vista vista uses a lot of resources i would certainly say that you need a very bare minimum of gb of ram and a hard drive of at least gb this is just the bare minimum i have computers at home with vista premium not my choice and with xp there are adults who regularly use the computers they all want to use the xp basically because it is far simpler to use and far quicker need more convincing i attend an adult college the college has it suites a totally of computers because of general feed back from the public they have cancelled their vista upgrades my advice wait for at least a year and then see how things are take care and good luck Windows Mobile Macromedia Flash Mouse (computing) Microsoft Office Windows XP Microsoft PowerPoint Stardock Digital photography Windows Vista Forth programming language Screenshot OpenOffice.org Yearbook Computer virus Apple II family IPod HyperCard Microsoft AmigaOS Minesweeper (computer game) Screenplay Windows 2000 Mozilla Firefox Pocket PC History of Microsoft Windows PlayStation Portable Microsoft Excel OpenBSD Opera (web browser) Science Macintosh Finder WordStar ZX Spectrum Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Educational animation Icon (computing) Atari ST Uploading and downloading Computer Melissa worm Peer-to-peer The Sims 2 ALGOL 68 Xerox Star Emacs Mac OS X v10.4 PlayStation 3 EIA-708 Knoppix Microsoft Word Floppy disk Xbox 360 Java programming language Gmail BASIC programming language Linux Apple Computer Computer forensics StarCraft Secret Missions Macintosh Plus Keynote (software) Apple IIGS IBM PC compatible Object Desktop Quest for Glory Objective-C Super Mario Bros. 3 GIF Dictionary Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Trusted computing Blue screen of death MS-DOS Kazaa Atari 8-bit family Google Desktop Baseball Stars Chrono Trigger Cache Nintendo Open access Oxford English Dictionary Software testing Super Nintendo Entertainment System Typeface XML E-mail spam Pump It Up GNU General Public License Signs Half-Life 2 Danger Hiptop Mac OS X Amiga Power Podcasting C programming language Public-key cryptography Commodore 64
