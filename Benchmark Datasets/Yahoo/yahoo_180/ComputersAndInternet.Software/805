how do i put use my roms on my visual boy advanced um when i open my rom on my vba it just turns the visual boy's black screen into a white one and on the top of the file that blue strip on the top of the screen it says visual boy advanced then it shows a percentage and thats all it does can you help me i have seen other videos on you tube but they dont help the percentage just keeps going up and down sometimes it goes over your rom may not be in the proper format the file extension should be gb gbc or gba or a zip file with one of these files in it you didn't say what rom you were playing so i couldn't verify if it was a good rom or not very rarely the emulator will not render the video correctly because the video hardware doesn't support the particular render method and must be changed to directdraw or gdi in this situation you can still hear sound since you didn't mention that you could hear sound i will guess that the rom is bad Cascading Style Sheets Flat file database British national grid reference system Solar cell Mouse (computing) P__li Style sheet Drawing Mac OS X Microsoft Excel Minesweeper (computer game) Unicode Double-click (computing) Book of Kells Derren Brown Racetrack (game) A151 road Mozilla Firefox Westchester County, New York Wiki Pirate radio Ley line Laptop Opera (web browser) Music Mattress Glass Map projection Map Crossword Speech synthesis National Weather Service E-mail Transcontinental nation Political subdivisions of New York State Command line interface Marching band Web traffic Preferred number Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Atari 8-bit family Konqueror Ed Biblical inerrancy C Sharp Visual Basic .NET AppleScript Habbo Hotel Combo box Web design Chinese character Illuminated manuscript Windows XP Inheritance (computer science) Starsiege: Tribes OmniWeb Google Maps Entertainment Weekly Information warfare Logo programming language Live 8 Denbighshire History of the graphical user interface Penny Red HTTP cookie Abdullah __calan Tent Musical notation Bookbinding Search engine optimization Flag of Hong Kong CPU cache Carlisle Xerox Star Multiple document interface Quattro Pro Digital photography XML NTFS Categories Oslo Accords Territorial dispute President of Ireland Anonymous remailer Parallax TRS-80 Pixel Integrated circuit Public space OpenDocument TrueType Storyteller System Desertification Spy Hunter Geographic information system File format Public Land Survey System Geography of Finland Rigging SAS System
