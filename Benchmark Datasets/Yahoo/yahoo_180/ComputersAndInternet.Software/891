i cannot set a desktop wallpaper on one user account only any suggestions on how to correct this we have user accounts set up in windows two of the accounts will let us set a desktop wallpaper the third account will not display a wallpaper you can briefly see it displayed when you log off through the control panel browse for images is even inactive for this one user account only without knowing which version of windows you're using it's difficult to offer anything specific but i'd try creating a th account just to see if everything works the way it should if it does you can probably rule out any system problems and just chalk it up to a glitch or hiccup when that uncooperative rd account was created in that case i'd delete the rd account rename the newly created th account and set it up but if the th account also doesn't work correctly it might be a problem with a damaged system file if you have your original install cd you could try running a system file check check click start run type in sfc scannow ok no quotes and notice the space between sfc and scannow if any damaged or missing system files are located you'll be prompted to insert the install disk files will then be repaired or replaced as needed the scan could take over an hour depending on what it finds wwbgd File system Windows 2000 Windows XP File Allocation Table Spyware NTFS Object Desktop Uninstaller Gmail Windows Installer ITunes Windows Me Blue screen of death Linux Internet Explorer Macromedia Flash Computer virus Partition (computing) System 7 (Macintosh) Virtual memory Btrieve Windows registry Stardock New.net Rootkit Filename extension Windows Explorer IPod Macintosh Finder Xerox Star Mac OS X Enterprise content management Library (computer science) Unicode Google Computer File format Windows 3.x AmigaOS Plaintext ASCII art USB flash drive Sony Comparison of file systems Mach kernel OS/2 NTFS junction point System/36 AOL Instant Messenger MSN Messenger Password cracking Domain Name System Host file ZIP (file format) Master Control Program Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Path (computing) Windows Server 2003 Wget Apple II family Microsoft .NET Symbolic link History of the graphical user interface Backup Computer forensics Kazaa Computer storage Common Unix Printing System Directory HTTP cookie Redundant array of independent disks Linked list Defragmentation Data recovery Microsoft Windows MDAC Windows Vista Surveillance IMac Server System/34 Architecture of Windows 2000 FreeDOS Apple Macintosh Computer file NX bit Skype Metadata Novell NetWare Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis RPM Package Manager PHP Windows 95 Floppy disk Perl MS-DOS Pretty Good Privacy
