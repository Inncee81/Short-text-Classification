why is ie so laggy on some os installs my pc came with vista and ie works really well however i also installed xp on another partition and ie and firefox work fine but way too laggy when scroll up or down in a webpage it takes a little time to do it like i said its laggy which is not happening on my vista install i have a newer pc with gb of memory any way to fix this maybe video card drivers are missing maybe the vista partition is taking up all the ram and graphic power d all those new protection such as protection mode uac etc making an other partition is just like sharing a soul and since it is not whole you won't meet the fully power of your system since vista is such a hog it would take more space than xp thus making not accurate just to show you is vista on your computer so vista's ie will have more power to run it's ie without slowdowns this is my hypothesis though MSN Messenger HyperText Transfer Protocol Internet Webcam Internet phenomenon Proxy server Uniform Resource Locator Website LiveJournal Transmission Control Protocol Gmail Xbox Live BitTorrent Web crawler Blog HTTP cookie Web traffic Wget Internet pornography World Wide Web Ajax (programming) Wiki Common Unix Printing System Slashdot effect Prank flash Web page Web server Webcomic Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Server Virtual hosting Steam (content delivery) Apache HTTP Server Denial-of-service attack Search engine optimization Aggregator Domain Name System Web hosting Windows XP City of Heroes Representational State Transfer The Best Page in the Universe Everything2 E-mail spam Spyware Whois GameFAQs Neopets Web application SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs SAML Mozilla Firefox JavaServer Pages Btrieve Friend-to-friend Netscape Communications Corporation Transport Layer Security News server Microsoft Office Halo 2 Microsoft Wireless Application Protocol Sydney Delta encoding Counter-Strike Ultima Online Fark.com Slashdot trolling phenomena Phishing VBulletin JavaScript Squid cache Censorship in cyberspace Homestar Runner ELO rating system Streaming media PunkBuster Character encodings in HTML Secure Shell Port numbers Windows 2000 Web browser Internet censorship in mainland China Podcasting Photoblog Google Web Accelerator EDonkey network ITunes Yahoo!
