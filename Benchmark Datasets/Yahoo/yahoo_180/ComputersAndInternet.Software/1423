why does my windows xp system automatically shut down every t minutes i have a gateway system with windows xp pro on it every three to five minutes the system automatically shuts off and will not turn back on for about another three minutes during the time that the system is shut down the green power light is still on but when i press the power button nothing happens as soon as the green power light goes off i can hit the power button and the system will boot back up for about another to minutes i have checked the power setttings and everything seems to be correct i set the hard disk to go off never but this problem still occurs i ran a norton virus scan and windows defender scan and came up with nothing interestingly enough the system did not shut off during the time that the scans were running i plugged the power supply into another system and the system stayed on with no problems the power light staying on is interesting to me any help would be greatly appreciated from your description it's probably safe to say your problem has nothing to do with win xp is your computer's clock keeping proper time if not then check the cmos battery looks like a giant watch battery on your motherboard a computer acts really wonky when that battery starts dying try disconnecting everything hard drive included and see if it'll boot through and stay on longer than the minutes leave only the keyboard connected disconnect the monitor hard drives cd dvd drives and anything else you mentioned about the power light staying on disconnect the led cord for this as well this will help you eliminate what is causing the problem also is it that your hard drive shuts off before the rest of the computer or that your computer shuts off and then dials down the hard drive i think another person's suggestion about the heat lvls is possible as well have you checked the resting temp in the bios if you've tried the elimination and it still turns off with absolutely nothing connected by the power supply keyboard then i think it's safe to say it's likely something with the chip motherboard whether it's heat related cmos battery you can try replacing this since those batteries are pretty cheap etc good luck with this Microsoft Windows Windows Vista Windows XP IBM PC compatible Mac OS X ATI Technologies History of Microsoft Windows Mouse (computing) Apple Macintosh MSN Messenger DirectX Windows Server 2003 IPod OpenGL Radeon Bluetooth AmigaOS Personal computer Xbox Windows 3.x Microsoft PowerPC Microsoft Office Webcam Laptop X Window System Nintendo Linux Amiga OS/2 History of the graphical user interface PlayStation 2 Best Buy NVIDIA Apple Computer Wintel Windows Me Blue screen of death NX bit Universal Serial Bus MS-DOS Graphics card Video Graphics Array Architecture of Windows 2000 Timeline of computing 1990-forward DOS Windows Presentation Foundation Bill Gates Wi-Fi Windows API Vaporware Xbox Live IMac Apple IIGS PowerBook PlayStation 3 Computer hardware Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Hard disk DR-DOS Palm OS Internet fraud System/360 Portable Document Format Patch (computing) Electronic commerce Mac OS X v10.4 Skype TRS-80 Color Computer Poker jargon Sega TRS-80 Next-Generation Secure Computing Base 64-bit CP/M Prank flash Macromedia Flash Fritz-chip The Walt Disney Company Connectix Spyware USB flash drive LiveCD Internet Explorer ALGOL 68 Windows Blackcomb Teletext Device driver Knoppix Amstrad CPC Software cracking Desktop computer Atari ST MDAC Computer-aided design ReactOS Microprocessor Kernel (computer science)
