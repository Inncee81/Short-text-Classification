how to get linux on virtual pc without a disk i have no blank cd's to put the iso file for ubuntu linux on so i was wondering if i could do it another way since you already have the iso image you are ready to install create your new virtual machine specifing ram virtual hd size select the new virtual machine and boot it by clicking the start button this boots the machine up without an os and will sit there trying to load an os over the network click on the cd menu and choose capture iso image and navigate to your iso file restart the virtual machine my clicking on the action menu and choosing reset the virtual machine will reboot and attempt to boot from the iso image from this point you will be able to run the installer this is also a faster way of installing than having the actuall cd hope that helps DVD Warez Web server Wget DeCSS Digital rights management PHP Web crawler Uniform Resource Locator World Wide Web Streaming media Common Unix Printing System Representational State Transfer Cross site scripting HTTP cookie Website HTML Copyright Windows XP Modchip Copyright infringement Internet SAML Copy protection H.264/MPEG-4 AVC BitTorrent First-sale doctrine Apple Computer The Internet Movie Database Gmail MAME Apple II family Unix Uniform Resource Identifier Pirate decryption Macrovision JavaServer Pages Fire Fair use GNU General Public License Computer virus Ajax (programming) Kazaa Cue sheet Mixtape TV Tome Disk image Web cache XHTML IBM PC compatible Copyleft Filename extension Free software REBOL Entertainment Weekly The Star Wars Holiday Special Character encodings in HTML Domain Name System Web browser CD recorder Public domain BSD license Web page PlayStation Portable Wireless Application Protocol Programming language Wiki MP3 XSL Transformations ITunes A Course In Miracles Peer-to-peer WebDAV DVD Copy Control Association Fair dealing Web service Laptop Japanese copyright law Copyright law of the United Kingdom Ebook Jon Lech Johansen Netflix Spyware Freenet Intranet CPAN Cryptography File Transfer Protocol MS-DOS Campbell v.
