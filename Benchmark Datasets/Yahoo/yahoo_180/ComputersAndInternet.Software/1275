is there a program that monitors and shows the causes of computer crashes i have used tuneup ad aware and ccleaner on my computer and it still crashes while i play games a lot is there a hopefully free program out there that monitors and shows you why your computer crashes if it does i really want to know if it is due to overheating or if something else is causing it i don't know of any program that does this but i'm sure that there probably is one just check at http www download com if you are using windows you should be able to get an idea of why the crashes are occuring by view the events log just go to help and query event viewer using event viewer event viewer maintains logs about program security and system events on your computer you can use event viewer to view and manage the event logs gather information about hardware and software problems and monitor windows security events i would guess though that your problem probably lies in the registry or perhaps a hardware problem hope this helps Screenshot HTML element Mouse (computing) Menu (computing) Context menu IBM PC keyboard Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Gradius DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Option key Power-up Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Golden Sun Mac OS X v10.4 Macromedia Flash ITunes AmigaOS Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX PlayStation Portable Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 System 7 (Macintosh) MRE Danger Hiptop Combo box Web page Macromedia Fireworks Super Mario Advance 4 Pie menu AppleScript IPod Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMIX Hell's Kitchen (television) Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance Dance Dance Revolution KONAMIX WordPerfect Dance Dance Revolution 4thMIX Vim (text editor) DrumMania Heraldry Japanese tea ceremony Mozilla Application Suite Konami Code Gmail Apple IIGS Keyboard layout File (metalwork) Vertical service code Menu Finale notation program Linear Motion Battle System Musical notation RollerCoaster Tycoon Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles Scrollbar Pump It Up MapleStory Limit Break Adobe Photoshop Windows 2000 Mega Man (NES) C plus plus Sonic R Decision making Macintosh Finder Restaurant WilliamsF1 Mozilla Firefox Minor characters in Morrowind Inflation Dance Dance Revolution Scrolling shooter Castle of the Winds Netfilter/iptables Knife Chinese cuisine Ecco the Dolphin AS/400 Command Language Fitts' law Action 52 Final Fantasy XI Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Contra (arcade game) Seiken Densetsu 3 Microsoft Paint Queen Margaret Union C programming language Mod (computer gaming) Inkscape Super Size Me GuitarFreaks Touchpad Pottery Barnes & Noble
