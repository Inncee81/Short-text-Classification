why has my computer stopped letting me burn cds hey first off this is my grandfathers computer so i'm not sure what exactly he's done but from what i gather he didn't do anything that should cause this probelm of course i'm not sure but heres the problem when ever he attempts to burn a cd using any program it won't work wmp says that the files may not fit even if you only have one song on the cd if you try to burn it anyways i get an error and that error says something like format is not supported even thought its an mp when using nero is says something about its not supported and that i may made a plug in i'm not sure what to do i've done a system restore and it hasn't fixed the problem does anyone have any suggestions if not should i attempt to just wipe out the untire computer and try to just reunistall windows and everything is doing that easy could someone with little computer knowledge do that my thinking is that windows will do mostly everything thanks for the help the first thing i would try is to put a blank cd in the player have no other programs running you should get a message like what do you want to do click make a folder to burn if you do not get the message go to my computer and click on the e drive or what ever your computer says is the drive of the cd then find the music an put it in the burn folder if the computer will do it then you know the problem is with media player and nero not with the computer if the computer will not do it then go to control panel system hardware device manager see if there is a yellow warning that the device is not working you didn't mention which version of windows you have some cd players on older machines will only do certain types of cd's make sure you are using a compatible type Computer virus Microsoft Office E-mail Mozilla Firefox Mac OS X Internet Explorer Gmail Mozilla Thunderbird Windows XP Dialer Microsoft Outlook Microsoft Windows WordPerfect Stopping e-mail abuse Mozilla Application Suite Opera (web browser) System 7 (Macintosh) Windows Vista OpenOffice.org E-mail spam Microsoft .NET BitTorrent Linux Microsoft Internet Message Access Protocol MDAC Verizon Wireless KDE Webmail Spyware Steam (content delivery) Pretty Good Privacy Post Office Protocol Kazaa Common criticisms of Microsoft Wine (software) Outlook Express Proxy server Danger Hiptop Ajax (programming) Patch (computing) OpenDocument Blue screen of death Perl Windows 2000 IPod Podcasting Application software Trillian (instant messenger) Windows Me AmigaOS Hotmail Windows Installer Apple Macintosh Digital photography Google Windows Mobile Sender Policy Framework Anonymous remailer Melissa worm Browser wars History of Microsoft Windows OpenBSD Linspire Rootkit ITunes PHP IBM PC compatible Netscape Navigator Emacs GNOME SCO-Linux controversies Computer forensics DR-DOS Mydoom Linux distribution Internet fraud Mandriva Linux CPAN Ubuntu Linux Computer software Object Desktop Forth programming language Windows Server 2003 Btrieve Xbox Web crawler Domain Name System MSN HTML DLL hell Mac OS X v10.2 Mac OS X v10.4 64-bit Microsoft Word PLATO Spotlight (software) REBOL NX bit Surveillance
