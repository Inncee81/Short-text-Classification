what's the best 'virtual drive' program for this game i own the original red alert command and conquer pc game it of course comes as a cd set i don't like having to change cds so often and i know that it's not good for the cd drive over the length of time to keep opening it so much to change to the other cd so i need a 'virtual drive' program that will rip and store these two cds on the hard drive as well as work with this cd set one cd for each 'side' depending on which you play i'm familiar with virtual drives but i haven't come across one that works with cd sets that are meant to be used together a lot of virtual drives seem to only want to use one cd at a time and of course you can't just 'flip' between this image of one cd to the next image of the other cd and not have a closure of the game itself any ideas as to what to do about this i am using win xp and have tried countless no cd patches and such none of them work the game itself runs fine off the cd in compatibility mode with win use deamon tools magic disc etc i used both and they are pretty good EFTPOS Automatic teller machine Windows XP Point of sale Digital photography Atari 8-bit family Apple Macintosh Computer System/36 Nintendo Atari ST Apple II family Mac OS X Commodore 64 Linux Software engineering Extreme Programming Debit card IBM PC compatible Copy protection Computer and video games Computer virus CPU design Malware Skype Windows 2000 Modem Stardock Cheating in Counter-Strike ZX Spectrum AmigaOS Computer insecurity PlayStation 2 IMac Internet fraud Spyware Copyright infringement of software Embedded system IPod Cash register Financial services Slot machine Timeline of computing CPU cache MAME Education in Germany Credit card USB flash drive Quake III Arena Ragnarok Online Commodore International System 7 (Macintosh) Anti-virus software First-sale doctrine Universal Serial Bus Xbox Computer chess Amiga Redundant array of independent disks Digital rights management IBM Personal computer Computer hardware DVD Laptop Desktop computer VISA (credit card) Money Device driver Electronic commerce Java programming language Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis $ale of the Century Calculator Commodore PET Dot matrix printer Galactic Civilizations Acorn Computers Surveillance Mainframe computer Cg programming language Monopoly (game) Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Microeconomics Microsoft Windows PostScript Intuit, Inc.
