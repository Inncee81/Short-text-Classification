looking for insurance requirements for sub contractor on hurricane debris clean up fema funded i have been told that a sub contractor has to have proof of bond insurance when doing debri clearing would this be a fema requirement or a requirement of the main contractor my husband was killed in fla on a land fill site he was unloading debri when the truck fell over on him if anyone out there has either done this type of work or is a sub contractor who has done this kind of work i could really use help me with this question individual he worked for is being of no help as yet ok you don't have proof of bond you have a performance bond fema is going to require the gc to have a bond naming them as obligee as a guarantee that the work gets done the insurance company pays fema the stated amount on the bond if the gc doesn't get the work done a bond has nothing to do with the insurance on the job or at least not much if the individual he worked for has not submitted a workers comp claim they aren't going to that doesn't mean they are off the hook the chain goes your hubby's employer or the general that hired him them then the general that hired them all the way up to the property owner all those people can be held responsible for the death benefits related to this claim you need to take several steps make a written request to his employer to file a workers comp claim file a complaint with the state department of labor against his employer give it two weeks and talk to an attorney i rarely recommend attorney involvement but i do think in the long run you're going to need one on the one hand the case is open shut even if his employer didn't have wc coverage the gc did and they're on the hook for all benefits for uninsured subs which your hubby likely is on the other hand getting money out of contractors is brutal getting them to file claims is very brutal so i think you're going to need real help with this and i'm very sorry for your loss Insurance Wal-Mart Life insurance Federal Emergency Management Agency of the United States Unemployment Workers' compensation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus United States Postal Service Unemployment benefit Social Security (United States) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Construction Hurricane Katrina timeline Lloyd's of London Michael D.
