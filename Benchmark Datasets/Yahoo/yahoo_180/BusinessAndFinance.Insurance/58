does any place accept a payment plan for bariatric surgery i have no insurance and was wondering if any place would take payment plans i don't know but you could get a revolving line of credit from a bank that would handle it a heloc or something i must say that if you have no health insurance and are cost consious getting bariatric surgery is probably a bad idea they may quote you a price but bariatric surgery also involves a lot of follow up medical care and frequently involves after surgery health risks such as nacrotic fat that are not included in the price your price could skyrocked if you need follow up i would strongly suggest finding a job that will give you health insurance this might or might not pay for the bariatric surgery but it would proably pay for any emergency follow up care Health insurance Obesity Insurance Medicare (Canada) Mutual fund Prostate cancer Unemployment Adjustable gastric band National Health Service Medicine Economy of the United States HIPAA Bond Wal-Mart Bank Emergency Medical Services Health care in the United States Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Canada Health Act Transsexuality Derivative (finance) Finance Citigroup General practitioner US health reform under FDR Canadian and American health care systems compared Managed care Social Security (United States) Stroke Traumatic brain injury Auto insurance Risk management Medicare (United States) Commodity markets Health savings account New Deal Gastric bypass surgery Medical malpractice Social Credit Bretton Woods system Divorce History of the United States (1918-1945) Money Stomach cancer Open access Capital accumulation Government debt Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Legal aspects of transsexualism Credit card Urinary incontinence Health care in Canada Anorexia nervosa Gold standard American Medical Association Collateralized debt obligation Breast implant Barbara Boxer Social security Medical record Social Security debate (United States) Hillary Rodham Clinton Adverse selection Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Plastic surgery Primerica Financial Services Debt Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Nuclear power phase-out Economics Gambling Public policy Prescription drug Childbirth Health care Microeconomics Everwood Pharmaceutical company Efficiency wages Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Canadian federal election, 1965 Nuclear power Colorectal cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Productive and unproductive labour The Apprentice 2 Berkshire Hathaway Estoppel Health care in the Republic of Ireland Medicaid Ovarian cancer Centrelink Personal finance Surgery Crohn's disease Shoppers Drug Mart
