are hmo patients treated differently maybe i have been in the dark i have been an hmo patient almost my entire life on my parents policy growing up and on my own now that i am older i understand the differences from other plans mainly hmo patients dont really pay much if any at all but we have to see our primary doctor before we see anyone else we need to obtain a referral from our primary doctor i dont mind it i just started a ob in healthcare field and i cant help but notice that hmos are sort of frowned upon i have even heard that patients with hmos are purposly scheduled during crappy times that they have to wait longer for appts is this a school of thought that other people share and i am finding out just now great question and i totally agree with you i'm no expert in health insurance and hmos ppos and all that but i have a funny feeling that hmo patients get short changed i think that they hospitals and doctors will find a way out of providing necessary and costly tests that some patients may have require i know people who have gone to the er and basically were turned away after being triaged no attemps were made to find the cause of the problem it's really sad the state of healthcare in this country sorry if this sounded ignorant but it's just an opinion Publicly funded medicine Health maintenance organization Health insurance Medicare (Canada) Prostate cancer Triage National Health Service Stomach cancer Health care in the United States Emergency department Chiropractic Psychiatry Psychiatric hospital US health reform under Nixon Pharmaceutical company Podiatrist Obesity Alternative medicine Physical therapy Psychology Legal aspects of transsexualism Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Contract Preferred provider organization Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Traditional Chinese medicine Insurance Reiki Anorexia nervosa Medical malpractice Theory of conduct Nurse Kaiser Permanente Physician Involuntary commitment Adult attention-deficit disorder Medical record Clinical depression Urinary incontinence Emergency Medical Services Abortion in Canada General practitioner Health care History of intersex surgery National Kidney Foundation Singapore Bipolar disorder Milton H.
