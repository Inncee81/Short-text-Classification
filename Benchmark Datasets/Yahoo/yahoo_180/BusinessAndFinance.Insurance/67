if you have full auto coverage this is my first wreck and it might be my fault once it's taken to arbritration i have full coverage on my auto insurance the other party has full coverage insurance what is the most i will have to pay for my deductible how much will my insurance go up also will i have to pay for additional out of pocket expenses other than my deductible full coverage is a loaded term depending on the state you reside in go to the state website gov and research the insurance section to find out the exact answers you are looking for if you are afraid to ask your agent i am from michigan and we have the most confusing auto laws in the country so i won't even begin i will tell you in general that you will owe your deductible for the collision that is listed on the declaration page since the other party had full coverage their insurance will subrogate against your insurance company for the damages to their insured's vehicle including the deductible the other person has on the policy and the loss will count against your loss history depending on the company you are insured with and how long you have been a customer will decide what happens to your rates normally in my experience as an agent the past ten years each company is different in handling their rate increases for losses and each state varies as well our claims department is national the first question asked is which state are you calling from so they know what guidelines to use some companies do not raise your rates others increase it at renewal you will have to wait and see how you are treated at the next renewal date and maybe get a few quotes in the mean time to be prepared you should not have any additional out of pocket expenses other than your deductible there is no deductible on liability and you will be covered personally for any lawsuits or claims arising from the accident up to the full amount of the liability limit on the policy Auto insurance Health insurance Life insurance Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Tax Annuity Social Security (United States) Publicly funded medicine FairTax Wal-Mart Contract Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Liability insurance Risk management Home insurance 401(k) Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Slander and libel National Insurance Mortgage Road traffic accident Negligence Title insurance Nuclear power phase-out Credit card Health care in the United States Flat tax Unemployment benefit Microeconomics Saskatchewan Government Insurance Liability Variable universal life insurance Tort reform Mutual fund Unemployment Citigroup Divorce Legal aspects of transsexualism Health savings account Segregated cycle facilities Sport utility vehicle Speed limit Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Actuary Income trust Expert system Nuclear power CPU cache Food Stamp Program Daylight saving time Commodity markets Automobile Warranty Earthquake insurance Member of the European Parliament Software testing Government debt Canadian and American health care systems compared Abortion Bond Gross domestic product Bank Education in the People's Republic of China Blackjack Poker jargon Drug test 2003 North America blackout Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Joint and several liability Policy Debate Auto Train (Amtrak) American International Group Corporation Limited liability company US health reform under FDR Incorporation (business) Estoppel Income tax Graduate school Amtrak Product liability Downing Street memo Domestic partnerships in California Income statement George W.
