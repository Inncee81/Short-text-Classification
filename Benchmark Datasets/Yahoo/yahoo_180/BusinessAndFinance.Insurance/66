do i keep old whole life insurance policies or cash them in for term my father just gave me five k insurance policies he had on me to me i'm now and married they are about year each total a year for k i would think i would need a lot more coverage and get a term policy but is there an advantage to keep the others or just cash them out worth less than k you may want to keep at least one of those policies active depending on what you decide to do overall that way you might at least have enough to cover expenses if you were to outlive the term policies you speak of however if you decide you no longer want the whole life policies depending on the value of them you probably won't want to cash them outright that's because you would have to pay taxes on whatever cash value you got out of the whole life policies there's a way around this though you can do what's known as a rollover of the funds from your whole life policy to a few different types of life insurance contracts without having to pay taxes on the cash values however you cannot roll the cash value to a term policy there's another option to keep in mind you could roll the funds to a universal policy which is in a lot of ways like a term policy on steroids basically a universal policy will build cash value for a little while but it will ultimately start to dwindle pretty quickly still you can keep your guaranteed death benefit till at least age and some of them extend as far as age effectively for the rest of any foreseeable lifespan that means you wouldn't lose the cash value of the whole life policies you wouldn't have to pay taxes on it either and if you're in good health you can still probably by quite a bit more coverage for the same price with universal policies you could even set it up so that you'd only have to keep paying for x number of years after which the policy is yours i typically set these up so that payments stop about the same age where my clients indicate they'd plan to retire don't be too hasty in cashing out those old policies until you get more info on your options Life insurance Insurance Variable universal life insurance Annuity Pension Tax Health insurance Social Security (United States) Publicly funded medicine United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Mutual fund Universal life insurance Taxation in the United States 401(k) Money Contract Bond Inflation Lloyd's of London Corporate finance Retirement plan Unemployment benefit Monetary policy Trust (Law) USA Personal finance Bank Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Social security Auto insurance Education in the United States Craps Ra (board game) Deflation (economics) Poker jargon Canada Health Act Public policy United States Postal Service Social Security debate (United States) Medicare (Canada) Nuclear power phase-out Student loan Primerica Financial Services Freeters Wal-Mart Capital accumulation Lottery National Insurance Canadian and American health care systems compared Life expectancy Government debt Security (finance) Warren Buffett FairTax Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Credit card Subsidy Commodity markets Title insurance Individual Retirement Account Blackjack Home insurance Gross domestic product Individual Savings Account Inheritance tax Health savings account Hyperinflation Common Agricultural Policy Florida Lottery Economy of Russia Leasing Productive and unproductive labour Actuarial notation Finance Child support Television licence Policy Debate Economy of Africa Institutional fund management U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Arguments for and against drug prohibition Theory of conduct Great Depression Contract with America $ale of the Century Supply and demand London Congestion Charge Trust (Law) non-USA Risk management Gambling
