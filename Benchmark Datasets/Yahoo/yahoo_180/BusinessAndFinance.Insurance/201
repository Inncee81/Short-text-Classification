at home for free trash grass paint mini blinds i gotta get a job so i can rest some if you are looking at adjusting for a career your answer will depend on what type of adjusting you would be doing independent adjuster or a company adjusting there are a lot of similarities but also some major differences an independent adjuster usually works for a smaller company that does field investigations for a number of insurance companies who don't have field reps in the area where the independent adjuster lives works a company or staff adjuster works just for one company most staff adjuster jobs are inside jobs sitting behind a desk all day working on the pc and phone you will have better benefits working for an insurance company as a staff adjuster but you can make more money working as an independent adjuster especially if you are licensed to handle storm or catastrophe claims if you are willing to work longer hours i have worked at many large companies st farm allstate american family nationwide as a staff adjuster i did both field and inside adjusting adjusting claims is never boring but when you work at a insurance company you always get more claims than you can handle in a hr week there is no overtime for any work over the hrs you do it for free since you are a salaried employee for most independent adjusters you are paid hourly based on the billable hours worked on a file so you actually get paid for any hours you work in excess of hrs as an independent adjuster you have much more face time with insureds and claimants and that gives you a chance to provide great customer service and sometimes educate people on how insurance works other times it means you get called dirty names i've done both types of adjusting and currently work as an independent adjuster even though the benefits are less than i got at big insurance companies i still like being an independent better major insurance companies expect you to work to hrs per week with no overtime if i work more than hrs i get paid for it i just get my regular hourly pay but at least i'm not working for some clueless dickweed for free to be an independent adjuster in most states you have to pass a licensing test if you work at an insurance company you normally don't have to be licensed if you want to get into this as a career i would suggest one of these backgrounds or experience auto body repair home or commercial contruction attend an adjusters training program at a vo tech school some people think that ex cops make good adjusters but i disagree i have worked with of them over the years and they were not good at adjusting being an adjuster can be a good job or it can be a bad job so much depends on where you work every claims dept at a large insurance company has tons of politics and back stabbing crap going on working for or owning an independent adjusting company lessens that crap by about good luck Insurance Wal-Mart Health insurance Life insurance Constitution of
