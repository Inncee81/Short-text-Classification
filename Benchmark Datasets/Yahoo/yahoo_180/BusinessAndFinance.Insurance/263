i have an auto insurance policy for the person who hit my property how do i find which company issued it the police report shows an insurance policy number but it does not state the name of the issuing company the person ran into my brick and iron fence with his car and i want to file a claim against his insurance not my homeowner's policy the police apparently do not record this information annoying is there a numerical format of some kind that easily identify's which company issued the insurance nope occasionally an agent will recognize a policy number but there are thousands of companies out there writing policies and not all agents write for all companies plus it's private information you have two choices realistically either go through your homeowners carrier and let them chase down the policy number which btw might be inactive if the policy has been cancelled or file against the guy directly in small claims court you could also just wait and see if he files a claim with his insurer but that's not particularly proactive Insurance Life insurance Contract Lloyd's of London SCO-Linux controversies Surveillance United States Postal Service John F.
