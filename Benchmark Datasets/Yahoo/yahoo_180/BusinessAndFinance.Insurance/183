what should the basic coverage be on a home insurance policy for a home valued at i'm not sure what you mean about the basic coverage are you asking how much an insurance policy should cost what kind of coverage liability amounts with that in mind i will try to give you a little information you always want to purchase a full replacement coverage policy for your home with full replacement the insurance company will pay the cost to replace items rather than give you a depreciated amount for example your roof will depreciate in value over time if you get hail damage full replacement coverage will pay the full cost of replacing the roof less deductible other policies would only pay the depreciated value which means you could be picking up half of it or more for liability limits purchase the highest liability limit you can without having to go to some type of umbrella policy often around typically the liability amounts are relatively low increasing that amount is very inexpensive i increased mine a couple years ago from k to k the cost of my insurance went up around per year with the higher liability limit you are insulating yourself against injury lawsuits many insurance companies lock the value of your home in at the time you purchase the insurance i think you get around a increase in value after that you have to notify the insurance company that your house is worth more which means you will be paying more for the insurance check with a reliable insurance agent that can shop many different insurance companies if you go to a xyz insurance agent you are going to get xyz insurance if you go to an insurance agent that can shop your rates you will get the best rate regardless of whether it is xyz or abc insurance hope this helps Life insurance Auto insurance Microeconomics Home insurance Health insurance Wal-Mart Tax Publicly funded medicine Mortgage Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Lloyd's of London Credit card Title insurance Risk management Surveillance Variable universal life insurance Depreciation Contract Taxation in the United States Mutual fund Gross domestic product Blackjack FairTax Medical malpractice Citigroup Mobile home Health care in the United States Liability insurance Unemployment Personal finance Inflation Capital accumulation Bulk vending Tort reform Nuclear power phase-out Term life insurance 401(k) Consumption of fixed capital Corporation Stock Poker jargon Unemployment benefit Primerica Financial Services Warranty National Insurance Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway United States Postal Service High-voltage direct current Nuclear power Saskatchewan Government Insurance Corporate finance Health savings account Airline Transistor Bond Money Battery electric vehicle Drug test Commodity markets Monetary policy Growth hormone treatment Economy of Russia Asbestos Asset Wind power Solar power Member of the European Parliament Intellectual property Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Taxation in the Republic of Ireland U.S. generally accepted accounting principles Capital gains tax Slander and libel Cooperative United States dollar Bank Liability Supply and demand NFL on television Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Medicare (Canada) RuneScape weapons Tri-Stat dX Autonomous building U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Property tax Labor theory of value Sport utility vehicle Federal National Mortgage Association Incorporation (business) Gramophone record Capitalism Solar cell
