about medicare we're turning soon and will be tossed out of our current health care plan with kaiser permanente we live in co and will be relocating east on the coast somewhere the information i have currently found is that there are hmo's that offer medical dental and vision including drug coverage for one low price from to per month depending on the company we go with my question is this what is the stuff about medicare part a b and all the other alphabet soups i'm a little testy here because i'm confused if etna offers an hmo plan for per month why must i choose between the alphabet plans i got some of the information from www medicare gov or is that simply an option if i go with a ppo or fee for service plan i went to the website you suggested and then went back to www medicare gov and i'm more confused then i was before just what is medicare in english please but what about a full medicare health care coverage is there such a thing can i get health care without signing up for medicare after i'm i'm so confused try talking to me in english i do not understand spanish government yes it is very confusing my answer is greatly simplified for ease of understanding you'll want to visit a local independent agent for details part a is hospital coverage when you use the medical services you have a deductible in then you pay of the allowable charges part a is free for most people and given to you automatically when you turn part b is doctor coverage it has a deductible in then you pay of the allowable charges part b cost in for most people is per month this is given to you automatically but you can decline the main reason to decline is you've got coverage elsewhere the agent will help guide you there but in most cases you won't want to decline part c is the medicare advantage plans there are three types hmo ppo and pffs private fee for service you must have both part a and part b to get on a plan the aetna hmo you spoke about is a medicare advantage plan you have a time period of months months prior to your th birth month your birth month and months after your birth month to sign up on a plan if you don't sign up when first eligible there are restrictions as to when you can sign up these plans are county specific so you'll need to sign up in co if you are living there when you turn after your move you'll need to sign up with a different plan on the east coast these plans pay the part a b deductibles and the for you you have co payments when you use the service these plans have more benefits than just being on original medicare because the plans can administer the plan more cost effectively than the government can you do not have to sign up for part c if you are ok with the deductibles and the of part a b part d is the prescription drug plan you must have either part a or part b to sign up with one you also have the same time period as you do with part c you do not have to sign up but there are restrictions and penalties if you don't sign up when first eligible part d has a deductible in there is also a donut hole where you don't have coverage the agent can give you more details many of the part c plans have part d included the part c plans and many of the part d stand alone plans will pay the deductible make sure that any medication you are taking is on the formulary of any plan that you get on the agent can guide you you can elect to get a medicare supplement instead of the part c medicare advantage plan the premium for these plans are higher but you don't have any co pays so these plans are better for people that are sick and use the medical services frequently you must have both part a b to get on a plan no supplement has part d so you will need a stand alone part d plan if you get on these plans Pharmaceutical company Managed care Health care in the United States Medicare Part D Canadian and American health care systems compared Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Social Security (United States) Insurance Life insurance Taxation in the United States Student loan Medicare (Australia) Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act Medicaid Health savings account Wal-Mart Canada Health Act FairTax US health reform under FDR Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Health care in Canada HIPAA Flat tax National Health Service Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme United Kingdom corporation tax Canadian federal election, 1965 Social Security debate (United States) Food and Drug Administration George W.
