could any one help i'm sooo confused what is the difference between the multiregional model and out of africa model this question is regarding human evolution i'll make this simple as all the other answers either have minor or major flaws due to the dna evidence the current multiregional model has to imply that erectus migrated out of africa and then independantly evolved into different archaic homo sapien species all around the globe then as anatomically modern homo sapiens migrated out of africa these archaic groups were still reproductively compatible and bread into this anatomically modern homo sapien and added regional gene contributions from the archaic species the out of africa model states that these regional archaic populations were not reproductively compatible with anatomically modern homo sapiens and as of such were eventually replaced by being out competed by this new anatomically modern homo sapien that radiated out of africa this covers the models' definitions additional information the dna evidence is too consistent to ignore the fact that anatomically modern homo sapiens did evolve in africa and the discussion between multi regional vs out of africa comes down to weather or not anatomically modern homo sapiens were still reproductively compatible with the numerous archaic populations which had independantly evolved around the globe so far the bulk of the empirical evidence is pointing towards the out of africa model as being the correct one here are some maps which show the spread of y dna and mt dna based on the frequencies of haplogroups in modern populations north america and australia are based on the pre colonial indigenous populations and thus creates a pre colonial image of the spread of human genes mt dna http worldfamilies net migration map wfn gif y dna http jewsandjoes com images ftdna migration map jpg it is this dna evidence that makes it impossible to conclude that anatomically modern homo sapiens evolved independantly from different regional archaic homo sapiens groups as some of the answers that you have received have implied Race Single-origin hypothesis Species Homo (genus) Milford H.
