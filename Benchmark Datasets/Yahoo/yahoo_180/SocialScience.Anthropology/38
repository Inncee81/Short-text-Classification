do you think eventually this planet will be of one homogeneous human race if were still around by then i hope not variety is cool besides there are genetic benefits for the species to having a diverse population i think we will see a lot more mixing of races in the future but we will never be all one race there are still too many primitive cultures that are more or less cut off from the modern world and even though as people become more open minded about interacial relationships even though there have always been people attracted to the exotic there will also always be people who are attracted to the familiar want to be with people who look like them hopefully it won't be too many more generations before xenophobic racists are bred out of our culture but there will still always be people who are just plain more attracted to members of their own race it will be nice when that day comes where such choices are made out of personal preference not out of hate or fear Biodiversity Race Sexual orientation Species The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Sexual attraction Black (people) Domestication Human Physical attractiveness Culture Multiracial Validity of human races Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire Plant breeding Eugenics Extinction Xindi Caucasian race Chicken Science fiction film Franz Boas Heterosexuality Diversity Sigmund Freud Imperium (Warhammer 40,000) Traveller (role-playing game) Demographics of Japan Ecology Human nature Drow Pioneer Fund Insect Race (historical definitions) Sex Immigration Green Day Racism Genetic engineering Extraterrestrial life Guns, Germs, and Steel Prime Directive Sociocultural evolution Dog Exosquad characters Social psychology Asian fetish Xenophobia Reality Primate W.
