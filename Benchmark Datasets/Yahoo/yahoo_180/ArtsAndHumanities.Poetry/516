any comments on my poem happy cockroaches cockroaches can run away from anything including from the lights being turned on from cleaning up after themselves from their multiplying offspring from people pets and sprays from being thankful for food and shelter and from paying a cent for rent c i'm not sure if you meant to do it but your poem seems to move from being about the actual insects to a person who can be seen as a cockroach if that's what you were going for you do it in a subtle way and it works very well cent for rent is a nice way to end the poem as there is no rhyming before this i like it it has a certain shel silverstein meets an irish limerick feel to it keep writing Shel Silverstein Cockroach Rent (musical) Poetry Andrew Dice Clay Limerick Limerick (poetry) Rudyard Kipling Literature Gross domestic product Foodborne illness U2 (band) Totally Spies!
