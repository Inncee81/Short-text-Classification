what do you think of my poem bring your scarf maroon soaked coat let s run away someplace remote take my hand embrace my arm as i m near you i m hotter than warm the deserted park just you and i on this rainy day of july let s gaze into each others eyes and chase around the fireflies make paper boats to drop on streams have vanilla caramel sweet ice creams talk of the world of what we believe happy go lucky carelessly naive cuddle and flirt by the colored see saw blinded by love by lack of flaw dancing to melodious whispers of wind as we waltzed along giggled and grinned splashing in puddles as though we were five enjoying the treasures of being alive forget all your troubles erase all the pain timeless romance as we kiss in the rain time to depart as skies turn gray we say goodbye in our own little way tomorrow again he yells far away being with him was the best of today hi i'm valeria i'm fifteen years old i've already posted this poem but i just wanted to hear more opinions about it i don't have a title for it yet suggestions are gladly welcome much love d i think you have done well the rhyming isn't at all bad but the rhythm gets a little off and the timing gets a little off in a couple places but not bad i'm sure that will improve you switched from present tense to past tense and back again which threw it off a bit also but still not bad enough to worry about keep writing it gets better with time and i see talent underlying what you did my best advise to you is to develope your style of poetry and don't let others dictate how you write do it the way you like and it will flow like water and appeal to many my choice for your title would be something on the order of love in the park Happy Tree Friends Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Time Out of Mind Cliff Richard AFI 100 Years series Sin City Billboard Hot 100 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Milton H.
