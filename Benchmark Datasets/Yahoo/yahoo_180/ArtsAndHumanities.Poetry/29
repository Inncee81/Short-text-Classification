my burial for love poem plz comment burial for love your buried out with the bones of my dead memories in the backyard mortuary next to the cemetary of long gone dreams you used to mean everything but now you mean nought no more do i wish to sought for feelings not worth it and best left forgotten since i've fought them too many times over again and again it's no use holding onto to something that goes around and around whining like a broken recording on forever spin all's fair in love and war they say but i think nay everyone has to pay to eventually win s n hammond it's about an ex btw hears a pin drop watches a tumbleweed blow by learn how to use spellchecker fluffy rolls her eyes and i'm more talented you'll ever be so shows middle finger i think it's beautiful you are really talented i could even feel the emotions you wrote about it reminds me of the old saying it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all i think it really says a lot about who you are Jon Secada Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Blood on the Tracks Rent (musical) Sesshomaru Funeral Time Out of Mind Embalming EastEnders Pitaten The Amber Spyglass Scenes from a Memory Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Professional wrestling slang John Berryman The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Brigadoon The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Jewish bereavement Miss Saigon The Supremes Insane Clown Posse Eric Cartman Elton John Professional wrestling holds Spice Girls RuneScape quests The Lovely Bones Marilyn Monroe Salad Fingers Paul Is Dead Cemetery Blonde on Blonde The Shining (film) Cole Porter Jim Steinman Jeopardy! in culture Leo Wyatt George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron Shen Gong Wu Mystique (comics) Damn Yankees One Tree Hill (TV series) Death Ulic Qel-Droma William Shakespeare Long barrow Phaedo Billboard Hot 100 Bringing It All Back Home Dynasty (TV series) Oh My Goddess!
