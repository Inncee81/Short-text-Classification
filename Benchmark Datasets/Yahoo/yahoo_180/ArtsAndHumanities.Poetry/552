my poem a parents vision comments as a small child crawling so tenderly not knowing now what in the future he ll be early in life we ll need to plan to grow him into a really great man we hope that his life will be true and be long and for that feat he ll need to be strong for in his life he ll share all its sorrows he ll take it in stride and plan for tomorrows if he is smart he ll learn to observe for sometime in life it will throw him a curve if he learns young there won t be much pain as we all know it can come down like rain and as he grows he can go anywhere we ll start him out young give him a dare we ll hope that he ll learn to explore there is so much out there for him to adore and when it is time for him to grow old we hope in his life he was truth full and bold and when all those years does takes it toll we ll look at his life we ve accomplished our goal good concept needs some editing though you're trying too hard at times and missing the obvious phrase for example if he is smart he ll learn to observe for sometime in life it will throw him a curve could have easily been if he's smart he'll learn to observe for sometimes life will throw you a curve or if he's smart he'll learn to observe because sometimes life throws you a curve you don't need to say him in both lines and if you're worried about using a cliche like life throwing you a curve then put it in quotes like this because sometimes life throws you a curve it doesn't let you completely off the hook but at least it's a recognition that the line has been used to the point of being cliche also don't feel like you have to add commas in the middle of a line if you don't want the reader to breathe there there is so much out there for him to adore reads just fine without the comma and there are many other lines that fall into the same category finally couplets are very difficult to pull off without sounding too rhymy they usually work when you want comedic effect not what you're trying for here in a sonnet not quite that either or any other poem that makes the couplet almost invisible because the rhyme sounds unavoidable as if no other word would have fit your couplets on the other hand rhyme as if they were forced to and it isn't surprising because like i said they are very difficult to do well the great poets make them seem easy but don't let that fool you into thinking that they actually are easy because they are not try an abab or abba pattern for example if we rearrange your last four lines and when it is time for him to grow old when all those years finally take their toll we hope his life was truthful and bold if so we d have truly accomplished our goal okay so there was a little editing of the last line too but can you see how rearranging the aabb to abab made the rhymes a little less rhymy you can try this with the other lines and with different patterns until you find one whose tone matches your subject the most closely keep writing Jon Secada Rhyme scheme Rhyme Poetry Shakespeare's sonnets Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sonnet Equine conformation Shaggy dog story Motivation Humphrey Bogart Scenes from a Memory Tenshinhan Joke Meter (poetry) Chinese language E.
