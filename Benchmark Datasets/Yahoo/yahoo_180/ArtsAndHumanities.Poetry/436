read this passage poem what do you think when i wrote it originally it was in a passage of text but then i decided it could be a poem do you like it this way emotionless and numb i sit here idly leading a pointelss life for a pointless day can i somehow escape to another world where light frames every face and love kinders every heart that place so perfect so frightening i could not happily exist in a place where against the odds meat truth wisdom and honesty and though this place this place should be the place i strive to reach i wish not to see that until i am happy with a lonely obsolete existence never oops spell checker screwed up the spelling of meat not my fault lol holy twinkies i think i did it again that might have been me then not the spell checker i meant to write meant instead of meat lol hehe first of all its much harder to write free verse because a rhyme scheme gives you a framework to build your idea off of in free verse you have to win your reader over not with an easily wrapped up little package but a profoundly true deep statement your depth is there but the concrete connections to the ideals you are pursuing are not then again nobody agrees with me here and they think all that sing songy straight rhyme crap is fantastic a writing teacher once told me that adverbs were to be avoided that youre better off looking for a verb that is more specific i also think you misspelled kindels i really think the tension of your poem comes from the last lines which to me says kill thy darlings and start a new poem that tackles the much more difficult task of explaining why you must first find contentment here on earth and why the next best thing is really just a figment of our imagination overall one of the deepest poems i've read on answers Poetry Bhagavad Gita Socrates Philo Religion Book of Mormon Amidah Translation House of Leaves The Dunciad Shaggy dog story English grammar Trinity Jacob Neusner Tao Te Ching Simone Weil Buddhism Deconstruction Biblical inerrancy Spell checker God Theory of conduct Mantra Meaning of life Paradise Lost Calvin and Hobbes A Course In Miracles John Berryman Didache Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friedrich Schleiermacher Emily Dickinson Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Leet Hey Jude Discordianism Sabbath Hangul Tetragrammaton Object-oriented programming Angel Rhyme Rudolf Hermann Lotze Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief African American Vernacular English Urantia The Amber Spyglass Philosophy of language Japanese grammar Apocrypha Church of Christ, Scientist Criticisms of Christianity Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity German grammar Goodness and value theory American Pie (song) George Oppen Sant Mat Eugene Onegin Past teachings of Prem Rawat Miguel de Cervantes Gary Snyder Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Sant Thakar Singh Mu'allaqat El (god) Extreme Programming Eastern Orthodox Church Rabindranath Tagore Origin belief Yehuda Halevi Book of Revelation American and British English differences W.I.T.C.H.
