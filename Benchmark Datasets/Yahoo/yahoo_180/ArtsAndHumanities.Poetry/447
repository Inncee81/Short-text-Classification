what do you think the music played with a calming frequency the speakers gently seeped the sound of ambient keyboards and light percussion creating a seductive soundtrack to our midnight drive through curtains of blackness the windows were cold to the touch reflecting the icy conditions in our immediate extremity salt stains and fingerprints littered the glass and streaks with melted snow cascaded down it's length the music pulsed louder yet gentle like the far away squeal of a pot of boiling water the skylight was glowing faintly with a vague hints of an impending dawn the car raced along a painfully straight stretch of road and she hadn't so much as turned the steering wheel two degrees in the last twenty minutes nor word was spoken as we were so perfect so happy they'll remember only our smiles 'cause that's all they've seen blood since dried when we are found are the tears in which we had drowned as we were so perfect so happy continued why are you doing this she spoke without expecting a response her voice penetrated the still air of our speechless drive so silent my heart had jumped i'm not doing anything i said but i didn't even believe that myself this is what's best for me for you for us or maybe just for me i thought as a tear formed in the pit of her eye the music poured through the speakers and we were losing ourselves in the cadence she looked down momentarily and closed her eyes for a bit longer than a standard blink then she was crying then she was shouting then i was shouting now pouring confessions having no answers or solutions we barely even heard the questions as we were so perfect so happy they'll remember only our smiles 'cause that's all they've seen blood since dried when we are found are the tears in which we had drowned as we were so perfect so happy don't put me underground i was meant for a life somewhere else please love give me the wheel before both of our hearts you will steal tonight will steal tonight as we were so perfect so happy don't remember only your smiles 'cause that's all they've seen blood since dried when we are found are the tears in which we had drowned as we were so perfect so happy our cracking voices became part of the music the car pressed on faster through the night as our voices lowered the cadence again overtook the air up ahead there was a curve approaching she made no indications of slowing source rise against the approaching curve i love rise against that song rocks d Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Jon Secada The Amber Spyglass The Shining (film) Happy Tree Friends Sin City Poker jargon Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Indianapolis 500 Frankie Laine The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Speed of light The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Opportunity rover Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Beach Boys Paul Is Dead Hey Jude Futurama (TV series - season 5) Milton H.
