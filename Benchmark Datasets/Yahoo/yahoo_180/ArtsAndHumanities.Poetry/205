do you like my poem i long for the day when the sea and i will be one when i will bathe in her waters and bask in the sun the warmth of the waves will cover me the sound of the tides will rock me to sleep i will dream of her many mysteries and pray for a day when man will love as much as she loves me i will be a prisoner of land no more sorry it is called prisoner of land does this flow better i long for the day when we will be one when i will bathe in her waters and bask in the sun the warmth of the waves will cover me the sound of the tides will rock me to sleep i will dream of her many mysteries and pray for a day when man will love as much as the sea loves me i will be a prisoner of land no more i like it it's simple and direct maybe you should work a bit on the meter the pacing's a little weird if you could tighten it up just a little bit it would flow better and it needs a title Tide "Weird Al" Yankovic Renewable energy Planet Waves The Waterboys Moon Surtsey Opportunity rover Linda Ronstadt Flood Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Glacier Beach Sun John the Baptist Grunge music Waylon Jennings Tommy Atkins Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tidal power Coast Agatha Christie Roxette Origin belief Solar power Dean Koontz The Beatles discography Coral Sea Islands Mars Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Anchor R.E.M.
