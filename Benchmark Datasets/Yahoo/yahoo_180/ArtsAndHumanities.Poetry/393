will she kill me guarded the faces leaning flat elbows in corners lashed by raw shadows felled by the timbres of forests smiles sealing fissures in fables voiceless to hushed ears that listen in what silent pastures still rooted do wings render flight to the dusk and whispers on thresholds find answers to questions that die here unasked they wait at the sepulchral entrance to lie in the disengaged shadow and ask for the axe to be measured by dry sightless wells of their eyes arrested the throbs in the walls of the temple lungs no longer lift to the weight of their hunger strident the warning exhibit vortex of torn wings descending raping the tired broken harvest the bone from the marrow uncovered do waters still flow in the channels carved by the hard fisted muscle warmed by the noon sun that slumbers cooled by the black rains that follow the soles of feet find no comfort in following pathways of ashes the bones bend to taste a new blossom and bleed on an earth frozen over i ran out of space sure i've seen longer poems than this this is my sister's first poem you might compare it to the one i posted comments on this reflection what a difference in subject i'd appreciate your comments she has been published since this one on her behalf thank you mutya p she has been published doctor watson i also posted in philosophy for the creative answers in that category you should see of the first answers now she really will that was supposed to be the soles of old feet find no comfort moon thank you willow seemingly effortless rhythm that doesn't lag once that's what i thought having taken the seminar with her although i have no talent for poetry i understand how important voice is it needs to be read aloud for the music in it even if the metaphors aren't related to also this poem was published brandy b it is long i agree but consider some other poems of even greater length i agree with appeal to certain sort of folks that's the beauty of creativity the same thing doesn't appeal to everyone nor does it need to dr watson a critique from one who truly understands poetry now the worst of times to choose since this is growing whiskers lovely lovely lovely i especially enjoy the seemingly effortless rhythm that doesn't lag once rhythm is problematic in my writing so i love this especially read out loud it just rushes out of the mouth this is the sort of work i would love to read with a class and get everyone's perspective perhaps this will be read in poetry workshops someday it is that good and as i said a superb example of rhythm well done thanks for posting this psychic cat Equine conformation Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story A Course In Miracles Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.
