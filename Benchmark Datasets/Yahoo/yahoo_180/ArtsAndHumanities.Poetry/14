another poem i wrote how good or bad honest answers only please days go by so quickly nights go by so slow laying awake in my bed i wonder why you had to go you never looked back the day you left me like that you said you d never forget our ride to the moon way up high above the heads of our friends we were the only ones there way up on the moon your eyes were diamonds so sapphire blue your smile sent me somewhere i think it was the moon so far away that was so long ago too i wonder if it has changed as i stare up at that moon okay it has promise you echo the word moon on all your last lines except the first stanza and it's conspicuous by its absence fix that put it in the last line on the first stanza is weak anyway so this might make it right check your beats you've decided to do unrhymed verse that's fine but you need to keep the cadence moving and you don't you drop beats here and there and they wouldn't be difficult to fix so fix them have someone read the lines out loud to you so you can hear them in someone else's voice i can tell by the tone that you'll be able to hear the problem areas and i have every confidence you'll be able to fix them on your own be careful on under overstatements way up high is obviously above the heads of our friends so you need a different example especially if you're going to refer to the moon again also i sense your version of long ago is probably only a few years so be careful of sounding pretentious you can say that it seems so long ago that would be fine i hope you see the difference otherwise it had an even tone and like i said possibilities work on it a bit and post a revision if you think it's been improved meanwhile keep writing Social rule Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Meter (poetry) John Berryman Milton H.
