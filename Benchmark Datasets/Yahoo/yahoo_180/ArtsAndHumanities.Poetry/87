yet another poem sometimes i cry sometimes i frown sometimes i m lost sometimes i m found sometimes i smile and look to the sky sometimes i wonder why life goes by sometimes i think about you and why this had to end sometimes i cry out my eyes until the tears come down sometimes i think about you and why you had to leave and i only wanna know why you made me believe please take me back don t leave me here take me in your arms just one more time sometimes i wish sometimes i hope sometimes i wonder why you re in my life sometimes i wonder why you left and why i stayed behind what made you walk out on me what made you disappear why d you come in my life when you surround me by my fears come back don t leave come back i think i can believe stay away don t come near go away before i even shed a tear come back stay away come back go away honest answers please the end was awesome i must say it's basic straight to the point but packs a punch of emotion in it i love the end you can really see the struggle of wanting something so bad but being so scared to be hurt if you know how to write music make this into a song it would be really good as a song too i give it a Jon Secada Shaggy dog story One Tree Hill (TV series) Rich Mullins The Amber Spyglass The Ashlee Simpson Show Gregg Alexander I Don't Wanna Cry EastEnders Pitaten Miss Saigon Social rule The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sydney Riot of 1879 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Max Martin The Beach Boys Muslim ibn Aqeel The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Emotions (album) The Time Machine Another Side of Bob Dylan Night (book) Time Out of Mind The Isley Brothers Phoebe Buffay's songs Kodocha Shinn Asuka The Parting of the Ways The Death Gate Cycle The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Frankie Laine The Miracles Hip hop collaborations Mariah Carey (album) Wonderland (McFly album) Poker jargon Tears for Fears Shen Gong Wu Cliff Richard The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Cher (entertainer) Donna Summer Kender Good Charlotte The McGuire Sisters Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hall & Oates Nico Robin The Shining (film) John Berryman Rais massacre Queen (band) Jennifer Lopez The Contender (television series) Avenue Q LaToya Jackson Piccolo Junior Saga Knife Tears Whitney Houston Satchel Paige Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Waking the Dragons Aquemini Tom Jones (singer) Force (Star Wars) Garth Brooks Friends Father's Day (Doctor Who) Swingout Empire Burlesque The Hits/The B-Sides Billboard Hot 100 Romulus and Remus Polygon Records The Emancipation of Mimi Scarlet's Walk Futurama (TV series - season 5) Random Harvest Sami Brady 1957 World Series Characters of Naruto Current teachings of Prem Rawat Blonde on Blonde Bon Jovi The Empty Child Dolly Parton Johnny Cash Love and Theft Freddy Fender MC Hammer Tag Spice Girls Montreal Screwjob Coming of Age (TNG episode) Anya Jenkins The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan
