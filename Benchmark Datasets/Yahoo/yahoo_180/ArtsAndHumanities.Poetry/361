can you take a look at this poem please what sort of world have we been given a strange place with skies full of smoke where are the green pastures and the still water they have become a joke even now whilst we recycle our cans and save our plastic bags for later use our generation has been given a world with its head in a hangman's noose is it too late what difference can be made now that this damage has been done now that the trees are burning and the smog blots out the sun we have forsaken the green pastures and we will continue to joke until the world is beyond salvation a strange place with skies full of smoke forgot the title sorry it's 'my generation' and the third line down in the second verse should read 'my instead of 'our generation thanks good deep and worth thinking about maybe it should be printed and delivered to every home in the world or printed over and over again till we know it by heart Bong Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Characters in the Smurfs Noah Hay Waste management Sonic the Hedgehog 2 John Wesley Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coffee Plastic Salvation Luminoth Solar power Gramophone record Customs and etiquette of Japan Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME El (god) Warcraft III Gene Wolfe Mercury Atlas 6 Dustbin Link (Legend of Zelda) Kigo Sonic & Knuckles Neil Gaiman The Dunciad Lechaina Four Quartets Gospel of Thomas The Amber Spyglass Sukkot House of Leaves Monopoly (game) Fire fighting Tefillin Mathematician Intravenous therapy The Divine Comedy T.
