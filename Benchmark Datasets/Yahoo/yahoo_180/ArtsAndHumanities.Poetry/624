come on people rip it apart i wanna know your thoughts feedback good and bad todays society a man walked down the street today was shot it bled him dry a girl awoke in some dark place was raped by some smooth guy a baby drowned by its mamas hand the tub was full and warm a woman cried he broke the vow and now she's full of scorn i sat back and watched it all the news is such a drag and if i only took a stand this world may better be but who has time to give a crap if the victim isn't me lisa thank you so much this is the second poem i've posted and i keep getting one line answers you just proved that there are people left in the world who think ta i apprecaie what you are doing believe me now the poem may not be appealing at all yet it has all the basic requirments to be considered poetry im a english major maybe my work stinks and i my spelling is worse but i can most deffinitly distingish poetry from prose so do a favor and supply educated responses in the furture thank you kristi i'll give a bit of both for you the subject matter and the words are cutting in a good way the dark apathy in the ending is particularly powerful i do think it can be improved as poetry to me the rhythm is actually too precise in this it reads a bit more sing songish than works with this subject matter i am also not sure why the end isn't broken into lines it reads the same in rhythm and rhyme scheme but is written out as though it were prose i can see a good argument for putting this in such a controlled almost light poetic style apathy typically involves falling into step in some way and adhering to a strict form does make sense in that regard still i think using some free verse with this to give it some ragged edges that fit the subject matter would improve it if that is what you were doing by writing the last section as you did then go the extra step to disrupt the rhythm and rhyme there rather than just eliminating the line breaks all in all nice work on this Poetry Meter (poetry) Literature Alliterative verse Biblical poetry Rhyme Theory of conduct English grammar Glossary of partner dance terms Poker jargon Craps Rabindranath Tagore Translation Limerick (poetry) Theodicy Irish poetry Restoration literature Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Japanese poetry Sonnet Augustan literature Song Jon Secada Abortion debate Whose Line Is It Anyway?
