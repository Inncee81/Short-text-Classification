opinions on this please her pain was tangible snapping like electricity in the air the taste of it lay on her tongue with every breath it polluted her soul gave her cause to cry in anguish in the darkness the terrible darkness loneliness played games with her like an evil trickster it promised laughter then delivered pain she called out she cries out still begging for mercy for someone to save her but everyone that comes eventually goes leaving in their wake the laugher of the devils the ones that plague her the ones that blacken her days that the steal the light from where will her release come who will set her free will the dark own her forever will the devils play their games for eternity who will set her free till then the darkness reigns it suffers no light extinguishing it with fury so it will never be again till then the darkness reigns loneliness her king the poem is about a women longing for luv but in all forms she feels alone and lost unworthy of love and believes that she will forever be trapped this has a good amount of potential it talks about pain and loneliness but is not monumentally boring that can sound a little harsh but without images to grasp onto poems of this type can quickly devolve into abstract messes yours is above that and looks like it could get even better you asked for opinions so here's mine work a little more to engage the senses in this poem you are dealing with pain and loneliness your reader needs to be able to latch on to what does that look like feel like smell like etc so when you start with pain don't tell me it's tangible show me in what ways it's tangible so your first lines might be her pain snapping like electricity in the air ok then you hit line the taste of it lay on her tongue what does pain taste like i have no idea but it is not a word to clarify that to your readers if it has a taste what is it i was reading a question in another section describing a bad labor pains in pregnancy the mother got to tallking about the actually delivery and said it was like trying to push out a bowling ball covered in shards of glass now as a guy i will never experience labor but that description will stay with me it made what would be an abstract pain to me something that i could relate to this is what you need to add to make this poem stronger i think it is good in some parts but it could be very good these kinds of changes will make that difference just give it some thought take care Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hell The Amber Spyglass Theory of conduct Scientology beliefs and practices Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Emancipation of Mimi Simone Weil The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Paradise Lost Shen Gong Wu Sin City Demon Breastfeeding Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Wolfrider Summa Theologiae Atomism Immortality Childbirth Characters in the Smurfs Thief (computer game) Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Kodocha The Dunciad Baseball Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Conan the Barbarian Evil InuYasha media and release information Sense Night (book) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Tag W.I.T.C.H.
