my poem bonds run deep comments she stood outside for just a glimpse for a face thats aged from innocence she see the eyes she sees the face like memories from another place she gets real close her sight is clearer the vision there seems like a mirror the sight she sees brings her to tears of older days and yesteryears there was the day that they departed their combined life it never started who really knows what could have been but here's her chance she'll try again she gets right in her line of sight just when she thought the time was right for them it seemed like time stood still they gave a look like loved ones will but then that girl just gave a glare and vanished into the thin air she didn't care if they were kin she just saw an evil twin so she sat down and started crying that look she got was so denying then someone whispers in her ear i'm coming back our fued stops here nice wordings but um i don't get the last two stanzas one more thing the poem doesn't convey much emotion in my opinion it's as if you wrote it for the sake of writing it i don't know but that what i feel also could you please comment on my poem it's in my asked questions profile Shaggy dog story Four Quartets Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind The Amber Spyglass Scenes from a Memory Jon Secada Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct K' Oh My Goddess!
