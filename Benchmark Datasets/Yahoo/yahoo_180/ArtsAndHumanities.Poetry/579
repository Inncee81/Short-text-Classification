my poem life death love and hate warning came up with this poem in the middle of the night and my rhyming isn't that good in the eyes of deathwe look and we fightwe figh with all our might until our willpower seeps away just like our wealth in the eyes of love we fall and we sing it has that aura an attractive bling with that feeling you soar into the sky like a dove in the eyes of hate we show it and we hide having to choose a side this world is what we create in the eyes of life we smile and we rejoice to the world we spread out joys and into this new adventure we happily dive i am not a poet and don't intend to be say anything you want i was expellermussed once but i did go on to become the poet i did not want to be in the first place Poetry E.
