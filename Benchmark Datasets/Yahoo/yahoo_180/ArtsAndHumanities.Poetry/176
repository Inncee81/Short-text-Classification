good morning poem siena those golden days of sorrow filled adoration along the canals and in the forests vastly lost on god s estate waiting for you in an ancient cafe a half glass of aged madeira the old fear that you may no show but then around the bend into refracted cathedral light you carried grief to me your face a too often read story of how things wouldn t be and i half listened studying your radiance cheviche and uneaten truffles watched as i argued for us and you said no then disappeared into cobblestone shadows i learned gilded lessons of love and isolation and left us in the past for thinner rooted places thin promises of new days love and mourning twist in the traditional way pulling me back to a caf on the river to see you again in siena obscureb you have some beautiful imagery here just wonderful phrasing sorrow filled adoration though a mouthful feels very lush here this poem has such specific interesting details a half glass of aged madeira into refracted cathedral light your face a too often read story cheviche and uneaten truffles watched gilded lessons of love and isolation i might as well just copy the whole poem the ideas transitioned from one another so well here satisfying and brilliant work this poem made it a very good morning thank you for sharing this Wood carving C.
