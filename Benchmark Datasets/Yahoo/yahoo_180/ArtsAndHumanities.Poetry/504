a different voice than i've ever used before less poetic and maybe more real but i'm not sure how it holds up as a poem read it as a conversation except for the chorus the first line is the speaker and every other line is the other voice the small children without exception get up early every day why i don t know but it is either inspiring or annoying depending on what i m not sure my internal balance i suppose what do you really mean i really mean that i want that kind of unwavering enthusiasm for life yes and love and challenge i know i m growing out of adolescent habits what habits it's laborious for me to sleep to the high heat of late morning and that means what it means children can t sleep for excitement adults for worry you re worried yes college loans love bad jobs good jobs money ah the same thing they get up to greet i try to sleep in to avoid life some form of it i guess here s the story my mother is always sad my father has four chronic diseases my sisters hate my father my mother should but instead she prays for him i m confused and i feel like my beginning is hailed with an end are you through with your greek chorus now chorus i am alone fine then your greek solo and no one is ever really alone what the hell does that mean no no i ask the questions you answer that is how this poem works fine so as i was saying what were you saying the little kids and siblings yes my dear little brother and sister don t be sentimental they seem to understand life they seem sage sage stoic almost like marcus aurelius embracing calamity without bowing to it don t be pretentious either sorry my coping mechanism is intellectualization you give yourself too much credit o k the point is despite the erosion of everything we know erosion eh despite the dismantling of the household yeah despite the kitchen clock disappearing along with other things that have belonged to this family yes this family for years the duration of my life ah the eldest yes despite the divorce now she s getting real the clashing of two realities no three his hers ours yes yes they get up happily early every morning and watch cartoons as if this is just life as if this too shall pass yes but how can they know how can they trust it will because they know it must so the line breaks in this are really not what they are supposed to be this might just be a disasterous jumble of sentences that won't make sense the way they are now if so i'm sorry willow you have questioned if your piece holds as a poem i'm no litteraly expert so i should also question if my reply holds as a critique but i know for sure that you long to break from the dogma of form and that you are seeking to find your own voice a voice that unveils your soul and denudes your true colors i believe that as much as you maintain the honesty of that voice the rest would be but edge trimming once again i'm deeply moved before i elaborate i wanna point you to a simple trick that could help boosting the meanings of your genius lines which is simply the line breakings dont hesitate to press enter in every meaning you want to emphasis and be greedy every meaning counts allow the reader to stop at every image i will demonstrate shortly dont you believe that a poetic dialogue needs two poets in a discourse it's not clear why the poem was posted in posts but it's clear that each was written in a seperate sitting which is revealed in the different attitude of the chorus and the different dramatic consistency of every part the other voice in the first part is agressive and distractive however let me try to use the line break to cut the flatness of the other voice the small children without exception get up early every day why i don t know but it is either inspiring or annoying it depends it flows better than depending on what i m not sure my internal balance i suppose what do you really mean i really mean that i want that kind of unwavering enthusiasm for life yes and love and challenge i know i m growing out of adolescent habits what habits it's laborious for me to sleep to the high heat of late morning and that means what it means children can t sleep for excitement adults for worry you re worried yes college loans love bad jobs good jobs money ah the same thing they get up to greet i try to sleep in to avoid life some form of it i guess the second part is brilliant it is also the most dramatic the lines flow so easily the chorus this time adds an enriching dimension and poses serious and important questions investigating remarks all of which will be more revealed through more of that enter pressings the third part carries deep thoughts and conclusive philosophic statements but the chorus is back to its blunt distractive tone which deprive you from the symbolic benefit of you managing to turn that voice from an opposing investigative voice to one who sympathize empathize with your explained agony keep it up willow Socrates EastEnders Shaggy
