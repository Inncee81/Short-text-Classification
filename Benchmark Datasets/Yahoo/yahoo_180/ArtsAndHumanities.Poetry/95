prince poem there once was prince who met many beautiful women but none who he fell in love with one day while attending a royal ball he saw a girl a girl mingling with her friends she saw him look and went away and he followed the sound of her anklets jingling the girl had no beauty it made no sense that i wanted to know her but she had a sweet innocence i got one of my royal friends to get me all the information about her i got her house address and went to her small cottage which was very far from town i climbed up to her window that night and saw her reading a novel in her night gown she saw me with great her big brown eyes as she helped me into her room i didn t want to waste my time and i told her that i have great feelings for you my lady every one was asleep i took her in my arms and tried to look into her eyes i gave her a few sweet kisses now i could start to feel her innocence i held her tighter so she could feel my body she seemed get tense and pulled away i decided to let her go but just one more hug now she was breathing harder and i could feel her warmth and breath on my body as i was leaving she stood by the wall oh she looked like a sweet glass doll no matter what i did not want to leave but for her i will she was away for a while and all i thought about was that girl and her unforgettable smile stop trying to make it rhyme and trying to make it flow i wouldn't exactly say you are the right kind for a poet but stop cutting the lines and turn it into a short story you really have a flair for it Kodocha The Amber Spyglass Sin City Blood on the Tracks Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada Scenes from a Memory Ron Weasley Piccolo Junior Saga Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Spice Girls The Shining (film) Blonde on Blonde Care Bears The Contender (television series) Pitaten The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe W.I.T.C.H.
