and one more rewrite i really appreciate your help on these innocence longing for the time i knew when my life belonged to me i was just a child you see innocent unique and free in the mist of night i dream the terror still rips at me i can feel like yesterday the man that i most despise he a wolf in sheeps disguise stole my innocence from me used me for his own dark sin ripped assunder by this man he stole the thing most precious my innocence and my hopes i hope the bastard burns away in hell where his type belong i pay the price everyday him forever and a day a couple points to consider on your rewrite steve l unique doesn't say a lot consider a word that conveys something l might want to include it after feel l wolf in sheep's disguise remember the apostrophe you may want to change this anyway it's a bit predictable for you i like your last line however i'm begging for more concrete details in here it's an emotional topic and i feel like though difficult psychologically you need to go deeper here what i mean is when i get to l rather than knowing that you the narrator are innocent and so on i'd rather focus on something that depicts that innocence some scene or image and then later when you crush the image there is an emotional response in the reader same with l the terror i'd like to see you take it a bit deeper i know you can it's just by drawing these images more fully through the poem i think you'd gain an emotional punch which is probably why you are rewriting this one so much it isn't quite giving you the payoff that you know the scene can give just my thoughts use what works disregard the rest Jon Secada Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City EastEnders The Amber Spyglass Blade Runner Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Invisibles Hell Time Out of Mind Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Days of our Lives Scenes from a Memory Eisner Award Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Sigmund Freud Social rule Meaning of life The Second Renaissance Characters in the Smurfs The Brothers Karamazov Theory of conduct Book of Mormon Venom (comics) Narrator The Hobbit Transformers: Cybertron John Berryman Russian joke Pitaten Nineteen Eighty-Four Storytelling Procrastination American Psycho Microeconomics Blood on the Tracks Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Gene Wolfe One Piece minor characters Daredevil The Star Wars Holiday Special Paradise Lost Humphrey Bogart Internet troll Obi-Wan Kenobi Consciousness Bon Jovi Zoophilia Poker jargon Marie Antoinette Anne Boleyn Video game controversy Alfred Hitchcock Altruism Art Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) 2005 Bali bombings Phoebe Halliwell Characters of Naruto Trainspotting (novel) About Schmidt Discordianism Blood (computer game) Infantilism Lewis Carroll Vulcan (Star Trek) Empathy Knots Landing Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Wassily Kandinsky Spidey Super Stories Objectivist philosophy The Pilgrim's Progress S__ren Kierkegaard Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Innocence: Ghost in the Shell Screenwriting Gospel of Thomas Soul W.I.T.C.H.
