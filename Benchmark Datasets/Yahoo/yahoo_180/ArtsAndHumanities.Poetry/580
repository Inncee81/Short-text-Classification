what do you think of my poem i wrote this poem at a m this morning i just felt like writing something what do you think keep in mind im only and im still thinking of changing a few things the clock tick tick tick go the seconds of my hours and the hours of my days never again to be seen never again to be heard my days move on and so do my years however my mind still lingers there in the past it relives and rejoices those events lost by the ticking of the clock thus while my body grows tired and weak my mind still clinging to those memories of the past is joyful and full of vigor my body is the arm within the clock however my mind is the hand who sets it while the arm is inevitably trapped by the clock and the ticking away of time the hand can turn back the clock to a time and place where more joyful events had occurred na i dont mind if you add it to your notepad or whatever thanks for your comments chipmunk aka that was beautiful do you mind if i put this on word pad so i can reread it sometime you mastered those words and managed to fit them together to express your feelings so perfectly your poem is so true that it hurts simply perfect Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Simone Weil Mattress Time Out of Mind Past teachings of Prem Rawat Time Joy Electric Milton H.
