does anyone know a good peom about someone who falls in love but cant be with that person or about someone who will stick by a person no matter what basically any good love peoms sad ones this is one of the saddest love peoms i wrote hope it suffices my beloved across the endless sea you've gone across to heaven's shore i cannot feel your silken touch i'll see your face no more for now i'll miss you next to me and have for several years my sorrow that you're gone from me has caused me many tears i miss the way you looked at me i miss your nose so cute i miss the sunlight in your hair i sometimes feel i'm mute the years i had so fleeting few to gather next to me the memories of a lifetime so in my mind i'd see the sparkles in your eyes so blue the golden hair so fine the perfumed scent i loved so much when you were only mine i must stay here yet for a time but there will come a day when i will meet you by the gate and then with each we'll stay no more to part nor turn our backs our spirits will entwine as one we'll spend eternity for you i'll cease to pine Scenes from a Memory The Amber Spyglass Pitaten Jon Secada W.I.T.C.H.
