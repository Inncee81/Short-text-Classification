what do you think of this poem i wish that you were here when i washed that final tear it reminded me of the way you made me feel it was not a dream it was totally real i saw you outside the window waiting for summer to come and now that its finally here you only wish that i was near i open the door to see you but you were not there i looked everywhere but you were nowhere to be found i wanted to cry my heart out but that would not solve a thing so i gathered my belongings to find you but i soon found that you were gone for good now i miss you more than ever you must have known you were always that clever i could not see what you had shown ill make it alright if you just come back why did you go in the first place was it because of the way i act i can make it better if i just erase i am sorry that i just watched you but never told you to come in i am sorry that this was over before it could ever begin i love it and don't listen to kevin s poems don't need a rhyme pattern Jon Secada The Jazz Singer Time Out of Mind Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Amber Spyglass Poetry One Tree Hill (TV series) Knots Landing Pitaten The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) The Inside Cliff Richard The Isley Brothers Care Bears Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Parsifal Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Subtle Knife Waka Miss Saigon Friends Scenes from a Memory Dial M for Murder Leo Wyatt Hall & Oates Ayyavazhi mythology The Dalek Invasion of Earth Pip (South Park episode) Storytelling Jennifer Lopez Grandview, U.S.A.
