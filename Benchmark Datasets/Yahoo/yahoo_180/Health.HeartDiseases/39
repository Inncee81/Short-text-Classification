any info appreciated been in hospital twice regarding s v t due to see consultant on thurday for test results and for him to tell me if i need an operation i know what s v t is but im a little worried anybody else been through the same paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia psvt is a rapid heart rate which occurs from time to time paroxysmal psvt starts with events taking place above the ventricles symptoms can come on suddenly and may go away without treatment they can last a few minutes or as long as days the rapid beating of the heart during svt can make the heart a less effective pump so that the body's organs do not receive enough blood to work normally the following symptoms are typical with a rapid pulse of beats per minute palpitations the sensation of the heart racing fluttering or pounding strongly in the chest or the carotid arteries dizziness or light headedness near faint or fainting shortness of breath anxiety chest pain or sensation of tightness weakness in legs a special procedure called radiofrequency ablation rfa has been developed as an alternative to medication to treat many patients with svt during this procedure special plastic tubes called catheters are inserted into a vein into the upper leg groin area and are advanced to the heart using a fluoroscope the catheters are used to record electrical signals from inside the heart they can locate precisely the site from which the svt originates radio waves called radiofrequency energy are delivered at the tip of this catheter to the precise location of the svt creating a small coagulation of the tissue approximately mm in diameter the procedure has a to chance of successfully treating the svt so that it does not recur or require medication there is approximately a chance that the svt will recur usually within the first to months rfa can carry the risks described below less than risk of serious or life threatening complications less than risk of damage to the normal conduction system bleeding bruising or infection at catheter insertion site damage to the heart lungs blood vessels or nerves blood clots to the lungs need for electrical shock to the chest rashes allergic reactions adverse effects of sedatives or anesthetic agents such as respiratory depression requiring insertion of a breathing tube please see the web pages for more details on svt and rfa Aortic dissection Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Panic attack Insulin Heart Pulmonary embolism Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Anxiety Medicine Lung Coronary catheterization Intracranial pressure Epidural Hypoglycemia Obstetrics Chlorpromazine Bone marrow transplant Childbirth Local anesthesia Blood pressure Leukemia Cancer Sleep apnea Atheroma Diabetes mellitus Penis Decompression sickness Aneurysm Group A streptococcal infection Carbon dioxide Tobacco smoking Aspergillosis Cocaine Mesothelioma Coeliac disease Mobile phone radiation and health Needle aspiration biopsy Flecainide Pneumothorax Syringomyelia Hip fracture Radiosurgery Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Magnetic resonance imaging Diabetic neuropathy Gastroparesis Opioid Aspartame Pulmonary hypertension Chronic fatigue syndrome Paracetamol Cephalic disorder Bipolar disorder Cystic fibrosis Apoplexy Gastroesophageal reflux disease Mitral regurgitation Air embolism Clinical depression Drowning Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Interventional radiology Hypertension Radiation therapy X-ray Allergy Trazodone Tourniquet
