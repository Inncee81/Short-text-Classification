my heart suddenly starts to beat faster but then it goes back to normal with no more symptoms i know i have to go to the doctor but i'm kinda sacared and don't want to wait to get to him to have at least an idea of what's happening i don't eat a lot of greasy foods since i don't go to fastfoods or eat any red meat but i do eat a lot sweet foods i am a bit overweight but not obese it's like pounds overweight and i'm years old i don't excercise much but i am not completely sedentary since i dance but just for a few monts september november and january april my grandmother did suffer from taquichardies but i don't know of anyone else suffering from any other heart disease in my family i am a completely healthy person who has never suffered from anything and doesn't get sick often what happens is it beats fast for like seconds and then it goes back to normal i don't feel dizzy or with blurred sight or any other symptom except for the beating of my heart in my chest which is really uncomfortable your grandma with tachycardia could have been brought on by anything and is not a disease in and of itself tachycardia simply means your heart is beating bpm beats per minute is the normal heart rate a heart rate should be fairly consistent with exceptions of chemical alterations stress and physical exertion any frequent deviation from a regular pattern should be followed up with a doctor immediately where they can do tests to see what is going on simple tests such as an ekg show the electrical pulses of the heart and allow the doctor to visualize the cycle of the heart beat and look for any blocks or electrical irregularities an echo cardiogram gives the doctor a two dimensional view of the flow of the blood and lets the doctor know how much of the blood is being pumped out of the heart and the direction a stress test can be helpful as well if there is a coronary artery blockage this can either be done with monitored exercise or chemically simple blood tests can detect electrolyte imbalances as you can see there are many things a doctor can do to check on the function of your heart if this is something that has happened more than once and there was nothing to trigger them go see a doctor dan s the answer above is very wrong and for your sake and health please disregard him i dont care if i get best answer but maybe the best thing to do is talk to your doctor wrong information on here can really do a lot of damage also tachycardia is not the same as an irregular heart beat disregard all that said that as well regular vs irregular simply is determining the length of time between electrical impulses of your heart this is usually deciphered with and ekg and they measure the time between your qrs complexes tachycardia is simply a fast heart heart rate and can be regular sinus tachycardia or irregular which can come in various forms Heart rate Tachycardia Chronic fatigue syndrome Hypertension Atrial septal defect Prostate cancer Coronary heart disease Diabetes mellitus Traumatic brain injury Heart Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Atherosclerosis Stroke Cardiovascular disease Angina Ventricular fibrillation Cardiology Atrial fibrillation Anorexia nervosa Coeliac disease Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Stomach cancer Urinary incontinence Blood pressure Physical examination Cancer Pulse Tocopherol Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Atrial flutter Asthma Action potential Nutrition Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Obesity Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator First aid Flecainide Panic attack Clinical depression Cardiac arrest Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures Anxiety Tobacco smoking CPU cache Cirrhosis Equine conformation Insulin Multiple sclerosis Bipolar disorder Atheroma Bradycardia Sleep apnea Pneumonia Decompression sickness Propranolol Circulatory system Chlorpromazine Folic acid Time signature Exercise Antiarrhythmic agent Heartworm Kidney Balance disorder Theory of conduct Dieting Maprotiline Medicine Cholesterol Milton H.
