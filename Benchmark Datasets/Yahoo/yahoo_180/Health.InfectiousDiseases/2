once you aquire mrsa do you have it for life mrsa is not normally a lifetime infection if it is treated properly and in time so as not to develop into septicaemia there are new products available to treat prevent and cure mrsa infection if taken regularly this will prevent any further episodes what is mrsa methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus is a common type of staph bacterium which lives on the skin and in the nasal passages of around of the population mostly this staph aureus bacterium does no harm and does not pose a problem with infection or require a cure but like many bacterium staphylococcus aureus has the ability to pose a serious infection problem if you are feeling run down ill injured or if you have undergone any form of surgery it can cause a very serious staph infection if it enters the body such as through open wounds or instruments placed in the body or by cross contamination from another patient nursing staff or specialist without proper treatment this can lead to death or be difficult to cure an antibiotic called methicillin was used for the treatment and cure of infections caused by staph bacterium the term 'methicillin resistant' means that this type of antibiotic can no longer kill of the staph bacterium and another antibiotic needs to be used if available if methicillin can no longer be used for the treatment and cure of staphylococcus aureus infection it is medically referred to as mrsa the causation of mrsa antibiotics have been in use for many years as a successfull treatment and cure for staph infections however these antibiotics have been overused misused and over prescribed as a cure for staph aureus infection for many years it is fairly common for people to not complete a course of antibiotics or not use as prescribed if this happens it is probable that not of the bacterium that caused staph infection will have been killed surviving staph bacterium develop a resistance to this antibiotic and multiply as more and more antibiotics are prescribed the number of staph bacterium that are able to resist those antibiotics become more numerous the biggest problem with the use of antibiotics is that they are non focused therefore they do not discriminate between good and bad bacteria otherwise known as 'flora' which can be found in the large intestines and form a large part of the bodies immune system without this immune system protection 'superbugs' are free to develop treatment of mrsa mrsa can be treated with different antibiotics to methicillin however this is becoming increasingly difficult medications such as antiseptic wash and certain ointments can be used to remove mrsa from the nasal passages and skin even when it is doing no harm to the individual however there is now a new product that has been proven to be effective in killing all mrsa bacterium and a lot of other known pathogens the new silver solution is non toxic proven in multiple tests at times the recommended dosage the new silver solution is the first colloidal silver product to attain a new patent in over years this product can be used internally externally and as a surfectant to both prevent and cure mrsa infection the new silver solution can also be used with animals and all our test data shows it to be very effective travel protection is travel to the middle east or iraq or africa a worry then the new silver solution is a medical 'must have' against infection protect yourself from disease outbreak mrsa or methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus as it is medically termed and malaria and avian bird flu the new silver solution also protects and will cure other staph infections yeast infection sinus infection urinary tract infection staph skin infections and a host of other pathogens and bacteria it does not only prevent these infections it can cure them those are claims which are verified medical institutions across the globe have conducted extensive tests on the new silver solution it is patented and has been forwarded to the fda for approval even though it is not a drug staphylococcus aureus causes many bacterial infections these can be boils carbuncles infected wounds deep abscesses and most worryingly infection of the blood stream which is medically termed as bacteraemia blood stream infection is also sometimes called septicaemia this is of greater severity and clinical significance a wide variety of bacterium can cause bacteraemia but one of the most common is staphylococcus aureus this is a very difficult situation for treatment or cure the symptoms though are not specific to mrsa they can be the same for other bacterium that cause septicaemia symptoms of septicaemia can include high fever rigors shaking a raised white blood cell count and disturbance in clotting of the blood with a tendency to bleed and ultimate failure of the vital organs this is the kind of mrsa infection that has the highest death rate in england and wales and also now in the usa mrsa bacterium can be found on the skin in the nose in wounds and in blood and urine or any other body site they are most likely to cause infection when a person has a break in their skin or another opening where bacterium can get inside the body common skin conditions caused by mrsa include infected cuts boils infected hair follicles fluid filled blisters impetigo or skin sores that look like infected insect bites minor mrsa infection can sometimes develop into more serious complications such as spread of the staph infection to surrounding tissues serious abscesses blood bone or heart infection first descriptions of staph aureus came in the 's it came to the attention of medical practitioners that this bacterium was the most common cause of infection of wounds following surgical procedures surgery tube insertion instruments etc although penicillin was discovered by sir alexander fleming in penicillin was not introduced against s aureus until the 's and most strains of s aureus were found sensitive to its use prior to penicillin these infections could cause serious or sometimes even fatal infection as no treatment or cure was available before penicillin unfortunately when penicillin was used for treatment of these staph infections a few strains of staph aureus made a protective enzyme called penicillinase which broke down the penicillin and protected the staph aureus bacterium beta lactamase is a type of enzyme produced by some bacterium that is responsible for their resistance to beta lactam antibiotics like penicillins cephalosporins cephamycins and carbapenems these antibiotics have a common element in their molecular structure a four atom ring known as a beta lactam the lactamase enzyme breaks that ring open deactivating the molecule's antibacterial properties these strains had become very resistant to penicillin and in approximately of all staph aureus strains which were taken from patients with clinical infections were penicillin resistant the bacterium that caused these infections had become evolutionist in nature penicillin was therefore no longer effective for the treatment and cure of these resistant staph aureus strains 'methicillin' was the next medical development and was derived from penicillin to treat these evolutionist staph aureus strains it was manufactured to combat the degradation of the antibiotic by the newly formed enzyme called penicillinase this ensured that the previously penicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus would still be treatable by using this new medical drug about a year after the initial use of methicillin mrsa was discovered in england staphylococcus aureus had again become evolutionist in nature and was now resistant to methicillin there are few reports about mrsa in the 's and the 's more appeared during the 's it became massive in the mid 's epidemic levels of certain strains of mrsa became uncontrollable in medical hospitals throughout the united kingdom many believe that the cause of this outbreak was associated with new comfortable living habits and as a result a reduction in our immune system strength these new strains are very infectious and transmit easily colonisation was taking place between the medical staff and patients they were treating the new strains have the ability to cause very serious infections these new strains now represent about of the staph aureus bacterium found in patients with blood stream infections in england wales and the usa the staphylococcal family staph aureus is just one of a large family of staphylococcal bacterium their normal place of residence is on the human skin the most common non staph aureus staphylococcus on human skin is called s epidermidis generally harmless and called part of the 'normal communal flora' of the human body many s epidermidis are also resistant to antibiotics including methicillin they have the same resistance mechanism as mrsa and are referred to as mrse although resident on everyone's skin but normally harmless s epidermidis causes significant infection if it enters wounds upon medical devices for example artificial hip joints heart valves or when medical staff use intravenous catheters to provide access the bloodstream severely ill patients such as those in intensive medical care units or those undergoing cancer chemotherapy are at a greater risk of this sort of infection than most others mrsa colonisation staphylococcus aureus of the most common kind including those strains that are mrsa in nature can cause a very wide range of infection these range from asymptomatic colonisation where the mrsa is doing no damage but still has the capability of causing clinical infection to fatal septicaemia which is the most severe form of blood stream infection trying to treat or cure septicaemia is nigh on impossible colonisation areas about of the worlds population is colonised by staph aureus in medical hospitals the percentage is greatly increased due to more contact with cases of infection staph aureus carriage is more likely to be mrsa in hospital populations more amongst patients and medical staff than in the general community this is because antibiotic resistant bacterium are encouraged to develop by the use of antibiotics to treat ranges of infections in hospitals that being said community acquired mrsa ca mrsa is also on the increase especially in countries like the middle east iraq and africa http www mrsamedical com
