any way to get rid of an advanced toe nail fungus every nail has it some of them have curled into what i can only descibe as tubes they are very difficult to clip if anyone can give me advice on that it would be much appreciated i take so many perscriptions already that i have had one doctor tell me she wouldn't perscibe my anything for it because of potential liver damage this is a difficult one you have onychomycosis and it is very difficult to treat topical antifungals creams ointments lotions are not very effective at getting rid of the infection there are some medications that can be used to treat it though like terbinafine itraconazole fluconazole and griseofulvin you have to take the medication for months it can be very expensive if you are on other medications there can be a lot of interaction problems and even if you aren't on any other medications these medications can cause liver problems however you can obtain blood labs before and during treatment to monitor your liver and the medications could be stopped if there was any sign of liver problems but the last bit of bad news is this even if you convince a physician to prescribe it and you monitor your liver with blood lab draws and you find a way to pay for it and you take it for months there is still a fairly high failure rate and you might have to repeat the treatment with one of the other medications and even if you cure it and get rid of the infection completely you will have around a chance of having a recurrence in the future i don't want to discourage you but am only providing you with the facts and if you are really determined to get rid of it then talk to your doctor again armed with this information ask to get the lab draws to monitor your you liver and tell your doctor you are willing to accept the possibility of failure and recurrence at this point your doctor should agree if not see another doctor or ask your doctor for a referral to a dermatologist who will certainly help you i hope this helped some Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Stomach cancer Medicine Prostate cancer Malaria Athlete's foot Chronic fatigue syndrome Folic acid Hypoglycemia Eczema Diabetes mellitus Homeopathy Terbinafine hydrochloride Stroke Herpes simplex virus Pneumonia Cirrhosis Pharmaceutical company Nail disease Organ transplant Nail (anatomy) Malignant melanoma Paracetamol Crohn's disease Alcoholism Glycogen storage disease type I Insulin Urinary incontinence Fecal incontinence Acne Bipolar disorder Bone marrow transplant Growth hormone treatment Hepatitis C Medical prescription Rocky Mountain spotted fever Chlorpromazine Doxepin AIDS Myocardial infarction Theory of conduct Traumatic brain injury Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Alternative medicine First aid Emergency Medical Services Childbirth Medical analysis of circumcision Dermatology Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Health insurance Aspergillosis Tocopherol Phimosis Sleep apnea Gout Maprotiline Cytomegalovirus Intravenous therapy Epilepsy Animal testing Ebola Duesberg hypothesis Gastroparesis Diabetic retinopathy Leukemia Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Cephalic disorder Osteoarthritis Clinical depression Terri Schiavo Blood pressure Dialysis Clomipramine Hypertension Conjunctivitis Shock Asthma Autism Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Stem cell Plame affair Miscarriage Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Antifungal drug Prolactinoma Syphilis Propranolol Psychiatry
