what is wrong with my eyes i have some sort of problem with my eyes for example even if its really bright outside i can walk into a light room and will still have to turn on a light because it still appears really dark to me i havn't been to see a doctor or anything but just recently my mum has been complaining because near enough every room i enter i have to turn on the light even though to her it is really bright please can you shed some light on the situation thank you this sounds like something serious is going on i do have that problem and i am afflicted with retinitis pigmentosa the only one who can really determine what exactly is going on with your eyes is an ophthalmologist please have your mom make an appointment with one decreased light perception can be the reason of many things and it does not have to be a serious issue but when it comes to eye sight it is best to consult a specialist and have them find out what's wrong and treat it accordingly good luck Color Visual perception Retinitis pigmentosa Philosophy of perception Glasses Diabetic retinopathy Pok__mon Abilities Light-emitting diode Ophthalmology Social rule Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Light pollution Glaucoma Myopia Eye color Hearing impairment Sun Garfield Little Britain Contract Floater Bad Wolf Optometry Direct realism USS Tunny (SS-282) Stereoscopy Boom Town (Doctor Who) Speed of light CIE 1931 color space Sunglasses M16 (rifle) Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Physical examination Sin City Macular degeneration Rose (Doctor Who) My Little Pony Theory of conduct Jam (TV series) Ethics Stuttering Retinal detachment Dyslexia Parallax The Keeper of Traken Sense Milton H.
