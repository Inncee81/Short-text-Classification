polarized sunglasses i bought a pair of glasses that has a polarized sun glasses clip on in other words i just wear my glasses and the put the magnetic clip on over the glasses to have shades since i got this pair of glasses from an eye care center could i assume that the polarized clip on provides good uv protection i didn't think about it when i was buying my glasses because i assumed i could trust that any kind of shades would have good uv protection if i bought them from an eye care center that has about associated optometrists with doctorate degrees yes the polarized lenses are great for blocking glare and providing uv protection for your eyes the only downside to a magnet sun clip on your glasses is that they do not provide as good of coverage and side protection as conventional sunglasses and the light can still get in the sides which means a bit of uv can still get to your eyes etc if you ever doubt the amount of uv protection your lenses are providing many opticals have uv meters that can test the amount of uv that will transmit through your lenses you should ask your local eye care center about it hope this helps Sunglasses Glasses Eyeglass prescription Stereoscopy Polarization Optometry Light Sun Ultraviolet Parallax Microscope Eye Optical fiber Filter (optics) Headlight Binoculars Lens (optics) Telescope Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Aberration in optical systems IMAX Antenna (radio) Glass Contact lens Eyepiece Light-emitting diode Movie projector Microscopy Ophthalmology Uses of trigonometry Solar eclipse Solar power Dark matter Gamma ray burst Seismometer View camera Lighting Upholstery Federal Standard 1037C Medical prescription Optical coating Aurora (astronomy) Gas metal arc welding Electric motor Moon Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Mirror Rainbow Shielded metal arc welding Lunar Prospector History of telescopes Modem Sunlight Polarizer Gravity Microphone Observational astronomy Autostereogram Anaglyph image Diabetic retinopathy Optics Photographic lens Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Depth of field Polymethyl methacrylate Medicine Universal Serial Bus Bicycle lighting Surveyor 7 Diabetes mellitus Stage lighting Sunspot Terraforming Iris (anatomy) Diving suit Camera Haidinger's brush Rayleigh scattering Solar cell Digital Sensor Goggles DualDisc Surveillance Nystagmus Macro photography Contax Ionosphere Life insurance Internal ballistics Clementine mission Magnetic core memory Lunar Orbiter program Compound eye Cassini-Huygens Cathode ray tube Solar sail Polar Bear 3-D film Solar panel
