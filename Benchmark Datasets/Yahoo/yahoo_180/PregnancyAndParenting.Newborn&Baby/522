newborn sounds congested my day old son sounds very congested when he breathes like there is fluid or mucus build up somewhere in his respiratory pathways i know it's common for them to swallow amniotic fluid but i thought that would have cleared by now he has no fever and he passed his pediatrician's physical days ago but when he sneezes a white film comes out possibly from the formula and breast milk we are feeding him also he seems to choke quite often during bottle feedings is this normal or should i be concerned there could be a few things going on with the choking and feedings is the nipple hole too large remember that he is also breastfed and must draw on your nipple hard to get the milk out with a bottle nipple the milk comes out a lot faster without the draw our newborns all had congestion early on and a good deal of sneezing he is probably clearing himself out if he seems uncomfy use a syringe and suck the discharge out of his nose if a fever take him to the doctor and have him looked at you should stick to breastfeeding only to get your supply built up as well as the fact that it is easier to digest good luck to you and congrats on your new baby Breastfeeding Infant Elephant Childbirth Nipple Fertility awareness Pneumonia Breast milk Nipple piercing Milk Jaundice Infant formula Common cold Baby bottle Prolactin Toilet humour Reptile Intravenous therapy Bong Guinea pig Cat Carburetor Oxytocin Cystic fibrosis Nasal congestion Mastitis Group A streptococcal infection Obstetrics Urinary incontinence HIV Hay fever Vampire Hypoglycemia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Vitamin D Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Happy Tree Friends Breast pump Respiratory rate Mosquito International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Abortion Pulmonary alveolus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Transmission (medicine) Infant respiratory distress syndrome Pacifier Amniotic sac Siphon Protein-energy malnutrition Nose Piccolo Junior Saga Kangaroo Drawn Together Breast reduction Tasmanian Devil Pasteurization Blood (computer game) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Brassiere Domestic rabbit Diphtheria Russian joke Medical analysis of circumcision 2000 Australian Grand Prix Flatulence Nestl__ Internal ballistics Teat Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Whale Nestl__ boycott Mammary gland Cytomegalovirus Insomnia Stomach cancer Rocky Mountain spotted fever Noonan syndrome House Mouse Gong Social rule Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Nudity Decompression sickness Prolactinoma Hyperthermia Glycogen storage disease type I Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Dairy Fancy rat Intact dilation and extraction Shotgun Patent medicine Fecal incontinence Patent ductus arteriosus Trapping
