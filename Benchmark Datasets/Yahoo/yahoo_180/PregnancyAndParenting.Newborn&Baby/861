people constantly staring at me breastfeed when i breastfeed in public even when i'm turned away from everyone there's always guys giving me the googly eyes trying to catch a glimpse of my nipple and i'm not exactly ugly or fat ha whats peoples fascination with it it's natural i don't sit there with my boobs hanging out and i cover up the best i can i also never do it in the presence of children if that happens i go to the car changing room in a store womens lounge in a resturaunt or store etc i'm not a hooker trying to expose myself but if it's degrees out i'm not going to suffocate my child with a big blanket and it will be a cold day in hell when i feed my son in a disgusting dirty germ infested bathroom stall what did some of you women do when this would does happen listen elton what i am doing is not sexual in the least it is feeding my child something that is needed for survival it's pigs like you who i'm talking about just because you can't have any of this doesn't mean you have to be bitter i look at breastfeeding women a smile from ear to ear i'm so happy for what they are doing for their baby i make sure they know i'm not staring and if i'm in a good place i'll go over and tell them how beautiful they look and that they should be really proud of what they are doing too many nursing mothers get evil eyes and open suggestions on what would make other people more comfortable like covering up etc you should however nurse infront of children they are the next generations and we want to stop this nursing stigmatism now but we can't the only way to help out is to show children including your own that nursing is a happy healthy and natural thing to do if our children don't learn from nursing mothers they will learn from mothers feeding their children by bottle obviously i'm not talking about people who couldn't breastfeed etc so no knickers in a knot who never have to cover up even though it isn't natural if someone was to look at me breastfeeding i think the best thing to do is look back at them with intense eyes and just smile if they continue to look you can ask them how their meal is or say lovely weather kill them with kindess as we don't want nursing mothers to become known as irate even though i'm sure you feel that way sometimes eye contact is very powerful use it Breastfeeding Shaggy dog story Sin City Humphrey Bogart EastEnders The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breast Knots Landing Social rule Teen Girl Squad The Inside Childbirth YuYu Hakusho Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infant Fertility awareness Pitaten Little Britain Kodocha Recurring South Park characters The Amber Spyglass Comanche The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe True Crime: Streets of LA The Wall Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword The Smoking Room Brassiere Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kyle Broflovski One Tree Hill (TV series) Characters of The Sandman Jon Secada Care Bears Human sexual behavior Marilyn Monroe Toilet humour Survivor (novel) Shark Garfield Laura Schlessinger What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
