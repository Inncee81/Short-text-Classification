how do you keep a month old baby awake for a while during the day she will sleep most of the day and only like hours at night i try to keep her awake from pm til pm so she will sleep for a little while at night not having much luck what can i do i have a year old also i need sleep at night it's true that month old babies need a lot of sleep but they shouldn't be sleeping all day and only being active at night you will have to gradually switch her body clock around a full hours she is completely out of synch with you this will take weeks of consistent gritted teeth discipline you need to decide what time you want her to wake up every morning wake her up at that time rigorously every day and do everything you can to stimulate her brain to stay alert in daylight hours light is the key word the human brain responds strongly to the stimulus of light so turn the light on in her room take her out in the sunshine and set up her play area in a sunny spot in the lounge room you will also need to ensure she has plenty of brightly coloured noisy toys to play with music designed for small children is also a good idea as is face to face interaction lots of smiles talk laughter and singing your four year old can play an important role in this campaign by playing noisy games with the baby talking and singing to her and generally being an excellent role model if you have pets that are safe for her to interact with that would be a wonderful stimulus for her to stay awake and active exposure to tv and dvds videos should be limited to half an hour a day of programs purposely designed for small children you're probably wondering when you'll have time to do the housework and the answer is you won't but this is far more urgent your baby's language and general mental development is at a crucial stage and she needs to be interacting with the family my son got terribly bored at weeks and i couldn't work out what was wrong until his father set up a bouncinette with rattles and things hung above it he lay in that bouncinette and kicked and rattled like mad he wasn't able to crawl towards interesting things but when they were put within his reach he responded very strongly edit i forgot to mention feeding at one month she will probably still be feeding around the clock but over the next few months you can start limiting night time feeds a little as long as she's not screaming with hunger also don't play with her after night feeds just change her nappy and put her back to sleep keep your voice very low and hypnotic Shaggy dog story Sleep Milton H.
