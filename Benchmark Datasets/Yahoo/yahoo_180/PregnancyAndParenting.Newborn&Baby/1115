nursing strike nipple preference month old baby my nd child is just months and has just in the last days refused to nurse and will only take a bottle he definitely prefers breast milk sometimes making a disgusted face when we feed him formula i've been pumping and trying some things i've read on the web but it doesn't seem to be getting better does anybody have any specific experience with this happening if so how did you get your baby back to breastfeeding thanks p s he will nurse when he's asleep but not when he's awake you're on the right track sleeping and nursing is the way to get him back to the breast he'll come around eventually lots of extra cuddles and sleeping together will help too he may come back to the breast if he gets a nasty boo boo or if something scares him like thunder i know that this is a tough thing to go through hang in there i'm proud of you for knowing that this is a problem that can be fixed many women would give up at this point but continuing to breastfeed is totally worth it good luck Breastfeeding Infant Breast Nipple piercing Humphrey Bogart Nipple Childbirth Fertility awareness EastEnders Baby bottle Milk Breast pump Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mastitis Nestl__ boycott Social rule Hera Urinary incontinence Philosophical skepticism Brassiere Breast milk Characters in the Smurfs Nestl__ Prolactin International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Great Teacher Onizuka Everwood Sleep Out-of-body experience Scenes from a Memory Prolactinoma Jam (TV series) Breast cancer Characters of The Sandman History of corsets Conker's Bad Fur Day Pitaten Breast fetishism Nudity Cat Shaggy dog story Breast reduction Oh My Goddess!
