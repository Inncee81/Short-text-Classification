do you use a d ointment or something similar at every diaper change even if there's no rash in other words do you use a d as a preventative or simply as a treatment once a rash has occurred i read someone else's post on here and she implied she used it at every diaper change just curious to know if this is standard or not the first few days after birth even weeks the baby can have lots of bm's so we like to use it every time after that i like to let the baby's skin breathe a little if the baby has thrush it's important to not use it for every diaper change as the baby's skin needs exposure to the air as much as possible i like to put it on at night and when i leave her with one of my teenagers they may not be so quick to realize she needs a change it is both a preventative and it helps heal after trying several we found that a d works better than the others on an existing rash lots of the others seemed to sting when applied Diaper Psoriasis Candidiasis Rash Zinc Urinary incontinence Eczema Coeliac disease Fecal incontinence Group A streptococcal infection Syphilis Cytomegalovirus Lupus erythematosus Scabies Decompression sickness Mercury (element) Acne Lyme disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever Witchcraft Breastfeeding Spina bifida Allergy Radiation therapy Infant Homeopathy Sunburn Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hyperthermia Herpes simplex virus First aid Stomach cancer Transsexuality Premature birth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anthrax Tattoo Skin Professional wrestling match types Malignant melanoma Hay fever Prostate cancer Pregnancy Tarantula Hulk (comics) Identity and change Rooibos Scar Herpes zoster Ayurveda Family Guy Childbirth Asthma Shen Gong Wu Hormone replacement therapy (trans) American English Diving suit Abortion debate Pneumonia Kimberly-Clark Corporation Monkeypox Demographics Spanking A Course In Miracles Traumatic brain injury Static Shock Congenital disorder EastEnders Leather Cephalic disorder Gonorrhoea Reiki Michael Savage (commentator) Rasheed Wallace Beryllium Characters in the Smurfs Wound healing phases Diabetes mellitus Aloe Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Anal fissure Lanolin Mouth ulcer Ageplay Doomsday argument Jon Secada Rugrats Stinging nettle Smallpox Expository preaching Lisp programming language Fatality Circumcision Schistosoma mansoni Second language acquisition Extreme Programming Cancer
