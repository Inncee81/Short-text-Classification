breastmilk not enough well it's few days that i feel that my breast doesn't have that much milk and my month old son refuses breast so i pump to keep the milk suuply but i pump only ml from both breasts so that's not enough him i give him formula but he's so eager to grab a watermelon bread to suck on isn't it dangerous if he swallows a piece of bread or watermelon maybe it's time to give him fruits thank you ml oz is a very large pumping output it is normal to have to pump more than once to make enough milk for one feeding even the best breastpump can only get of the milk in the breast unlike a baby who gets all the milk in the breast and signals the breast to make more right now you should work on getting your baby back to breast that is key to making your life easier as for solids before months is too soon for pretty much all babies but if he can self feed he might be ready read these http www borstvoeding com voedselintroductie vast voedsel rapley guidelines html won't he choke many parents worry about babies choking however there is good reason to believe that babies are at less risk of choking if they are in control of what goes into their mouth than if they are spoon fed this is because babies are not capable of intentionally moving food to the back of their throats until after they have learnt to chew and they do not develop the ability to chew until after they have developed the ability to reach out and grab things thus a very young baby cannot easily put himself at risk because he cannot get the food into his mouth in the first place on the other hand the action used to suck food off a spoon tends to take the food straight to the back of the mouth causing the baby to gag this means that spoon feeding has its own potential to lead to choking and makes the giving of lumpy food with a spoon especially dangerous it appears that a babies general development keeps pace with the development of his ability to manage food in his mouth and to digest it a baby who is struggling to get food into his mouth is probably not quite ready to eat it it is important to resist the temptation to 'help' the baby in these circumstances since his own developmental abilities are what ensure that the transition to solid feeding takes place at the right pace for him this process is also what keeps him safe from choking on small pieces of food since if he is not yet able to pick up small objects using his finger and thumb he will not be able to get for example a pea or a raisin into his mouth once he is able to do this he will have developed the necessary oral skills to deal with it putting food into a babies mouth for him overrides this natural protection and increases the risk of choking http www llli org faq solids html your baby is starting to get ready for solids when he is about four months old he becomes more sociable playing and holding conversations with you during a nursing session he has a growth spurt and nurses more frequently for a while he imitates the chewing motions you make whilst eating he is practicing you will know that he is really ready to start solids when he is about six months old he can sit up without any support he continues to be hungry despite more frequent nursing which is unrelated to illness or teething he has lost the tongue thrusting reflex and does not push solids out of his mouth he can pick up things with his finger and thumb pincer grasp babies who are ready for solids can usually feed themselves mothers often report that they knew their babies were ready when they picked up food from a plate chewed it swallowed it and wanted more Professional wrestling holds Dairy Chopsticks Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Carburetor Hamster Equine conformation Dog training Coeliac disease Milton H.
