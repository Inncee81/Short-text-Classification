what could be the cause my son who is almost months has been routinely sleeping through the night with one feeding around am for the past two months the past couple of nights he has been waking up at least times to feed and getting up earlier than he normally would to eat i am thinking this is more of an eating issue than a sleeping one i was having a hard time with him napping lately but that is getting better while his night time is getting worse i don't put him down for late naps and getting him to sleep is not the issue he just keeps waking to eat he eats a lot during the day too so i am not putting him down hungry he eats the upper limit of what he should be ounces of formula if not more do you think it's just a growth spurt we are going in for his checkup next week and i will discuss this with the doc then but any other ideas of this sudden change in sleeping eating habits please do not tell me to put cereal into his bottle it is a choking hazard and is not proven to make them sleep longer when he is ready for it i will give it to him on a spoon the way he is suppose to eat it my best guess is that it is a growth spurt our twins did this too ask your doc about starting cereal sooner rather than later most docs recommend waiting until five or even six months before giving cereal especially if there is a history of allergies in the families i found with our guys that once we started cereal and then moved to baby food they drank less formula breast milk and slept better at night Breakfast Infant formula Milk Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Siesta Characters in the Smurfs Puberty Garfield Narcolepsy Nestl__ Kosher foods Cat Folic acid Sea-Monkey Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fecal incontinence Allergy Sleep Atkins Nutritional Approach Friends Food Kurt Cobain Urinary incontinence Veganism Little Britain Futurama (TV series - season 5) Coeliac disease Ron and Fez EastEnders Knots Landing Slow Train Coming Fertility awareness Dieting One Piece minor characters Daylight saving time Saturday Night Live Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Password Infant Mattress Alcoholics Anonymous The Time Machine Days of our Lives Avenue Q Vegetarianism Capercaillie Asterix and the Laurel Wreath Vampire Dog Soybean Insomnia Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fasting Livestock Tooth Apollo 8 Hera Peanut Binge eating disorder FoxTrot Sin City Baby bottle Social rule The Shining (film) Hansel und Gretel Roman eating and drinking Caffeine Childbirth Back to the Future Doraemon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Conker's Bad Fur Day Jennifer Parker MRE Scooby-Doo Fiddler on the Roof Treehouse of Horror XII Jewish cuisine Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Ben Johnson (athlete) GED Salad Fingers Coffee Shaggy dog story Koala Breast cancer Marathon (sport) Drawn Together Bread Humphrey Bogart IP (complexity) Hypoglycemia Phoebe Buffay's songs AFI 100 Years series Russian cuisine
