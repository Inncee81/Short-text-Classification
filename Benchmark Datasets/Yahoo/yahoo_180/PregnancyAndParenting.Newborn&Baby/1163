my friend's baby i have a friend of mine that has a son that is months old he's the cutest little boy but i'm worried about him for starters he's just started crawling when you call his name he doesn't respond to it until you are in his face he's cooing and not trying to say any words at all his motor skills are of one of a six month old my husband has brought this to my attention before but i've tried to tell myself something different until i actually spent time with i don't want to offend my friend and just say i think something is wrong with your son is there a way that i should say it without being disrespectful or hurtful also do you think that she really knows that something is wrong with her child but chooses to ignore it help chances are your friend already knows something is wrong but u could give her a print out on developmental milestones to be helpful just in case she doesnt know just bring it up nicely i'm gonna tell u a story real quick and see if it helps at all i have cousins that we see maybe or times a year and we all went to the beach this year now my child has autism and i know and was in the process of getting help for him well i didnt go around telling everyone what was wrong its just not who i am and we were there and they though i went to bed and started talkin bout my son and how i should know there is something wrong and get him help well let me tell u i went in there and asked if they really thought i was that stupid and told them what was wrong and they shoudl stop talking cuz i am getting help well ne ways i bet your friend does know and she may even be in the process of getting her child help who knows maybe she is like me and didnt want to tell everyone i hope if u do say somethig it isnt behind her back like those people did and be very nice about it if u do say something its hard to deal with when your child has a problem she may still be in the denial phase cuz trust me u go through that phase for a couple months too then u snap outta it and say alright what do i do and then usually u dont tell alot of people just family when they are that young hope i helped seriously i wasnt tryin to be mean just tellin u what i went through too so u can get both sids sorta Jon Secada Kodocha Theory of conduct Sin City Social rule Domestic violence The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) The Marshall Mathers LP Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blood on the Tracks Friends Avenue Q Autism Kender Shawn Michaels Hip hop collaborations Coming of Age (TNG episode) Asperger syndrome Married... with Children Mississippi John Hurt Breath of Fire III Piccolo Junior Saga Extreme Programming AFI 100 Years series Marie Antoinette The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Ron and Fez The Ashlee Simpson Show Transactional analysis God Emperor of Dune Atomic Kitten Good Morning, Vietnam Daz Dillinger The Jim Rome Show Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Infantilism Autism rights movement Little Britain Humphrey Bogart Plame affair The Family from One End Street The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Hulk Hogan Hip hop rivalries The Beach Boys Singlish Jam (TV series) 2000 Australian Grand Prix EastEnders Public Eye Grandview, U.S.A.
