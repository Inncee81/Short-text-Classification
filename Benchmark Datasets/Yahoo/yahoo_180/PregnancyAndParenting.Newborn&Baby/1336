i cannot get my week old baby to sleep any at night she has been diagnosed with gerd and is on medicine for it but it is not helping i'm sleep deprived and it shows physically emotionally and mentally it starts anywhere from pm to am and she's up until nearly am she has periods where she's fussy or just wide awake i need to figure something out i've never had this much trouble getting my other kids to sleep i try to nap during the day but it's hard with my other two kiddos this girl just doesn't sleep but i need her to i'm breaking down i had a son who from birth never seemed to sleep at all but rather seemed to recharge his batteries instead he only took twenty minute naps but he didn't have gerd he is now almost years old a daughter of ours did have gerd however years ago this problem wasn't yet named there are different degrees of gerd meaning the amount of reflux that travels back up after feeding this is the reason your daughter isn't sleeping the best answer i can give you from personal experience is to use your approved car seat for sleeping using the car seat buckle the harness with the baby on her side sitting up roll one receiving blanket into a tight roll and place behind her back and another one in front from her chest to her crotch and make sure it is close to her body for support using a kitchen chair or any other surface that would be safe under the car seat move to the side of the bed where you sleep the baby should be level with you when you are laying down so you can see her and after falling asleep if she cries when you open your eyes she is in full view the car seat should be slightly reclined so her head stays to the side and slightly backward and not chin to chest by sleeping her in an upright position this will reduce the reflux and the pain and discomfort she feels that is causing her to want to remain awake chances are that with her refusing to sleep during the night you find yourself holding her over your shoulder and this reduces her pain and gives her some relief because she is upright baby swings for some reason never offered the same help or accomplished the same result i think because of the feet dangling during the day she is too tired to insist on staying awake so for short periods she is falling asleep but not staying asleep long enough when she is awake she can exercise her legs back and chest mucles by not being in the car seat burbing the baby more then normal inbetween also helps and allowing the use of a binky all this is causing you and her to not get enough sleep sleeping her in an approved car seat for a few months while she developes further is not dangerous nor will cause her harm my daughters reflux started at birth but wasn't known but at months was reflux at months it increased to she is now over years old married with two healthy children and does not suffer from gerd her growth wasn't stunted or legs bowed nor did she have a messed up spine from being slept in a car seat all it did was allow both of us to get the sleep we needed and restful at that gerd at birth is not abnormal and not a condition for life in all cases good luck and get some needed sleep mom you deserve it and congrats Urinary incontinence Equine conformation Gastroesophageal reflux disease Aerial (dance move) Traumatic brain injury Narcolepsy Mattress Fast bowling Breastfeeding Professional wrestling throws Abortion debate Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Cephalic disorder Diving Strap-on dildo Asthma Chronic fatigue syndrome Childbirth Out-of-body experience Shaggy dog story 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Suplex Recumbent bicycle Chair Casualty lifting Social rule Professional wrestling attacks Clinical depression Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers The Amber Spyglass Insomnia Hypoglycemia Swingout Kodocha Weight training Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breech birth Lucid dreaming Cat The Contender (television series) Puberty Stomach cancer Carpal tunnel syndrome Coeliac disease Pitaten Scientology beliefs and practices 2000 Australian Grand Prix Sin City Backstroke Professional wrestling aerial techniques Crash test dummy Androgen insensitivity syndrome Spanking Stroke Humphrey Bogart Characters in the Smurfs Swimming Multiple sclerosis One Tree Hill (TV series) Sailing Tai Chi Chuan Bipolar disorder Passenger car Breaststroke Jon Secada Hypnosis Transsexuality Cancer Butterfly stroke Phoebe Buffay's songs Horse Psychosis Infantilism Apollo 8 Dairy The Shining (film) Massage Polyphasic sleep Addiction Dog agility Car handling Obstetrics Garfield Anatomical terms of location Autism
