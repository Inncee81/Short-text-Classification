about bowel movement my month old baby is not passing motion for three days tried prune juice what should i do hi as this has been going on for a few days i would see your gp health visitor or ask your pharmacist for advice if this happens regularly the it is possible that your baby may not be absorbing the vitamins and minerals needed which are essential for growing there is probably a hour pharmacy near you when my son had a similar problem i used a couple of teaspoons of fresh orange juice and diluted it with water three four bottles throughout the day along with his usual formula did the trick and i was advised to stop food for a short while by my health visitor until he had a bowel movement at seven months your are perhaps begining to add new foods to your babies diet your babies body needs to get use to dealing with these this could cause constipation if your baby is constipated she he probably will not want to eat much as her his tummy will be full as long as your baby is drinking their milk and bottles of juice a day this is not a major problem at months for a couple of days i would suggest that you give a little amount or no food for a day and just give fluids water weak juice and breast or formula milk after all babies do get most of their essential vitamins etc from their milk in the first year i notice that in response to previous questions you have asked that people have suggested bulking your baby up on rice cereal and such things added to their i do not know whether you have followed this advice but please do not add these thing to your babys bottle as this can cause choking and constipation as your baby will not be getting enough fluids unless they are drinking lots of water too as this would be like your baby is having another meal rather than a drink my son loved avocado sweet potato and adding pureed fruit to his meal has kept his bowel movements fine since i hope that this helps Fecal incontinence Milk Veganism Diarrhea Coeliac disease Folic acid Nutrition Breakfast Food Dietary fiber Soft drink Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Vitamin C Fasting Coffee Hamster Soy milk Peruvian cuisine Tocopherol Wine Vitamin Tea Crohn's disease Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Denmark Soybean Vitamin D Guinea pig Cuisine of Brazil Medical prescription Cuisine of Africa Hypoglycemia Nestl__ Healthy eating Tofu Potassium Russian cuisine Drink Cuisine of Malaysia Japanese tea ceremony Aloe Jewish cuisine Yoghurt Chocolate Laxative Raw food diet Pet skunk Egg (food) Chlorpromazine Pomegranate Organic food Rum Swedish cuisine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Happy Meal Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Potato Food guide pyramid Prostate cancer Bread Lemon Beer Omega-3 fatty acid Polychlorinated biphenyl Vegetarian nutrition Bong German cuisine Breakfast cereal Rice Dialysis Hemorrhoid Irritable bowel syndrome Botulism Little Britain Sea-Monkey Patent medicine Domestic rabbit French cuisine Chronic fatigue syndrome Dairy Cheese Multiple sclerosis Tomato Sake
