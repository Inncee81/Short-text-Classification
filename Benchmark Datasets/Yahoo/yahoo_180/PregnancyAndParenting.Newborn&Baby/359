my son's fever my ten month old son suddenly came on with a fever thursday night around i was visiting my folks and i noticed he was hot i figured no big deal because he's hot natured when i got home i took his temp and it was at gave him ibuprofen and it when away well it's been like this for a day now i'd say hours fever goes away with fever reducer but comes back hours later when the medicine wears off so what do i do he's not lethargic he's not too cranky about as cranky as a baby can be with a fever he's sleeping well and eating a bit he's aslo drinking lots of clear fluids like gatorade and pedialite so he seems fine other than the fact that this fever wont leave he's not coughing or sneezing not even grabbing for his ear and it's not teething that's just a myth i'm just worried that there may be an underlying factor here that's causing this temperature to rise thus fighting off an infection i didn't take him to the doctor yesterday because they were closed and i don't want to take him to the er because it's not that big of an emergency unless his fever gets any higher with treatment i just don't know what's going on with him and would like some opinions on what i should do i was thinking a minor emergency center but then i'd have to not treat the fever so i don't bring him in without a fever because he was given medicine but then i don't want to not give him medicine just to show the doctor that he's feverish but i don't want to make him miserable ahhh i'm worrying too much help me please thanks his fever has been up and down since thursday night ranging from never higher and sometimes lower just thought i'd add that a fever is not a bad thing it just means your child's body is trying to fight off something there's a good chance he may need antibiotics to get better if a temp is his only problem and it doesn't get too high i would try to keep it down and get him to the doctor first thing monday here are ways to get the temp down that work for us take cold wet wash clothes and place behind the bend of the knees the creases of the arms and behind the neck we also let our small child run around bare footed on the cold tile of food lion and that brought down the fever yeah he will have dirty feet but it's worth it if you've been trying a long time to get it down and it's less traumatic for him Common cold Urinary incontinence Hyperthermia Group A streptococcal infection Childbirth Breastfeeding Aerial (dance move) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Equine conformation First aid Diving Characters in the Smurfs Pneumonia Malaria Rocky Mountain spotted fever Medicine Thermoregulation Social rule Psoriasis Gout Foodborne illness Fever Boom Town (Doctor Who) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome The Shining (film) Herpes simplex virus Eczema Hay fever Diarrhea Domestic rabbit Drowning Humphrey Bogart Sauna Ron and Fez Piccolo Junior Saga Babe Ruth Knots Landing Ebola Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Fecal incontinence Comanche Customs and etiquette of Japan K' Temperature EastEnders Fancy rat Soap opera Lyme disease Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Carpal tunnel syndrome Little Britain Carburetor Hypoglycemia Theory of conduct Dialysis Infectious mononucleosis Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Climate of the United Kingdom Mesothelioma Vampire The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kodocha Allergy Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Bubonic plague Fast bowling Thermal power station Pitaten Cephalic disorder Cliff Richard Guinea pig Fertility awareness Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Professional wrestling throws Insomnia Snake Time Out of Mind Charles Darwin's illness Intravenous therapy Health insurance Frankie Laine Dog
