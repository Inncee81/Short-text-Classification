lead based paint in our potential new home anyone have experience with this and and an infant we've read about all the harmful possible effects of lead paint if ingested but how likely is it has anyone lived in an older home with lead paint a relative of mine lived in an old building with lead paint and their daughter had to be tested each month but she was just fine anyone have anything to add we would be renting and therefore cannot get rid of the lead paint from what i've read removing it can be just as dangerous if not more because dust gets in the air removing it will be more of a problem than dealing with it if there are any flaking paint chips definitely remove those and paint over them with a latex or something that will hold it together lead paint is only bad for babies when they ingest it either eat or breath the dust if baby isnt chewing on the window sills or eating paint chips or breathing dust from construction it will probably be fine the whole thing is over rated and blown out of proportion we all grew up in houses with lead paint not all of us are damaged from it Depleted uranium Liquid breathing Cocaine Childbirth Botulism Lead paint Condom Paint Carbon dioxide Cancer Asthma Tooth enamel Halitosis Nuclear fallout Aspartame Oral sex Explosive material Hypoglycemia Casting Tobacco smoking Fire fighting Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Insulin Nutrition Chocolate Airbag Eating Hamster Milk Ork (Warhammer 40,000) Inflation Methamphetamine Chewing gum Arguments for and against drug prohibition Diabetes mellitus TeX Drill bit Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Asbestos Coffee Tooth Beryllium RISC Abortion debate Seismic retrofit Nitrous oxide Chernobyl accident Veganism Diving Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Dental caries Overclocking Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Fluoride Drowning Uranium Babe Ruth CPU cache Rebreather Styrene Decompression sickness Jet engine Adam and Eve Super Nintendo Entertainment System Inhalant Cheating in Counter-Strike Fuel injection Floppy disk Tobacco Intracranial pressure Paracetamol Guilty Gear Raw food diet Vacuum cleaner Hun-Apu Sex assignment Fallout shelter Atari 8-bit family Coeliac disease Famine Motif of harmful sensation Plastic Radeon Microeconomics Anxiety Sean Combs Breathing gas Unclean animals Psilocybin Mesothelioma Ice Gravity Road safety Property tax Final Fantasy magic Foodborne illness Air pollution Hyperthermia
