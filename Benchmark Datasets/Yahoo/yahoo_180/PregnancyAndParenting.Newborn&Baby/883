looking for supplemental nursing system sns for breastfeeding i want to restart breastfeeding my son is still able to latch on very well but stops after he gets almost nothing out pumping is not increasing my supply and i'm already on fenugreek i think a sns is our answer if you know where i can get one either second hand i have medela bags to sterilize or a cheap new one i would love to hear it i just don't have to spend on something that might not work for us i was told by someone that wic has them our wic office believe it or not isn't as much into breastfeeding as you would think my son just turned one and has been weaned since he was a little over months they will say he is over one so don't worry about breastfeeding him anymore my goal was months and still is hopefully with the sns we can make it to that thanks so much in advance wanted to add i'm bidding on one that is on ebay right now but you know how that goes the last few minutes they shoot up to almost full price i will try wic tomorrow you are right no harm in calling and i wanted to add he enjoys breastfeeding but being a busy toddler there is no time for him to sit down and nurse unless he is getting a good bit of milk that is why we stopped to begin with my supply was never what i would call great no matter what i tried so bottles became more and more each day until no more breastfeeding i really do hope people read this and understand that if you really do have to supplement then use the sns bottles are not the answer like you said if you want to keep breastfeeding and he will not comfort nurse i'm hoping that a few weeks of using the sns he will understand that nursing isn't just for food like he used to he takes a pacifier and that's his comfort he used to nurse for comfort and food but now he doesn't show that much of an interest unless he is getting milk great job for wanting to get back to breastfeeding have you tried la leche league's website they have a phone number and someone there might be able to help you also have you checked ebay since you are looking for a used sns or have you talked to your local hospital or lactation consultants our wic office is not that breastfeeding friendly either so i know what you mean there http www lalecheleague org http www kellymom com here's the search result for ebay there were several one was even new and going for plus shipping http search ebay com search search dll from r trksid m satitle supplemental nursing system category hmmm i'm really bummed to hear the reason you stopped in the first place i hope others read this and realize that you should not supplement at all if you are committed to breastfeeding that is not the answer to a low milk supply once you give that first supplemental bottle that is the beginning of the end of breastfeeding there are many things you can do to boost your milk supply if it really was low this is also a common misconception usually the child has just become more effecient at nursing rather than a drop in supply and pumping is never an indication of how much milk you have Milk Childbirth Fertility awareness Infant formula Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dairy Folic acid Prostate cancer Live 8 Haven (TNG episode) Social rule Breast pump The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Kodocha Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Humphrey Bogart Breast Phoebe Halliwell Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Inside Little Britain Continuation War The Amber Spyglass Domain Name System Milton H.
