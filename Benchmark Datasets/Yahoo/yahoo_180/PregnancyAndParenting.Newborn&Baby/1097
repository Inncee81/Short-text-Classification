our baby pukes every time we feed him practically what do we do every time we feed our baby he seems to puke part of it or most of it up he's and a half weeks old the problem is he doesn't always want to take the breast so it makes things harder and we are forced to also supplement and feed formula and pump at other times too he seems to puke sometimes after or minutes and even at times an hour later at first we thought it was maybe something to do with the bottles which we've tried different types liner types bubble free types then we tried formula types as well no luck there we thought of lactose free formula but according to the pharmacist it probably isn't that we really think it's air in his belly because sometimes he'll burp with a puke and the problem is he's extremely hard to burp we just cannot burp him sometimes i can go for minutes and he'll barely let anything out we've tried stomach and moving him everything we can think of and no luck on our legs on our belly shoulder no luck any help if you've switched formula made sure theres nothing in the water then we can assume it's him that's where i'm going to go here my son was really hard to burp too and he had terrible gas as a baby but we always kept going because we didn't want him to barf yuiecch here are a few tips burp frequently even during feeding my son was soley bottle fed and because he got the gas so bad afterwards we burped him every three ounces from an oz bottle or so and that really helped my roomie who had her babe at the same time and had the same problem but breastfed had a bad case of the baby barfs as well and i told her that any time he lets go try to burp him then or before you switch breastesests it worked let gravity help after a large meal dont lay him down right away even if he is sleeping gravity will help him digest his milk and get it to the bottom of his tummy even with the big asss air bubble in there the down side to this tip is that often the air moves with it and thats ok but we all know that lower gas in the tummy is magnificently painful and be prepared to deal with the screaming when he really got going we'd do this bicycle race a little while after eating after gravity has taken its toll when he starts to fuss lay him on his back and push his little feet up to his belly don't worry it won't hurt but be gentle keep doing that and flex his legs like a bicycle and try not to laugh when he farts on your wife keep your chin up kids Breastfeeding Aerial (dance move) Burping Toilet humour Milk Piccolo Junior Saga Childbirth Baby bottle Professional wrestling throws Diving Care Bears Shaggy dog story Bong Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Bart chalkboard gags B-47 Stratojet Trailer Park Boys Professional wrestling attacks Equine conformation Guinea pig Social rule Dairy Cat Siphon Flatulence Coffee Nestl__ Infant Fertility awareness Breech birth Cheese Suplex The Adventures of Pete & Pete Sea-Monkey Infant formula Jam (TV series) Breast milk Little Britain Poker jargon Babe Ruth Snake Milton H.
