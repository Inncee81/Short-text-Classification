giving infant water i just picked up my son from my mother's house and she told me he had about ounces of water today i have never given him water is this okay he is almost months old he is a large baby he weighs pounds i know that there are different views on this subject also he is drooling alot gnawing at everything including his hands tugs at ears and his been a little cranky here and there do you think this is teething or could it possibly be something else i know it seems young for teething but i've heard that's possible it sounds like he's teething classic symptoms start giving him teething rings and ice cubes it'll help with his crankiness as far as tugging on his ears the pain from teething might be in the back of his mouth near the joint of his jaw and skull or it could be the onset of an ear infection again if he doesn't stop with the ears consult your pediatrician the water shouldn't really be a problem as long as it's in moderation consult your pediatrician if you're freaked about it congrats on your little one Breastfeeding Childbirth Hearing impairment Diving Traumatic brain injury Guinea pig Elephant Dog Paget's disease of bone Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Cephalic disorder Pacifier Shaggy dog story Platypus Tooth Chronic fatigue syndrome Cochlear implant Psoriasis Equine conformation Toxoplasmosis The Empty Child Canal lock Ear Swimming Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cytomegalovirus Domestic rabbit Tetrapod Cat Coeliac disease Muscle English unit It's All Gone Pete Tong Deftones Hyperglycemia Tocopherol Jala neti Coffee Noonan syndrome Tobacco smoking Premature birth Earwax Mastoiditis Urinary incontinence Intravenous therapy Otitis externa Tasmanian Devil Physical examination Hearing aid Post Polio syndrome The Contender (television series) The Inside Humphrey Bogart Happy Tree Friends Piccolo Junior Saga Gray Wolf Social rule Mountain Gorilla Syphilis Theodicy Aye-aye Cerebral palsy Balance disorder Tinnitus Autism Stuttering Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gag (BDSM) Dobermann Tuatara Postpartum depression Herpes simplex virus Head Diarrhea Phimosis M__ni__re___s disease Abortion debate Mind Over Murder Paul McCartney Temporomandibular joint disorder The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Snake Infant Hun-Apu Pneumonia Common cold Group A streptococcal infection Temporal bone Miscarriage Beaver Nile crocodile Pregnancy Migraine Abdominal pain Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Burr Redding Vegeta Birth weight
