my baby will be months on august he was born weeks early he is trying to crawl and pull up on things he really hasn't mastered the ability of sitting up he may sit up for like to minutes at a time i hope i'm not rushing him but i really want him to sit up on his own you know so he can play and i won't have to wrry about him hitting his head so much i know children are going to fall and get cuts and stuff my question is is there anything i can do to help him sit up what did you do when you were trying to teach your child to sit up and walk a lot of parents i know said their child don't have teeth at that age and my son has teeth one at the top and two at the bottom so i know he is making progress i agree walking does mischief and more trouble than you as a mom will need the sooner they begin they learn soon enough by pulling up on tables and things i already know you're a great mom because you're too busy worrying but that's fine boppy and large pillows in a v shape are fine to help support him to sit teeth come out whenever i've heard it's when they better develop the ability to process carbs or starches some are earlier than others i wouldn't worry also a fun game only for infants who are able to hold their neck head up mos is fine is to play up down by placing him on a soft flat surface hold hands with both of his hands and encourage him to pull himself to sit uuup then lay back down in a funny sing song repeat it slowly but only as quickly as you feel him pulling it won't take him long to learn it as a sort of a reflex this is kind of like stomach crunches or sit ups for infants but it goes along with helping strengthen their arm muscles too make up your own sing song of up down and when he laughs smiles or giggles you know your song rocks corny but really cool to him as long as you gently help him exercise it's all good happy months give him plenty of hugs'n'kisses good luck and enjoy being a mum Social rule Breastfeeding Aerial (dance move) Milton H.
