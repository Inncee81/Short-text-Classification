baby on the way i am due to have my first child within the next two months my concern is my dog he is only a few years old very big and very loveable he is good with children and other animals if he were to ever hurt anyone or thing it would be because he is too loveable as he love love looooves to cuddle my concern is that he is going to become jealous when the baby is born he is the last animal that has joined our family and hasn't had to get used to anyone new around has anyone had any problems with their animals when a baby has come into the house how have you introduced them and made the arrangement ok i've heard a lot of people have had problems with their animals and wanted to know if anyone has had any experience in this area now my dog is about pounds part bulldog and part boxer we have let him sniff around the babies room and we do feel that he will be protective over her also he is very nosy so if something new is around he wants to check it out asap my friend brought her month old over and she was being stiff and holding her way up so he couldn't see that made him anxious and he wanted to know what was there that he wasnt allowed to see im just nervous ever since we bought him he has slept in the bed with us we have slowly been teaching him to sleep on the floor and learn some boundaries i think he'll be fine once he gets accustomed to the idea like i said im just nervous and was hoping to see what other people in the situation had done hi i have two dogs myself a yellow lab and a siberian husky and i was actually amazed at how great they were with my son when i brought him home from the hospital he is now my husky was so protective and curious about my son every little cry my son would make he would run up to his bassinet to make sure he was ok he would also just walk up to him and check on him from time to time my lab didn't really bother with him all that much as he grew older my dogs were always very gentle with him and now that he's two he will sit on the lab and jump on her like a horse and she just lays there my husky on the other hand just walks away if he tries to play with him in that manner the only advice that i got was that when the baby is born and still in the hospital it's good to bring a blanket home or a beanie that the baby has worn so the dogs can get used to the smell my husband did this when he went home to get some things while i was still in the hospital i'm sure everything will be fine with your dog and that your baby will have a great friend in him growing up good luck with everything sylvia Shaggy dog story Pitaten EastEnders Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Care Bears Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Knots Landing Dog training Breastfeeding 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Blood on the Tracks Lauren Bacall Characters in the Smurfs The Death Gate Cycle Garfield Babe Ruth Slow Train Coming Diving Meat Loaf One Tree Hill (TV series) Dog agility Sharon Tate The Shining (film) Infantilism Dog Into the West (miniseries) Days of our Lives Romulus and Remus 1957 World Series Siberian Husky Family Guy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Fairly OddParents Pet skunk Blankets (graphic novel) Comanche Alaskan husky Urinary incontinence Kitchen The Star Wars Holiday Special Avenue Q Kodocha Aphrodite Static Shock Honey and Clover Marilyn Monroe Piccolo Junior Saga Daredevil The Contender (television series) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Smoking Room Melanie Wilkes Lady and the Tramp Good Times Waylon Jennings The Amber Spyglass Poker jargon Jam (TV series) Socrates Sleeping Murder Characters of Lost Satchel Paige Animal Farm Sudden infant death syndrome Cliff Richard Traumatic brain injury Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fancy Crane Undergrads Sin City Bringing It All Back Home Hamster Macbeth The Catcher in the Rye Out-of-body experience Domestic rabbit Philip J.
