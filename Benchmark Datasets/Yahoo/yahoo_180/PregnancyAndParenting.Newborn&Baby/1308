switching formula has anyone changed their babies formula i am thinking of changing mine from sma to something else to see if that makes a difference there is something wrong with her and she doesn't sleep at all and is awake for up to hours at a time the docs dont think there is anything wrong but she is visually distressed i asked a question yesterday doctors no help and baby still not sleeping this is something i thought of that could help due to there being what appears to be a bad taste in her mouth that wakes her up everytime she falls asleep she is not teething and doesn't have thrush i have checked how would you switch formula has anyone experienced any bad effects the docs frown upon this in the uk but the mad doc i saw yesterday said it was fine to change i am willing to try anything to get her to sleep my poor baby is exhausted i didn't catch how old baby is but being awake for a solid hours is too much for any infant it is alright to switch formulas look for something without dairy ingredients as this could be the cause you might also want to look into finding a dr will a little more compassion towards a child who isn't sleep and a mother i feel horirble for you both she might have acid reflux which is causing her to show a bad taste but depending on age it could also be her showing you she is still hungry when you are having a hard time remember to go back to the basics is she hungry is she wet is she too cold or too warm does she have diaper rash is she gassy i'm not sure what the recommendations on switching formula is but i think you do it all in one go please correct me if i am wrong this way it is easiest to monitor allergies again i'm not sure i know i wasn't much help but i thought i would send you encouraging words keep checking on her and offering her as much mommy time as you can afford with your sleepless mind best wishes Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Philosophical skepticism Urinary incontinence Sleep Diaper Singlish Insomnia Infantilism Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Gastroesophageal reflux disease The Shining (film) Dream Milton H.
