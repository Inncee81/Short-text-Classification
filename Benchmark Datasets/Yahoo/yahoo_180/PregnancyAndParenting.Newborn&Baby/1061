baby's seperation anxiety driving me nuts my daughter is months old and has a really bad case of seperation anxiety and its driving me crazy she is crying all the time if i even put her on the floor she is crying i feel like i'm going crazy always having to hold her and not that i don't love the fact of being needed i need to be able to sleep and get things done cause i do have another daughter and for some reason daddy just isn't good enough and her cry is just god awful i really can't stand it what can i do so we are both a little happier this is why many people say that raising children is so difficult because babies and older children go through phases that take a lot of emotional energy out of their parents what you must understand during your child's entire life is they will go through phases children are not emotionally or psychologically developed enough to know how to react to situations that is what parents are for to teach them in a 'civilized' adult way and you have to remember while going through these phases that your baby girl is not doing these things because she is a bad child to spite you or because you've done something wrong but she will push push your buttons to see where you draw the line and this is an important part of childhood development children ask for boundries it is what makes them feel safe and secure with you as their guiding force through their life your daughter may be going through an emotionally stressful time right now as she realized that she is mobile and can function with out your help or as she becomes more mentally emotionally advanced these milestones can be scary things for children just like when they begin to walk or talk they get all these new feelings and thoughts and abilities and it can be overwhelming new unexplored space for them so they may become clingy act out badly and this is the time they need their parents to be understanding and to comfort and help them along however when it comes to behavior it's important to let the child know that it is okay to feel these feelings but not okay to act out in a negative way so if your child wants you to hold her all the time endulge that a little so she finds security in you during this time but also let her know that it is okay if you have to put her down and go to the restroom or make dinner or clean or just have a moment to yourself it may not be a super idea to leave her with a lot of different people at this time however if you must leave her with someone else let it be just one person so she can get use to that person as well by the way this phase is self limiting and will end with in a month or less my advice is to be very attentive to your child's behavior and give her what she needs but also be very clear about your boundries and come up with some creative correction when she over steps those boundries as she gets older i have typed way too much but if you would like me to recommend some books to you email me and i would be happy to do so it is just so important that you create a security within your daughter through these times both with your love and attention when she needs you and with boundries as well as she gets older Infantilism Autism Narcissism Theory of conduct Grief Transsexuality EastEnders Procrastination Asperger syndrome Urinary incontinence Transactional analysis Humphrey Bogart Friends Social rule Second language acquisition Attachment theory Stuttering Pitaten Psychoanalysis Nicomachean Ethics Mental retardation Scientology beliefs and practices A Course In Miracles Traumatic incident reduction Milton H.
