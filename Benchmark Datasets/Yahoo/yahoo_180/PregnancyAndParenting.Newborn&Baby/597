is there any problem if i do not start feeding solid food to a months old baby but only breastfeeding i have a months old baby girl i haven't started giving her any baby food yet is this affect to the baby's future development she is heavier than average weight and very healthy right now should i start the baby food right away or can i start whenever i feel it's ready you can start introducing solids when you're ready anytime before the first year but i think the reason they say to introduce certain foods is that your baby needs more iron that what can be given via breastmilk alone perhaps shortly you could start with baby cereal that has been iron fortified i was just reading that in the 's they didnt offer children solids until they were yrs old in france that seems crazy nowadays doesnt it some start at just a few mths way too early she's probably heavier than avg because she's just drinking milk which has more calories than fruits and veggies do i started solids quite slowly at around mths with my daughter but continued nursing quite often until she was mths before slowing down a little she went up from the curve during that time and gained more than others her age i just read your other responses they are a bit over reacting it's no solids until at least mths nowadays if they bother keeping up with things that means you can start later i went to a lll meeting and the organiser said she didnt start solids until mths with her baby her normal dr was completely ok with this but when she went in for an appt a replacement was there since the original dr was sick the replacement went off on how terrible this was she hadnt started solids and it was close to child abuse etc etc not even close my daughter's going to wake up any minute but let me see if i cant find you an article about delayed solids ok here we go from kellymom the following organizations recommend that all babies be exclusively breastfed no cereal juice or any other foods for the first months of life not the first months world health organization unicef us department of health human services american academy of pediatrics american academy of family physicians american dietetic association australian national health and medical research council royal australian college of general practitioners health canada most babies will become developmentally and physiologically ready to eat solids by months of age for some babies delaying solids longer than six months can be a good thing for example some doctors may recommend delaying solids for months if there is a family history of allergies here's another article that talks about i guess this myth that all of us have about a baby needed extra food than breastmilk their first year for the iron see link below for full article introducing solids ensures that a baby is not deprived of necessary iron in his diet anemia is uncommon in the breastfed baby due to the following reasons a healthy full term infant has ample iron stores at birth to last him at least for the first twelve months of life although the amount of iron in breastmilk is small it is readily absorbed at a rate of compared to of the iron in formula this is due to the high levels of lactose and vitamin c in human milk which aid in the absorption of iron and breastfed babies do not lose iron through their bowels as do formula fed infants whose intestines develop fissures from damage caused by cow's milk so there ya go dont worry about solids at all for now as lack of iron shouldnt be a concern either Infant formula Coeliac disease Tocopherol Nutrition Prostate cancer Vegetarianism Hypoglycemia Insulin Childbirth Crohn's disease Vitamin C Vitamin D Omega-3 fatty acid Urinary incontinence Anemia Protein-energy malnutrition Breast milk Growth hormone treatment Infantilism Dietary fiber Dairy Chronic fatigue syndrome Cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Fecal incontinence Food Medicine Medical analysis of circumcision Ulcerative colitis Pregnancy Atkins Nutritional Approach Nestl__ boycott Puberty Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Healthy eating Stomach cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Vegetarian nutrition Glycogen storage disease type I Tooth International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Fertility awareness Guinea pig Autism Tooth enamel Aspartame Chocolate Domestic rabbit Obesity Egg (food) Cat Soy milk Hamster Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prolactinoma Food allergy CPU cache Infant Dog Organic food Fasting Nurse Obstetrics Soybean Abortion Adjustable gastric band Terri Schiavo Malaria Raw food diet Clinical depression Abortion debate Fancy rat Vitamin Polychlorinated biphenyl Carburetor Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Calorie restriction Human height Jaundice Medical prescription Allergy Midwifery Insomnia Physician Sleep Overpopulation Thimerosal United Nations
