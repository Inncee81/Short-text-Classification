anyone out there have hcg shot to achieve your pregnancy i had an hcg shot days ago i took a pregnancy test last night to see if it was still in my system and i got a faint positive result i know that my shot level was i was wondering when you are pregnant do you go straight from the false positives to a darker positive how will i know when i have a real one or is there a day or two where the tests will be negative because the hcg shot is out of my system but the hcg from pregnancy isn't high enough you will see a more confident positive result when you are really pregnant considering the circumstances you should wait until you have a darker positive result and then see your doctor to help determine whether you are truly pregnant Pregnancy test Human chorionic gonadotropin Pregnancy Prenatal diagnosis HIV test Menstrual cycle Miscarriage Cytomegalovirus Folic acid Bernice Summerfield Fertility awareness Hydatidiform mole In vitro fertilisation Drug test Coeliac disease Abortion Obstetrics Prolactinoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gonorrhoea EastEnders Abortion debate Abortion in Canada Human skin color Teenage pregnancy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Human sexual behavior Blood type Binary classification Urinalysis Knots Landing Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
