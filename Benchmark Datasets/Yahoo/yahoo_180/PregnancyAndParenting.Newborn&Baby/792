odd question if i have an reaction to a food can i pass it down to my baby while breastfeeding i tried a new salad last night a few minutes later i broke out in a itchy rash over my cheeks and neck my tonsils swell up it went away by its self in about hours i know i have a mild allergy to one of the herbs in the salad i didn't think to check the salad first however the weird thing is my month old baby came out with a rash a couple of hours later but i couldn't see his tonsils he was happy as i watched over him for awhile and he's fine the weird bit is that he's lost his rash like i did after hours it was worst just after his bath then just startded fading away so could i have passed the reaction down through my breastmilk it sounds like your baby has the same allergy as you you can't pass the reaction itself to him but he did inherit your allergy i would call his ped and let them know about the reaction he had and that your allergic to it as well so they can put it in his records Allergy Breastfeeding Hay fever Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Shaggy dog story Food Food allergy Peanut Tonsil Tattoo Coeliac disease Asthma Characters of Naruto Urticaria Rash Hypersensitivity Cat Multiple chemical sensitivity Infectious mononucleosis Conjunctivitis Angioedema Treehouse of Horror IX Humphrey Bogart Group A streptococcal infection Eczema First aid "Weird Al" Yankovic Latex allergy Vampire Childbirth Breast milk EastEnders Stuttering Insomnia The Star Wars Holiday Special Salad Fingers Hey Jude Time Out of Mind Cephalexin Nasal congestion Penicillin King Crimson Infant formula Salad Pittsburgh Steelers Airedale Terrier Elephant Whose Line Is It Anyway?
