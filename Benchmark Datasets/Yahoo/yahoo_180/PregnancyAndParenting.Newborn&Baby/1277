what does everyone think about cloth diapers i am in my third trimester with my rd child and we have always used pampers but we just got my youngest potty trained and i really don't want to start buyng diapers again every week is it hard to use cloth diapers is it hard to keep them clean good and bad experiences are appreciated thanks i cloth diapered my son from the time he was weeks old until he potty trained right before he turned three i loved it i can't say that there were no issues but even disposable users have issues they have blow outs and leaks and rashes yet if someone has those same issues in cloth diapers then they blame the cloth i am a cloth diaper advocate and have helped many families get their babies in cloth and they are always surprised at how easy it is the worst thing about using cloth diapers today is fighting people's stereotypes about them and the people who use them we shouldn't have to defend ourselves for making the best choice for our babies the good thing is that most people change their minds about cloth diapers once they are exposed to them and realize how much easier they are than they previously thought what a lot of people aren't aware of these days is that there is a whole world of cloth diapers available on the internet there are enough choices to make your head spin those gauzey flat diapers plastic pants and oversized safety pins that you find in the baby section of your local department store are a thing of the past and if that is someone's only experience with cloth diapers i'd be surprised if it weren't horrible diapers are meant to be changed everytime they are wet or soiled yet dispoables are made so absorbant that many consumers are spoiled and don't change the wet diaper until it is falling off the baby therefore if someone is conditioned to this mindset they will end up causing a rash on a baby by leaving a wet cloth diaper on for hours or so at a time if used and washed correctly it's not hard just use a hypoallergenic detergent such as all free and clear cloth diapers do not cause rashes however disposable diapers contain so many chemicals that they have been known to cause severe diaper rashes if you breastfeed baby's poop will just disolve in the wash once baby has solid poop you can use a flushable diaper liner to catch the solids so clean up isn't hard at all my advice to you would be to wait on the all in one or pocket diapers until your baby is eating solids regularly you will need a cover to help the diaper hold in all that liquid poo fitteds and prefolds work great as long as you buy a quality brand online and don't worry about prefolds being hard to use they're not you can just fold it into a rectangle and place it into a velcro closing cover no pins needed good luck with your choice Infantilism Breastfeeding Kimberly-Clark Corporation Fecal incontinence Procter & Gamble Textile manufacturing Urinary incontinence Social rule Plastic Elimination communication Billiards Undergarment Fast bowling Jackass: The Movie Clothing Pitaten Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Hazing The Apprentice 2 Shit Poker jargon Menstrual cup 2000 Australian Grand Prix Jennifer Lopez Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Atkins Nutritional Approach Casting Menstrual cycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tire Genericized trademark Strap-on dildo Characters in the Smurfs IBM PC compatible Shaggy dog story Abortion debate Dry cleaning Comanche Kimi Finster Hiking Kodocha Ron and Fez Upholstery EastEnders Zinc Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Paragliding Hard disk The Inside Knife Toilet humour Tattoo The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bong Japanese tea ceremony Cheese Plame affair Dishwasher Extreme Programming Conker's Bad Fur Day Brian Close Washing machine Knots Landing Rose (Doctor Who) Debugging 1957 World Series Mixed martial arts Hard water Fire fighting Jon Secada Scientology beliefs and practices Toilet Gaia Online Hydrogen peroxide The Fairly OddParents Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Social aspects of clothing Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Homer Simpson Aerial (dance move) Parenting Japanese toilet Waste management Hamster Equine conformation Theodicy Escherichia coli O157:H7 Charmed Drill bit
