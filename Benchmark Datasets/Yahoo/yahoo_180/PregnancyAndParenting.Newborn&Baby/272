is it normal for a week old baby's legs to quiver shake from time to time my son was full term and had a normal delivery we noticed after a few weeks that his legs would shake from time to time mostly when mad crying but occasionally when calm as well he otherwise is doing well and alert and tracking at weeks hi this is completely normal for babies to shake in their limbs especially as newborns because they are not as coordinated and have little control of them from personal research and experience of caring for my babies month old daughter and month old son i don't think they have much of a sensation to their limbs at newborn stages for example if i sit and tickle my daughters toes she gets real kick out of it and responds to my touch but my newborn does not because he has less feeling in his feet i have even watched him wake himself up or prevent himself from sleeping because his legs are bouncing all around and he doesn't realize it that is probably why they recommend swaddling methods at that age anyhow it is totally normal it would be different if he had tremors in his hands or something i would not worry about it a bit unless you notice him not developing as he should be and contrary to what the previous person said i would not mention it to the doctor unless you have a serious concern about it and see that it is interfering with his usual growth by the way when his legs shake and he isn't crying it usually is body language that means he is excited and also he could be over stimulated and just reacting to his surroundings in that case it is totally normal and both my children have done that Childbirth Breastfeeding Hypoglycemia Prostate cancer Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Urinary incontinence Out-of-body experience Androgen insensitivity syndrome EastEnders Shaggy dog story Pregnancy Puberty Clinical depression Child sexuality Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milton H.
