please help my baby boy is weeks old and up until two weeks ago has eaten like a horse he was weaned at sixteen weeks and has eaten three substantial meals a day since he was about weeks even though he has been teething quite bad he also cut his milk down to on average oz a day over the last two weeks he has been getting really upset at food times and has cut his solid food down considerable and also his milk a bit i was just wondering whether it is a phase that all babies go through ie teething or not requiring that amount of food any more also has anyone got any ideas on how i can get him to eat some more i have tried everything more than likely your baby is going through a phase but the important thing is to keep offering it is frustrating as a parent to prepare food only to have it go to waste but a child nutritionist advises 'it is not your responsibility to make your child eat but it is your responsibility to provide food ' when my daughter was a baby i would marvel at how she would go through phases and eat a lot and other times it seemed she went all day on three cheerios you do have to look at the more serious side however is your baby losing weight if so a lot these concerns should be addressed with a doctor has your baby been on medication such as antibiotics if this is the case he might need some enzyme replacement trying to digest food without certain enzymes or good bacteria would cause a baby to be fussy when food is offered eating just doesn't feel good a doctor may prescribe something but soy yogurts often have some of the same enzymes your stomach needs and you don't have to use cow's milk yogurt when you refer to your son drinking milk perhaps it is this that is hard for him to digest is he drinking formula maybe he needs a new formula some babies develop allergies and sensitivities to their formulas and need to try a new one if your son drinks formula made with cow's milk try a soy or rice formula lactose intolerance can develop at any time alternative formulas can be a little more expensive but eventually you can go back to the cow's milk formula and eventually even cow's milk if your child isn't allergic also don't forget to burp him i would pat my daughter forever it seemed until i got her to burp keeping bloating down is important if he cries after drinking or eating chances are he has gas pains and begins to associate it with eating and won't want to eat is your baby teething you said he is give him comfort food like rice cereal and even things like frozen bananas to teeth on with supervision of course we don't want choking also he may need smaller portions and more frequent meals he may be tired of having to tank up three times a day and would prefer to graze most babies and toddlers graze meaning they eat a few cheerios later a couple bites of apple sauce later a portion of a teething biscuit an hour later a few bites of pureed carrots it is easier on digestion this way and babies usually know not to over eat they don't like to feel really full by forcing food or tanking him up three times a day he may lose his ability to regulate fullness and actually develop into an over eater babies can consume quite a bit if allowed to eat smaller portions throughout the day again make it available but don't force the issue maybe he has had too many new foods recently go back to basics and only offer a couple different foods that are easy to digest and things you know he likes most babies don't get bored with foods like adults do they prefer favorites over too many new foods evaluate the eating environment is he left in a high chair to eat by himself or does he sit at the table with you and possibly others during meal time at eye level are meal times calm and enjoyable or stressful and rushed perhaps just holding him in your lap while you eat will increase his interest as long as he isn't losing weight and becoming dull and unengaged it is most likely a phase and some minor adjustments will help take a 'this too shall pass' attitude if he is losing weight and doesn't seem to engage with you just seems droopy and lack luster you should have him checked out if the doctor says not to worry then relax and do your best to make mealtimes fun and non forceful good luck Food Cheese Tooth Diarrhea Soy milk Hamster Soybean Cat Livestock Yoghurt Nutrition Fancy rat Insulin
