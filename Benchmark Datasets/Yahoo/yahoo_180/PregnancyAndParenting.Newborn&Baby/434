blessed thistle hi my question is has any one ever used only blessed thistle without combining fenugreek the health food store was out of fenugreek and mothers milk tea so i started out with just blessed thistle i have allready seen a difference in my supply and i am pretty satisfied hours later i was going to order the fenugreek online and use both but i'm not sure if it is necessary every one i have spoken with used the herbs together and my doctor said i can take the herbs b anyone tells me to ask him lol i pumped and am putting my lil man to the breast everytime i can and seems to be working should i just stick with this for now the reason i wanted to up my supply is my son is a little behind for his age and he is not and will not be supplemented so plz don't suggest this i'd like to see him gain a bit more weight he is gaining a lil over a pound a month and that is fine but if he could gain a bit more i d be pleased thanks hi tasha yes blessed thistle can work on its own and some other ones to try if you want is red raspberry leaf tea and fennel tea you can take fenugreek and blessed thistle in capsules and make a big thermos of the other teas and drink throughout the day lots and lots of liquids will help too carrot juice is great because it has tons of nutrients in a glass and it well help boost your supply and your energy which i'm sure you need you don't have to use blessed thistle along with fenugreek if you can't find it but it might help even more also you have to consider that your supply may be just fine if your baby seems content and ends feedings on his own it could be that he only wants to gain a little over a pound a month my daughter is not a big eater either if on the other hand it seems like he wants more but you're not producing enough then you may need to up your supply and it seems like you're doing all the right things in order for that to happen you may try what i suggested in your last question pump after feedings and give him that milk when he seems to want more that 's how i got my baby to gain a little extra weight he seems to be fine though he's not in a danger zone so just keep nursing on demand let him stay at the breast for as long as he wants and be positive that everything will be okay good luck you seem to be a very good mommy he's a lucky boy Breastfeeding Milk Fenugreek Tea Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Humphrey Bogart Bodybuilding Dairy Coffee Veganism Chocolate RuneScape quests Japanese tea ceremony Khatushyamji Dieting John the Baptist Sugar beet Hamster About a Boy Carburetor Curry EastEnders Money Ayyavazhi mythology Theory of conduct Solar power Breast milk Breakfast Hydrogen economy Folic acid Coeliac disease Terri Schiavo Yerba mate Ty Cobb Textile manufacturing Omega-3 fatty acid Rum Order of the Thistle RuneScape skills Frankie Laine I Want to Hold Your Hand Guinea pig Alcoholic beverage 2000 Australian Grand Prix Uranium Infant formula Little Britain Characters in the Smurfs Sugar Agriculture Tocopherol Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Lil Jon Joke Vitamin C Soft drink Rooibos The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Cuisine of Singapore Childbirth Herbal tea Kylie Minogue Ketchup Elephant Sage American Black Bear Prostate cancer Radio Yerevan Milton H.
