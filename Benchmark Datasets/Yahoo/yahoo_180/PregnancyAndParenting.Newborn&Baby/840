baby scratching her face my ten week old daughter has gained control of her hands and is now fascinated by her ability to put her hands to her bottle suck on her fingers and unfortunately scratch her face she scratched her face on two occasions today and drew blood there wasn't much bleeding but the scratches were about half an inch each and it broke my heart to see her bleed and cry i have the mittens and they worked wonderfully when she was fresh out of the womb but now she can wiggle out of them even a nicer pair i have that goes up higher on her arm i am wondering if any other parents found another solution for this problem i am very worried that she will scratch her eyes or cause more painful sores on her beautiful face what can i do to prevent scratching what can i put on her scratches thank you so much for your answers i swaddle her snugly at night so that is the one time i don't have to worry about scratches i will try your suggestions such as newborn socks leaving the scratches alone and i will be religious about keeping her nails trimmed i appreciate the feedback first off she wouldn't be the first to do this i would suggest keep doing the mittens even if she is pulling them off or try socks sometimes they stay on better make sure you are swaddling her when she is in her bouncer car seat laying down in your arms etc so that she doesn't have the chance to scratch i would also suggest trimming her fingernails as often as you can so they are too short for her to stratch herself if you are having troubles doing this may i suggest either doing it while bathing towards the end since they will be softer or if all else fails because of wiggles do it when they are sleeping i also suggest that they are usually looking for something to do when they end up scratching themselves so try to keep them preoccupied with sometihg in thier hands so they don't think about touching thier face tripe antibiotic neosporin should work fine for the scratches Breastfeeding Knots Landing Piccolo Junior Saga Childbirth Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Traumatic brain injury Vampire Social rule Knife EastEnders Salad Fingers Electrophysiology Avenue Q The Shining (film) Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Miscarriage Eczema Kodocha Time Out of Mind Jon Secada Stroke Blood on the Tracks Dialysis Menstrual cup Aerial (dance move) The Marshall Mathers LP W.I.T.C.H.
