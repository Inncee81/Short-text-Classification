my nephew and i are very close how do i assure him that if i have a baby i won't love him any less when my sister nephew's mother told him that my husband and i were probably going to have a baby soon he said but insert my name here thinks that i'm her baby he seemed really down for the rest of that night and when i bring it up he doesn't hardly respond i want to let him know that i will always love him very much even if i do have children of my own what is the best way to do this this is a delicate situation we all know what you wanted to here from him is wow that's great but children don't think like adults always and what your nephew is most likely thinking is that he'll be second best to your child but encourage that the new baby will be like a younger brother or sister to him ask if he wants to come with when your shopping for new baby things and have him pick out a few things but no matter how many times you tell him that the baby won't tear you apart that's probably not what he's thinking it's still not good enough if he's a good five years older then your baby then maybe tell him that once he and the baby are older that he might be able to babysit the most important thing to do is to not slack off on the fun things you guys did together make sure your nephew knows that it'll all be the same you'll still play catch at the park and you'll still read to him communicate that it's all the same good luck EastEnders Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Stewie Griffin Humphrey Bogart The Adventures of Pete & Pete Jon Secada The Fairly OddParents Everwood Phoebe Halliwell Pitaten Melanie Wilkes Charmed Transactional analysis Baby Blues The McGuire Sisters Boy Meets World The Family from One End Street History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Paige Matthews Kodocha The Ashlee Simpson Show Infantilism The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Night (book) Phoebe Buffay's songs House of Bourbon Origin belief Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Rod Stewart Social rule Married... with Children Ayyavazhi mythology Sharon Tate The Lovely Bones Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Time Out of Mind About a Boy Honey and Clover Haven (TNG episode) Rais massacre The Catcher in the Rye Trailer Park Boys Shaggy dog story Luke and Laura Spencer Incest Romulus and Remus FoxTrot Abortion debate Characters in the Smurfs Katharine Hepburn Past characters (Neighbours) The Magician's Nephew John the Baptist Whitney Houston Neighbours Brian Close Scrooge McDuck Family Doug One Life to Live Rugrats Henry VIII of England Macbeth Characters of Lost The Chronicles of Narnia The Critic Jam (TV series) Aladdin (1992 film) What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
