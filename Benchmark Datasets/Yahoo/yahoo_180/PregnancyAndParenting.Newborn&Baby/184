what can be done to encourage new moms this is open to all moms we all know that bf'ing should be the norm but it's not if you formula fed your baby what do you think would have helped you make a decision to breastfeed if you breast fed what was a major contribution to this decision be detailed i'd really like to know what your experiences have been some really interesting and good answers so far i just want to add that in response to booboo's question about why i'd like to know is that i'd like irl to help moms who are having trouble without making them feel judged or defensive knowing what has stood in the way or what has been beneficial to others can help me be more empathetic and helpful hope that answers your question we all know the benefits of breastfeeding i think we should spread the word about it without bashing formula feeding moms we get nowhere putting someone else down i had to supplement with formula for about a month until i started producing enough milk i hated that my lactation consultant looked down on me because of it the only thing i could think about was that it wasn't her starving baby so why should she judge me i think we should support without judging that is key it looks really bad when your trying to teach and help someone and you bash the only other option there is to feed your baby the second thing to do would be to be as honest as we can be i was determined to breastfeed and thought it would come naturally and that my body would know how much milk to make for my son it didn't i did have to supplement with formula for three weeks or a month i'll say a month because it did seem like a while breastfeeding is very difficult for first time moms and you must be informed about the difficulties that some will face with beastfeeding and the commitment that comes along with it it doesn't matter how informed you are you must understand that just because a friend had an easy time with bf it doesn't mean you will inform with the truth and let moms know the difficulties along with the benefits have support groups and peer counselors young moms that had difficulties with bf that overcame them and overall enjoy it we have to realize that not every woman is up to the challenge of breastfeeding as it is a challenge and understand and support them too all moms breastfeeding or not need some suport as some moms come to regret their choice not to breastfeed there are many more thing you can do but imo these are the most important Breast Fertility awareness Theory of conduct Current teachings of Prem Rawat Milk Prostate cancer Scientology beliefs and practices Shaggy dog story Nestl__ boycott Goodness and value theory Ethics Breast milk Infantilism Folic acid Social rule One Tree Hill (TV series) Infant Omega-3 fatty acid Decision making Meaning of life EastEnders Coming of Age (TNG episode) Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Brassiere Incarnations of Immortality Cindy Sheehan Richard Feynman Humphrey Bogart Fathers' rights Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Scientific method GED Simone Weil Internet troll Utilitarianism Abortion in the United States Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Nipple piercing God Emperor of Dune Organic farming Microeconomics Strategic management Eddie Guerrero Breast cancer Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Justification (theology) Altruism Theodicy Autism Kurt Cobain Expert system Stuttering Ron and Fez Opus Dei Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Plame affair Deconstruction Pok__mon Live! 2000 Australian Grand Prix Terri Schiavo RuneScape quests Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder America's Next Top Model Past teachings of Prem Rawat Science Yoko Ono Divorce Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Same-sex marriage in Canada Consensus decision-making Kender Alcoholics Anonymous Avenue Q Determinism Kyle Broflovski Phoebe Buffay's songs Breast pump Jury trial Protein-energy malnutrition A Course In Miracles Abortion debate Martial art G__del's incompleteness theorem Time Out of Mind Kodocha Ayyavazhi mythology Appeal 2005 trial of Michael Jackson
