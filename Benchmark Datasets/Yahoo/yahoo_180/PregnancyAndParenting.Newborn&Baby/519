can i still do it i have a day old and i really wanted to strictly breast feed him the problem is after about days my nipples were so cracked and bloody that it was too painful to nurse him now he is eating out of bottles either formula or pumped breast milk however i would really like to go back to breastfeeding now that my nipples have healed is there a good way to try to transition my baby back to my breast the only real way is to slowly wean him back on theres a really good chance you will get the cracked nipples all over again so get some good lanolin cream to put on them just in case the best way to do it is just start putting him back on i have had to do this with a few of my kids i was partially weaning my daughter at around months when all of a sudden she didnt wnat the formula anymore so i had to just keep putting her back on and she would constantly drink every hour or two and hardly sleep but she wouldnt take the bottle after a day or two she was back on fully breastfeeding and i weaned her at months a similar thing happend with my now year old son when he was a about months old he went cold turkey on me and would not touch my breastmilk from my breast but would drink it from a bottle so i started to pump a few days later he decided he didnt want it that way anymore i couldnt get the bottle into him and he just wanted breast again it took a few days again to get him back on and those two days are tiring and i did get very sore nipples again but worth it if you want to breastfeed i breastfed him until months old being only days old you have an incredibly good chance of getting him on the breast it will just take a bit of time and peserverance and he will seem hungry but if you want to breastfeed you will have to stop the formula and just keep giving him the breast until your milk supply is back up again goodluck Mastitis Infant Fertility awareness Nipple piercing Nipple Baby bottle Breast milk Childbirth Milk Breast pump Nestl__ Infant formula Prolactin Indianapolis 500 Knots Landing Hormone replacement therapy (trans) International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes Massage Nestl__ boycott Protein-energy malnutrition Coffee Brassiere Lanolin Breast reduction Characters in the Smurfs Prolactinoma Soft drink Breast cancer Elephant Dairy Cat Vitamin D Equine conformation Social rule Apollo 8 Elimination communication Nudity Orgasm Urinary incontinence EastEnders Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Myocardial infarction Jaundice Hansel und Gretel Plastic Hera Guinea pig Mammary gland Kodocha Shaggy dog story Premature birth Kosher foods Jackass: The Movie Koala Marathon (sport) Co-sleeping Herpes simplex virus The Death Gate Cycle Janet Jackson The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Stomach cancer Puberty Harp Seal A Day in the Life Cuisine of the Philippines Obstetrics Shark Ice cream Dialysis Breakfast 2000 Australian Grand Prix Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Poker jargon Fecal incontinence Medical analysis of circumcision Bart chalkboard gags The Amber Spyglass Piccolo Junior Saga Out-of-body experience Supernumerary nipple Stroke Yoko Ono Cliff Richard Daredevil Breast reconstruction Red Hot Chili Peppers Little Britain Domestic goat Sudden infant death syndrome Cocaine Mouth ulcer B-47 Stratojet Leon White Erogenous zone
