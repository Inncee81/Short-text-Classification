bright red blood after giving birth a month ago i gave a month ago and had an episiotomy my discharge has already turned from red to brown and then to yellowish but this morning it turned bright red again just like fresh blood my stiches has already healed so it is most probably from my uterus is this normal i stopped breast feeding two weeks ago and i felt some cramps this morning hmm it could be a number of things if your last lot of bleeding had completely stopped it could actually be your first period which sucks but can happen and more likely if youre no longer breastfeeding if you suddenly became more active as that can cause red blood it could be an infection here you have to just go by how you feel if you feel great the discharge isnt offensive and you dont have cramping then its probably not an infection but if its any of the above or you also have a temperature then i would ring your midwife just to be sure goodluck and congrats on the birth of your bubba Childbirth Breastfeeding Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness First aid Pregnancy Obstetrics Miscarriage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jaundice Puberty Stomach cancer Vitamin C Urinary incontinence Infant Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Female genital cutting Endometrial cancer Tuberculosis Dialysis Blood on the Tracks Endometriosis Breech birth Guinea pig Treehouse of Horror V Breast Blood Infant formula Caesarean section Gonorrhoea Shark Stroke AIDS Thermoregulation Tocopherol Oral contraceptive Psoriasis Androgen insensitivity syndrome EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Heartworm Muscle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abortion Kain (Legacy of Kain) Shaggy dog story Variable star Folic acid Bruise Bone marrow transplant HIV Collectibles in Bionicle Wound Time Out of Mind Group A streptococcal infection Complete blood count Platelet Milk Bleeding Leukemia Good Morning, Vietnam Discus (fish) Intravenous therapy Giraffe Infectious mononucleosis Dead Sea Slayers Old wives' tale Cancer Chlorpromazine Coeliac disease Blood (computer game) Placenta praevia Erythropoietin Socrates Dobermann Cephalic disorder Head louse Medical analysis of circumcision Undead (Discworld) Intersex surgery Wound healing phases Prostate cancer Prolactin 2000 Australian Grand Prix Episiotomy Chicken Anopheles Glucocorticoid Piccolo Junior Saga Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Anemia Chagas disease Traumatic brain injury 28 Days Later Forrest Gump Weapons of Middle-earth Postnatal
