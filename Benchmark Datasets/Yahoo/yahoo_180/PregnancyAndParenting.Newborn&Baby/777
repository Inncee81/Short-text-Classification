how on earth do you go back to work after weeks or less of giving birth my daughter is weeks old i'm getting very little done around the house except feed her burp her and comfort her because she isn't a good sleeper i cannot imagine going back to work after six weeks maternity leave i am able to take weeks but everybody seems to say the craziness gets better after months still how do you do it going back to work when your baby is months old and still very demanding i'm finding it seemingly impossible from a time standpoint alone toss aside any guilty feelings at this point how do you do it if you've gone back to work after weeks maternity or less what was it like managing feeding pumping sleeping working and the rest of the stuff in life that needs to get done at some point or another it is hard i was able to stay home with our son for months with our baby only weeks what do i do i sleep with her i feel that she needs to know i am there when i have been away until each day we did the same with our son and he was in his own bed by years nurse on demand we have family cleaning day every saturday everyone helps and it all gets done in day i organize everything the night before my clothes baby's stuff our son is and he is in charge of his own stuff i even lay out the breakfast stuff the night before i pump at work times a day and once before i leave to help my husband works nights and watches her during the day and then we switch in the evening i wore a sling when she was smaller and got things done that way now a mei tei and she loves the view my home was not as orderly as i wanted it but i wouldn't ignore the kids to get it all done when i am home it's all about the kids that is my mantra sleeping is easier when you sleep with them because i can nurse and get to her before she is really upset also she sleeps better having me next to her she slept through the night at weeks old got up for a bit at months at months both times with teething and she is just a year and sleeps all night long i love waking up with her and so does my husband it works and it will all fall into play but it takes time once you have a routine it gets easier good luck and congrats to you Knots Landing EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Michael Garibaldi Kimi Finster Humphrey Bogart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sin City Melanie Wilkes Kodocha The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe About a Boy Urinary incontinence Neighbours Characters in the Smurfs The Catcher in the Rye Jon Secada Childbirth The Shining (film) The Apprentice 3 Dog training Aphrodite The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pitaten Insomnia Jewish bereavement Ron and Fez AFI 100 Years series The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Social rule Friends Sharon Tate Honey and Clover Sleeping Murder Big Brother UK series 6 Vegeta The Ashlee Simpson Show Rosa Parks Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Romulus and Remus Kurt Cobain Sleep Jam (TV series) The Contender (television series) Beatles for Sale Heracles One Life to Live Apollo 8 Theory of conduct Fancy Crane The Human Stain Nurse Betty Phoebe Buffay's songs Textile manufacturing Empire Burlesque Great Teacher Onizuka Charmed Miss Saigon Donald Neilson Fertility awareness What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
