how do i stop being scared of the dark i am so afraid that there is something hiding somtimes it takes me forever to go to sleep i can barely go downstairs sometimes without getting scared and it doesnt help that my house creaks i know that there is ntohing because my dog would bark and the doors are locked but i keep thinking that there is like an evil clown wanting to kill me behind every dark corner and i am so afraid what should i do yes i know it sounds babish but idk haha nope i shouldn't have x and it's only at night btw never durring the day not matter how dark it is thanks everybody and yes i did see it well only part of it from the part from the photo album till about minutes afterwarrds try turning out lights wherever you go also keep the mentality that its all in your head try to think that your over reacting your not a kid anymore things like that plus the chances of someone being there or an intruder lurking in the darkness is so small that im sure you'd be struck times with lightning before any of that would happen Shaggy dog story Jon Secada The Shining (film) Bob and George Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Silent Night, Deadly Night Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Time Machine Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) The Subtle Knife Lisa's First Word Sin City The Marshall Mathers LP One Tree Hill (TV series) Time Out of Mind Shen Gong Wu Xiaolin Showdown Force (Star Wars) Darth Vader Dean Koontz Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rayden Characters in the Smurfs AFI 100 Years series Glen Jacobs The Midnight Sun Care Bears Weebl and Bob StarCraft Secret Missions Characters of Naruto Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix The Virgin Suicides Cliff Richard The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Races in the Warcraft universe Grandview, U.S.A.
