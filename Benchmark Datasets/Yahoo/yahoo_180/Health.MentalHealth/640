my interests are disappearing yeah my interests are disappearing and i don't know what to do now i don't want to watch t v or hear music because i don't have a motivation anymore and even food it's not as delicious as before i'm just eating to stay alive i'm just year old boy and have these things before i used to watch t v the whole day and so to music and i used to like eating food but now it's over and even the internet i don't want to surf the internet anymore or to go online before i was addicted on internet this time i'm online just to write this question i hope you help me please i'm really dying my interests are gone and you can't imagine who i'm living please answer alright all these symptoms you are describing are all related to some type of depression there are different types of depression in today s world if this has been happening for a while then you need to speak up talk to someone you are close to about getting help in a professional manner letting someone know that is close to you will give you strong support and help you get motivated to seek professional help next is selecting a counselor i see you a male so you probably might want a male counselor just as a suggestion you need to go and pick one then start talking to them the first few times you will be there you might be scared to talk about your feelings but talking to them will not only make you feel better but they will give you suggestions on ways of helping you if they feel that you need to be put on medication they will refer you to a psychologist then they will choose what type of medication you should be put on but not every time someone goes through these symptoms means that they need medication you may just need someone to talk to that isn't in your every day life whatever you do don't let this go or it might change your life and not for the good you might be the total opposite of what you used to be personality wise the only reason i say this is because i went through the same thing many people do so don't feel alone because you are not i was depressed for years and completely lost my old personality i used to be happy loving into my school life enjoyed playing video games watching tv being with my family being with friends eating normally and so much more when i was depressed all my things i enjoyed doing went right out the window i would just sit in my bed and cry all day wanting nothing to do with life i stopped eating hardly anything and lost a lot of weight i lost pounds i was over weight before so that s why i lost so much i ended up being hospitalized several times they diagnosed me with manic depression which is not good now you might not even need to be hospitalized if you take things into action now not wait like i did anyways once i got the right help my old personality was back my parents were deeply thankful for the help i got and were thrilled to have their daughter back its really amazing what this illness can do to you how it can completely flip your life around i hope my response to your question could help you out i wish you the best of luck and don't get discouraged plus don't feel alone what so ever there is always light at the end of the tunnel Shaggy dog story Clinical depression Transsexuality Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Theory of conduct About a Boy Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anorexia nervosa Sant Thakar Singh Pitaten Stomach cancer Friends Philip J.
