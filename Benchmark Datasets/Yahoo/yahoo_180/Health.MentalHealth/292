what are the chances that my boyfriend could get alzheimer's disease my boyfriend's grandpa died of alzheimer's his mom's dad a few years ago i get mad at him sometimes because when we have a conversation it's usually one sided it's not just with me though it's with everyone i know he said he just has a hard time putting his thoughts into words quickly he can never find the right words to say i looked up to see if anyone else was like this and i found that this is actually a sign of alzheimer's i know that it's very unlikely that he has it now but maybe it's a sign that he will have it in the future i know that ad can be hereditary what are his chances of getting it if it was not his parent that had it but his grandparent as of right now i'm not aware of anyone else who has had it in his family but it is possible anyway i'm just curious i know it's early to worry but if it's possible to do something about it now i'd like to i love him so much and want to do anything i can to keep him healthy thanks there are a lot of things that go into causes of alzheimer's disease i would recommend that you suggest he goes to a doctor preferably a specialist or at least one that knows alzheimer's well a couple questions to keep in mind would be what's in his diet good and bad what supplements he's taking if any and if he's taking a cholesterol blocking drug it seems that a lot of doctors may not know or at least don't acknowledge that the typical cholesterol drugs stop your body from producing cholesterol altogether while that might seem like a good idea you need some cholesterol in your body and especially in your brain one of the most common complaints with those drugs is complaints about memory and cognitive problems some of which are even symptoms of alzheimer's if he's not taking any drugs and or if the doctor doesn't know what might help you could always try natural supplements that a lot of people get benefits for with mental support clarity and memory there's ginkgo biloba acetyl l carnitine fish oil huperzine a phosphatidylserine vinpocetine choline inositol bacopa moniera or monieri dmae and some of the b vitamins which also help with energy unfortunately different people respond differently to different supplements so it's hard to say which of these may be the best for him in particular unless you can see a doctor that knows about supplements edit in response to the person who said you can't die from alzheimer's that's not true if it advances far enough a person can literally forget to breathe that's what happened to my great aunt when she passed away from alzheimer's but it's literally in the final stages usually a decade or two after the onset Alzheimer's disease Prostate cancer Tocopherol Nutrition Folic acid Bipolar disorder Coronary heart disease Urinary incontinence Clinical depression Schizophrenia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Multiple sclerosis Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Stomach cancer Fish oil Traumatic brain injury Cholesterol Hypoglycemia Chronic fatigue syndrome Brain Omega-3 fatty acid Vitamin C Veganism Nootropic Stroke Cancer Tobacco smoking Hypnosis Psychosis Atherosclerosis Atkins Nutritional Approach Social rule Myocardial infarction Dieting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Parkinson's disease Diabetes mellitus Anorexia nervosa Soul Anxiety Mental illness Immortality Milk Addiction Theory of conduct Hypercholesterolemia Antiretroviral drug Consciousness Abortion debate Yoga Sutras of Patanjali A Course In Miracles Adult attention-deficit disorder Obesity Down syndrome Vitamin D Dementia Terri Schiavo Epilepsy Coeliac disease Grief Milton H.
