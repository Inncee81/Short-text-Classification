help i need to see a counselor but i do i know what kind i need i have never seen a counselor before but i need to see one now i was sexually abused as a kid i have major trust issues and i really don't take rejection very well i have anger management problems exspecially when i feel rejected last night i lost it my husband wouldn't kiss me because he didn't want to feel like he was forced to i was so hurt it was like tearing my heart out i got drunk not something that i usually do i threw a mirior at the floor and broke it yep years of bad luck i hit him and then well then i really just wanted to grab a knife and kill myself the only thing that stopped me was that i didn't know how to stab myself that would make me die then i would end up in a hospital in the psych ward and i am closterphobic is that how you spell it so that would not be good so what kind of counselor do i need look for a therapist who specializes in trauma someone who is trained in edmr might also be a good idea depending on what you are experiencing make sure s he has a license to practice and is someone you respect and believe you could grow to trust what you've described sounds fairly typical of post child abuse you are not alone and with commitment you can get beyond this apologize to your hubby and explain what's going on too Theory of conduct Psychotherapy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Boston Public EastEnders Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Dissociative identity disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Psychoanalysis Sin City Transactional analysis Traumatic incident reduction Tenshinhan Knots Landing Narcissism Humphrey Bogart The Beach Boys Laura Schlessinger The Inside Anger management Milton H.
