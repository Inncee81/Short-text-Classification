find something you enjoy yeah great advice except what if you don't enjoy things i guess i can't really say that i am in here right typing right there must be something of interest even if it's in the exploration of my present state of mind i guess i hear that phrase alot as if being told yeah okay i forgot that and move on as if the problem solution is that simple i realize it isn't that simple maybe it's from a lifetime of killing time on education without a focus or complaint since i did well in that maybe if's from my lifelong isolation from society as there isn't the focus of people seeing the problem maybe it's cause i just have no concept on my identity who knows so how does one find something to enjoy if one does not know what that is been told to just explore new things which is good advice for an extrovert but i'm clearly not that i realize i am seeking help otherwise wouldn't be in here i don't know maybe i just convinced myself i'm different from society around me and has no clue on what to do thanks for the early advice i guess that's why i didn't want to use the introvert word for i get how it could be viewed as an excuse i also get that with the limitations of space it's difficult to detail the things that happen in one's life that brought them to this point what concerns me and explored this with previous therapists is i'm starting to get the appeal of rage not in harming others for i don't have that desire but am starting to get why or rather how someone can close themselves off to feed on their own darkness i guess like an addiction if previously not stated has tried medications therapy group etc in the past and not ect not an option either it was a noted concern of my last therapist of growing possibility of not finding any place to fit in but uncertain where to go so therapy was halted i know sounds like i've given up but really haven't just no concept on where to go besides all the methods that already failed i posted the same question albeit in a different way a couple of days ago what makes me happy i honestly have no idea but thinking about it has brought some clues to mind i enjoy talking to my psychiatrist and psychologist i have started enjoying talking to my mom better and my two sisters and their children too i have had my meds substantially increased i think that helped too my good friend is going to meet me for lunch on friday i realize i enjoy talking to only certain people in a reciprocal way others i like to help at my clubhouse by talking positively to them i hope to be a peer specialist one day as you can tell grin i named myself that i am an introvert but that's not all bad i enjoy being here on this website and sharing experiences i enjoy receiving connections talking my nephews and niece live far away and e mailing all of them life can be good i truly think if we open up our minds to the possibility of happiness and then see what we think of try it you are extremely intelligent i sense that try it take care Carl Jung Theory of conduct Medicine Milton H.
