my poor self esteem is causing me to be a lesbian can this statement be true i don't want to be rude or anything honestly what is wrong with you people for many years homosexuality has been a taboo now that people are coming to their minds they are making a taboo in favor of homosexuality can't you just see something without prejudice or any feeling of guilt for a moment look back at your answers can't you see they mostly lack any logic she's asking if poor self esteem may push someone toward being a lesbian not if every lesbian is so because of low self esteem i think that's quite possible i give you a couple of examples if somebody has been sexually abused by a man during childhood he or she is more likely to show homosexual behavior an abused girl is likely to develop hatred or disgust toward men while an abused boy has an early sexual experience with a man and that definitely affects his mind set and senses if a girl is masculine or for some reason is more attractive to lesbian woman than to men she's more likely to try being with a woman isn't this obvious not being attractive to men causes low self esteem and having homosexual women around adds to the temptation one may think why not being with someone who can appreciate my beauty and so on the same for a girly boy not that my word has any scientific basis but i've seen more than a few examples and i try to use my mind Transsexuality Pedophilia Homosexuality Human sexual behavior Homophobia Sexual orientation Gay Bisexuality Gender role Biology and sexual orientation Lesbian Reparative therapy Homosexuality and Judaism Homosexuality and Christianity Yuri (animation) Societal attitudes towards homosexuality Child sexuality Effeminacy Gay rights Theory of conduct Infantilism Religion Homosexuality and transgender Gay slang Friends Homosexuality in China Aesthetic Realism Pederasty Transgender Serial killer Childlove movement Social rule LGBT Rape Domestic violence Homosexuality and Islam Strap-on dildo Anglican views of homosexuality Religion and sexuality Paragraph 175 Philosophy of language Homosexuality in Japan Sex education Cross-dressing Incest Sigmund Freud Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sex and the City Friendship Feminism Germaine Greer Butch and femme History of sex Same-sex marriage Falsifiability Age of consent Gay rights timeline Physical attractiveness Heterosexuality Joke Girl Choice and sexual orientation Coming out Transvestism Married... with Children North American Man/Boy Love Association Marriage Epistemology Anal sex Sexual revolution Oral sex Pornographic movie Atheism Adoption The nature of God in Western theology Baldness Sex in science fiction Alignment (role-playing games) Laura Schlessinger Rosie O'Donnell South Park Sexual intercourse Sadism and masochism Pornography Homosexuality and medical science Gender
