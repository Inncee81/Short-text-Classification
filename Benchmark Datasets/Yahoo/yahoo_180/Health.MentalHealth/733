how can i stop being negitive defensive and insecure please help me with this well you realize your shortcomings which is a big first step have exercises in your mind to turn around your thinking such as whenever you catch yourself thinking a negative thought think of a positive one to counter it if it's about a person think of something good about that individual when you hear yourself being defensive step back think about it b f you spout out excuses and formulate a more logical trail of thought if the only thing coming to mind are defenses don't say anything just listen to the person they may not be attacking you as you think it may not sound effective but i did this and i find myself naturally thinking more positively anymore i had the same issues and didn't want to be that way either i still have negative thoughts sure but i almost immediately come up w a more positive thing to say or a better way to look at things also the people you're hanging out w is huge if you have friends who are just as negative and down as you feel you'll never go anywhere try to associate w more positive people and limit the time you spend w people who just bring you down w them even if it's family Shaggy dog story Psychoanalysis The nature of God in Western theology Sigmund Freud Utilitarianism Time Out of Mind Jon Secada Theodicy Philosophy of language Friedrich Schleiermacher Scientology beliefs and practices Summa Theologiae Goodness and value theory Karen Horney Mind control Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Chess strategy and tactics Stuttering Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Characters in the Smurfs Social rule Theory of conduct Slow Train Coming Nicomachean Ethics K' Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Intelligent design Tai Chi Chuan Predestination Traumatic incident reduction Operation Market Garden Franz Boas Logic Columbine High School massacre Arthur Schopenhauer Scientific method Ethics Ranma __ characters A Course In Miracles John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Marching band Transactional analysis Socrates Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Atheism Past teachings of Prem Rawat One Tree Hill (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Coercion Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alcoholics Anonymous Ontological argument Jiddu Krishnamurti Elvis and Me Hiberno-English Schizophrenia Homophobia Critique of Pure Reason Cyberspace Intelligent design movement Aristotle Magical thinking Determinism Knots Landing Blood on the Tracks Spice Girls Kodocha Blonde on Blonde The Invisibles Civil rights Victor Cousin Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Cheating in Counter-Strike StarCraft: Uprising Religious Society of Friends School of Salamanca W.I.T.C.H.
