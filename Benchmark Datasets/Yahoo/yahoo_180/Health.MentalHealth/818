could this be ocd i have several weird habits that i never thought about i was reading an article about eating disorders self mutilation and ocd and how you can have more then one at the same time i'm anorexic and a self mutilator so when i'm driving in the car with someone i'll breath in when we go past drive ways and breath out when we go past grass also i refuse to do anything six times i do it seven times it's illogical but i feel like i'm opening myself up to something evil if i land on six i can't only do it one or two times though i've tried i get a bad feeling if i knock on something i do it seven times i also do patterns with my breathing when i'm just sitting there or doing anything the same with swallowing i find all these things very strange but i never really though about them could i be ocd and if so what do i do about it or am i just overreacting do you mean doctor doctor or therapist i'm my mother doesn't believe i have any problems and won't help me at all with any of it i can't really do a whole lot and i don't want to be commited or anything i know it's to help with my mental pain no one knows i can't talk to anyone because i don't have close friends i don't like letting people close i can talk online and say it because no one knows me i went to a therapist once and i lied about everything because i didn't trust him my father died in and my whole life everyone's ignored eachothers problems and swept it under the rug and has pretended that it's not there i can't talk to anyone and i can't get help because i can't talk to anyone yea this sounds like ocd it would probably take a professional to determine finally if you are and to come to an actual diagnosis there are also groups of average people that come together and help each other through ocd just punch in ocd in yahoo search to find out more i've heard of cases where ocd can be falsely induced one place where i worked there were people that were kinda cruel they would constantly call me for no reason i ended up being in the habit of going to where they were or looking up and it was for no reason at all i never thought this kind of thing would happen to me after these crappy people left it actually took me a while to get out the habit of going to check on people can you believe that i actually thought i was ocd because i always had to double check things and i only did that once after that i would just tell myself that i double checked it and i just needed to have faith that i checked it and for some reason that worked but then someone showed me what real ocd was and i was like wow if you can break your habits and live habit free you may not be ocd just think of all the time you'll be saving by not repeating things all the time maybe that and other advice might help you out but i think that requires testing to determine ocd or not you also have to go back and try to remember the earliest times you started these habits then you can try and make a new path in life for yourself by remembering when it started and then making a healthier way of life for yourself for now you don't have to talk to any doctor or anybody you do not trust just keep doing what you're doing asking for help anonymously online you can get a lot of information that way and maybe some of it will help read up on the subject too maybe you'll find a way yourself and even help others but if none of all this helps try to get professional help from people who see this all the time nurses and other people who have dealt with or who have ocd you'll find the solution that others have also found isn't as bad as you imagine in any case either way good luck i hope you're able to help yourself and find help through this Obsessive-compulsive disorder Milton H.
