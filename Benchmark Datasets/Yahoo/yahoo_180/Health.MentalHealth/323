is there a psychologist specialized in healing urges like the need of meeting people and questioning my friend has this urge to meet girls and question them about their childhood or other personal details from their past he really has this urge and from time to time he has to meet up with different women to talk about that but those girls don't know why he meets up with them they might think he is interested in them but after or meetings he doesn't want to meet the same person any more please if there is someone there able to tell me what to do to heal him of this urge i'd really appreciate that thank you it sounds to me like your friend may have his own issues from childhood that he needs to deal with meeting these girls two to three times questioning them about intimate details and then not seeing them anymore may indicate a fear of intimacy he may be hoping that someone will share with him some of his own issues the best thing you can do for your friend is be supportive you might suggest that he go to a therapist but prepare for him to be defensive if some of your other friends are noticing the same behaviours you might want to work together to get him help Human sexual behavior Transsexuality Reparative therapy Sigmund Freud Transactional analysis Dissociative identity disorder Ex-gay Child sexuality Milton H.
