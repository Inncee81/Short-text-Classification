i am a 'little' overstressed any ideas how i can really relax i feel i have a problem in relax and enjoy things even talking to my friends laughing and joking i cannot fully enjoy it always think of feeling tired think about my work hi its probally you have just over done things in the past like to much work relationship problems or family problems there are so many things that can stress you out that you just feel exhausted in the end maybe if you have time and money go on a short trip somewhere nice maybe even alone to find yourself again a spa holiday would be the best otherwise what i do as a single working mum i go for a hot bath and use all the spa products i can find make myself order myself a meal and just kick back and try to relax maybe talking to a good friend about this and plan something you really enjoy and go and do that but if you always feel very tired and your sure its not your lifestyle then id suggest you go and see a doctor to to be on the safe side and see its not something else good luck ps dont take life to hard its to short to fuss with stressful things in life its here to enjoy Avenue Q About a Boy Social rule Charles Darwin's illness Mid-levels Scenes from a Memory EastEnders Stomach cancer Shaggy dog story Singlish Sauna Ludwig Wittgenstein Little Britain Chronic fatigue syndrome Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sant Thakar Singh Pitaten Friends Psoriasis The Ashlee Simpson Show Futurama (TV series - season 2) Professional wrestling slang Insomnia Sento Sharon Tate 2000 Australian Grand Prix Theory of conduct Sigmund Freud Prostate cancer Development of Darwin's theory The Contender (television series) Piccolo Junior Saga Reflexology Infantilism Love Hina main characters Great Teacher Onizuka __douard Manet Shit Out-of-body experience George Costanza Earth Girl Arjuna Tai Chi Chuan Minor characters in Morrowind Kodocha Mojave people The Amazing Race Transactional analysis Jennifer Lopez Parachuting Oasis (band) Fecal incontinence Drag racing Therion (band) Care Bears Aikido Breastfeeding The O.C.
