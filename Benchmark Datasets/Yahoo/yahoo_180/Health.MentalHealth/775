how do you tell someone that you have panic attacks i need to tell my parents so that i can get help in preventing them and whatnot but i know they'll make fun of me so what is a foolproof way of telling them that it's not something i take lightly and i'm being serious okay well first off is there something that is keeping you from telling them like are you doing drugs or have you recently done something or changed something in your life that's keeping you from telling them more so what's making you anxious and paranoid i ask these questions because i went through the same problem i'm i'm well over that phase but i went through it too the best thing i can recommend is for you to just be straight out with your parents they aren't going to reject you and throw you out onto the streets if they do those are not ideal or understanding parents they should be there for you and understand or atleast try to understand what it is you're going through it's tough man let me tell you panic attacks and anxiety are no walk in the park it takes time and patience above all a positive mind to over come this i hope i was of some assistance Anxiety Panic attack Clinical depression Humphrey Bogart Avenue Q Karen Horney Transsexuality About a Boy Ex-gay Anorexia nervosa Social rule Theory of conduct Hypertension VHF omnidirectional range Datalore (TNG episode) Sinfest Coming of Age (TNG episode) Existentialism Diving Dog training Prostate cancer Narcissism Meaning of life The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Infantilism The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Meditation Borderline personality disorder Justification (theology) Avoidant personality disorder Dynamical system Columbine High School massacre Urinary incontinence Education Franz Boas Sigmund Freud Linux kernel Obsessive-compulsive disorder Chucky Pancamo Human sexual behavior Psychoanalysis Mao (game) Critique of Pure Reason Volleyball Vernon Schillinger Knife Socrates Jam (TV series) Kasparov versus The World Frank Furedi The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder Joke Paranoia Agent Obi-Wan Kenobi Escape from New York Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Battle of the Bulge Extreme Programming Milton H.
