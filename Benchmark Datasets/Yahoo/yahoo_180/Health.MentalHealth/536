i'm very scared i was down town and walking to my friends moms shop i glanced at this guy and he was like what are you looking at and i said nothing and then he was like if you ever look at me like that again i'll beat you upside the head and call the police i was alone and i'm only i'm scared that next time i go downtown i'm going to see him do you think if i do and if i'm with a friend friends he wont bother me i also get scared that i'm going to see him at night cause at night i get freaked out so easily i get so jumpy just going down the stairs in the dark what should i do i've already told my parents that man has some issues to work out your young he won't do anything to you if you had friends by your side there is absolutely nothing he can do to harm you so your safe with friends secondly you won't get arrested for looking at someone if that's true everyone would be in jail by now lol one thing you should never do is talk back and say what are you looking at keep yourself stable just talk to your friends as you walk by and you'll be safe i don't even know what a young girl would be walking in the night with no adults around anyways and lastly if you have a bike that would be pretty useful i mean who would run after a kid on a bike that's stupid unless they are really desperate so you can bike there without trouble stay safe don't get hurt Sin City The Inside Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Silent Night, Deadly Night The Fairly OddParents Rod Stewart Aerial (dance move) Eric Cartman Kyle Broflovski Shaggy dog story Wyatt Earp Avenue Q The Human Stain About a Boy W.I.T.C.H.
