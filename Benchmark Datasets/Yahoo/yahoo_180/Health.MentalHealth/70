finding peace with theology okay i'm going to post this in both the mental health section and the religion and spirituality section since i don't really know which it belongs in i've always been obsessed with theology i started becoming completely taken in by it when i was about and was amazed by the different belief systems and religions of the world i hopped from church to church and from religion to religion on the one hand wanting to 'settle down' into the 'true religion' and on the other hand just wanting to learn and see as much as possible i've just turned and it's starting to seem like a burden the problem isn't just 'finding the right religion' although undoubtedly that's a part of it but rather an unceasing power it has over my life even my dreams are religious my whole life it's been an almost schizophrenic thought pattern and i never seem to be able to escape thinking about it it's not necessarily a bad thing it's just who i am and i've learned a lot but i can't switch off and it's exhausting even though i can see the world around me it seems to have almost lost it's value worldly things stop mattering when all you can think about is what's beyond that what should i do you are a mystic in the making that's a beautiful thing but i can tell you that the world will never understand it you probably will get people telling you that you are crazy but i hope that you will not succumb to those doubt thoughts your mind is opening wide it may be a while before you can understand it theology ideas and thoughts will never bring you peace of mind although they can help light your path for a while i don't know if you ever read krishnamurti's works but you might take a look at his books he was all done with religion and theology but was one of the most amazing spiritual philosophical thinkers ever okay so that's my opinion but it sounds like you are ready for that and you'd probably appreciate it most can't just keep asking questions the first part of it is the hardest part because you start to figure out that everything you thought you knew about yourself and the world gets turned upside down but it will be okay don't fight your calling my friend follow it Jiddu Krishnamurti A Course In Miracles The nature of God in Western theology Socrates Religious Society of Friends Theology Friedrich Schleiermacher John Wycliffe Meaning of life Religious pluralism Max Weber Scientology beliefs and practices Discordianism Simone Weil Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Reality Jewish philosophy Jon Secada Alcoholics Anonymous Ontological argument Theory of conduct Past teachings of Prem Rawat Gospel of Thomas Human Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Summa Theologiae Predestination Rudolf Hermann Lotze Supernatural Causality Prayer Emanuel Swedenborg Theodicy Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Epistemology Philosophy of language Confucius Philipp Melanchthon Sant Mat Justification (theology) Anthroposophy George Fox Atheism Opus Dei Ludwig Wittgenstein Francis Crick Satanism John Howard Yoder Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Philosophical skepticism Meme Al-Ghazali Human nature Metaphysics God Christianity Free will Calvinism Belief Taoism Milton H.
