do you think my little cousin is mental i think my little cousin is sort of mental she's seven years old every morning she always acts weird she suddenly cries for no apparent reason she says mom mom mom when she already knows that her mom isn't at home she smiles creepily for no reason and then she does other stupid stuff that only mental people would do and then in the afternoon evening and night she acts all normal again i believe there's something seriously wrong with her also she always do move stuff in her room around for some weird reason she is having a hard time with separating from her mom she is scared too and fearful little kids do weird stuff sometimes which is perfectly normal if she is in a new environment this could explain why she acts a little off try not to judge her though she is coping the best way that she can Kim Possible Intelligence quotient Avenue Q Treehouse of Horror V "Weird Al" Yankovic The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Sin City Kimi Finster Little Big Mom Insomnia The Marshall Mathers LP Bonus Stage Ron and Fez Futurama (TV series - season 5) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Springfield Elementary School Coming of Age (TNG episode) Psychiatric hospital Teacher's Pet (Disney) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Kodocha The dozens Victor Cousin Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Recurring South Park characters Blackadder KaBlam!
