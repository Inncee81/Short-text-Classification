why do we have so many bipolar people these days it seems like one out of people are bipolar when i grew up in the 's i never knew anyone with the illness i mean these people today are really sick they're not making this up they scream and talk nonstop jump up and down think they have super powers over others etc it seems like when the 's came along bipolarism was born does anyone know what caused this your thoughts are appreciated i'm a little appauled that you got so many ignorant answers in the s bipolar was called manic depression it was treated with lithium and a few first generation anti psychotics not much of a med selection it is still treated with lithium i am on it and i love it we now have other mood stabilizers so nearly all can find something that really does work back in the s people didn't talk about mental illness we also had those big mental institutions to warehouse us crazies in the s manic depression was renamed bipolar why good question bipolar doesn't describe it there are no poles and you can be both manic and depressed at the same time today science and psychiatry recognize that what once was thought of as a type of untreatable depression is actually a form of bipolar and it responds to bipolar meds that adds a little to the number approximately of the population is bipolar that stat has remained fairly constant the illness has a strong hereditary link and you have to have the right gene make up to ever get it so population explosion might explain some of what you are seeing but it's not a contagious outbreak lol btw regular life adult stress isn't gonna trigger bp something seriously stressful in childhood is what probably does it perhaps increasing divorce rates play a little into setting it off who knows here's another stat the average length of time to be properly diagnosed is years for those with bipolar type ii that's a lot of hell to go thru and it's partly why pdocs are making the diagnosis sooner even if they temporarily over diagnose better than having your patient commit suicide if you know what i mean last because there is greater acceptance of mental illness in society bipolar children are being diagnosed bipolar earlier past trend was to stick with the adhd or problem child label much longer and the suicide rate is it's a serious illness actually it is a neurological brain disease it is not something that can be fixed with talk therapy Psychiatry Autism Borderline personality disorder Controversies in autism Antipsychotic Pneumonia Medicine Mania Chronic fatigue syndrome Multiple sclerosis Cancer Post-traumatic stress disorder Lamotrigine Antidepressant Transsexuality Electroconvulsive therapy Asperger syndrome Homeopathy Anti-psychiatry Chemical imbalance theory Migraine Psychiatric hospital DSM-IV Codes Mixed state (psychology) Hypoglycemia Prostate cancer Epilepsy Autism epidemic Divorce Depression (mood) Neurology Asthma Herpes simplex virus Combat stress reaction Coeliac disease Psychoanalysis Haloperidol Suicide Fibromyalgia Psoriasis Narcissism Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Sexual orientation Cannabis (drug) Alzheimer's disease Mental health Schizoaffective disorder Traumatic brain injury Motor neurone disease Alcoholism Involuntary commitment Sigmund Freud Maprotiline Anorexia nervosa Urinary incontinence Obsessive-compulsive disorder Abortion Growth hormone treatment Dissociative identity disorder Psychotherapy Alternative medicine Primidone Autism rights movement Lithium salt Stuttering Obesity Stomach cancer Cephalic disorder Mental retardation Intelligence quotient Hypnosis Stroke Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Infantilism Postpartum depression Leukemia Cerebral palsy John Cade Procrastination Emil Kraepelin Virus Drug addiction Unemployment AIDS reappraisal Tobacco smoking Sickle-cell disease Multiple chemical sensitivity Grief Lesch-Nyhan syndrome
