teen depression how to solve it without adults how do you overcome depression when you're a teen without going to an adult for help i know it's best to go to an adult for these kinds of things but that would ruin my friend's life even more she doesn't see an end to it and feels that the only reason she's still alive is because it'd hurt others too much she doesn't want to do anything fun she feels like just sitting in her room by herself it's hard to explain but the way i can is that she can feel the sadness sinking in her taking over her life what can we do how can i help her get through this so i can see her happy again i'm thinking of research what exactly should i look for thanks in advance for any suggestions and answers she's already had therapy her parents use to take her but after a while they gave up and nothing terrible or horrible or drastic has happened in her life the good news is it will pass in time around it really started lifting for me try to get her to go outside and enjoy herself hang out with friends go to parties etc any physical activity usually helps excercising is a big one or if she doesn't want to leave her room bring things to her video games get take out and watch a lot of movies just any activity besides sitting alone in the dark if she writes try to hint that she write out all the thoughts before she goes to bed each night they'll regroup but the more she does it the less intense it will get i think all forms of medication if you're under need to be through your parents so that might be a last resort bottom line is to keep the activity and physical focus up and the emotions out either written if she wants it private or talking about it and it will pass as the teen years progress much like acne does Pitaten Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story About a Boy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Prostate cancer Transactional analysis Social rule The Lovely Bones Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Infantilism Borderline personality disorder The Fairly OddParents Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Milton H.
