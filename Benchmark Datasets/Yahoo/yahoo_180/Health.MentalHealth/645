am i a bad person i worry if an action i take could cause a horrible reaction like if i call my mom and she happens to be driving i don't want my call to cause her to crash or if i accidently snap at someone i don't want to make them upset and sometimes i accidently do make people upset i worry that people may do something like hurt themselves or someone else because of any action i take or a if i wake my brother up a bit early for school he'll perform worse and fail a test or the class i don't know what to do does doing these things make me a bad person could i worry that anything i do could hurt someone and i don't want that to happen i'm talking small actions like a i mentioned above i'm not saying i do anything extreme like hurt people i just worry if small everyday actions could hurt my loved ones and if im a bad person for thinking this or doing these things brandon for a while when i was younger i too used to think about such things now many years later i have realized that there are things in the universe which control the destiny of every one of us it is true that we must be responsible for not only our acts but also our thoughts as they influence our choices human shoulders were never made to carry the burden of worrying about every thing we do it is obvious that you care a great deal about the others in your life which is a very good thing try thinking only positive thoughts about those you love and quit worrying worry is a destructive emotion and in my experience carries no benefits whatsoever the universe will unfold exactly as it is supposed to try to enjoy your life and the time you spend with your loved ones they will pass from this world at the appointed time whenever that might be make the most of what little time we have here and try not to carry too many deep concerns everything will be ok you will see peace be unto you will Theory of conduct Evil One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule God Emperor of Dune Philosophical skepticism Earth Girl Arjuna John Howard Yoder Jon Secada Social psychology The Fairly OddParents Shaggy dog story Jiddu Krishnamurti Meaning of life Predestination The nature of God in Western theology Karma Meme Avenue Q Abortion debate Milton H.
