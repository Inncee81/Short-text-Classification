i'm scared to sleep i have had nightmares for nearly years now they started a while after i returned from iraq in i know everyone claims ptsd when they have nightmares and bad memories but i don't know if that is what i am suffering from is it normal to have nightmares after seeing things like that or does having the nightmares mean i suffer from ptsd its not always the same sometimes its just sounds or just hazy images and i feel scared or like i know my buddy needs help but i can't get to him and no matter how bad he is hurt or even if i know hes dead i try to get to him but cannot sometimes its specific events and i swear every night i see them its like i see them more vividly then when it actually happened like they burnt into my mind and they just wont leave i had a dream once that i was ambushed and we tried to fend off the attack and right in the middle of the fight everything disappeared and i was in my living room crouched behind the sofa one time i had a dream of a firefight just past an nassiryia in iraq everything was exactly the same until a bus got hit with a tow missile and as i watched the bus explode and burn its was like i knew everyone from my whole life i knew was in there and they were all dying and i had no way of stopping it i couldn't even move to protect them from the hit i've only had this dream once but it woke me up from a dead sleep and i didn't sleep for nearly days i need to know how to make this stop its getting worse and its getting harder to close my eyes at night because i sometimes tremble at the thought of what i might see when i fall asleep i need help what do i do and what does that dream mean your mind is trying to cope with severe emotional trauma you need to talk to someone who is trained to lead you out of this stalled coping state look up your local va hospital for that you've been in combat they will bend over backwards to help and also the vfw post there are a lot of vets who've gone through this and can understand what you are saying without you having to censor yourself being with others who have been through a similar hell and sharing your stories and nightmares and hearing about theirs and how they coped will help more than just about anyhting else by the way thank you for doing what i could not diabetes disqualified me for service Post-traumatic stress disorder Sin City Shaggy dog story Traumatic incident reduction The Shining (film) K' The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Miss Saigon EastEnders Out-of-body experience Blood (computer game) Audie Murphy Lucid dreaming Pitaten StarCraft: Uprising Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
