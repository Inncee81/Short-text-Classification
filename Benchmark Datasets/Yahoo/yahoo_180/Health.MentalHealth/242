does anyone else experience this at night my mind starts racing hundreds of incorherent random thoughts pop into my head and keep me from falling asleep for example i recall one night i was thinking about what to eat tomorrow next i was thinking about eggs and before i knew it i was thinking about why eggs where round and so on these thoughts go on and on and get crazier and crazier i cant sleep because of it does anyone anyone else have the same problem yeah i do this too i find two things most effective one try to get yourself to focus on one thing such as how soft the pillow is or a hobby you enjoy and each time you find yourself wandering just make yourself go back to that one thing two when you realise you have got out of control in your thought trail again try to follow your train of thought backwards to where it started trying to focus your mind and remember what twisted pattern led you to that point seems to calm your mind down and it helps you realise there actually was a logical thought process to get you there good luck The Amber Spyglass Psychoanalysis Dream Hypnosis Soul The Contender (television series) Magical thinking The Time Machine Sigmund Freud Jon Secada Lucid dreaming Socrates Yoga Sutras of Patanjali The Catcher in the Rye Stoicism Philosophical skepticism Beatrice Portinari Social rule The Subtle Knife Consciousness The Ashlee Simpson Show A Course In Miracles About a Boy Leadership Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The nature of God in Western theology Boom Town (Doctor Who) Bad Wolf Insomnia The Fairly OddParents Aristotle The Invisibles Scientology beliefs and practices Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Free will W.
