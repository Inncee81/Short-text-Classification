what is the best way to deal with a drug addict parent i moved into my dad's home last summer as he is in the last stages of emphesema the kicker is he is a drug addict and very difficult to live with what is the best way to tell him his behavior the emotional abuse guilt trips and violent mood swings are making me want to leave him to die alone it is getting to the point where i am ready to let him die by himself i hate that he has got me to this point but i am now getting sick due to his sickness the worst part of all this is that he will die soon within six months yet his drug addict behavior is making me sick i am so mad at him that i pray for his death it makes no sense to me to needlessly suffer and be a miserable prick to those around you i know it's his addiction but it doesn't make it any easier when he's acting like a reall ass kit kat i know i can't change him ive dealt with this my whole life it's a hard decision to make to leave a parent to die alone or stay with them and take the shit probably the toughest decision i've ever had to make so far i can say one thing though if he keeps treating me the way he's been treating me i'll have no problem letting him die alone i put my life on hold to come help him and this is the thanks i get drug addiction is such a wonderful thing lol you are in a very hard place and your dad is obviously suffering too he's biting at the nearest person who he feels safe to do so the question is can you take it without being completely destroyed yourself give yourself the space to think things through if the answer's yes then steel yourself you dont have to accept his behaviour calmly tell him when things are not acceptable and walk away for a while but i suspect he won't change if no then do what is right for you and seek help later you will do the guilt thing at some point try getting some counselling to help you decide Addiction EastEnders Narcissism Divorce Borderline personality disorder Domestic violence Drug abuse Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Procrastination Daredevil Alcoholism Theory of conduct Drug addiction Arguments for and against drug prohibition Transsexuality Alcoholics Anonymous Sigmund Freud Rape Kurt Cobain Social rule Bipolar disorder Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Transactional analysis Adult attention-deficit disorder Friends Anxiety One Tree Hill (TV series) Anorexia nervosa Ethics Bradley Nowell Nicomachean Ethics The Adventures of Pete & Pete Fathers' rights Alignment (role-playing games) Self-harm Stomach cancer Sexual orientation The Marshall Mathers LP Dog training Vernon Schillinger Infantilism T'Pol Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Calvin and Hobbes Illegal drug trade Traumatic brain injury Sexual addiction Abortion debate Health insurance Charles Darwin's illness Mental illness 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Poker jargon Rent (musical) Goodness and value theory Grief Dead Like Me Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Days of our Lives Obsessive-compulsive disorder Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Good Times Babe Ruth The nature of God in Western theology Knots Landing Utilitarianism Reparative therapy Scientology beliefs and practices Everwood Fitz Hugh Ludlow Schizophrenia Coming of Age (TNG episode) Sant Thakar Singh A Course In Miracles Milton H.
