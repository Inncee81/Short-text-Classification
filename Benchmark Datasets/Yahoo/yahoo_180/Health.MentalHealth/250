could she be being abused i am and work at a day camp there is a year old girl who i've never met before who came up to me today and wouldn't leave my side the camp was playing a game and i got pulled under the parachute and when i came out she was crying because she wanted me to stay by her all day she has been telling me that she loves me and that she wished i was her mommy she has even started calling me mommy and i don't even know her she is constantly asking me for a hug too and kissing me over and over she told me that her daddy was looking for a girlfriend which makes me believe that there is some trouble at home because she also said that her parents live together its not that i want to get rid of her i am just worried that maybe she is being abused somehow and that's why she feels the need to be all affectionate to me the other six year olds are cute and cuddly but not this extreme i am wondering if i should tell my supervisor or what i should do thank you it may have been asked a long time ago but not by me this happened today talk to an adult supervisor they should be trained in how to deal with the situation usually an adult in the care of children is mandated to report suspected child abuse authorities will check the details and you would not be responsible for proving that child abuse neglect actually is or did take place for the safety and health of this little girl report this to your supervisor then check to see if the supervisor did anything about it if they don't and the little girl continues this behavior you may have to go to another level of management where you work i know its a lot of responsibility for a year old but it could really make a difference in this little girl's life Child sexuality Infantilism Child abuse Domestic violence Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) About a Boy Social rule Garfield Miss Saigon Good Times Friends Pitaten Milton H.
