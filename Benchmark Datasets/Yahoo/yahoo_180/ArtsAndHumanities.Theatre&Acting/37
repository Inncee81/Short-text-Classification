how are people hypnotized i mean these stage shows where for example people are told to act out silly scenarios are they for real or are these people just playing it up for the audience i for one can't be hypnotized and it really annoyed the hypnotist as i made him look a bit stupid but personally i didn't feel anything not sleepy nothing is it all just a con trick nlp to me is the equivalent of brainwashing so i guess anyone can be brainwashed but i still can't be hypnotized or should that read manipulated it's not a con it's a show same with magic acts it's just good fun of course it's staged there are different kinds of hypnosis performed by psychotherapists but it's not very entertaining to watch Hypnosis Derren Brown Neuro-linguistic programming Magic (illusion) Mind control Abduction Phenomenon John Grinder The Late Show with David Letterman Little Britain Confidence trick Whose Line Is It Anyway?
