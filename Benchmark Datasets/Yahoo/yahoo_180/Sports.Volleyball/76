really bad back pain from volleyball i'm so it's not cuz i'm old the pain started after doing wall sits and starting wall jumps it's mostly in the top half of my back around inbetween my shoulders it gets better after i stop playing but still hurts i can barely finish a set of jumps now and i have to keep my back straight when i'm in my defensive position help me i can't keep playing like this i'll loose my spot on the team it feels better when i hunch my shoulders to my ears as if i was blocking but then i put my shoulders down and it hurts just as much it's not soreness i know soreness this hurts like someone is clubbing my back while i jump it's not a dull sore pain see whether you can find a chinese acupuncturist to help you with some massage at you don't really need acupuncture treatment i was in the same pain in college when i wasn't even able to raise my arms and remove my t shirt but two months' massage once every week treatment got me back to the court and i am still playing like crazy by the way after all those workout the first thing you want to do is go home and take a shower right not a good idea you need to do your cool down and you might want to use a treadmill to warm up before cooling down so that you can get all your muscles back to normal make sure you put on an extra t shirt or long sleeve top to keep your upper body warm whether you are sweating or not hope this helps Volleyball Massage Aerial (dance move) Repetitive strain injury Equine conformation Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling holds 1957 World Series Weight training Diving Swingout Pain Poker jargon Professional wrestling throws Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Professional wrestling attacks Breastfeeding Andr__s Galarraga First aid Backstroke Professional wrestling aerial techniques Satchel Paige Mattress Traditional Chinese medicine Jon Secada Sento Fibromyalgia Childbirth Sauna Mario Pittsburgh Steelers The Shining (film) Angina Textile manufacturing Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Softball New York Giants Doom enemies Shirt Meat Loaf Swimming Breaststroke Powerbomb Suplex Rugby union positions International League Stomach cancer Babe Ruth Social rule Chronic fatigue syndrome 2000 Australian Grand Prix Kodocha Sandy Koufax Eddie Guerrero Glossary of American football Piccolo Junior Saga Urinary incontinence Futurama (TV series - season 5) Rugby union One Tree Hill (TV series) Chiropractic Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Carolina Panthers Cincinnati Bengals Marathon (sport) Exercise Alternative medicine Troy Glaus Norway national football team The Inside Medical acupuncture Neckbreaker Cleveland Browns Sydney Riot of 1879 Yao Ming Milton H.
