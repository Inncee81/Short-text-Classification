volleyball tryouts does anyone find it a little crazy to have tryouts that last hours with two break one fifteen minutes and one minutes this is for three days then we have two a days for the rest of the week i'm not sure where you hail from but in ma the miaa has a limit on how many hours you are allowed to practice for many times i have heard of double sessions where your try outs are morning as well as afternoon with about a hour time window in between but rarely an hour session typically a coach won't get the best out of her prospective players the remaining days of the week if they are overworked the first three but so long as the coach is abiding by the high school ordinances in your region it sounds like something you'll have to suck it up and make it through if you really want to make the team that could be the point of the whole thing those not fully dedicated won't make it through the first three days we all have full confidence you can make it through tryouts and give it your all at the same time as coaches we look for dedication determination and desire as well as natural ability if you are an underclassman your effort will be the coaches best guide to how you will perform and what kind of player you will become in the next years good luck Baseball Volleyball Blonde on Blonde New York Giants Jeopardy!
