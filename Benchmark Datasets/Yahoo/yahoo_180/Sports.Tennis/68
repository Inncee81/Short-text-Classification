when the national anthem is sung while you are playing your game do you stop play this may not belong in the tennis section but it happened to me on the tennis courts this weekend so i can t be to far off while playing in a fun mixer on saturday the national anthem started to be sung at a swimming event less than feet away i could see the flag waving in the light breeze and felt like i should stop play and face the flag what is the proper flag etiquette in this situation well that is just bad timing isn't it anyway i'm not sure what the etiquette is for civilians but on a military installation everything stops when the national anthem is played but then again everyone there knows that the national anthem is played everyday at the close of the duty day since you were kinda caught by surprise my recommendation would be that you continue your game until there is a safe time to stop the game and render the proper courtesy not all americans would even consider the situation and i'm sure you wouldn't want to take a decent backhand to the head again this is just my advice i don't even know if there is a protocol for that type of situation but it is nice to know that some people still respect the flag Badminton Volleyball Table tennis Seishun Academy Middle School Extreme Championship Wrestling Page Falkenberg Paul Levesque Sport Piccolo Junior Saga Xiaolin Showdown Tennis Glen Jacobs Eddie Guerrero Equine conformation Andre Agassi Trish Stratus Atlantic Coast Conference Mark Calaway Sports in Puerto Rico The Prince of Tennis Shen Gong Wu Commonwealth Games The Contender (television series) Kurt Angle Association of Tennis Professionals Boston University Real tennis Aikido Professional wrestling throws Bj__rn Borg Rugby union Playoff Leon White China at the 2004 Summer Olympics Weight training Water polo Professional wrestling slang Single-elimination tournament Recumbent bicycle Professional wrestling Shawn Michaels World Championship Wrestling University of Texas at Arlington Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Jack Charlton John McEnroe 1896 Summer Olympics Tag Second Battle of the Atlantic Pete Sampras Hulk Hogan Yao Ming John Layfield Insulin United States Air Force Academy Physical education Illinois Fighting Illini ELO rating system Chinese Basketball Association National pastime Playoff format Paintball Mike Bucci Gottfried von Cramm Tournament Tenshinhan Jim Ross Ravi Shastri Bundesliga (football) New Zealand at the 2004 Summer Olympics Roger Federer Jimmy Connors May 2005 in sports University of Indianapolis Rod Stewart United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Eugene and William Regal Don Budge Women's National Basketball Association Glencoe High School New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Humerus Baseball Beer Pong Computer and video game genres Sandy Koufax August 2004 in sports Minnesota Golden Gophers Rocky Marciano I, the Jury Bill Goldberg Meat Loaf Sports timeline West Virginia University James E.
