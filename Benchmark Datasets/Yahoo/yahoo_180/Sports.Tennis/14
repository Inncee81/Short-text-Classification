tennis now and years ago all of as know what's going on in tennis these days no need to mention anything but if we look back a few year let's say years everything was so diferent passion combat determination etc those are the words that ruled back than that's what i think i enjoyed watching tennis now i really don't know anymore what do you think on this subject am i the only one who feels this way the problem today is that there are not that many rivalries federer and nadal have been stepping it up in the rivalry department but that is a relatively new thing heating up last year other than that there is nobody that is really challenging them day in day out certanly not federer back in the day you had sampras agassi courier chang becker and edberg any of them on any given day could win a major and many of them challenged each other each time they faced each other those create some exiting rivalries today you just dont have that dynamic so there is less excitement you've got some really good players out there near the top djokovic roddick gasquet murray and some older guys that still can go deep in tournaments hewitt safin blake haas but there are just no good rivalries you know with almost complete certainty that federer against any of these other players will result in a federer win on clay you know that nadal will beat anyone so there is nothing to get excited about there is no mystery involved when you can predict the winner every time same thing in the women's game you had graff seles sanchez viccario novatna and navritilova and some interesting rivalries today with henin sharapova venus serena jankovic and mauresmo you don't really have the week in week out matchups because so few of them ever compete in the same tournaments yes any of those girls can win major tournaments but will they be facing each other in the quarters semis or finals or will they take on some no name like bartoli in the wimbledon final henin serena is an interesting rivalary but how often does it happen not nearly enough serena has been dominating sharapova and venus can beat anyone at any given time or loose to someone ranked th in the world in the second round the williams sisters never play good matches when they play each other and martina hingis is no longer in the same class with the others capriati hasen't played for years clijsters is retired lindsay davenport left but might come back maybe there is just no good ingredients for a solid rivalry in women's tennis which sucks now The Championships, Wimbledon Andy Roddick Rafael Nadal Association of Tennis Professionals June 2004 in sports Bj__rn Borg Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics 2005 US Open Jennifer Capriati Lleyton Hewitt Mary Pierce Gustavo Kuerten Stefan Edberg Boris Becker Tennis strategy Goran Ivani__evi__ Virginia Ruano Pascual June 2005 in sports Playoff Martina Navratilova Tennis Open Era Marat Safin Andrew Murray (tennis player) John McEnroe Am__lie Mauresmo Ai Sugiyama Chris Evert U.S. Open (tennis) Tennis Masters Cup French Open Davis Cup James Blake Ivan Lendl Sania Mirza Billie Jean King Forehand Mats Wilander June 2005 in Britain and Ireland Lottie Dod Tim Henman FA Cup Mark Philippoussis Suzanne Lenglen Norway national football team July 2004 in sports Jimmy Connors Tournament Greg Rusedski Jim Courier World Chess Championship Richard Krajicek Jana Novotn__ ELO rating system Poker jargon Oakland Athletics Gabriela Sabatini Table tennis Ice hockey July 2005 in sports Thomas Muster Garry Kasparov Playoff format Single-elimination tournament Anna Kournikova Sports timeline The Ashes Yevgeny Kafelnikov Arantxa S__nchez Vicario Carlos Moy__ Richard Gasquet Sumo The Contender (television series) One-day cricket Brazil national football team Fernando Gonz__lez Rod Laver Football (soccer) Paul Levesque
