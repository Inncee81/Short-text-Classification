who do you think will win the us open series this year note the question series not the grand slam answer for both the men's and women's please i think its going to be roddick for the men's and sharapova for the women's no question of nadal or federer because they simply dont play enough of the series tournaments roddick is the sole contender on the men's side if anyone is to challenge him that would be either novak djokovic roger federer rafael nadal but for this they wil have to play enough tournaments in the series maybe they want to win the us open and not the us open series i think roddick wants to just concole himself by winning the us open series coz he may never be able to win the us open lol on the women's side sharapova is a hot contender she's sitting on top of standings anna chakvetadze has the biggest threat to her followed by the lefty schnyder and who knows currently th placed sania mirza might just spring a surprise Rafael Nadal Roger Federer Andre Agassi 2005 US Open Andy Roddick Association of Tennis Professionals Maria Sharapova Tennis Open Era Lindsay Davenport June 2005 in sports Kim Clijsters Lleyton Hewitt Tennis Masters Cup Davis Cup French Open Justine Henin-Hardenne U.S. Open (tennis) June 2004 in sports Serena Williams Gustavo Kuerten Steffi Graf Monica Seles Bj__rn Borg Anna Kournikova Nikolay Davydenko Venus Williams The Championships, Wimbledon July 2005 in sports Billie Jean King Martina Hingis John McEnroe James Blake Ivan Ljubi__i__ Forehand Playoff Marat Safin Jimmy Connors Elena Dementieva Eddie Guerrero Plame affair 2005 English cricket season Conchita Mart__nez Norway national football team Tim Henman Rugby union David Nalbandian Chris Benoit Kurt Angle Women's majors Igor Andreev Suzanne Lenglen Professional wrestling match types Mark Calaway Virginia Ruano Pascual Australian Open Anastasia Myskina Greg Norman July 2004 in sports Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics Juan Carlos Ferrero Grand Slam (golf) Jack Nicklaus Fernando Gonz__lez Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics A.J.
