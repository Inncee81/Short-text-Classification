sega is king poor sega its all forgotten about now the sega genesis was once king of consoles and after the dreamcast nobody cared now they're only a software compay who publish their games to every console out there they're even making a game with nintendo they're old rival very pathetic and sad for sega my question is this will sega take one chance just one chance and rise again from the ashes with a new console and fight back as the underdog or they can do nothing continue surviving until sega slowly crashes and burns maybe i was and am still a big sega sonic fan and am happy that at least nintendo are taking an active role in keeping sonic alive and have the good humor to pit sonic against mario yes in the upcoming mario and sonic at the olympic games game for the wii that and i also hope he is playable on ssbb so unless sega can start pumping out a lot of games and get some real revenue flowing to develop a new console i dont think we will see them in the console scene again as many of the rd party developers they had like atari and such from way back in those days have gone into the wider market developing games for all playforms very big sad face who knows maybe one day we may see a sega remembrance console thingo like the atari flashback with all its classic games built into the console Sega Sonic the Hedgehog Computer and video games Video game music Nintendo Revolution Sega Saturn Platform game Nintendo History of computer and video games Computer role-playing game Nintendo GameCube Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis History of video games (16-bit era) Super Nintendo Entertainment System Console emulator Sonic the Hedgehog 2 TurboGrafx 16 Sonic & Knuckles Sega Game Gear Sonic the Hedgehog series Streets of Rage Sega Master System Spider-Man (games) Sega 32X Video game crash of 1983 Sonic Adventure Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Double Dragon History of video games (32-bit / 64-bit era) Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit) Console wars Atari Jaguar Video game console History of video games (Sixth generation era) Atari 2600 Doctor Eggman Ecco the Dolphin Rare (video game company) Dead or Alive (video game) Super Mario 64 FIFA Series Video game publisher Shadow the Hedgehog (video game) King of Fighters Handheld game console Analog stick Stormfront Studios Nintendo DS Bubble Bobble SNK Playmore Amiga Shadow the Hedgehog Intellivision Team 17 Sonic Rush Sega CD Puyo Pop Fever Super Mario 128 Xbox Home computer Virtua Fighter Golden Age of Arcade Games The Legend of Zelda series Bowser Accolade Handheld video game Sonic Adventure 2 Game controller Ren and Stimpy Super Smash Bros.
