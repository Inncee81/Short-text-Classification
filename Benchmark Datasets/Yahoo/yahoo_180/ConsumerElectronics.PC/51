i can't remember the name of this pc game does anyone know where to download it it was a pinball game for the computer and i don't know when it came out but i played it around it had a blue robot in the center and i think it moved while you played pinball does anyone know where i can download it screenshots are much appreciated i remember this game it's called epic pinball pinball's popularity waned with the growth in popularity of the video game video games are a more dynamic medium for play with limitless possibilities pinball is tied to two flippers a ball and a slanted play field as a result it is unlikely pinball will ever regain its glory days of the s when it peaked just because its popularity waned does not make the game less fun it only forced it into a niche in epic attempted to port pinball to the pc at the time dozens of developers had video game adaptations of pinball available but players lamented the poor physics and deck layouts epic pinball was the first video pinball game to successfully imitate real world pinball physics with challenging deck designs and that afforded replayability epic pinball came as shareware where the player could either download for free of purchase for a small fee a portion of the game to try it out before deciding if they wanted to buy the full version the shareware version came with super android the full version offered thirteen tables including super android the best table of all thirteen was super android without question you were tasked with awakening the android by striking key combinations of table buttons and ramps you would activate an arm a led increase its i q and a variety of other tasks accomplished with only the pinball itself unfortunately ultimate android was one of the few great tables that brought the player back for more the tables were all original designs rather than ports of real machines some of the designs were boring such as the deep sea table deep sea had a variety of interesting ramps and buttons to strike but lacked any goal you leveled up simply by obtaining a certain number of points enigma is gimmicky a table that takes advantage of its video game nature to make various strike buttons and ramps appear such as free floating gems you must hit to score points while interesting in concept in practice it became more of an annoyance than a challenge still many of the tables had that rare mix of table design theme and challenge that kept you coming back the excalibur themed table had an excellent design as did cyborggirl and the 's styled magic table the magic table allowed you to perform tricks such as pulling a rabbit out of a hat through the course of key button strikes and ramps while some tables are better than others epic pinball has enough variety and realistic physics to satiate the pinball wizard looking for an hour's distraction without the cost of a full sized machine Computer and video games MAME Baseball Nintendo Entertainment System Pok__mon Bubble Bobble Slot machine Spy Hunter History of computer and video games IBM PC compatible Electronic Arts Defender (game) Poker jargon Commodore 64 Computer and video game genres Super Mario 64 First-person shooter RISC Spider-Man (games) MMORPG Double Dragon Beatmania IIDX Stars!
