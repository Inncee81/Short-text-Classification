i think lakers should give up these players for jermaine this is not espn trade machine since jermaine has expressed his desire to play alongside kobe in la i propose a deal that would send brian cook jordan farmar andrew bynum and either maurice evans or sasha vujacic to indiana in return for o'neal and maybe a draft pick or some money this way indiana gets the center they need a good shooter in cook along with a young pg in jordan farmar and a good off the bench player in maurice evans or sasha vujacic what do you guys think that's a very suitable scenario that has a slight possibility to happen the main thing for the lakers is to hold on to odom while still trying to require jermaine o'neal we'll see what happens in the next couple days Michael Jordan Shaquille O'Neal Craps Yao Ming Basketball Slam Dunk Contest Chick Hearn 1986 NBA Draft Steve Nash NBA Slam Dunk Contest Julius Erving Katelyn Faber NBA Street SLAM Magazine Shooting Nike, Inc.
