who's a better shooter bob mcadoo or dirk nowitzki they have been compared a lot but who is the shooter dirk or bob i'd say nowitzki what do you guys think mcadoo and dirk are different types of players and different type of shooters coming from two different backgrounds i love pure shooters and became a big bob mcadoo fan in the ncaa final fours in when mcadoo was playing for north carolina for only one year as he came out of college early in mcadoo's one college year at north carolina he led north carolina to the ncaa final four of mcadoo averaged during the regular season points per game in his only regular season at north carolina from mcadoo was a ncaa all american in his only year at north carolina mcadoo was a big man who had an unblockable shot using his long arms to bring the ball way behind his head before he shot as only mcadoo could do mcadoo's shooting range was typically from to feet out hitting nothing but net with an unblockable shot and played about half of his career before the nba had the three point shot mcadoo almost typically shot over from the field whild dirk shot right at for the first time in dirk's year nba career in possibly because dirk quit taking three point shots in as dirk only made three pointers in this entire past regular season mcadoo's highest nba fg was significantly higher than dirk's highest which was right at and mcadoo's career nba fg was over with dirk's being dirk's first season shooting at which dirk did in mcadoo was a pure shooter and the first big man to make a career of shooting from long range however mcadoo managed to hit the boards much harder than dirk coming out of college early mcadoo was named nba rookie of the year won one regular season nba mvp award won three consecutive nba scoring championships ppg as his highest scoring average won two nba rings in four nba finals mcadoo's regular season mvp year was when mcadoo averaged ppg averaged rebounds per game far higher than anything dirk has done shot from the field higher than anything dirk has done and blocked shots per game that same year in the playoffs mcadoo's buffalo braves in the playoffs against future hall of famers forward center elvin hayes and center wes unseld and a very deep baltimore bullets team took the baltimore bullets to games in the playoffs where mcadoo averaged in that series which almost upset the heavily favored baltimore bullets while mcadoo averaged points per game and rebounds per game in that buffalo braves baltimore bullets game playoff series agains hall of fame forward center elvin hayes and hall of fame center wes unseld so it cannot be said that forward center bob mcadoo did not face stiff big man competition in hall of famers in their prime in elvin hayes and wes unseld mcadoo's nba career ranged from a young kareem abdul jabbar still in his prime and included several seasons of michael jordan's early years also nba legends of this era included kareem dr j moses malone magic bird and many more all in their primes so it cannot be said that mcadoo played in a different era against less competition unless you say that mj kareem abdul jabbar dr j moses malone magic johnson larry bird elvin hayes etc all in their primes not the ends of their careers were chump change while mcadoo played his year nba career shooting a higher field goal percentage for an entire year career than dirk's highest single season in the nba mcadoo was a pure shooter at north carolina in the nba regular season and in the nba playoffs mcadoo shot over from the field mainly at long range for a nba season career while dirk for the first time barely exceeded from the field in the regular season on very few three point attempts three point attempts this past season while shooting over from the three point line for a tremendous total of dirk scoring a nba low as a nine year starter with three pointers made this past season so in my opinion dirk got right at from the field for the first time in his ten year nba career career by not taking three pointers this past season and moving closer to the basket in the mcadoo range of to feet mcadoo's top ppg average in the regular nba season by season in the nba were ppg ppg ppg ppg ppg and ppg again mcadoo shot over in of his nba seasons compared to dirk's nba season out of nba season mcadoo's top rebounding per game averages were rpg rpg rpg rpg and rpg from to which were the kareem years at kareem's prime and mj's first several years in the nba with dr j moses malone bird and magic playing their prime nba years during this time period as far as rebounding mcadoo even got to play against wilt chamberlain and jerry west's los angeles lakers when chamberlain concentrated almost solely on rebounding mcadoo played taller than his listed height and seemed taller than listed but definitely had a very long wing span you had to see mcadoo shoot and to see mcadoo play to appreciate the difference in mcadoo's shooting and dirk's shooting as mcadoo could get his shot off over anyone in the nba with his long wing span and his great jumping ability where in high school mcadoo set a state high jump record in winning the state high jump title as a high school senior in north carolina bill russell once said about bob mcadoo he's the greatest shooter of all time period forget that bit about the 'greatest shooting big man mcadoo could fill the hole with the rock over anybody no matter how tall they were or how good a defender they were mcadoo's three nba scoring titles nba mvp and nba rings help prove this to some extent but i truly feel that bob mcadoo from the ncaa final fours to his last nba playoff game could score at will which is why bob mcadoo is in the hall of fame not only that but mcadoo was a big time rebounder too i will grant that dirk is one of the better free throw shooters in nba history compared to mcadoo's very respectable year career free throw average as mcadoo's single season career high free throw percentage was during mcadoo's mvp year at as far as a comment that dirk has a lower fg dirk has usually shot around from the point line which will not lower dirk's career or single season fg average that much plus mcadoo played of his years in the nba with the point shot mcadoo knew his limitations and pulled up just inside the point line normally to fire a to footer mcadoo was not a point shooter having played center most of his nba career as far as the comment that mcadoo did not play against competition then the same thing must be said for mj's early years as mcadoo played at the same time in the nba during jordan's early years plural and the prime years of all of the players mentioned above for the person making that comment does that mean mj's early years do not count as mj did not play against competition Los Angeles Clippers Kobe Bryant Indiana Pacers Shaquille O'Neal New York Knicks Los Angeles Lakers NBA Finals Dream Team Houston Rockets Miami Heat
