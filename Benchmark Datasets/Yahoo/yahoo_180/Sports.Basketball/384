can the guy make it more obvious that he wants to be a laker after laying low and mulling a lil about the huge moves idiot turned hero danny ainge has made for his celtics i've considered looking forward to next season without the lakers making any big off season moves and pretty much keeping the same core after i read this report and hearing what jermaine had to say with his own mouth and not what 'sources' claim i'm getting curious about how cupcake can this up one obvious way is getting jermaine and losing odom but knowing kupchak he'll probably throw in odom and crittenton in the trade but at this point im okay with losing the prospect in crittenton if we retain odom and gain o neil cmon mitch do your job for once in your life if theres hope for ainge then theres a glimmer of hope for mitch too get redemption for not getting wade when u traded shaq mitch can mitch make this happen http sportsillustrated cnn com writers arash markazi oneal trade index html mitch cupcake is reluctant to give up andrew bynum i just don't know what they see in this guy in today's nba strictly back to the basket players are not gonna have a whole lot of success dude to the zone defenses look at dwight howard dude is a monster rebounder and shot blocker but he is a strictly post up guy and can't shoot or do anything else so he can do only limited things offensively with all the physical strengths and tools he can work with bynum doesn't have a foot jump shot and neither is he good at runing up and down the floor and scoring in transition he's not amare who can post up and drop the footers strictly back to the basket centers are just not fit for today's nba i dunno why those dumbos in the lakers front office are still holding onto him during last year's trading deadline at midseason the new jersey nets lost nenad kristic in a season ending injury and before mikki moore stepped up they were pretty thin up front they approached the lakers and proposed a deal and they said they're willing to give up kidd for andrew bynum kwame and st round picks i would've done that if i were the lakers instead they didn't and ended up paying for it if we had kidd at the nd half of last year we could've had an odom kobe kidd trio and that would' ve been good enough to make some noise in the western playoffs think about it ronny turiaf plays amare tough and is a rough and tough guy and plays hard he gave amare all sorts of problems last year and we coulud've used him at center for defensive puprposes while lamar kobe and kidd did their thing offensively ahhhh the lakers management sucks big time Utah Jazz NBA Finals National Basketball Association Indiana Pacers Los Angeles Clippers Andrei Kirilenko (athlete) Michael Jordan Los Angeles Lakers Kobe Bryant December 2004 in sports Orlando Magic Dream Team Basketball National Football League 1986 NBA Draft Golden State Warriors Chris Webber Houston Rockets Shaquille O'Neal Karl Malone Larry Bird 2004 NBA Finals Robert Horry January 2005 in sports Rasheed Wallace Toronto Raptors NBA Draft Julius Erving Women's National Basketball Association July 2004 in sports Wilt Chamberlain New York Knicks New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets June 2004 in sports Chick Hearn Salary cap San Antonio Spurs NFL Draft Pat Riley Continental Basketball Association Emanuel Gin__bili Yao Ming November 2004 in sports Moses Malone Alex Rodriguez Scottie Pippen Kareem Abdul-Jabbar The NBA on ABC Phil Jackson Minnesota Timberwolves Wheel of Fortune Denver Nuggets Larry Brown NBA Live series Boston Celtics Philadelphia 76ers Manny Ram__rez New Jersey Nets Sammy Sosa Gary Payton (basketball) Toronto Blue Jays Steve Nash Carolina Panthers 1985 NBA Draft Phoenix Suns Mitch Richmond 2005 NBA Finals International League New Mexico Lobo Basketball Baseball Portland Trail Blazers Gary Sheffield Detroit Pistons Wayne Gretzky Magic Johnson Tennis Glossary of American football Derek Fisher Jerry Sloan 2004-05 NHL lockout Doug Flutie Reggie Miller March 2005 in sports Allan Houston Dallas Mavericks The NBA on NBC October 2004 in sports Mario Lemieux Pittsburgh Pirates Cotton Fitzsimmons Babe Ruth Betting (poker) August 2005 in sports June 2005 in sports Houston Astros Volleyball History of baseball in the United States Jeff Hornacek
