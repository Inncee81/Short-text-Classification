a trade i know will never happen but worth looking at http games espn go com nba features traderesult players teams te cash there seems to be a misconseption that the mavericks are happy about paying terry as much as they do for what he provides he is onttheir long term asnwer at any position and he is at best a streaky shooter yes when he's hot you'd never think of leaving him but when he's not he is a defensive liability who will jack up bad shots the lakers need fresh bodies and a shooter who is streaky is better than a shooter who always misses which is what they have now terry is still a big enough name to be appreciated in la while farmar is unnecessary piece of the lakers puzzle as he is a mediocre shooting guard and now is the third option for point guard the lakers get the fresh blood in nowitzki to get rid of the current regime of kobe who wont win very much as is while not plunging deep into the lottery the lakers cannot ever do that the league wont let them they lose got cut off the mavs wont have any excuses as they free up salary cap space while getting someone with legit playoff success who will do whatever necessary to win dallas is a godo team that would fit kobe's need to be the best player on a championship worthy team why do peopel call jason terry a superstar he used to be the best player on some god awful hawks teams but now he's on a real team and they are overpaying him majorly you all missed the point which was that they would have extra money to go out next season when a ton of top teir talent is available who would you rather have dirk and terry or kobe and gilbert arenas i dont think this would work trading superstar for another doesnt work for me because the teams are pretty much the same position as before just a difference superstar and without dirk dallas has pretty much no frontcourt you cant expect dampier and diop to hold it down without dirk and terry dallas is just kobe and howard which is just a better version of kobe and odom i mean dallas will still be a good team but i dont think they will win a ring with kobe and no dirk Kobe Bryant Kobe New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Karl Malone Los Angeles Lakers College basketball Phil Jackson Shaquille O'Neal LeBron James Allen Iverson Randy Moss Derek Fisher 2004 NBA Finals Michael Jordan Bear Bryant Katelyn Faber Dream Team John Salley Felice and Boudleaux Bryant Joe Namath NBA Finals Shooting guard 2000s Jerry West Football World Cup 2002 Phoenix Suns July 2004 in sports Amare Stoudemire Gary Payton (basketball) Vlade Divac Tracy McGrady Orix Blue Wave New Jersey Nets Slam Dunk Contest New York Giants Tom Leykis Los Angeles Clippers Sam Perkins Vince Carter August 2004 in sports USS Robinson (DD-562) January 2005 in sports Top League Brandy (entertainer) Chuck Cooper Planet of Fire Japan national rugby union team Nicole Richie Japan Rugby Football Union Japanese baseball NBA Slam Dunk Contest Softball 2002 Tour de France ESPN25 J.
