who do u think will get the heat starting job for pointguard next year it is mainly between jason williams and smush parker first of all i do not really consider dwayne wade a point guard but consider this last year he brought the ball up court more often then not especially when the opposition used full court pressure made the first pass to the wing to initiate the offense then moved to the off side wing after receiving the ball on the wing he looked to penetrate passing enough to register over apg which led the team was by far the most effective passer on the team at getting the ball into shaq in the low post is better at that pass than just about any pg in the league and jason williams not even close and smush parker even worse led the team in to by a wide margin largely due to the fact that he attempted the most challenging passes just like one would expect of a point guard maybe if it walks like a duck and quaks like a duck its a point guard i guess at the very least d wade is the best pg og and sf on the team by far well come on what do say about that i at least expect a few thumbs down for this my guess is the job is williams to loose but he is no longer much of scorer and can not be trusted to handle the ball that much any more either is not a very good defender and has lost a step i would give smush a chance at least he can defend and williams disappears to often and for to long as far as smush and scoring he can score that's not his problem it is that he is inattentive as a point guard and would be better as a combo guard where his inattention to detail would not be so costly fair chance that he can redeem himself paired up with wade who will take most of the pressure as he had to do with williams all year late note just trying to be controversial here and generate some debate why if williams has riley's confidence did wade bring the ball up against full court pressure more often than williams if williams is still good enough to play as a full time starting point guard in the nba did wade average apg more that williams in just more mpg and why did wade have to attempt so many challenging passes just to give the offense some semblance of flow what is it that people like so much about williams not that its his fault he played courageously and well for a number of years but has been beat up and abused and just cant be counted on anymore in any way now if you use him when match ups are in his favor thats ok he can still be effective and valuable better began to groom parker at least he plays d for the position or look for someone else maybe even a combo guard as wade really plays a lot of point anyway NBA Finals New York Knicks Steve Nash Los Angeles Clippers Kobe Bryant Allen Iverson Yao Ming Shaquille O'Neal National Basketball Association Larry Bird NBA Draft Utah Jazz Basketball Michael Jordan 2005 NBA Finals Orlando Magic Gary Payton (basketball) January 2005 in sports Chicago Bulls LeBron James Kwame Brown Houston Rockets Phoenix Suns 2004 NBA Finals New Jersey Nets Robert Horry Indiana Pacers Boston Celtics Dream Team Denver Nuggets Jerry West Karl Malone Phil Jackson Lakers-Celtics rivalry New Mexico Lobo Basketball Detroit Pistons New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Magic Johnson NBA Live series 1986 NBA Draft Memphis Grizzlies Chick Hearn Rasheed Wallace Wilt Chamberlain John Salley NBA Slam Dunk Contest Isiah Thomas Tim Duncan Charles Barkley Los Angeles Sparks Dallas Mavericks Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Slam Dunk Contest Reggie Miller College basketball Chris Webber Miami Heat Tayshaun Prince Emanuel Gin__bili Kenyon Martin Minnesota Timberwolves Scottie Pippen Sam Perkins ESPN25 New York Giants Three-point field goal Kyle Broflovski Tyronn Lue December 2004 in sports SBC Center Cliff Robinson (basketball player born 1966) November 2004 in sports The NBA on ABC July 2004 in sports Andrew Dice Clay Bobby Knight Pat Riley Dikembe Mutombo Dennis Rodman Katelyn Faber Continental Basketball Association English cricket team David Robinson (basketball player) Vince Carter Moses Malone National Basketball League June 2004 in sports The NBA on NBC Major League Baseball television contracts Dwyane Wade Buddy Guy David Stern George Mikan Golden State Warriors Georgia Institute of Technology Danny Ainge
