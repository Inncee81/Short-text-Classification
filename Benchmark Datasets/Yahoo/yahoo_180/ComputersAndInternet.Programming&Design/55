flip function in excel i have several columns of data with spacer columns in between specifically financial data from to right now it goes form to from left to right ascending i want to make it so it goes from to from left to right descending does anyone know of a function or a simple macro that would do this if i specify the range of the data will your macro work with merged cells this doesn't have any just wondering this would be a very handy feature and i'm surprised excel doesn't have this feature or i haven't found it in any obvious places there is no function to flip the columns but you can sort the columns in the desired left right order select your columns data sort options button bottom left pick sort left to right ok pick the row to sort by the row that has your years pick descending note that the spacer columns will sort all the way to the right and you will have to re insert them between the years one way around this is to have a sort row let's say row below the years which has the sort order and sort by that instead a b c d e f blank blank blank etc etc now if it were me i would probably just cut and paste the columns to where i wanted them select the column to move edit cut select column that should be after it insert cut cells good luck Quicksort Flat file database Mouse (computing) Winning Streak Selection algorithm Insertion sort Punch card Sorting algorithm Halting problem On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Floppy disk Shell sort Trip distribution Visual Basic Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME HTML element ALGOL 68 Eight queens puzzle Sudoku Relational algebra Common Lisp Binary numeral system Turing machine Beatmania IIDX Array Macro Expert system Sega Saturn Linked list ARexx Join (SQL) Search engine optimization Microsoft Excel Matroid Napier's bones Hash table System/36 Lisp programming language Magic square EIA-708 Emacs Database Polyomino Windows Mobile Monty Hall problem DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX IPod Wario's Woods Danger Hiptop Curling Dance Dance Revolution CPU cache Burrows-Wheeler transform MUMPS Orthogonal matrix Computer virus Unit record equipment Manual transmission Scrabble C preprocessor Quake III Arena Transposition cipher Crossword Domain-specific programming language Autonomic nervous system International Phonetic Alphabet Genetic engineering Cheating in poker DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Determinant OpenOffice.org Hamming code Economics Macro photography WordStar System/34 AmigaOS C programming language Equine conformation Java Database Connectivity Aerial (dance move) HyperCard Mobile phone N-Gage Spreadsheet Red-black tree Copy protection Enterprise Objects Framework Wallpaper group Cell (biology) Billboard Hot 100 Genetic algorithm Strategic management Animal Crossing
