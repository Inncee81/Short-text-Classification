how do i create half page flyers on one sheet of paper i can't figure out how to get the text to write sideways if that makes sense i am using word use the page setup in the file menu to change the page layout from portrait to lanscape that will rotate the page on to its side then go in and use the format menu to create two columns on the page create your flier in the left hand column highlight and copy the whole thing insert a column break from the insert menu this will take you to the right hand column paste everything into the right hand column you will now have two copies of your flier on the page ready to be printed Algorithm Breadth-first search Traveling salesman problem Graph theory Glossary of graph theory Prim's algorithm Graph (mathematics) Greedoid Dynamic programming Compiler optimization SL (complexity) Minimum spanning tree Graph (data structure) Bellman-Ford algorithm A* search algorithm Graph coloring Java virtual machine Kruskal's algorithm Depth-first search Network flow Genetic algorithm Transport Layer Security NP (complexity) Ajax (programming) JavaServer Pages Matroid Apache HTTP Server Red-black tree Directed acyclic graph WebObjects NP-complete Microsoft .NET Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition Integer factorization Associative array Hello world program Routing Ant colony optimization Reference counting Sorting algorithm Search algorithm Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition Web server HyperCard Web crawler Standard Widget Toolkit C plus plus Cross site scripting Planar graph Uniform Resource Locator Kolmogorov complexity Quicksort Static single assignment form Halting problem Randomized algorithm Fibonacci heap In-place algorithm Expert system String (computer science) Binary search Control flow graph Linked list Conway's Game of Life Control flow Integral World Wide Web Freenet Elliptic curve Eulerian path Compiler Mozilla Firefox Hazy Sighted Link State Routing Protocol UTF-8 Binary tree Computer program Recursion Python programming language Simplified molecular input line entry specification Eight queens puzzle Immutable object Signed graph String searching algorithm Thread (computer science) Disjoint-set data structure Java platform Chemical database Link-state routing protocol Pointer Web traffic Library (computer science) Scheme programming language Graph isomorphism problem Heuristic (computer science) SHA hash functions Bayesian network Inheritance (computer science)
