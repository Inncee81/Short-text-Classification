what is the best tool to create an easy and effective database sometimes i need a software or database to collect data and store it but i want my own database which i can put what i want into it i want it has easy interface and work locally and or remotely through a server or whatever i am not a possessional one in programming but i have the willing to learn so please advise me by the best tool i should learn and use to create my own database i use mysql for the database and phpmyadmin for the user interface both are free and both are excellent and phpmyadmin makes the bundle easy to use although the first time phpmyadmin configuration is occasionally mystifying for anything beyond 'normal' later if you want to write java c php etc code to access the database that is also possible MySQL PHP Linux Java programming language WebObjects OpenOffice.org Visual Basic Microsoft Access Computer software Windows 2000 PhpMyAdmin Object-SQL mapping Managed learning environment Ajax (programming) LAMP (software bundle) Web application Object-oriented programming Library (computer science) Web hosting Windows XP JADE programming language Software testing Python programming language Common Unix Printing System Open Database Connectivity Plan 9 (operating system) ITunes Lotus Notes Macromedia Flash MDAC Database management system GNU General Public License BitTorrent Btrieve SAS System Domain Name System CPU design Microsoft AmigaOS Tcl Enterprise JavaBeans Mozilla Firefox TikiWiki Database Objective-C Microsoft Office C plus plus Free software Commodore 64 Microsoft .NET Secure Shell Mac OS X IBM PC compatible Wikipedia Common Lisp JavaServer Pages Windows registry X Window System Scripting language Component Object Model Whois Flat file database Oracle Corporation Oracle database Embedded system Enterprise Objects Framework Microsoft Excel CORBA Web crawler Class (computer science) HP-UX The Internet Movie Database Informix Burroughs B5000 Xcode AS/400 Computer ZX Spectrum Enterprise content management Windows Vista Distributed computing Linux distribution Eclipse (computing) Password WikkaWiki BIOS Programming language Mach kernel Cocoa (API) Thread (computer science) Web design Blender (software)
