what is the best site to learn c with no prior experience in programming i am very new to the whole programming game i bought a book not to long ago called c without fear but i am having a hard time reading what this guy writes half the time i have also been to teach yourself c in days but again this website assumes too much knowledge in programming in my opinion is there a free website that offers a tutorial to fluently or at least close to that learn c perhaps you guys are misinterpreting which question i am asking i am not asking which language i should learn i am asking a good tutorial solely and only for c i understand that c is the predecessor of c but i am not asking how to learn c am i i asked for a turorial on c http www cplusplus com and http cprogramming com are probably your two best sites to get standard tutorials you'll also want to keep track of http www parashift com c faq lite and c faq com it's offline at the moment but you can get mirrors at anytime by googling for c faq other sites are usually suspect this includes the days site most resources on c are either incorrect in various ways or are obsolete cboard cprogramming com as well as the devshed c forum and daniweb c forums have some very knowledgeable professionals to help out and you should rely on them to correct mistakes initially their help can make a significant difference in how easily and painlessly you learn with c however the real way to learn it is to get books you can get an idea of how it works through online tutorials and you probably will want to start out with online tutorials but if you are serious about learning it you absolutely must get a number of recognized and important books for c there's a lot and i mean a lot of old incorrect or otherwise terrible c books most of them aimed at beginners the two books i recommend and the books authors are recognized in the c world are c primer th edition by lippman and accelerated c by koenig other recognized books are too advanced you may find both books to be just a bit too fast paced and assuming too much though they really don't but you might find it so apparently you can do it http www amazon com you can beginners introduction programming dp is also a good book i haven't seen it myself but the author is definitely a recognized expert and you can actually get his help sometimes on comp lang c and similar usenet groups might be worth getting his book $ale of the Century Instant messaging Tic-Tac-Dough Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Gmail Goodness and value theory Spam (electronic) AOL Instant Messenger The Apprentice 2 Google Internet Relay Chat Social rule SmartAsk Wheel of Fortune Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
