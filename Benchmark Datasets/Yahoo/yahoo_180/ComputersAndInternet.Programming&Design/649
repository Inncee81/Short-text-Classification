vb net regex code to be able to find the string between h and h tags and write over it what i am trying to do is figure out the regex code needed to find the text between h and h tags so that i can extract it and write over it so what i think would happen is that i would find the h tag which could also be h aparently and then extract that text just in case i need it later and then be able to put text after this tag from a variable and have it be input before the h tag which could also be h or h even any idea of the regex code as well as the class needed to do this in vb net here is what i have dim alltext as string filereader readtoend dim holdtext as match dim theregexpattern as string h s dim aregex as new regex theregexpattern holdtext aregex match alltext i unfortunatly can not get anything bigger than the h tag i want to get the text between the two tags and replace it notice i have a in the regex but it is not picking up any of the characters between the two tags thanks i have been trying to figure out how to get the text between the tags and so i tried but that doesn't even work for the text after the first tag i realize i don't have the second tag's regex in the code i have been trying to do it step by step but i can't even get a h hello world found i keep getting an string when i try and add the furthermore once i can do this perhaps i am even going in the wrong direction as i just want to replace what is in between the tags with stuff that i have from a string variable i have been doing much research on regex but am still not sure how to do this that is to just replace the text in between the two tags any ideas especially examples in this case as i just seem to be doing something wrong any help is much appreciated thanks brian well i hope in vb net there is the equivalent of mid or mid in all versions of basic and excel and othe spreadsheets mid typically takes a beginning character postion and a number of characters like mid str beg num if the count is left off most return from the beg char to the end otherwise you have to fudge using the len of str so to find the beginning for mid you need something like instr which looks like c instr str str where c is the first position of str in str like if instr abcde cd you would get instr usually has an optional start search position like c first str str to save using mid one nice difference is that instr keeps the character count so if c instr abcdeab ab it returns the absolute location in the string not the relative position in your case what you want to do in my opinion is to clean the source to get rid of h etc so you are dealing with h then you would do something like this c instr source h ' gets the location of beginning if c then c instr source h if c and c c then holdstr mid source c c c ' pull out text between parts adding length of h to c and subtracting to get length allowing for length of h source mid source c newtext mid source c ' or mid source c len source c ' put new text between ends of old text in source else flag notfound endif ASP.NET Ajax (programming) PHP Web server HTML Server-side scripting HyperText Transfer Protocol Application service provider Microsoft .NET Website Uniform Resource Locator SharpDevelop World Wide Web Digest access authentication Unicode and HTML Web design Web application Character encodings in HTML Visual Basic .NET Mono development platform Visual Basic Mozilla Firefox Macromedia Dreamweaver Wget JADE programming language Mozilla Application Suite Wiki Windows Server 2003 Captcha GameFAQs Internet Spaghetti code Java Servlet BASIC programming language JavaServer Pages Domain name JScript .NET Web page Nemerle Goto (command) HTML element Cross site scripting Mod python Hello world program HTTP cookie Quake III Arena Uniform Resource Identifier Web browser Macromedia C Sharp Domain Name System Streaming media Jabber Morning Musume Apache HTTP Server Netscape Navigator Visual Studio .NET Quotation mark ColdFusion Phishing HP BASIC for OpenVMS ASCII art Transclusion Blue Cheer Massimo Ellul Web hosting Kuzari Fictional websites in Doctor Who MIME Control flow User agent Textile (markup language) Simple Mail Transfer Protocol F Sharp programming language Cascading Style Sheets Object-oriented programming 400 (number) MSN Messenger Volleyball Serpent Society Slash (punctuation) Antidepressant Remote procedure call Wireless Application Protocol Web analytics ADO Federal Standard 1037C Virtual hosting Nokia Lotus Notes Callback (computer science) Application server Gopher protocol Gmail Nicomachean Ethics Web traffic TOC protocol MPEG-4 Representational State Transfer BZFlag
