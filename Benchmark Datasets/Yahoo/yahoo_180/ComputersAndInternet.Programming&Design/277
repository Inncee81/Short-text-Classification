domain redirection question i just got off the phone with my website provider globat and am a little confused let me explain i've been hosting a website for about years now i have a domain name registered which directs traffic to my main site which is a family oriented site i have a section on my site that deals with medical information over the years this section has grown and grown and now is what brings my website most of it's traffic so i want to make it very easy to find this section on my site and decided to register an additional domain name that points directly to that section for example by typing www abc com just an example not really the site name brings you to www mysite com index html i want the new domain name to do this by typing www com which is an example of the newly registered domain name brings you to www mysite com medrecs index html and not www mysite com index html can this be done globat cust service says it can't help this seems simple insomniavisions thanks but i understand that the issue is global is saying that they cannot point the new domain name to a sub section of my website the new domain name can only point to www example com index html it cannot point to www example com subfolder index html i don't understand why this isn't possible how can i do this it can't because domains point to machines and not resources such as web pages what you could do however is simply register a domain name point it to your site and depending on the server platform iis apache etc have the site automatically redirect traffic to a subsection when the url is encountered e g www abc com is your main site www abc com forum index html is where you want things to go is www myforum com is what you register to point to that section of your main site you modify the http server to redirest all traffic pointing to www myforum com to www abc com forum index html you could also do this by modifying your home page if it's php or asp net it's straightforward more info is needed about what you're hosting under updated the reason they can point the http www root com somepage html is that when you go to a domain the web server can be configured to automatically know the default document for that path when you go one more directory however you are using domain resource it can be done using redirects from the home page itself all web enabled technologies can look at what the url is that the user arrived on and act on it for example in asp you can look at the request servervariables server name this also works on php etc if you detect this on the home page you code put into code behind logic to do a response redirect to the other url if you can't code behind the page and can only put html in i can give you a code snippet to achieve your intended outcome using javascript tell me what you have i will try to help you out updated yet again put this javascript with your configuration in your head section of the default page of your website script language javascript type text javascript test to see if i am at the new url make sure to include the default document that appears when you go to your main site url if window location href 'http www someurl com document htm' if not redirect to the main site and sub directory window location 'http www anotherurl com somefolder somepage html' script HTML element HTML Cross site scripting Hyperlink World Wide Web Web page Search engine optimization Website Markup language XHTML HTML editor Opera (web browser) Macromedia Flash Gmail Uniform Resource Locator Stopping e-mail abuse Wget JPEG Portable Document Format File format Favicon E-mail spam Wiki Web design Spam (electronic) Uniform Resource Identifier Emacs Ajax (programming) Cascading Style Sheets Representational State Transfer Web browser History of the Internet Visual Basic JavaServer Pages Windows XP AOL Instant Messenger Domain Name System PHP Neopets Ebook XML TikiWiki SAML Prank flash Unicode WebObjects Web traffic Dynamic HTML HTML scripting Mouse (computing) Everything2 Kazaa Google bomb Goatse.cx Internet Explorer Quotation mark Logo programming language Phishing HTTP cookie GameFAQs LiveJournal KDE Filename extension Public domain B3ta Google search Mozilla Application Suite Internet fraud Windows 2000 AmigaOS ASCII art Unicode and HTML Page widening Computer virus Xanga Web hosting REBOL OpenOffice.org Wireless Application Protocol MySpace Web 2.0 Spamdexing RSS (file format) Punycode Netscape Navigator OpenDocument Java programming language Blog Web crawler Permalink SCO-Linux controversies H2G2 Del.icio.us HyperText Transfer Protocol Link spam InterWiki Thread (computer science) Linked list Model-view-controller
