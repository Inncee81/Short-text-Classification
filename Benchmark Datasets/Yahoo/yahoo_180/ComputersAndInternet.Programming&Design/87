whould you please tell me the peas performance inviroment actuator sencors for easch robot assistant for proving mathmatic theory a robot for living in mars thanks in advance the cmplete question whould you please tell me the peas performance inviroment actuator sensors for each robots a robot for living in mars performance how long can it live how much time in average it needs it to find the information how fast can it move environment mars planet mountains rivers valleys u may suggest also the sun moons i think actuators the wheels the arms the drill if it will dig sensors camera used as its eye on the world temperature sensor i wasnt good in artificial intelligence by the way Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Opportunity rover Robot Mars Mercury (planet) Exploration of Mars Mars Exploration Rover Autonomous robot Industrial robot Aircraft flight control systems Sensor S-bot mobile robot Colonization of Mars Cassini-Huygens Planet Mouse (computing) Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Extraterrestrial life Spirit rover timeline for 2005 March Moon Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Colonization of the Moon Attitude control Audio-Animatronics Terraforming Mars Polar Lander Spacecraft propulsion Space colonization Astronomy Lake Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Mars Pathfinder Mariner program Robot Master Disc brake Planetary orbit Astronomy on Mars Interstellar travel Artificial intelligence Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Galileo spacecraft Artificial consciousness Speed of light Desert Computer science Cloaking device Solar eclipse Computer Carburetor Wearable computer Plasticity (brain) Astrobiology Mobile Analytic Laboratory Probe Mariner 4 Asteroid Extraterrestrial hypothesis Johnny 5 Venus STS-62 Phoenix (spacecraft) Mind transfer Astronomical seeing Heliocentrism Viking program Definition of planet Cognitive science Technology in the Stargate universe Three Laws of Robotics Machine vision Xiaolin Showdown Airbag Observational astronomy Cyberman Combine (Half-Life 2) Spirit rover K-9 (Doctor Who) Face on Mars Phobos (moon) Occultation National Aeronautics and Space Administration Rise of the Robots Alternative biochemistry Extrasolar planet Pyramids of Mars Space probe Space Race Huygens probe Sun Uncanny Valley The Planets Earth Motion capture Abiogenic petroleum origin Beagle 2 The Mysterious Planet Armored Core Isaac Asimov
