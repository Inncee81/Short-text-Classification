i want to offer levels of service on my website each level area password protected how would i do this ok i have a website and i want to sell areas of my site but i dont want a single password that i give to everyone who buys access to that area or a password that i have to create after purchase then email to indivduals i keep hereing about mysql and php and i was wondering if it was a simple way to use these to generate individual people passwords and usernames who have purchased access to these area but i dont want people just to create user account and automaticly gain access so i would like a something that know if someone has purchased access or a code that is entered when creating a account that identifes that the account has been purchased well i would build the website with the ajax style this is considered a web technique youtube apple and i believe myspace use ajax it's the idea of dynamically rendering sections of your page with out having to refresh the whole thing it uses css javascript xml php and html no flash to create an interactive site as for the password thing i would use php possible perl much harder for more security HTML element Cascading Style Sheets Typeface Musical Instrument Digital Interface JavaServer Pages HyperText Transfer Protocol Portable Document Format Uniform Resource Locator Hello world program Atari 8-bit family Unicode TrueType CPU cache HTML Marching band Apple typography OpenDocument Fischer Random Chess ALGOL 68 Windows Vista World Wide Web IPod Common Unix Printing System Emacs Unicode and HTML Web page Character encodings in HTML Spamdexing Final Fantasy (video game) ZX Spectrum Ebook Reconfigurable computing Blue screen of death Video game music Dot matrix printer Football (soccer) Volleyball Windows 3.x Forth programming language MP3 Windows 2000 Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Virtual memory Dai shogi Unix Double bass Killian documents ASCII art History of Microsoft Windows Hangul X86 assembly language Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Cyrillic alphabet Original Amiga chipset Macromedia Flash Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Uniform Resource Identifier Movie projector Secret of Mana Web design TeX Compact disc JPEG Chu shogi Mozilla Firefox Helium File Allocation Table AmigaOS Florida Marlins System 7 (Macintosh) Minesweeper (computer game) BZFlag Tcl PostScript Compiler optimization HTML scripting Jennifer Lopez PlayStation Portable Serif Wiki Laws of cricket HTTP cookie JavaScript Cross site scripting Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim MOS Technology SID Control Panel (Windows) Digital audio player Detroit Tigers XML Plain Old Documentation Jr. Pac Man Mozilla Application Suite
