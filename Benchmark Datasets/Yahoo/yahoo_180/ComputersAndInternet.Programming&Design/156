automatic updates when a piece of software has an update available on the internet how does the source of the update typically communicate with the host computer also the main drive of my question can someone update their software from a network i wish to use another computer as a buffer to trial the update so i can choose to use it or not without putting my main computer at risk for faulty updates and because i am paranoid about getting on the net generally now for copyright protection and security all updates are set to auto install you can use a second machine to directly test the updates but you will still have to run the update from the main machine afterwards HTML HTML element XML Blog Cascading Style Sheets Ajax (programming) Cross site scripting JavaServer Pages HyperText Transfer Protocol Gmail PHP Website XHTML Web server Web page Blogger World Wide Web Character encodings in HTML JavaScript HTML editor Hyperlink Uniform Resource Identifier Web application Representational State Transfer Web design Mozilla Firefox Markup language Comparison of layout engines (HTML) Web 2.0 Google bomb GameFAQs Bliki Stopping e-mail abuse SAML Serendipity (weblog software) MySpace TikiWiki XSL Transformations Internet Explorer Wiki Web browser Wget Uniform Resource Locator Permalink BitTorrent World Wide Web Consortium Common Unix Printing System Internet Search engine optimization Document Type Definition TiddlyWiki Opera (web browser) Portable Document Format XMLHTTP Client-side scripting Link spam Google MIME Zope RSS (file format) OpenDocument Streaming media Comparison of web browsers Document Object Model HTTP cookie Web analytics Dynamic HTML Unicode and HTML Open source culture Comment Xanga Geographic information system CPAN LiveJournal Macromedia Flash Podcasting Hello world program Mozilla Application Suite Metadata Weblogs, Inc.
