my main program is saying one of my functions is undeclared help i have a header file a implementation file with all the functions and a main file when i compile the implementation file its fine but when i compile the main file it says one of my functions undeclared first use of this function it doesn't happen for any of my other functions why this one heres the situation lets say my header file has a class poo that has all its own functions as a public member function we have void read poo int then in the implementation file we have void poo read poo array int size code then in the main file it includes poo h and it calls the function by saying poo array num read array num why is it saying 'read' undeclared first use this function even after i wrote void poo read poo int it still gave me that read was undeclared if this is c it is not the header file that is the problem either the function needs to be static or you need to declare an object of type poo and then call poo read also be sure to include your header in your main file Apache HTTP Server PHP Python programming language Scripting language Secure Shell HyperText Transfer Protocol Common Unix Printing System Windows Server 2003 CPAN Server Shell script Web server Unix Proxy server Buffer overflow Unix shell Spring operating system Wget Common Gateway Interface MDAC Linux Whois Transmission Control Protocol OpenBSD Windows 2000 Bash Novell NetWare Operating system Domain Name System BitTorrent Plan 9 (operating system) Computer virus Visual Basic Irssi Web browser Common Lisp Mac OS X Remote procedure call LAMP (software bundle) X Window System Cross-platform Internet Relay Chat Hello world program Server-side scripting Netscape Communications Corporation ASP.NET Client-server File system WAMP News server Categorical list of programming languages Web application UTF-8 Ajax (programming) File Transfer Protocol A/UX Library (computer science) Squid cache Shebang Domain-specific programming language Telnet MSH (shell) Gmail Mach kernel OpenSSH Vim (text editor) HTTP cookie Make Cross site scripting History of the graphical user interface Windows Vista Regular expression Shell (computing) Microsoft Windows Concurrent Versions System Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Thread (computer science) Cygwin WebDAV Sed GNU IRC bot Kernel (computer science) Free software EDonkey network HP-UX MSN Messenger Thin client Berkeley Software Distribution COMMAND.COM Filename extension Windows NT 4.0 MIRC Server Message Block MySQL Samba software Printf
