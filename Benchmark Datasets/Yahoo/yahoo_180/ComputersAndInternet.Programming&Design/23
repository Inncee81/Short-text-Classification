windows wizardry shortcut to toggle audio settings i have a usb headset that i use for audio and i also have a standard external speaker configuration i'll use the external speakers if my roomates aren't home and i can be loud but i'll switch to the headphones when people want peace and quiet i toggle between the two by right clicking on the speaker icon in my systray selecting adjust audio properties selecting the audio tab changing the sound playback default device to the other configuration then clicking ok whew is there some way that i can have an icon on my desktop that does all of that automatically whenever it is double clicked a little batch file or executable that detects the current setting then applies the other many thanks i'm not aware of any utility that can do this you might be able to set up a script to toggle your registry settings directly but that would be a somewhat inelegant and messy solution i'd recommend downloading a freeware macro recorder like powerpro that will allow you to assign the entire sequence to hotkeys not quite what you asked for but handy none the less Mouse (computing) Windows XP IPod Screenshot Mozilla Firefox Musical Instrument Digital Interface Macromedia Flash ITunes Bluetooth Windows 2000 Konqueror USB flash drive Windows Vista Floppy disk Xbox 360 Loudspeaker Universal Serial Bus Linux Sound recording Apple Computer Object Desktop Windows registry Gramophone record COMMAND.COM Double-click (computing) History of Microsoft Windows DVD Stardock LiteStep Blender (software) Disc jockey Common Unix Printing System Unicode Vorbis Headphones Compact audio cassette Windows 3.x Hard disk Digital audio workstation Opera (web browser) Emacs PHP MDAC Apple Macintosh P__li Digital camera Amstrad CPC Computer virus Taskbar History of the graphical user interface Tungsten Handheld Microphone Pretty Good Privacy Macintosh Finder International Phonetic Alphabet Hello world program Booting Mac OS X Original Amiga chipset Sound card Synthesizer Java programming language Secure Digital card Ethernet Multitrack recording Cheating in Counter-Strike Switch WordPerfect Voice over IP Digital rights management Mandriva Linux JavaScript Commodore 64 Control Panel (Windows) AppleScript Window Maker Stopping e-mail abuse QuickTime Television Scheme programming language X Window System Phonograph Apple typography Circuit breaker Microsoft Windows Internet Relay Chat Linux distribution VHS
