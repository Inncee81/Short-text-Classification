making a form in a java applet i'm trying to make a form on a java applet however i'm finding it very difficult to get the text labels and corresponding textboxes to align themselves one per line gridlayout is what i need to use i think but when i use that it adjusts my textbox components to fill the entire region of their alloted grid cell not what i want there must be an easy way to make a simple form on an applet any help appreciated i'd recommend you switch to a gridbaglayout this will let you specify fill conditions vertical horizontal both none on each component you insert and anchoring which edge of the cell for components that don't fill it completely it's slightly more complex than gridlayout but gives you the control over sizing that you want here's a snippet of some of my code that uses gridbaglayout joptionpanel new jpanel joptionpanel setlayout new gridbaglayout gridbagconstraints gbc new gridbagconstraints gbc fill gbc none gbc gridx gbc gridy gbc weightx gbc weighty gbc insets insets gbc anchor gbc east joptionpanel add getbatchidlabel gbc gbc gridy joptionpanel add getenablegldeletionlabel gbc gbc gridy gbc anchor gbc center joptionpanel add getdotransformbutton gbc gbc fill gbc horizontal gbc gridx gbc gridy gbc anchor gbc west joptionpanel add getbatchidtextfield gbc gbc gridy joptionpanel add getenablegldeletioncheckbox gbc Autodesk AutoCAD Lisp programming language AutoCAD DXF ActionScript USB flash drive Visual Basic for Applications Level design BIOS AMD Scene graph BRL-CAD Computer-aided design Secure Digital card DOS extender Universal Serial Bus Web application Categorical list of programming languages Macromedia Flash USB mass storage device class Just-in-time compilation File Allocation Table Flash Gordon Flash memory Solid modelling JavaScript DJ Grandmaster Flash Analog-to-digital converter XForms Game programmer Interface (computer science) Flash (comics) Streaming media Flash (photography) Field-programmable gate array PowerPC Computer cluster Tetris Xenon flash lamp Marin County, California File system Command line interface Recursion OpenOffice.org IBM Scalable Vector Graphics Level crossing Java programming language International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Set construction Plugin Dome of the Rock Commodore 64 Aspect-oriented programming Computer workstation Flash suppressor Timer Virtual machine Conway's Game of Life SOAP PHP Flash Thompson CompactFlash Adobe Illustrator Ajax (programming) FreeJ GDI H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Flash mob Labanotation Dance notation Log-structured file system YellowTAB Zeta Dongle Macromedia Shockwave Wired Equivalent Privacy One-time pad Washington and Lee University Mozilla Firefox Canon EOS NPAPI SWF GeForce 4 SolidWorks BitTorrent Flash fiction Enemies of the Flash Optical computer Flash Flash Revolution Virtual Network Computing Die Hard Password Amiga Symbian OS Flash Gordon (serial) Newgrounds Defender of the Crown Western Digital Time-resolved spectroscopy X-COM
