need explaination on arrays this is how it goes example short arr short i p t arr i p arr i t p p arr i t p i can explain them declares an array of shorts short arr declares a short and a pointer to a short short i p at this point arr is a pointer to the first of shorts arr is the first short arr is the second etc up to arr l is a short that is not initialized and p is a pointer to a short that is not initialized sets t to the l'th element in the array t arr i so if l then t will be assigned whatever value is first in the array sets p to the address of the l'th element p arr i equivalent to p arr l after this p will be the same place in memory as arr l if you change p arr l will change and vice versa sets t to the value of the short that p points to t p the final two statements are repeated in your question but i'm not sure what you are trying to do with them as written the code uses an uninitialized value l to index the array if l happens to be greater than or less than it'll point off into memory that it shouldn't be touching it also sets t arr l but then t p where p is the address of arr l so it does the same thing twice in slightly different ways Software engineering Flat file database Central processing unit CPU cache Economics The Internet Movie Database Windows XP Screenplay Escape from New York Database Joel and Ethan Coen W.
