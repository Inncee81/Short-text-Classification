md hash mapping unique input bit to unique output bit will the md hash function always return a unique hash given that input is unique each time and or less bits for example will all numbers return a unique md hash or do they lap over at some points i dont just want a yes no but some proof website links please the md algorithm will theoretically create collisions for two unique inputs but i would suspect that at bits the probability of it would be low the wikipedia entry for md http en wikipedia org wiki md vulnerability suggests collisions are easily generated but it fails to state that the only practical way to collide two hashes is to know the same prefix which is unlikely in the case of passwords although one could dictionary brute force attack a dataset of hashes in an effort to create collisions and thus crack the hash that's probably more work than many crackers would care to invest Objective-C Mozilla Firefox C programming language Macromedia Flash MAME C plus plus Header file Xcode Linux Unicode NPAPI Visual Basic AmigaOS Wget BZFlag MDAC Visual Basic .NET Unix HTML element C syntax OpenOffice.org C Sharp Java programming language Linux kernel Mozilla Application Suite EMule Microsoft Mach kernel Comparison of generics to templates Mac OS X Forth programming language PHP Pretty Good Privacy Smalltalk Extreme Programming Internet Relay Chat PaX Spyware JavaServer Pages Opera (web browser) Rational Unified Process Microsoft .NET SAS System Atari 8-bit family BASIC programming language Computer virus Open-source software Compiler optimization Gnutella Software testing Microsoft Windows APL programming language Windows Vista Musical Instrument Digital Interface Windows API X86 assembly language Delphi programming language IPsec RISC Spring operating system C preprocessor ALGOL 68 Computer Common Unix Printing System Debugging Podcasting Plan 9 (operating system) International Phonetic Alphabet IPod OpenDocument Concurrent Versions System Pointer Windows XP Source code Open source culture Netscape Communications Corporation ITunes Emacs Symbian OS Software engineering AppleScript GNU General Public License Ordinary differential equation Microsoft Office Peer-to-peer Programming language Product Lifecycle Management DirectShow Cocoa (API) Perl Copyleft Patch (computing) Linspire File sharing Compiler
