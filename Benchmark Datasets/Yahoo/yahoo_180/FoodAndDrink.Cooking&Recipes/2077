how can i make my own crab salad i have canned crab meat but i'm not sure what else to add you can pretty much put anything into it you choose i make mine with chopped onions and cerery and pickle relish sometimes all blended with mayonaise other times i use cream cheese and shredded cheese and add a bit of real cream to the mixture to soften the cheese to stir better sometimes i add seafood spices and other times i make it without any spices since the crab meat is already salty once i just used cream cheese and added some crushed pineapple to it and served it in crackers sometimes i mix shredded lettuce into it as well or chopped tomatoes experiment with the recipe each time that you make it until you like what your creation is when you become a creative cook then your food stops being the same old thing and you never get tired of the dishes you prepare variety is the 'spice' to life or to cooking as they say Salad Hot dog Hamburger Japanese cuisine Cajun cuisine Tofu D__ner kebab Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Peruvian cuisine Chili con carne Curry Cuisine of Singapore Mayonnaise Bengali cuisine French fries Cuisine of Africa Cincinnati chili Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of the Philippines Barbecue French cuisine In-N-Out Burger Soup Breakfast Cantonese cuisine Sauerkraut Cuisine of Vietnam Russian cuisine Sauce Gumbo Cuisine of Turkey Soul food Cuisine of Greece Food American Chinese cuisine Cuisine of Argentina Tamale Ice cream Sandwich Kosher foods Kebab Food preservation Pancake Apple pie Meatball Cuisine of Cambodia Korean cuisine Meatloaf Ketchup Fondue Cuisine of Austria Yoghurt Persian cuisine Potato chips Ramen Cuisine of Laos Peking Duck MRE Vegetarian cuisine Potato salad Sushi Dumpling Rice pudding Bagel Italian cuisine Fish sauce Muesli Pickling Kraft Dinner Cuisine of Ethiopia Chicken soup Kelantan Veganism Irish cuisine Mexican cuisine Pasta Taco Beef noodle soup Cuisine of Canada Corned beef Tea Stock (food) Culinary mustard Pea soup Dairy Cuisine of Thailand Bread French toast
