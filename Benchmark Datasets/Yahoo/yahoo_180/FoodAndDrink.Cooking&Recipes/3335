i want to purchase a new deep fryer i would appreciate any ideas on what to purchase i have looked at them online and in the stores and don't know what brand and model would be best for the money as far as brands i may not be much help as i haven't tried all of them what i would reccomend is an immersion fryer this is where the heating element is submersed into the oil versus having a heating element molded into the bottom of the oil pan the reason for this is that on an immersion element the food particals you are frying will fall below the heat source and then will not burn as fast causing you oil to break down faster the common fry daddy's use a bottom heating element and for this reason they are only good for maybe fryings as the sediment that settles on the bottom burns causing the oil to then burn i have a ge immersible fryer i bought at wal mart it ran and has worked like a champ for me got the largest model which has the seperate baskets was at wal mart the other day and they didn't have anymore but there was a professional model that had the immersible element and ran of course this is if you are looking for a home counter top fryer if this is for commercial use then the vulcan self filter turbo fryer hope this helps Deep frying Kitchen In-N-Out Burger Wal-Mart Motor oil Plastic Fire fighting Tofu Wok Coffee Turbocharger Carburetor Refrigerator Sears Holdings Corporation Billboard Hot 100 Swimming Central processing unit Domesticated turkey Stove Nuclear power Stir frying MMORPG Ice cream Windows XP Waste vegetable oil Heinkel He 100 Flood geology Sewage treatment Fish and chips Fire extinguisher Acne Bong Inflation McDonald's Pizza Hut Petroleum Fried chicken Brewery Mac OS X Mississippi River Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Thermal power station Pizza Cigarette Tesla coil Bank Energy development Candle Olive oil Coal Bart Sells His Soul Gas turbine Diesel engine Mutiny on the Bounty Overclocking Tlingit Neighbours GunBound Cookware and bakeware IPod Fire Steam (content delivery) Welding MAME Bacon Neopets 613 mitzvot Solar power Brand Paintball Laserdisc Carbon dioxide sink Two-stroke cycle Portable stove Free trade Fast bowling Recipe Alternative fuel Supply-side economics Barbecue Chewing gum Transformer Charles Goodyear Dot-com Advertising Chris Amon Berkshire Hathaway George Burns Casting Natural gas Hydrogen economy Torpedo Sun $ale of the Century Commodity Ben Johnson (athlete) Mattress Hamburger
