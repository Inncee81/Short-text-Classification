cucumbers salad or pickle i went to the farmers market one stand had cucumbers for i asked the guy if they were salad cucumbers and he said for i got home and tried to eat one and they are really bitter they must be pickling cucumbers is there anything else i can do with them i don't do pickling i really wanted salad cucumbers can i cook them what is a good recipe pickling and salad cucumbers taste the same the difference is that the skin slips off salad cucumbers if you try to pickle them toss 'em they're bad cukes they grew too slowly because the weather was dry radishes and onions get hot when the weather is too dry and cuke and greens get bitter cucumbers even when they are expensive are really cheap so it pays to get the best ones you can find i recommend buying small ones the skin will be thinner and more tender which is a minor thing and the seeds will be smaller and softer which is a major thing most of the bitterness is in the seeds and the skins Cucumber Cuisine of Denmark Cantonese cuisine Tofu Salad Hot dog Russian cuisine Jewish cuisine Japanese cuisine Sushi Hamburger Potato Onion Pickling Cuisine of Singapore Roman eating and drinking German cuisine Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Laos Kelantan Garlic Korean cuisine Potato salad Hamster Ramen Pickled cucumber Black pepper Beet Sauerkraut D__ner kebab Cuisine of the Philippines Bengali cuisine Larry the Cucumber Herring Celery Watermelon Cuisine of Thailand Cuisine of Turkey Banana Capsicum Turnip (brassica rapa) Curry Laksa Sandwich Flax Ginger Egg (food) Dim sum Shaggy dog story Cuisine of Greece Food preservation Cauliflower Gyros Fish and chips Mayonnaise Cajun cuisine Martini cocktail Soup Cuisine of Brazil Pea Culinary mustard Chicken soup Chili con carne Peruvian cuisine Polish cuisine Fugu Pea soup Fishing Kiwifruit Paprika Fennel McDonald's Food Gherkin Basil Plastic Cuisine of the Southern United States Coriander Meatball Dandelion Organic food Cereal Caesar salad Salad Fingers Cuisine of Africa Meal Sea cucumber Rice Melon Yoghurt Chile pepper Wasabi Cuisine of Vietnam Weed control
