why do old people like pie more than kids i always liked pie or cake that was not too sweet like carrot cake even when i was a small kid i never went for the really sweet stuff maybe though to try to answer your question it has something to do with the fact that pie is a classic dessert people have been baking apple pies since medieval times and buttery decadent cakes are more recent not trying to imply that old people are medieval or anything lol just saying that grandpa and grandma grew up with things like lemon meringue or coconut cream pie for dessert so for them maybe it's comfort food whereas kids now have grown up with things like peanut butter snickers ice cream cake topped topped with sprinkles so maybe according to today's kids rhubarb pie just seems dull in comparison Cold Stone Creamery Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of the Southern United States Ice cream German cuisine Confectionery Japanese cuisine Breakfast Doughnut Pie Jewish cuisine Butter British cuisine Pizza Cuisine of Malaysia French cuisine Strawberry Shortcake Dim sum Maple syrup Bagel Oreo Chocolate Baked Alaska Cha chaan teng Cuisine of Singapore Bread Coffee Tofu Cheesecake Fruit Rice pudding Cuisine of the United States Potato Pecan pie Apple Weebl and Bob Spidey Super Stories Greasy spoon Sprinkles Vegetarian cuisine SpongeBob SquarePants Polish cuisine Tea Cuisine of Austria Fried dough foods Codename: Kids Next Door Baking Cuisine of Brazil Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Almond Yoplait Waffle Spot the Dog Soup Garfield Cajun cuisine The J.M.
