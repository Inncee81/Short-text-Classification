microwave convection oven questions couple questions i have a microwave convection oven combo and tried to cook with it the other day the recipe required to cook for minutes at f the problem was that my 'oven' only goes up to f so my questions are how would i have converted the time properly to see how long i would need to cook at the lower temp cause i cooked it for an hourish and well didnt come out well didnt really cook and had to zap it in the microwave to cook it through this is my only oven cause i dont have access to an oven so i am hopeing i can master using this you sort of have to just do what you did be your own judge kinda like making toast when it's done it's done if it looks done then great if you start cooking using your own sense of time and measurement you will become a pro in no time at all i don't even own a measuring spoon or cup i make all kinds of fancy foods just using eye and hand for judgements you will become expert Microwave oven Microwave Bacon Cookware and bakeware Slow cooker Idli Pizza Temperature Stove Bread Kitchen Cooking weights and measures Cooking Breakfast Pancake Solar power Cavity magnetron Cooking on a campfire Rice cooker Kraft Dinner Hot dog Recipe French fries Wok Pasta Pump It Up Muffin Food Barbecue Cuisine of Brazil String theory Rice Bagel Jewish cuisine Chili con carne Sobolev space Wi-Fi Waffle Major appliance Vacuum tube Risotto Heat Sun Chopsticks Fannie Farmer Dabbawala Electromagnetic radiation Toast Campfire XML Electromagnetic spectrum Refrigerator Dialysis Good Eats Microwave meal Appeal Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME French toast Lunch Seismometer Scrambled eggs Cosmic microwave background radiation Quinoa Haggis Sushi Curry Joke Mantou Physical cosmology Hypoglycemia British cuisine Photon Metrication Case-based reasoning Futurama (TV series - season 4) Toaster Mayonnaise Portable stove Veganism Roman eating and drinking Sea ice Bento Meatball Obesity Salad Fingers Cuisine of Laos Expert system Grilling Mach kernel Flour Ketchup Raw food diet Cuisine of Thailand Cultural relativism Theory of conduct Cuisine of Denmark Fancy rat Soup Iron Chef America Renewable energy
