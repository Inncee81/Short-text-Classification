freezing cookie dough im making a lot of cookies early tomorrow and i was wondering if it would be alright to refrigerate the dough and just bake them the next day theyre drop cookies and cant be rolled into a log so im also wondering what the most convenient way of freezing them would be thanks a lot almost any kind of cookie dough will hold in the refrigerator overnight the exceptions are that things with beaten egg whites won't work just cover the dough in the bowl directly with plastic wrap to prevent air from drying it out and odors from getting to it as for freezing them after they are baked let them cool completely then put them in an airtight container in single layers with paper towels between the layers if you are planning on icing them do it just before serving not before freezing Cookie Puff pastry Bread Bagel Pizza Tofu Dumpling Carbon dioxide Mooncake Bong Cookware and bakeware Brewery Baklava Pancake Cuisine of Denmark Jewish cuisine Dim sum Flour Cannabis cultivation Refrigerator Milk Pillsbury Menstrual cup Baked Alaska Sushi Sauna Genericized trademark German cuisine Doughnut Domesticated turkey Potato chips Fried dough foods Cookie Monster Idli Haloalkane Japanese cuisine Cold Stone Creamery Sauerkraut Tea Dairy Tamale Sanitary towel Paper towel Souffl__ Chocolate Soap bubble Maple syrup Ice Fire fighting Vermicompost Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Wok Pop-Tarts Croissant M16 (rifle) Chicken Food preservation Ammonia Girl Scout cookies Mr. Freeze Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Plastic Bento McDonald's Manicure Food storage Polyethylene terephthalate Oreo Cheesecake Wood Fortune cookie Textile manufacturing Wine making Air conditioning Jiaozi Blonde on Blonde Ramen Refrigerator car Swamp cooler Fog Sesame Street Solar power Coriander Pierogi Pattern language Breadmaker Transformer Chicago-style pizza Cake Pita Cruising (maritime) Organic food Tortilla Pie Paint Mouth ulcer The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Stock car (rail) Coffee
