help a charcoal grilling newbie please i just got a small barbeque grill that uses charcoal the instructions for the charcoal says to arrange it in a pyramid shape and light after minutes the flames go away and the charcoal turns a grayish color then i am to spread out the charcoal my grill manual says to open all the vents and place my food on the grilling surface then place the lid on it also says to grill my ground beef for minutes and flip once i assume that means flip around the minute mark i followed these instructions but after minutes my burgers were still not done what did i do wrong also i put some asparagus on some aluminum foil and tried to grill in the same way the manual says minutes covered and it came out tasting horrible i bit into the asparagus and it was like it absorbed the taste of the charcoal nasty any help would be greatly appreciated i don't want to waste more food and want to get this done the right w well it sounds like you did everything right but don't go by the time line's set forth in a manual cooking with colas it is hard to control the heat level so sometimes it takes less time or more time depending upon the amount of coals and the heat produce i usually pour in my charcoal briquettes into the grill until i get a complete layer all across the bottom of the grill then i stack them this insures when i spread them out it will cover the entire bottom it takes about minutes for the coals to be completey gray white in color and these are now officially cooking coals cooking over coals that are still black will give your food that charcoal taste as it is still releasing dust although i am not a fan of cooking with grill cover on this turns the grill into an oven and bakes your food more than it grills it it also minimizs the flames and you do't get that flame kissed cooking try doing this with you cover off and adjust the vent openings till you get a steady red glow from your coals as far as asparagus i usually use water soaked wooden skewers to make asparagus rafts to make them easier to flip and i do them over indirect heat source on the grill also instead of using charcoal most stores now carry wood chuncks hickory and mesquite most commonly and they are started and used the same way as charcoal this would help get rid of that charcoal taste or used natural lump charcoal my favorite they sell this at most wal marts or hardware stores lump coal is charred wood and produces a higher heat level than commercially produced charcoal good luck and hope this helps Charcoal Coal Kitchen Carbon dioxide Grilling Grill Thermal power station Mattress Bong Cooking on a campfire Wok Microwave oven Bacon Renewable energy Wood In-N-Out Burger Furnace Nuclear power Tofu Sega Saturn Iron German cuisine Coffee Solar power Laserdisc Japanese cuisine Explosive material Brewery Bread Fire fighting Stove Water purification Rum Welding D__ner kebab Cuisine of Denmark Steel Bengali cuisine Tobacco Asparagus Bubble Bobble Recipe Paint Forge Carburetor Fire Nuclear reactor Drill bit Internal ballistics Gramophone record Plastic Chocolate Wood fuel Magnetic core memory Hot air balloon Risotto Hot dog Town gas Hydrogen economy Japanese tea ceremony Deforestation Sewage treatment Light-emitting diode Cuisine of Brazil Chili con carne CPU design Amateur telescope making Air pollution Fusion power Wood carving Carbon Radio controlled airplane Vacuum tube Printed circuit board Olive oil Hamster Hydroponics Satay Textile manufacturing Solar cell Pottery Rebreather Skateboarding trick Compiler optimization Motorola 68000 Aluminium
