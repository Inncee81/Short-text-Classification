budget birthday dinner my husbands birthday is coming up soon and we are a little tight on money for birthdays and such i always cook him a big fancy dinner something we dont have all the time but i'm not sure what to do this year he is a very picky eater pretty much only likes meat bread and pasta not even potatos and no veggies or fruits the only things i can think of are expensive especially if we end up feeding friends aswell any ideas one thing he loves is duck is there anywhere to get this affordably or would it be cheaper now then it was in the winter any ideas would be appreciated thank you ok we will probably be feeding people and other things he really likes we dont have much is seafood especially shrimp and such i cook nearly every day so finding something that we dont have often is the hard part chicken turkey ham and nearly anything with burger meat are all staples in my house i thought that i was going to be nearly brilliant but bert responded with the same answer i had so bert's the brilliant one a few added suggestions i can find small cooked shrimp in the fresh seafood section of our grocery store and although the price per pound makes you want to take out a second mortgage it is actually very reasonable since it isn't large or jumbo shrimp serve the prepared meal on plates handed to your guests as though they were dining in a fine establishment with several pieces of shrimp tossed on top of the alfredo thereby making it more of alfredo with shrimp rather than shrimp with alfredo make sense give the birthday boy a few extra though presentation presentation presentation a sprinkle the top of the alfredo with dried parsley and then sprinkle the shrimp on top of the alfredo with paprika b can you serve a side salad for your guests since your husband doesn't like vegetables choose lots of color to sit on top of each guests' salad bowl shredded carrots diced tomatoes black olives you get the idea c set a nice table then perhaps lower the lighting and light candles at the table there will be room if you are serving the meal to your guests rather than passing dishes around d is there something that you can use as a centerpiece that is a favorite of your husband's or perhaps a family member has something from his childhood that would spark memories and conversations either way you go it's a challenge but it will be a birthday to look back on it's amazing how resourceful and creative we can be Cajun cuisine French cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Cantonese cuisine Hamburger Gumbo MRE Salad Peruvian cuisine Roman eating and drinking Jewish cuisine Chili con carne Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of the Southern United States Dim sum Breakfast Barbecue McDonald's Meal Cuisine of Singapore In-N-Out Burger Korean cuisine Sandwich Vegetarian cuisine Ramen Potato Hot dog Cuisine of Laos Shaggy dog story Chicken soup Kitchen Domesticated turkey Cha chaan teng Food Sauce Fish and chips Sauerkraut D__ner kebab Japanese tea ceremony Soup Curry Russian cuisine Delicatessen Friends Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Veganism Kosher foods Bread Recipe American Chinese cuisine French fries Cuisine of Vietnam Tofu Potato salad Cuisine of Thailand Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an British cuisine Hot pot Minestrone Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hell's Kitchen (television) Dumpling Pea soup RuneScape quests Cuisine of Cambodia Tomato Soul food Hamster Coffee Sushi Microeconomics Rice pudding Cuisine of Argentina Couscous Serbian cuisine Foie gras Polish cuisine Canadian Chinese cuisine Restaurant Chinese New Year Vegetarianism Ham Chinese cuisine Wine Passover Tempura Little Britain Brunch Swedish cuisine
