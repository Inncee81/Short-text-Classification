sorry bout last question help please and to best ok i'm going to make my mom a cake and cover it with fondant here is the recipe http www cooks com rec doc html ok so i dont have a candy thermometer or a marble slab and i cant buy anything more because i have no more money i wasted all my money today buying the ingredients but i didn't realize that i needed the candy thermometer or the marble slab so what can i do about it how can i improvise no marble slab use a clean flat baking tray you could even use a clean worktop but i wouldn't recommend that as the sugar syrup will be very hot and the surface might blister as for no candy thermometer you are boiling the syrup unitl it becomes thicker when you lift some of the liquid with your spoon and let it drop back into the pan when it stops being very runny and falls in bigger globules it should be about ready check other replies for confirmation of this the recipe says to boil until reduced without stirring but i would stir to help prevent burning sugar burns very easily at the bottom of the pot and would spoil the finished result good luck Pancake Japanese cuisine Maple syrup Cookware and bakeware Sugar Coffee Candy Tofu Barbecue Jewish cuisine Sugar beet Bread Risotto Rum Idli Cooking Cajun cuisine Tea Food preservation German cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Pizza Poker jargon Honey Wok Korean cuisine Muffin Cookie Motor oil Cantonese cuisine Soul food Chili con carne Turkish Delight Ketchup Bacon Cuisine of the Philippines Turkish coffee Russian cuisine Stir frying Casting Cheese Dairy Coca-Cola Rice pudding Confectionery Pasta Slow cooker Moonshine Pottery Molotov cocktail Cuisine of Denmark Chocolate Textile manufacturing RuneScape quests Plastic Cake Dumpling Baklava Soap Cuisine of the Southern United States Roux Gumbo XML Potato Mattress Recipe Chinese cuisine Paella Baking Sucrose Boiling point Mayonnaise Stove Bagel Brewing Food Polish cuisine Breakfast Fractional distillation Cheesecake Acetic acid Drill bit Bong Christmas pudding Bulk vending Cuisine of Laos Water Betting (poker) Acorn
