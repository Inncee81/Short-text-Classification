are wooden rolling pins obsolete in this day and age of the fear of cross contamination how does one clean steralize a wooden rolling pin when cleaning the surface of the pins do not bathe the pin in great amounts of water which only serves to add unnecessary moisture to the wood instead use a damp cloth or a dough scraper to remove unwanted materials is what the experts say but does that remove all the particulates i e raw egg from the pin i do have several pins that are not wood but i'm focusing only on that particular tool obsolete or not thank you mikel for your educated answer when making some dough products egg is one of the key binding ingredients thanks again no steve i certainly don't think they're obsolete i have an arsenal of pins wood and steel each chosen as best of breed for a specific job similarly my boards are both wood and marble depending on the job in hand what i do believe should be obsolete are pins with static handles and revolving barrels of any type of material those are genuinely impossible to get properly clean even if they can be disassembled too many nooks and crannies as for clean down the dedicated board scraper it's not used for anything else for all wooden surfaces after each use during the day and finally at the day's end a rub down with a disposable cloth moistened with food service sterilising fluid which of course isn't found living in too many domestic kitchens g so you could replace it with a dilution of part of chlorine bleach to parts of water or part of chlorine bleach to of water for example the endless scraping down during the day precludes any build up of things you don't care for and the scraper assuming it's a good one gets more off than any other implement can and it's as quick as it is thorough 'wet' washing is another story altogether soggy wooden surfaces provide a moist environment for some considerable period of time while drying which does the wood no favours and gives any possible contamination a lovely environment to thrive not good on both counts pet peeve synthetic pins and rolling boards of any kind so we won't go there gg Textile manufacturing Hamster Dishwasher Upholstery Wood pulp Brewery Menstrual cycle Drill bit Menstrual cup Mattress Tattoo Dairy Knife Hydrogen peroxide Hemp Diaper Japanese tea ceremony Screw Brush Plastic Bread Soap Pottery Sushi Seismic retrofit Domestic rabbit Escherichia coli O157:H7 Casting Hydrochloric acid Nuclear fallout Comanche Kosher foods Handloading Motor oil Dishwashing Woodworking Dog Fecal incontinence Chopsticks Violin Flour Dry cleaning Foodborne illness Body piercing Halitosis Ammonia Tofu Organic peroxide Glossary of firefighting equipment Diving suit Explosive material Katana Water Welding Puff pastry Air pollution Disinfection Dumpling Radioactive contamination Plaster Chlorine Washing machine Houseplant Glossary of wildland fire terms Cremation Laws of cricket Beretta 92F/FS Kitchen Hazing Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Wok Radioactive waste Pizza Haloalkane Carnivorous plant Environmental concerns with electricity generation Tampon Technology Rice Thermal power station Metalworking Egg (food) Sauna Shampoo Jewish cuisine Culture of Korea Nuclear power Olduwan Radio controlled airplane Waste management
