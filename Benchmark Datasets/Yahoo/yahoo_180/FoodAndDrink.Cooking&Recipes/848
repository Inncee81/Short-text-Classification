how do you cook italian sausage i have a package of italian sausage but have no idea of how it is to be cooked is it boiled baked grilled or fried help i can't wait to taste it i am a former chef and what i do is brown them in a pan until coloured then i put a cup of water on them and a lid to steam cooked them this extracts the fat with out spattering and once the water has evaporated i then let them brown further sausages like a cake are hard to gauge but if you start them off then steam cook and brown them for minutes they will be done in about minutes more i like to add some onions peppers and seasoning the last period of cooking even a small amount of tomato sauce or spaghetti sauce for flavour and it goes nice on a bun or over pasta Hot dog Cajun cuisine Japanese cuisine German cuisine Barbecue French cuisine Tofu Cha chaan teng Fish and chips Pizza McDonald's Cantonese cuisine Cookware and bakeware Pasta Cuisine of the Philippines French fries Breakfast Ramen Cuisine of Brazil Pot Noodle Dumpling Bacon MRE Egg (food) Full English breakfast British cuisine Roman eating and drinking Steaming Bread Korean cuisine Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Argentina Sauce Coffee Chicago-style pizza Meatball Cuisine of Laos Haggis Bengali cuisine Italian cuisine Gumbo Sausage Spaghetti Sandwich D__ner kebab Ketchup Oregano In-N-Out Burger Ice cream Chili con carne Roux Salad Kraft Dinner Cooking Cuisine of Vietnam Soul food Stock (food) Iron Chef Peruvian cuisine Tea Domesticated turkey Kebab Rice Maple syrup Kelantan Chocolate Catalan cuisine Flour Brewery Sushi Stir frying Potato chips Couscous Greasy spoon Pringles Blood sausage Russian cuisine Chicken soup Bolognese sauce Mayonnaise Vegetarian cuisine Irish breakfast Muffin Soy sauce Naples Food preservation Cincinnati chili Jiaozi Peking Duck Curry
