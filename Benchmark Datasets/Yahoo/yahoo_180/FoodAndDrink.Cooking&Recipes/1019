does anyone know how to make a starbucks cafe vanilla frappuccino does anyone work at starbucks or know anyone who may work as a bartistas at starbucks i know starbucks carries the syrup you can buy i was wondering if any one knew how they were made i love them and want to make them at home thanks the starbucks secret is and always has been using really good quality ingredients so in that respect if you're trying to save money by making it at home you'll probably just do better getting it at the ole 'bucks the details aren't available to the public or baristas but the basic ingredients are a double strength coffee base frappuccino mix vanilla powder and whipped cream you can make the coffee base at home just use the water normally and start with a strong coffee espresso italian etc you'll have to look for a strongly flavored french vanilla powder which is available in basic cheap forms as carnation coffee mate or likely at gourmet grocers in the spice aisle the whipped cream is natural whipping cream so don't skimp there that leaves the frappuccino base here's the magic there isn't any it's just yummy stuff the link below is one of many purported recipes online google it and you'll get others but a better suggestion is to buy the bottled coffee frappuccino and use that as a starter good luck again don't discount the quality of product and expertise of baristas in making this drink for you it might be worth it in the long run Frappuccino Starbucks Coffeehouse Espresso Ice cream Milkshake Vanilla Soft drink Tea Bread Rum Cold Stone Creamery Maple syrup Curry Cuisine of Denmark Cappuccino Soy milk Oreo Alcoholic beverage Cheesecake Kit Kat Cake Polish cuisine Drink Cream (food) Wine Mayonnaise Cocoa Cheese Tofu Coca-Cola Turkish coffee Pancake French toast Pecan pie Heath bar Food Portuguese cuisine Cajun cuisine Idli Sake Italian cuisine In-N-Out Burger Cigar Cha chaan teng Milk Apple pie Moonshine Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Laos Hot chocolate Cocaine Marshmallow Breakfast PepsiCo, Inc.
