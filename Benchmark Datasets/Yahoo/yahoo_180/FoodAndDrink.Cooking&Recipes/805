is there a way to grill the focaccia bread for a panini if you don't have a panini grill mmmm panini's my favorite it depends on what you currently have to work with if you have heavy pans you can heat both on stove then use them one on top of the other to apply the pressure on your sandwich or if you have just one heavy i actually use a cast iron skillet for my own and one standard sautee or other lighter pan is it for the putting your sandwich in and use the heavier on on top i have also used a grill basket the wire framed type what you use to grill delicate food item that allows you to flip back and forth on grill in the oven at high temp you don't get the grill marks but it does toast evenly the basket is adjustable and you and adjust the pressure you apply on the sandwich can also use this on a grill as well if your not wanting spend any money to buy a panini grill you can make it out of anything the link below is a wonderful site that gives you many options and recipes for making a panini which in italian means plural pinino is actually what the sandwich should be called the site primarily addresses who to make it on the grill charcoal or gas but shows other methods as well withouth needing to buy an expensive and limited use panini grill good luck and let me kno what time dinner is i'm starved Barbecue Bread Breakfast Hamburger Toast Stove Pizza Cuisine of Denmark Hot dog Cuisine of Laos Grill D__ner kebab Kitchen Inflation Cooking on a campfire Portable stove Grilled cheese sandwich In-N-Out Burger Pancake Vegetarian cuisine Hot air balloon Mattress Japanese cuisine Recipe Turbocharger German cuisine Cuisine of Argentina Bacon McDonald's Casting Welding Transformer Cartridge (firearms) Cuisine of Brazil Toaster Plastic Cooking Muffin Street food Bicycle frame Brewery Hydrogen economy Fast-food restaurant Aluminium Scuba set Bagel Bicycle brake systems French cuisine Cajun cuisine Gas metal arc welding Electric motor Internal ballistics Car handling Boat building Cuisine of Turkey Cheesesteak Jewish cuisine Jet engine Incandescent light bulb Dundas Square Coffee Thermal power station Pasta Ford Thunderbird Kebab Gold standard Table tennis Delicatessen Loudspeaker Gross domestic product Strap-on dildo Microeconomics Mercury Cougar Fire fighting Petroleum Peanut butter Glass Nissan Skyline Irish breakfast Bicycle Dodge Charger Betting (poker) Mochi Final Fantasy XI Temperature Knife Window Sushi Charcoal Schlock Mercenary Chili con carne Panera Bread Spacecraft propulsion
