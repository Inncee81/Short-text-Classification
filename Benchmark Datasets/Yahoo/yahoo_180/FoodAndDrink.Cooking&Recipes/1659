is it possible to cook corndogs on a grill my kickball team is having a bbq tonight before our game and i want to bring something that is easy to cook easy to eat but not something that would typically be found at a bbq there is a grocery store near me that sells premade corndogs where all you have to do is put them either in a microwave or in an oven and they are done has anyone tried to cook corndogs like this on a grill before i believe that tonight we will be using a portable gas grill not a charcoal grill thanks corn dogs over direct heat will burn the corn bread very quickly and i am sure the pre made ones you are buying are frozen so here are some options you can try first thing is to try to be sure they are thawed completely this will shorten the time to cook them one method would be to wrap them in foil completely including the wooden stick and place on grill but under a lower temperature again direct heat and corn bread not a good combo another option and i have used this before to make cobbler on a grill is to by aluminum foil pans place corn dogs in pan then invert other pan and put on top of bottom pan this will make a sort of oven on the grill then just frequently slide pan back and forth to roll the corn dogs around in pan so all sides are getting heated evenly the top aluminum pan with make sort of like a convection oven out of this set up and help cook the corn dogs faster and more evenly hope this helps let us know how it turns out Barbecue Hot dog Bread Kitchen Wok Cookware and bakeware Grill Hamburger Stove Printed circuit board Japanese cuisine Coffee Bacon Renewable energy Refrigerator Cooking on a campfire D__ner kebab Solar power Cuisine of Brazil Jewish cuisine MRE Bong Happy Tree Friends Portable stove Cuisine of Denmark Cooking Cuisine of the Southern United States Amateur telescope making Skateboarding trick Heat Professional wrestling holds Internal ballistics Bagel Baking Gas metal arc welding Korean cuisine Mattress Table tennis Professional wrestling throws Fire fighting Muffin Aluminium foil Cuisine of Laos Ice cream Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Food Water (molecule) Motor oil Recipe Domesticated turkey Aluminium Idli Cajun cuisine Toast Sandwich Fast-food restaurant Manual transmission Drill bit Sushi Tofu Items in the Metroid series Incandescent light bulb Pasta Cuisine of Malaysia Sea ice Cantonese cuisine Trapping STS-62 Vacuum tube Breakfast Suplex Upholstery German cuisine Canoe Irish breakfast Dairy Star Trek Customizable Card Game Cuisine of Argentina Sailing Dog agility McDonald's Flour Cuisine of Singapore Hydrogen economy Mouse (computing) Knife Waffle Billiards Beverage can stove
