about pastrami im thinking of doing a morning time wedding in which i d like to serve a light cocktail with some different varieties of cheese and pastrami how much pastrami would i need in order to feed about people it would be hot but not in a sandwich nor wrap it would be more like a snack in a buffet along with some cheeses and fruit well first you have to figure out how many of the would eat the pastrami chances are that some will go back for seconds but there will be many that don't want pastrami at all just for argument's sake let's say will eat pastrami that's servings so how big is a serving it depends on what you're doing with it and pastrami can be pretty light i'd say go to the store and get a third of a pound and see if it's too much or not but if it is just right then you have or pounds of pastrami you might be fine with pound or less it depends how you serve it and slice it pound of pastrami is a goodly amount of meat take a couple of dollars and buy some pastrami and figure out how much you want to use per serving serve that and then multiply by the number of servings you think you'll need and unless you're doing a pastrami lover's convention i doubt it'll be the full good luck on edit you need to give your deli advance notice too they probably don't have that much on hand and often they cut pastrami separately the reason for that i used to work at one is that pastrami is just damned messy you can't cut anything else on the slicer until you fully clean it after pastrami that's why most delis unless they specialize in pastrami have it pre cut turkey roast beef ham not a problem a quick wipe and you can move on but pastrami big mess so they'll need a heads up to order it and then slice it for you Sandwich Breakfast Cuisine of Denmark Hamburger Hot dog Domesticated turkey Corned beef Delicatessen McDonald's Japanese cuisine Jewish cuisine Pizza Barbecue Brunch Bread Meal Tofu D__ner kebab In-N-Out Burger French cuisine Bagel Chili con carne Vegetarianism Soul food Clown Dim sum French fries Bengali cuisine Potato Ramen Ham Italian beef Korean cuisine Subway (restaurant) Sloppy joe Peruvian cuisine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Street food Japanese tea ceremony Chinatown Foodborne illness Dairy Coffee Cheese It's Walky!
