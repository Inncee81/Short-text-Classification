now how do i make good biscuts from scratch grandma's handmade homemade buttermilk biscuits i used to really enjoy hot fresh homemade buttermilk biscuits split one open and spread some fresh butter actually we always used margerine or slip in a fresh sausage patty there's nothing better after i learned to make them i also enjoyed just getting my hand dirty as i kneaded the dough kids have fun in the strangest way anyway here is how my grandma used to make them i don't think the store bought canned biscuits will ever even begin to compare ingredients cups all purpose flour teaspoons baking powder cups buttermilk teaspoon salt teaspoon baking soda cup crisco shortening sift the flour to make sure there are no lumps add in the baking powder salt and baking soda add the crisco slowly working it into the dry ingredients you can use a large spatula or spoon but i preferred using my hands next add the buttermilk working it into the mixture too after everything is thoroughly mixed plop it down on a floured counter top or cutting board turn you oven to to allow it to preheat while it's heating up knead your dough until it is about the consistency of clay that kids play with in grade school you can make it a little dryer if need be by sprinkling more flour on your counter or cutting board as you knead your dough it will pick up more of the flour after you have it the right consistency you can shape your biscuits by hand or using a cookie cutter i preferred pinching off a chunk rolling it into a ball and then patting it a little flat it takes a little practice to get you biscuits all about the same size if you want them more perfect you can roll out your dough using a rolling pin and then cut them with a round cookie cutter that would look neater when you have company over anyway place you biscuits on a cookie sheet that is either lightly greased or lightly sprinkled with flour if you use the flour option be sure not to put too much bake these biscuits for rougly minutes on the middle rack in your oven depends upon how hot your oven is and how far this rack is from the top if the rack is too low you can move the biscuits to the top rack the last minute of so to get them browned just the way you want leave them on the middle rack and thy should turn out lightly browned pop them out of the over and eat them while still piping hot that's the only way to get the butter to melt just right enjoy Puff pastry Biscuit Pizza Jewish cuisine Pottery Coffee Tortilla Breakfast Cooking weights and measures Pancake Chili con carne Japanese cuisine Idli Cuisine of Denmark Dim sum Tofu Bagel Ramen Hot dog Cuisine of the Southern United States Pasta Cake Cuisine of the Philippines Soul food Casting Dumpling Bengali cuisine Haggis Chocolate German cuisine Tea Maple syrup Baking Textile manufacturing Hamburger Cuisine of Brazil XML Drill bit Rice pudding Vinegar McDonald's Gumbo Cajun cuisine Butter Barbecue Seitan Glass Doughnut Cheese Baking powder Japanese tea ceremony Halva Cantonese cuisine Brewery Chocolate Salty Balls Cookware and bakeware Muffin Carbon dioxide In-N-Out Burger Mantou Poker jargon Fast bowling Bong Rigging Potato Naan Hay Cocaine Harp Plastic Dosa Mayonnaise Recipe Souffl__ Professional wrestling slang Breadmaker Margarine Toilet humour Baklava Pop-Tarts Steel Soap French fries Street food Turkish coffee Experiment Illegal drug trade Glossary of firefighting equipment
