how do i cook with a dutch oven i really must apologize straight away because this is an incredibly stupid question i was reading a magazine that features a woman who cooks meals whose healthy recipes are designed for those with ms she makes them all in a dutch oven though an item i've never heard of i've been looking at dutch ovens on ebay and in many of the ads they say things like you can use on stove top and in freezer they do not however point out specifically that it can be used inside an oven the chef who wrote the article cooks all of her meals in a dutch oven in her oven i can cook in a dutch oven in my oven right they're very expensive so i have to make the right choices here thank you a dutch oven is a heavy duty metal casserole dish with a lid it can be used on the stove or oven and can be put in the refrigerator or freezer so you can sear off stew meat or a roast on the stove before putting it in the oven in the same pan or use if for meats and stews that go directly in the oven or use it stove top to make a soup a good one may be expensive but they're versatile and a note to l c you're thinking of a double boiler Cookware and bakeware Barbecue Kitchen Cuisine of Denmark Microwave oven Cuisine of Laos Cuisine of the Southern United States Cantonese cuisine Bread Cooking Japanese cuisine Cajun cuisine Jewish cuisine British cuisine Cooking on a campfire Tofu Wok Ramen French fries Bacon Pizza Cuisine of the Philippines Hamburger Pancake Breakfast Chili con carne Dim sum Cuisine of Africa Russian cuisine Roast beef Dutch oven Bengali cuisine Slow cooker Spanish cuisine Beef noodle soup Recipe Portable stove Bagel Soup Sauerkraut Refrigerator Ice cream Joke Peking Duck German cuisine Dumpling MRE Korean cuisine Chinese cuisine Cassava Cuisine of Brazil Stir frying French cuisine Irish stew Roman eating and drinking Roux Lancashire Hotpot Major appliance Minestrone Kosher foods Sausage Rice cooker Goulash Hot pot Sandwich Yoghurt Kebab Idli Stock (food) Veganism Couscous Sushi Fire fighting Pea soup Iron Chef Cuisine of Finland In-N-Out Burger Potato Steaming Nabemono Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Comanche Sauce Cuisine of Thailand Little Britain Cholent Futurama (TV series - season 4) Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Peruvian cuisine Vegetarian cuisine
