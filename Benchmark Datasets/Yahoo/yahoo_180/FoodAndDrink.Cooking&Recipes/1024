i need help making my bread dough rise last week i tried to make bread according to a recipe i found in the book how to cook everything the recipe had you mixing all the dry ingredients including the yeast in a food processor then slowly adding the wet ingredients then you were supposed to knead the dough and let it rise well rise it didn't and it was a pretty warm day too degrees at room temperature does anyone have any suggestions it sounds like you used a recipe for a bread machine or instant yeast instant yeast has ascorbic acid on the granules to help them germinate and thus your bread can rise with out the babying of the regular yeast if you have regular yeast the above posters stated how to baby that also if you have the air conditioner running to a pretty cool room the bread will take a very long time to rise you might as well put it in the fridge and go off and forget it for hours Bread Beer Pizza Brewing Pasta Mantou Idli Carbon dioxide Tortilla Breadmaker Pancake Naan XML Jewish cuisine Yeast (baking) Food Apple pie Marmite Sourdough Dumpling Garlic Rum Cooking Hamburger Wine making Bagel Potato chips Rice pudding Vitamin C Tofu Breakfast German cuisine Recipe Puff pastry Pita Tamale Bacon Wheat beer Guinness Ice cream Cheese Climate of the United Kingdom Honey Ramen Cuisine of Brazil Curry Barbecue Bengali cuisine Sauna Muffin Chili con carne Veganism Frybread Mayonnaise Candidiasis Sushi Yeast Chocolate Cuisine of Malaysia Biscuit Slow cooker Instant coffee Organic food Cake Milkshake Make money fast Cider Soy protein Tea Fungus Paint Coffee Food science Coeliac disease French toast Plastic Pumpernickel bread French fries Alcohol fuel Vores __l Cajun cuisine Baking Roman eating and drinking Soy milk Refrigerator Ham Dim sum Fried dough foods Experiment Sauerkraut Natt__ Peruvian cuisine Soup Cookie
