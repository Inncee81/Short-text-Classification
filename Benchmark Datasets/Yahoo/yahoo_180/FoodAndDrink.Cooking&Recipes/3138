how long will caramel apples stay good i am getting married in october and i want to use caramel apples as favors i plan to make them myself i was wondering how many days ahead of my wedding i can make them and they will still be good for the wedding i know the day before the wedding is going to be hectic and i probably won't have time to make them the day before the wedding obviously the closer to the wedding day you make them the better but i would say days woul dbe ok kep at room temp so the carmel doesn't get too hard or too soft if anyone can help you make them then you could probably make them closer to the wedding day good luck and congratulations Toffee Cliff Richard Piccolo Junior Saga Haven (TNG episode) Aida (musical) Apple Cuisine of Denmark Pitaten ITunes Music Store Good Times Kit Kat Same-sex marriage in New York We Belong Together Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Cold Stone Creamery Series finale The Ashlee Simpson Show 2005 Ashes series 1987 World Series Brigadoon Candy Japanese calendar Duran Duran Champagne (beverage) Horseshoe A Milhouse Divided 2000 Australian Grand Prix 2001 World Series Avenue Q Buddy Clark Father's Day (Doctor Who) Eastern Orthodox Church USS Forrestal (CVA-59) EastEnders Paul Levesque Jennifer Lopez Homer Simpson Planet Waves About Schmidt Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles My Best Friend's Wedding Charles Goodyear Fiddler on the Roof Luck Halloween The McGuire Sisters Big Brother (Australian TV series) God Emperor of Dune The Star Wars Holiday Special Michael Owen My Big Fat Geek Wedding 1731 English cricket season All My Children Order of the British Empire Apple Lisa Same-sex marriage in the United States Lucille Ball Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Joan Collins Apple IIGS Blackadder Poker jargon Oh My Goddess!
