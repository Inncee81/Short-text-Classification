how do you make cream cheese pie as opposed to cheesecake i'm trying to make a cream cheese pie not a cheesecake one difference is that the cream cheese pie is not baked it has a different consistencey about as firm as ice cream but smoother and not frozen it dosen't have the cake like consistency of cheesecake anyway i'm using the following recipe ingredients inch prepared graham cracker crust ounce can light cherry pie filling ounce package cream cheese softened ounce can sweetened condensed milk cup lemon juice teaspoon vanilla extract directions beat cream cheese until light and fluffy gradually add sweetened condensed milk and continue beating until smooth and combined add lemon juice and vanilla mix well fill graham cracker crust evenly refrigerate until set this will take between to hours the end result cream cheese soup does anybody know how i can firm this up or am i doing something wrong i definitely used sweetened condensed milk not evaporated milk thanks for the responses i'll try it again did not add cheries either i have a can to spoon over slices ater it sets and i cut it but i didn't add it to the mix that is the exact recipe i've used for years with excellent results the only thing i can think of that you possibly did wrong is maybe use a can of condensed milk instead of sweetened condensed milk they are not the same consistency also you didn't add the cherries to it did you it will thicken as it gets colder in the fridge and the cream chesse hardens back up if you softened the cream cheese in the microwave that might mess up the consistency too sorry that's all i can come up with Tofu Cheesecake Cake Coffee Dairy Apple pie Cheese Pancake Pizza Cuisine of the Philippines Chocolate Cuisine of Denmark Tea Bread German cuisine Key lime pie Yoghurt Pie Soft drink Jewish cuisine Milkshake Heath bar Cha chaan teng Martini cocktail Hong Kong-style milk tea Japanese cuisine Bagel Soup Russian cuisine Milk Baked Alaska Cookie Rum Yoplait Peruvian cuisine Food Custard Refrigerator D__ner kebab Tooth Dairy product Potato French toast Vinegar Mayonnaise Souffl__ Maple syrup Cuisine of Singapore British cuisine McDonald's Cuisine of Brazil Hot dog Bengali cuisine Chowder Kosher foods Sour cream Muesli Cajun cuisine Paneer Gatorade Soy protein Condensed milk Oreo In-N-Out Burger Curry Jelly Belly Veganism Cuisine of Austria Soy milk Kraft Dinner Cuisine of Greece Idli Butter Campbell Soup Company Vanilla Persian cuisine Lemonade Dulce de leche Laksa Vegetarian cuisine B__chamel sauce Cuisine of New England Brewery Honey Food preservation Gelato Soul food
