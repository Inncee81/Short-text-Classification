are baking soda and baking powder the same thing and when using do you always put the baking powder in some hot water is baking soda heheeh grammar make me look so silly hehe good thing i asked not the same not in hot water you might be thinking of 'blooming' geletin making a 'slurry' with cornstarch or 'proofing' yeast all water methods used with powders baking soda sodium bicarbonate is the chemical compound with the formula nahco because it has long been known and is widely used the salt has many other names including sodium hydrogencarbonate sodium bicarb baking soda bread soda cooking soda bicarb soda saleratus or bicarbonate of soda it is soluble in water sodium bicarbonate is a white solid that is crystalline but often appears as a fine powder it has a slight alkaline taste resembling that of sodium carbonate it is a component of the mineral natron and is found dissolved in many mineral springs the natural mineral form is known as nahcolite it is also produced artificially baking powder is a dry chemical leavening agent used in baking and deodorizing there are several formulations all contain an alkali typically sodium bicarbonate baking soda and an acid in the form of salt crystals together with starch to keep it dry when dissolved in water the acid and alkali react and emit carbon dioxide gas which expands existing bubbles to leaven the mixture most modern baking powders are double acting that is they contain two acid salts one which reacts at room temperature producing a rise as soon as the dough or batter is prepared and another which reacts at a higher temperature causing a further rise during baking baking powders that contain only the low temperature acid salts are called single acting many recipes call for a process called creaming where butter and sugar are beaten together to introduce tiny seed bubbles which the leavening gas will further expand Flour Acetic acid Fire extinguisher Alcohol Ammonia Hydrochloric acid Sodium sulfate Titanium Cocoa Hydrogen chloride Sourdough Sodium hydroxide Sugar Water purification Cocaine Plastic Silicon Salt Chlorine Glass Leblanc process Soap Ice cream Tofu Tea Hard water Carbonated water Nitric acid Ceramics E number Solvay process Uranium Magnesium Flue gas desulfurization Explosive material Lithium Aluminium Coffee Mineral Potassium Base (chemistry) Carboxylic acid Carbon Portland cement Dumpling Dishwasher Hydrogen peroxide Copper extraction Cookware and bakeware Pottery Hydrogen Phosphorus Water Vanadium(V) oxide Edible salt Illegal drug trade Alkane Monosodium glutamate Sodium acetate Dye Coal Sugar substitute Enzyme Jewish cuisine Calcium carbonate Polyethylene terephthalate Casting Haloalkane Hydrogen sulfide Paint Soy protein Corrosion Technetium Beer Baking Ramen Nitrogen Dairy Desert Soil pH Gasoline Hydride Biochemistry Cake Barbecue
