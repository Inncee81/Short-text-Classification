you make my dinner for a whole week i am giving anybody a chance to make me a menu for me and my husband we will try any food i am so sick of thinking of what to have for dinner and my husband never tells me what he wants we like any food and we will try any food except for any type of fish and sushi manke me a menu and if i choose your food you will be chosen as the best answer good luck recipes linked below from sparkrecipes com a website of sparkpeople com most are healthier versions of many dishes and some original recipes from spark employees and the registered users most of the recipes listed i've made and enjoyed o baked ziti served with garlic bread and grilled or baked eggplant and zuchinni can add cooked meat to the 'meatless' recipe and substitute the cottage cheese for ricotta cheese i used zuchinni squash and eggplant and baked it in the oven while cooking the pasta my husband doesn't like eggplant so we kept it on the side instead of just putting in the skillet turkey tacos spanish rice and black beans we use lean ground beef and add part skim but my husband doesn't know cheese for the spanish rice my husband usually makes white rice and adds rotel oregano and other spices but the recipe below sounded good chicken melt sandwich with apple or sweet potato fries and or a favorite soup i use wheat bread instead of rye and add avocado and other veggies then julienne an apple or sweet potato and bake on a cookie sheet like baked french fries gourmet chicken salad serve on or with a large croissant roll and garden salad or whatever sounds good meat loaf serve with toast and green beans corn mashed potatoes spinach or any other vegetable s that sound good on the particular night also good with apple or sweet potato fries chicken stir fry and rice or noodles i use my husband's recipe or he cooks it basically a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables carrots broccoli and waterchesnuts stir fry sauce in the marinade and or asian oriental section of the grocery store and chicken or sirloin tips or top round all cooked in a skillet i've never used the recipe for stir fry linked below but it seems like a good place to start i'd add some broccoli and maybe cashews or pineapple vegetable sirloin kabobs i don't use the linked recipe i use sirloin or chicken or just veggies mushrooms squash zuchinni tomatoes and other veggies we feel like at the time or that look good at the store cut them up and grill them on skewers sometimes we marinade them sometimes we don't and we use different marinades just about every time i hope you enjoy these recipes or find some you like at sparkrecipes com you can also look at the world's healthiest foods website they have a database where you can select which foods you want in a recipe and it will bring up all the recipes in the database using the food s selected also if you register with sparkpeople com it's free and doesn't take that long you can use their meal plans they give you suggestions for breakfast lunch and dinner i usually don't use them now but i did for a while now i just think about what i want for the week and make a menu on saturday monday sunday then go to the store sunday evening but sparkpeople com is a 'healthy lifestyle' site weight loss and maintaining so the recipes they suggest will be 'healthy' at least healthier than the regular version of the recipe but all the recipes i've made i'd make them again and most of them my husband likes too o and while you probably won't need recipes for most of this stuff if there's a recipe for it i'll link it Food preservation Cincinnati chili Bacon Vegetarianism Cookware and bakeware Tomato Italian cuisine Serbian cuisine Gumbo Irish breakfast Cuisine of Austria Flour Cheese Ice cream Sushi Tamale Steak n Shake Veganism Meatloaf Delicatessen Ketchup Swedish cuisine Burger Mayonnaise Muffin Taco Cuisine of India Oregano Porridge Fast-food restaurant Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Kraft Dinner
