how do the characteristics of a gas stove enable food to be cooked faster than that of a charcoal stove it's all about heat control and convection you have more control over the heating with gas than you do with charcoal because the gas burns at a constant rate with charcoal it can have 'cold spots' and also has a rate of heat increase a hold time at the maximum temperature and a rate of heat decrease as most of the charcoal fuel has been used Stove Portable stove Explosive material Renewable energy Heat Carbon dioxide Furnace Barbecue Temperature Internal ballistics Charcoal Welding Incandescent light bulb Forge Carburetor Jet engine Wood fuel Warm-blooded Coal Steel Grill Kitchen Gas metal arc welding Solar power Biofuel Diesel engine Wind power Nuclear fusion Beverage can stove Turbocharger Urban heat island Helium Entropy Combustion Water (molecule) Steam engine Carbon Spark plug Fire fighting Heat engine Pebble bed reactor Turbojet Chemical reaction Alcohol fuel Rocket fuel Motor oil Nuclear reactor Fuel injection Wok Autonomous building Energy development Biodiesel Sun Ocean thermal energy conversion Turbofan Hydrogen economy Space shuttle main engine Oxygen sensor Gas turbine Ironing Water Tank Paracetamol Convection Thermoregulation E85 Natural gas Gas tungsten arc welding Cold fusion Heat sink Evaporation Partial pressure Ozone depletion Pressurized water reactor Fossil fuel power plant Axial compressor Petroleum Fire extinguisher Rebreather Scramjet Firestorm Deforestation Liquified petroleum gas Specific heat capacity Climate change Battery (electricity) Uranium Future energy development Hot air balloon Solar variation Stirling engine Fuel Energy Greenhouse effect Ozone hole Plastic Thunderstorm Supercharger
