could i get some help with a recipe conversion i want to convert a regular recipe into a bread machine recipe or just the kneading process really for a pizza dough how would i go about this i have already compared the amounts for a bread machine pizza dough recipe and this one and they are incredibly similar so i don't think i'll have to worry about that but i'm a little worried about the kneading time is it possible to over knead dough the regular recipe calls for minutes of kneading and my dough setting does if i did that would it affect the dough and the end result or should i just program my machine to knead minutes i know that sounds stupid but i don't want that programming the machine to affect my dough differently either i don't think it will be over kneaded minutes of hand kneading will work the dough at least as much as minutes of kneading with the little paddle in you machine also a good part of that time is actually mixing the dough ingredients together something you do before you start the minutes of hand kneading if you are concerned just watch it and as soon as it forms a nice smooth elastic ball turn of the machine and take out the dough bert Bread Pizza XML Pasta Cheese Pottery Mantou Breadmaker Experiment Naan Bagel Tortilla Food Flour Fried dough foods Dumpling Pita Idli Japanese cuisine Seitan Breakfast Carbon dioxide Potato chips Italian cuisine Puff pastry German cuisine Massage Tic-Tac-Dough Gingerbread Table tennis Doughnut Sushi Supply and demand Street food Drawing Microeconomics Apple pie Cooking weights and measures Oregano Jewish cuisine Compiler optimization Jiaozi Frybread Recipe Cookie Gluten Pancake Weight training Computer Central processing unit Tamale Tofu C programming language B__chamel sauce Taliesin Singlish Electrophysiology Alice B.
