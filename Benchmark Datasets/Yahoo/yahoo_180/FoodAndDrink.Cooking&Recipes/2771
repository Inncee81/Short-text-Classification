i'm baking a cake so which pan should i use well i'm baking a moist white cake and the recipe says that i should use a x baking pan but i don't have this type of pan all i have is an approx size x baking pan is that ok to use instead or will that affect the cake somehow well the x is smaller than the x so the cake batter will fill the x higher that will influence baking time since you have more batter mounded i would suggest using two x you'll get an ever so slightly thinner cakes but you won't have the big thick mounding that you'll have with only one x just doing the math a x pan is filled with of batter a volume of cu in using one x will fill the pan by inches of batter that's over a half inch extra using two x pans the batter level will be that's less than a quarter inch difference that's why i'd recommend using two x pans the main effect no matter which size pan you pick is that cooking times will need to be adjusted basically with two x you need to check sooner since it will probably cook faster and just using one x takes longer to cook Pancake Bread Cookie Pizza Cuisine of Denmark Cookware and bakeware Doughnut Violin Cuisine of the Southern United States Flour Hot dog Tofu Muffin Textile manufacturing Puberty Carburetor Internal ballistics Mattress Diamond cut Fish and chips Chocolate Cuisine of Singapore Redundant array of independent disks German cuisine Softball Jewish cuisine Dumpling Bagel Potato Sea level rise Mooncake Baking Chicago-style pizza Cartridge (firearms) Baked Alaska Baseball Sushi GunBound Barbecue Audio tape length and thickness Cuisine of Malaysia Cold Stone Creamery Bacon Vacuum Extraterrestrial skies Champagne (beverage) Baking powder Electrophysiology Bed (furniture) Motor oil Bengali cuisine Paper size Strap-on dildo Cooking Casting Cuisine of the Philippines Roman eating and drinking Slow cooker CPU cache Potato pancakes Twinkie Baseball Stars Drill bit Dosa Cake Wood Waffle Prostate cancer RuneScape skills Single Transferable Vote Transformer Amateur telescope making Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Dog agility Campfire Screw Fried dough foods Maple syrup French cuisine Bullet Dim sum Stage lighting Soul food Knife Bass guitar Gramophone record Color Betting (poker) Baked beans M16 (rifle) Pie Crossword Firework Rum Chinese New Year Cocaine Equine conformation Spark plug
