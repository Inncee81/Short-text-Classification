anybody know any good demi glaze recipes it can be simple or hard doesnt matter make a brown beef veal stock for it use large amount of shin bones and give a deep roasting after finishing and straining stock reduce it sometimes people only reduce their stock and thicken it with a roux or cornstarch this is actually called fond lie but it is good for most all brown sauce production for a better sauce base make demi glace i suggest if some day you want to really delve deep into sauce making that you try making a coulis it involves several wettings or simmering of meat in the same broth it is very rich and very expensive to make back to the demi glace half glace i use the techniques of escoffier who first made an espagnole from which he made his demi glace make a brown roux add the brown stock to roux escoffier reduces it this way i have altered it somewhat by reducing my stock by before thickening with the roux i do this so i have less time to reduce with the roux and less worry about it sticking to the pot and burning when i am busy simmer the thickened stock by putting the pot half way over the heat source it simmers do not boil the stock one side of the pot allowing the scum to be more easily skimmed sweat some diced bacon in a saute pour off most of the fat add mirepoix and thyme bay leaves pour and deglaze the pan with some white wine reduce by half add the veg pork mix to stock continue to skim the bitter scum layer i sometimes i do this part but escoffier says after a couple of hours of simmering strain the stock add more brown stock to the above strained stock and continue with simmering and reducing this adds more cooking time but more complex flavor as well the extended heating allows for more carmalization of sugars proteins browning of the stock this will make it very rich this is optional the last hours of simmering add tomatoes tomato puree adding a nice richness to the demi glace after your total volume has reduced by to strain the length of simmering time will be determined by your needs more stock can always be added to increse times which increases the flavor density good luck enjoy Japanese cuisine Tofu Sauce Gumbo Barbecue Roux Chicken soup Cantonese cuisine French cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Cuisine of the Philippines Consomm__ Chili con carne Hot dog Bacon Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Brazil Coffee Ramen German cuisine Hot pot Dairy Brewery Peruvian cuisine Rum Soup Milk Cuisine of Greece Beef noodle soup Bengali cuisine Pasta Pizza Bread Korean cuisine Nabemono Tamale Sugar Donburi Risotto Chocolate Jewish cuisine Roman eating and drinking Russian cuisine Fish sauce Cincinnati chili Soap Beer Soy sauce Cheese Butter Flour Ketchup Bolognese sauce Sake Fondue Dim sum Yoghurt Idli Food preservation Internal ballistics Seitan Ham Mayonnaise Ice cream Basic taste Cuisine of Africa Cuisine of Argentina French fries Dumpling Cuisine of Canada Sewage treatment McDonald's Alcoholic beverage Soul food Casting Roast beef Cooking Maple syrup Curry Starch Pot Noodle Explosive material Tlingit Sandwich Soy milk Plastic
