can you get sick if you put two meats in the same container i was slicing some ham and salami on the meat slicer and i put both meats in the same container my supervisor saw me and he started yelling at me and he was telling me that s cross contamination and i m supposed to keep foods separate from each other he said people can get sick i was wondering why putting meats in the same container would be a problem when both meats are going to end up on the same plate anyways so if i have a ham and salami sandwich i can get sick from that because of cross contamination it is probably more for the good habits fact to not ever put two different items in the same container than the sick factor unless someone could be allergic to one of the ingredients i say the super is correct but at the same time so are you both meats are cooked so no x contamination could occur but you also need to get into a habit of not mixing ingredients especially in a restaurant situation think of people's allergies Hamburger Food Breakfast German cuisine Foodborne illness Sandwich Sushi Japanese cuisine In-N-Out Burger French cuisine McDonald's Salad Escherichia coli O157:H7 Horse meat D__ner kebab Cuisine of the Southern United States Sausage Sauerkraut Barbecue Hot dog Chinese cuisine Peruvian cuisine Halaal Ham Cha chaan teng Kosher foods Cuisine of the Philippines Bagel Surimi Quesadilla Jewish cuisine Ice cream Bento Hot pot Cuisine of Argentina Korean cuisine Soup Egg (food) Cantonese cuisine Dog Cuisine of Africa Bread Kashrut Taboo food and drink Cuisine of Malaysia Organic farming Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Tofu Pea soup Tattoo Allergy Ham sandwich theorem Dim sum Bengali cuisine Pollution Soul food Cheesesteak Fast food Cuisine of Brazil Peanut In vitro meat Cuisine of Laos Meat MRE Atkins Nutritional Approach Offal Chili con carne Meat analogue French toast Vegetarianism Veganism Healthy eating Kitchen Pig Fast-food restaurant Chernobyl accident Hamming code Irish breakfast One Piece minor characters Fugu American Chinese cuisine Chicken McNuggets Stock (food) Cuisine of Vietnam Hakka cuisine Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Vegetarian cuisine Pie Subway (restaurant) Health insurance Irish cuisine Peanut butter Baking Cooking Cuisine of Singapore Canadian Chinese cuisine
