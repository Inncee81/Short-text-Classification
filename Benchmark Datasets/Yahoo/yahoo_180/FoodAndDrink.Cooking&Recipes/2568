what are some of the effects of dextrinization on starch got to do with flavour of sponge cake this is what i have for you i hope that it in some way contributes to your needs some functional properties of starch hydrolysis are body formation foam stabilization and sugar crystallization prevention dextrinization is the enzymatic process where alpha amylase starch enzyme degrades soluble starch molecules into dextrin molecules i do not have access to a text on chemical actions in baked goods however i can piece together a reasonable accounting of the process requested some dextrins are only very slightly sweet but further acid industrially or enzymatic conversions of starch to dextrins can increase food sweetness a bit the dextrine formation will also contribute to foam stabilization in the short time that a foam exists in a sponge cake i cannot be sure what extent the foam stabilization action of dextrin would be but we can assume that it does so to the extent that the foam remains a viable leavener until the cake is set then a major benefit is realized by the dextrinization on starch in your cake the main point was on flavor again with enough degradation of the starch to smaller dextrine units an increase of sweetness is realized if an acid s are utilized and if consumed in the conversion of starch to dextrins then a decrease in acid would mean less sourness in taste very subtle i am sure dextrins can also add to a fuller mouth feel in beverages will it do the same in a cake good luck and enjoy Brewery Bread Starch Tofu Chocolate Sugar Beer Cyclodextrin Carbon dioxide Coffee Glycerin Sugar substitute Citric acid Biochemistry Glucose Sake Alcohol fuel Aspartame Cell (biology) Brewing Milk Food additive Polysaccharide Alcohol Protein E number Water (molecule) Insulin Cheese Plastic Cocoa DNA repair Ozone depletion Saliva Nutrition Potato Francis Crick Photosynthesis Tea DNA Amino acid Corn syrup Messenger RNA Microeconomics Hydrochloric acid Protein sequencing Ecology Sulfur Iron Vinegar Alcoholic beverage Omega-3 fatty acid Ammonia Ethanol Formic acid Sewage treatment Water Haloalkane Explosive material Amylase Cookware and bakeware Lactic acid Glucokinase Fermentation Signal transduction Ice cream Flour Cellular respiration Espresso Vitamin C Monosodium glutamate Agriculture Sodium sulfate Cuisine of the Philippines Polychlorinated biphenyl Single malt Scotch Metabolism Organic food Pisco Hydrogen peroxide Deforestation Antioxidant Alzheimer's disease Cider Biomolecule Tocopherol Energy Fatty acid
