how long do you boil corn for fresh corn on the cob i love my corn just cooked take the husk and the silk strings off microwave place in a freezer bag and add a little water cook on high for minutes for corn cob large steamer bring water to the boil and steam for minutes boil bring water to the boil add corn and boil for minutes it will be cooked and isn't soggy it is be full of flavour and will be juicy crisp and sweet add a little butter some salt and pepper if desired and chop up some chives for a colourful effect when serving to guests i prefer to steam or microwave steam as it keeps more nutrients in when cooking with only a little bit of water as opposed to boiling in an abundance of water cooking all vegetables this way steaming will keep all the nutrients in if you do boil veggies and the water changes colour then there are no nutrients in the vegetables any more it is best to only cook them for a few minutes and then plunge them into cold water to stop the cooking process and keep their bright colours hope this helps and have a great day night x k Tofu Cuisine of Denmark Maize Rice Sweetcorn Barbecue Food preservation Hot dog Peruvian cuisine Ice cream Cantonese cuisine Jewish cuisine Japanese cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States Chili con carne Cuisine of the Philippines Microwave oven Cajun cuisine Bengali cuisine Ramen Chicken soup Haggis Soul food Russian cuisine Bread Dumpling German cuisine Bagel Roman eating and drinking Steaming Sauce Ketchup Dim sum French fries Onion Cuisine of Africa Stock (food) Brewery Cooking Couscous Breakfast Cuisine of Malaysia Cuisine of Laos Bacon Korean cuisine Coffee Japanese tea ceremony Cuisine of Brazil Common bean Rice pudding Chowder Gumbo Peanut Brewing Recipe Curry Beer Healthy eating Risotto Steam engine Domesticated turkey Kitchen Ammonia Nabemono Water (molecule) French cuisine Rice cooker Basil Hydroponics Eutrophication Peanut butter Potato chips Soup Corned beef MRE Water purification Miso Egg (food) Roux Hop (plant) Milk Quinoa Halva Sauerkraut Vegetarianism Kraft Dinner Mashed potato Porridge Asparagus Turkish coffee
