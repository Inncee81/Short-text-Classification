how can i make hashbrowns like the ones they give at denny's i have a food proccesor would that help they like almost every other restaurant buy the hashbrowns pre made and frozen you can call around your area to various food distributors and ask them if you can purchase some they may not sell them in any form other than bulk so try the grocery stores most of the stores carry only certain brands that aren't as good as restaurant style and you'll screw them up the first couple of times by under or overcooking them feel free to ask your waiter waitress to inquire as to the brand name and i'm almost certain a manager will tell you where they get them homemade quality varies with potato types i find the red potatos to be more firm and easier to work with and if you boil them for a very short time not soft let them cool and then grate and fry in a small amount of good oil you can get fairly close but my recommendation would be to locate the frozen if you want exact nad Ice cream French fries Food Potato Ramen Fish and chips Pizza Bulk vending Cuisine of Denmark McDonald's In-N-Out Burger Illegal drug trade Mattress French cuisine Peruvian cuisine Korean cuisine Soft drink German cuisine Fast-food restaurant Organic food Sears Holdings Corporation Burger King Delicatessen Inventory ITunes Music Store Alcoholic beverage A&W Restaurants Croquet (food) Hot dog Knife Deep frying Cuisine of Brazil Chili con carne Microeconomics Bengali cuisine Mayonnaise Food preservation Potato chips Coffee Wal-Mart Drill bit Breakfast Trademark Supermarket McCain Foods Limited 7-Eleven Egg (food) Tesco Japanese cuisine Cuisine of the Southern United States Dairy Queen Chocolate Wall Street Irish breakfast Bagel Convenience store Pancake Beer Brewery Barbecue Cajun cuisine ConAgra Foods, Inc.
