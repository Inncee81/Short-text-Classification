preserved cherries are these still good i found a jar of cherries preserved in kirsch at the back of my fridge when i was cleaning it out they were given to me by a friend so they're not a commercial product the lid didn't pop when i opened it so i don't think it was really sealed the way you would do if you were canning vegetables or something but they are in a solution of nothing except kirsch and a little sugar no sign of mold and they smell fine but i'm pretty sure they were in there for about years would they stay all right to eat for that long thanks mlf your reading skills are not very good i clean out my fridge every month i just haven't thrown this particular jar of cherries away because i didn't want to toss a homemade gift if it might still be good and i just wasn't sure hope your snarky moment there helped you have a good day sheesh i was totally sidetracked at your question when i realized that you haven't cleaned your refrigerator in years that's absolutely disgusting Sauerkraut Cuisine of Denmark Refrigerator Tofu Futurama (TV series - season 2) Kodocha Canning The Jam Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Chinese New Year Theory of conduct Social rule Fancy rat Cheese Methos Coffee Ron and Fez Tomato Food storage Shaggy dog story Foodborne illness Japanese toilet Tlingit Food Mountain Dew Kitchen Tamper-evident Shit Sausage Napoleon Dynamite Antidepressant Aerial (dance move) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Organic food Humphrey Bogart Cannabis cultivation Sharon Tate Singlish Vinegar Mouse (computing) Blonde on Blonde Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mayonnaise The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Cardcaptor Sakura Hamster Luke Skywalker Prince (artist) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Beach Boys Rum Wine Good Morning, Vietnam Peanut butter Timeline of alternative rock Kurt Cobain Stir frying Pandora Phoebe Buffay's songs The Ashlee Simpson Show Ron Weasley Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Citric acid Charles Goodyear One Piece minor characters Jon Secada Phonograph cylinder Tori Amos Bong Sushi Piccolo Junior Saga Pop-Tarts Avenue Q Dr Pepper Milton H.
