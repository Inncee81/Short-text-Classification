why does stocks open in a strong decline after a bad news if the stock market was closed for example one stock closes at on monday then monday night when nasdaq is closed the company releases bad news tuesday when the stock market opens the stock already opens at a down gap but how if the stock market was closed how that the gap was created the stock market works like an auction and the current price of the stock is simply the price of its latest transaction just because people bought the stock at last time doesn't mean that they will buy it at the same price next time in an auction the price keeps going down until a willing buyer is found and the price at which this stock is sold then becomes the current price of the stock a gap is created when no willing buyers can be found at the last transaction price and sellers keep bringing down their asking price until a willing buyer is found the price of the stock in this latest transaction then becomes the new price of the stock New York Stock Exchange Technical analysis Stock Call option Arbitrage Auction Short selling Supply and demand Option Day trading Futures contract Real estate broker NASDAQ Financial markets Atari Temasek Holdings Mutual fund Foreign exchange market Economics Surplus value Enron Corporation Insider trading Put option Capitalism Marketing Stock market downturn of 2002 Price discrimination Microsoft Initial public offering ITunes Music Store Stock exchange Dot-com Monopoly (game) Economy of Russia Sears Holdings Corporation Mergers and acquisitions Berkshire Hathaway Money supply Investment bank Dividend Rational pricing Adverse selection Ford Motor Company Margin (finance) Derivative (finance) Stock market index Speculation American Broadcasting Company Asian financial crisis Google Closed-end fund Dow Jones Industrial Average Bretton Woods system Security (finance) Free market Hedge fund Network effect Bond Economy of Nigeria Efficient market hypothesis Privatization ETrading Citigroup Reverse auction Microeconomics The Wealth of Nations Option style Market economy Fair market value Commodity Costco Neopets Gross domestic product Gold standard Black-Scholes Wal-Mart Annuity Michael Milken Islamic banking Transaction cost Amazon.com Real estate economics Warren Buffett Market Gold as an investment Equity investment Mutual-fund scandal (2003) Conveyancing Illegal drug trade Liberty Dollar Corporation Ming Pao Online auction business model Deflation (economics)
