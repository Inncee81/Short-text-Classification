are dividends yield measured annually for example pepsico div yield according to yahoo finance is is that paid quarterly or is the for the whole year if for the whole year why would i invest in this stock when i could invest in a cd or mutual fund that pays more than return annually any help would be appreicated yes the div and the yield is an annual amount the part you are forgetting here is that the real reason you are buying the stock is for the capital appreciation you want the stock itself to go up in value a cd certainly wont do that please also note that dividends and the amount that the stock goes up in value if you hold it for more than year is tax advantaged and is taxed at the interest you earn on a cd is taxed at your normal income rate as for the mutual fund that returns a higher rate that is always something you can consider although the taxes can be more complicated there depending on how they sell stocks during the year they can really throw you off by buying and selling stocks in less than a year Mutual fund Bond Annuity PE ratio Income trust Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Microeconomics Insurance 401(k) Surplus value Life insurance Income tax Cost of capital Gross domestic product Warren Buffett Derivative (finance) Capital accumulation Economy of Russia Flat tax Stock Citigroup Equity investment Social Security (United States) Individual Savings Account Eugene Fama Investment bank Corporation Security (finance) Black-Scholes Rational pricing Lloyd's of London Progressive tax Bretton Woods system Supply-side economics Income Federal Reserve Capital gains tax Wealth condensation Fixed income Finance Free trade FairTax Mortgage Financial markets Yield curve Islamic banking Income statement Debt Hyperinflation Dividend imputation Short selling Measures of national income and output Mergers and acquisitions Money supply Anarchism and capitalism Inflation Productive and unproductive labour Exchange-traded fund Futures contract Economic rent Economy of Pakistan Treasury security Gold standard Capital asset pricing model Technical analysis Keynesian economics Economy of Chile Supply and demand Conglomerate (company) Social Security debate (United States) Airline Dot-com Financial services Student loan Gold as an investment Municipal bond Retirement plan Michael Milken Berkshire Hathaway Stock market Ponzi scheme Monopoly (game) Tax haven Collateralized debt obligation Compensation of employees Labor theory of value
