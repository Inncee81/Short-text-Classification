i am a new in the stock market and have a question i just recently opened an account on sharebuilder i have never traded before and i thought it would to fun to try it out i was wondering if this is the right way to trade or if im missing something i see that the day high and day low for this particular stock goes up and down everyday by like a dollar or is it smart to buy about shares set a limit order to buy low and then set a limit order higher after the purchase to sell in the same day i figure if you could get to dollars a share i could pocket to extra dollars a day is this the right way to trade day to day or am i missing something and will end up losing you can do whatever you want as long as it makes money that is the bottom line you can try it once and then ask yourself did you get the profit you expected or was there some hidden costs if you did not get the profit you expected then you have to re evaluate your idea Arbitrage PE ratio Mutual fund Day trading Short selling Tesco Stock Corporation Enron Corporation Supply and demand Citigroup Poker jargon Microeconomics Stock market Wal-Mart Mergers and acquisitions Asian financial crisis Hedge fund Economy of Russia Illegal drug trade Gross domestic product Warren Buffett Economics United States dollar Bretton Woods system Capital accumulation Inflation Gold standard Insurance Deflation (economics) Foreign exchange market MMORPG Derivative (finance) Technical analysis Insider trading Call option Investment bank Hyperinflation Money Privatization Security (finance) Airline Labor theory of value Price discrimination Gold as an investment Temasek Holdings The Apprentice 2 Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Publicly funded medicine Eircom Political economy Option Economy of Pakistan FairTax Debt Ra (board game) Free trade Ryanair Capitalism Neopets Overclocking Supply-side economics Kyoto Protocol Law of value Euro Credit card Surplus value Manitoba Hydro Wall Street Crash of 1929 Bond Life insurance Keynesian economics Ford Motor Company DaimlerChrysler smart Rational pricing Timeline of the Enron scandal Monopoly (game) Dot-com Monopoly Wheel of Fortune Bank Progressive tax Canadian and American economies compared Microsoft Minimum wage Money supply Health insurance Tax Federal Reserve Flat tax Octopus card Commodity Hedge (finance) Economy of Chile Oil-for-Food Programme Islamic banking Economy of India
