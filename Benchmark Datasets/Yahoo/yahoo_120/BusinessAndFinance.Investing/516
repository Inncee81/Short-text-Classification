if a private equity firm buys out a company at x share are shareholders guaranteed that x share in cash i own arxx stock which will likely be bought out by a private equity firm veritas capital fund at share am i as shareholder guaranteed share will it be in cash i'm trying to figure out why any 'shareholders on record as of june th' would sell this stock below at this point also what would happen to shares bought after june th never been in a buyout situation before thanks if the terms of the offer is for all cash of per share of your arxx you will receive this amount after the deal closes this may take weeks or months to process generally it will be deposited into your brokerage account if you hold stock certificates you will need to send them into the transfer agent to receive the funds from the buyout the reason some people sell their shares before this date is to get their funds sooner you can think of it like selling their right to receive at a later date since they are getting their money in advance there must be an incentive to the buyer of the stock in order for him to buy as the payout date comes closer the will be a cut off date on the last day to trade the shares this should make it so that all the shares are settled prior to the payout if there is an error it will be sorted out during the clearing process by the transfer agent and the clearing department of your brokerage house Mergers and acquisitions Stock Security (finance) Mutual fund Stock market Corporate finance Investment bank Annuity Institutional fund management Finance Insurance Temasek Holdings Financial services Citigroup Derivative (finance) Bond Internet fraud Short selling Corporation Margin (finance) Mortgage Hedge fund Monetary policy Enron Corporation Day trading Privatization PE ratio Warren Buffett Life insurance Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Bank United Kingdom corporation tax Closed-end fund Financial audit Venture capital Stock broker Eliot Spitzer Corporate governance Futures contract Contract Wells Fargo Sears Holdings Corporation Money supply Timeline of the Enron scandal Morgan Stanley Income trust Individual Savings Account Financial analyst Wall Street Capitalism Market capitalization Bank fraud Deflation (economics) Joint stock company Leveraged buyout Harken Energy Scandal Variable universal life insurance Gold as an investment Dot-com Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited Islamic banking Advance fee fraud Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Incentive Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Retirement plan Capital accumulation Ford Motor Company DBS Bank Stock market index Acquire SCO-Linux controversies Social Security debate (United States) American Broadcasting Company Asian financial crisis Primerica Financial Services Surplus value Federal National Mortgage Association Gross domestic product Octopus card Insider trading Construction Debt Microsoft Treasury security Gold standard
