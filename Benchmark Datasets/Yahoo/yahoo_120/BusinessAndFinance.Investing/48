camarilla equation does anyone have adverse comments about using the camarilla equation on the djia index end of day positions thank you the caramilla equation was developed for use in day trading but i see no reason why it couldn't be used for end of day positions also the camarilla equation is a popular secret day trading equation its discovery is commonly attributed to day trader nick scott the principle behind the camarilla equation is the idea that market trends tend over time to revert to a mean the camarilla equation takes four variables from the previous trading day the market opening market closing high and low based on these variables the equation generates eight price levels the lowest four are support levels labeled from l to l the highest four are resistance levels labeled from h to h these levels represent points at which a reverse toward the mean will occur on a given trading day levels l and h are the most important levels generated by the equation at level l the market is strongly supported suggesting a reverse toward higher prices at level h the market has a strong resistance suggesting a reverse toward lower prices levels l and h are breakout levels meaning that if market prices exceed these levels the equation asserts that this breakout trend will continue for some time due to its secret nature there are many different versions of the camarilla equation some more complicated and accurate than others the validity of the camarilla equation is debated and research on its predictive ability is currently being done by trader steve waller the name comes from the spanish word camarilla meaning a group of secret advisors often involved in intrigues Technical analysis Inflation Economics Supply and demand Capitalism Microeconomics Free trade Causality Intelligence quotient Black hole Minimum wage Price equation Yield curve Monetary policy General relativity Liberal Democrats (UK) Keynesian economics Gravity Law of value Explosive material Supply-side economics Mutual fund Surplus value Ozone depletion Luminiferous aether Sea level rise Entropy Capital accumulation Global climate model Quantum mechanics Prices of production Kyoto Protocol Obesity Hypoglycemia Dow Jones Industrial Average Day trading Economy of Russia Operational amplifier Solar variation Tide Capital asset pricing model Human Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Special relativity Gross domestic product Ozone hole Economy of Africa Action potential Voter turnout Many-worlds interpretation Futures contract Pound sterling Doomsday argument Economic inequality Social Security debate (United States) Second language acquisition Strategic management Labor theory of value Big Bang Probability ELO rating system Derivative (finance) Democracy Diamond American individualist anarchism Antiretroviral drug Free market Macroevolution Mathematics of general relativity Dirac equation Experiment Political economy Physics Fermi paradox Central processing unit Future energy development FairTax Thermodynamics Shader Androgen insensitivity syndrome Temperature Ordinary differential equation Closing milestones of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Fair trade 2005 Atlantic hurricane season SAT Grade (education) Partial differential equation Short selling Speed of light
