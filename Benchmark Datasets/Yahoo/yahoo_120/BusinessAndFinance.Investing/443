why does the subprime trouble lead to the enormous fall of the i group what' s their correlation thanks banks in the us have for a long time been lending on the sub prime market this is generally mortgages to people who either cannot afford them or who have dreadful credit histories why do banks do this lending because they can charge much higher interest rates to cover the risk of default and defaults have been high what makes this worse is that other banks have bought a lot of this dodgy debt from other banks hoping to make a killing what has now happened is that the largest mortgage lender in the us is on the brink of bankruptcy and shares all across the market have gone down today for fear that others may follow where i come into this is that they are europe's largest private venture capital provider putting forward cash to fund management buyouts and mergers acquisitions the thing with i is that they have a habit of lending to those who are high risk and who are therefore 'sub prime ' their share price has dropped on wall street today taking them to a month low this is not in itself anything to worry about unless it keeps on falling the fear is that perhaps i may have some financial skeletons in their closet which are going to go pear shaped in the near future the sub prime market could happen here building societies have been lending up to six times a person's salary to fund the purchase of a house this is irresponsible lending and is technically 'sub prime' in its risk profile but because one does it the others follow or fall by the wayside financial probity goes out of the window there is a lurking suspicion in the city that some building societies are already technically insolvent this is because they do not actually have sufficient funds to cover themselves if interest rates zoom up and people start to leave the keys of their houses on the counter of the building society the societies have been borrowing huge amounts of money from international bankers and this money has got to be repaid when the nationwide took over the portman building society recently there did not seem to be any obvious benefit to the nationwide this started tongues wagging in city bars was it a government initiated bailing out job did the government want to keep everything on an even keel and not scare the horses so to speak like they did with the secondary banking crisis of the 's keep your eyes on the small building societies all is not well with the world economy the ecb has made thousand million euros available to banks to bail them out from sub prime trouble today yes today and no fewer than banks in europe have taken advantage of this cash to take loans to cover their big liabilities what's happening here in the uk is everything in the garden all rosy i do not think so beware Financial markets Citigroup Finance Monetary policy Asian financial crisis Money Microcredit Great Depression Student loan Derivative (finance) Money supply Credit card Islamic banking Inflation Bretton Woods system Economy of Russia Central bank Insurance Corporate finance Government debt Gold standard Interest Mergers and acquisitions Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) History of the United States (1918-1945) Privatization Annuity Temasek Holdings Economy of Pakistan Short selling Arbitrage Microeconomics Life insurance Federal National Mortgage Association Free trade Usury Tax Stock Corporation Capitalism Mutual fund Hyperinflation Toronto-Dominion Bank Donald Trump Enron Corporation Mortgage-backed security Euro United Kingdom corporation tax Economy of Haiti Bank fraud Irish Life and Permanent Developing countries' debt Islamic economics Publicly funded medicine Ford Motor Company U.S. public debt Social Security (United States) Bank of China (Hong Kong) History of post-Soviet Russia Bank of America Debt levels and flows Flat tax Dot-com Federal Reserve Economy of Africa Income trust Arthur Laffer Yield curve Stock market Argentine Currency Board HSBC Wells Fargo Hedge fund Michael Milken Government National Mortgage Association Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Fiat money Gross domestic product New Deal Savings and loan association Surveillance Taxation in the United States Futures contract Economy of Romania High-yield debt Social Security debate (United States) PE ratio
