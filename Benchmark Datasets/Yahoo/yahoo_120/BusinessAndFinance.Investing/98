market correction called it first my predictiion calls for the stock market to make a fairly abrupt correction my prediction is that during the time frame of now to approximately the end of the markets will slide continually to a corrective point for the dow of between cant happen the dow fell from wherel it is about now in to waaaaaaay below more like and even lower it dropped that much in two years and then started a comeback starting in the market and the dow has had a good year so far even though we have seen time periods of sharp declines it is possible for a correction of to happen at anytime due to reaction to news events earnings inflation etc the fundamentals of the market are much stronger than that of the market it should be noted that the dow started dropping well before the nasdaq crashed back then the bottom line is that things are different now while isolated incidents of problems happen the amount of irrational exhuberance is substantially less than in the only way that your prediction comes true is if their is a world financial crisis or a major act of terroism occurs Stock market downturn of 2002 October 27, 1997 mini-crash Asian financial crisis Technical analysis Deflation (economics) Black Monday (1987) Mass Short selling Bond Inflation Capitalism CNBC Monetarism Early 2000s recession September 11, 2001 attacks Dot-com Insurance Year 2000 problem Hyperinflation Dow Jones & Company Economic history of the United States NASDAQ Gold standard PE ratio Keynesian economics Annuity Anchor Arthur Laffer Dow Theory Supply-side economics Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Day trading Hubbert peak theory Stock market index Phase (matter) Capital accumulation Efficient market hypothesis Puberty Economy of Sri Lanka New York Stock Exchange Sea level rise Microeconomics Social Security debate (United States) Supply and demand Operation Market Garden Pinball Digital photography Theory Water (molecule) Equine conformation Employee stock option Dow Chemical Company Life insurance Bretton Woods system Economy of Pakistan Energy crisis Model (economics) Black hole Risk Tests of general relativity Free trade Explosive material Coercion Determinism Social Security (United States) Pound sterling Money 1957 World Series History of the United States (1918-1945) Progressive tax Economics Supernatural Enron Corporation FairTax Debugging Implications of peak oil Theory of conduct Drag racing Special relativity Economic inequality Predatory pricing Time travel Oil price increases of 2004 and 2005 Rational expectations Commodity markets Behavioral finance Petroleum Labour economics A Course In Miracles Classical mechanics General relativity Geometry Full moon cycle Bhopal disaster
