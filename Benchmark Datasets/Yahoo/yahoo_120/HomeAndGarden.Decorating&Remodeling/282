how to paint my new condo i just bought a condo it was built yrs ago still looks new in color the entire condo is painted with very light shade of yellow and white celing i haven't painted in my life i like to try in a room and see how it works i have choosen the color my question is how to prep the roo what supplies do i need since i am new in painting what kind of paint is best for walls do i need to paint the celing first or later there is no major or minor fix in the rooms so do i need to wash sand and paint or just start painting on the walls what time of the day is best for painting truly appreciate if someone can clear out these questions and pls do metion if i do need to know anything else in painting my new place thanks okay this is going to be a long one supplies must haves paint brush for cut in or trim to inches rollers nap unless you have very rough walls or to inch painting pad roller pan and tape helpful but not necessary drop cloths pan liners small step ladder krud kutter to clean up painting oops trim roller pad small roller pad about inches long now the best kind of paint firstly it depends on the room and your preference kitchens and baths should be semi gloss it is scrubbable moisture resistant and does not allow mold or mildew to grow on the paint film trim is ussually high gloss though some people don't like shiny and use something else living rooms dining rooms hallways and bedrooms are normally satin or eggshell ceiling are done in flat now some people don't like shine and will use flat on the walls if you do this i would consider finding a flat enamel both behr and pittsburgh make one this will be a scrubbable flat flat scuffs very easy and isn't very washable also don't buy cheap paint it's never worth it you don't have to get the top of the line but at least get something in the middle price range paint is truly something that you get what you pay for as far as the actual painting goes you should do the ceilings first if you have stains on the walls you should try to get them off as best you can it is always best to use a primer and be on the safe side that being said if the walls currently have no shine or a low shine and are a very pale color you can start painting if the walls are shiny or a bright or dark color use primer first if the color you have selected is bright or dark consider using a primer first and have it tinted the associate at your paint store should be able to help you with that if they stare at you blankly get your paint somewhere else when speaking about interior paint there is not best time of day to paint unless your interior space is unheated exterior paint has some time frame and temperature requirements but i won't bore you with them now start painting your ceiling wait a day for it to dry then tape off the edges use a painters tape otherwise when you take the tape down it will pull the paint too also don't leave the tape up for longer than say days you can get some that can be left up for days but i've never been happy with them when painting the first thing to do is you cut in meaning all the corners along the bottom along the ceiling and around any vents or outlets take the covers for those off if you can you can use a brush or a specialty roller painting pad for this i prefer either the brush or a trim pad next working in x or x sections load you roller with paint then make a big w on the wall roll back over the section and fill it in repeat this step and overlap the section slightly for even coverage keep going until the whole wall is done some brighter and dark colors will require two coats and satin and semi gloss ussually require two coats roll on your first coat and wait to hours for it to dry if it looks uneven or you can still see the old color behind it put on another coat i hope i covered everything good luck Paint Upholstery Mattress Drill bit Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Glass Textile manufacturing Knife Stairway Seismic retrofit Manicure Pottery McMansion Color Sento Poker jargon Passenger car Lighting Opportunity rover Amateur telescope making Xanadu House Bong Equine conformation Pennsylvania Railroad Wood carving Wok Drawing Brewery Fluorescent lamp Thermal power station Floppy disk Kitchen Light-emitting diode Wood Mouse (computing) Fan (implement) Fancy rat Tag Strap-on dildo Menstrual cup Primer (paint) Social rule Cookware and bakeware Handloading Solar power Leather Glaze Solar cell Japanese tea ceremony Wassily Kandinsky Tire Fast bowling Billiards Architecture of the California missions Diamond cut Ship Lionel Corporation Shaggy dog story Vitreous enamel My Little Pony Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Screw Electrical wiring Craps Chatsworth House Carpet Rolling-element bearing Brush Chair Laserdisc Milton H.
