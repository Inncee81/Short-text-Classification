is it okay to put wallpaper border on only of the walls my family is papering painting our bathroom last time we put paper above the tub it peeled horribly so the question is would it look okay for us to put border on the walls not surrounding the bathtub it's been my observation over the years that papering a bathroom is not the wisest thing to do it will invariably peel in some point in time the steam from a bathroom eventually seeps into the paper and it will lift eventually and most likely along the seam line the only way i'd advise a paper product is if you have a well ventilated bathroom like say a window you can leave open after steam accumulates Wallpaper Wallpaper group HVAC Bathroom Fire fighting Proposals for a Palestinian state Toilet Customs and etiquette of Japan Hogwarts Floor Directory Dance of the Vampires The Shining (film) Basement Sento Retinal detachment The Brady Bunch Fecal incontinence Toilet paper Dymaxion house Hot tub Passenger car Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Japanese toilet Disney's Contemporary Resort Bathing Wilton House Top-bar hive The Inside Israeli West Bank barrier Chatsworth House Saw (film) Meme Philosophy of space and time Glossary of firefighting terms BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban Carpet Glaspaleis Richard Chase Trench warfare Euphemism Queensbridge Blast shelter National Kidney Foundation Singapore Coal mining Symmetry White House Stocking Forge Wood Brett Whiteley Politics of the United Kingdom Berlin Wall World Trade Center Autostereogram Ice cream Big Bang Urinal Genericized trademark Blood Simple Winchester Mystery House The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Buick Skylark Kitchen Martin Luther King, Jr. Entertainment Weekly Bidet Big Brother (USA TV series) Paper Sauna Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Arthur Cayley Shotgun house Jean-Paul Marat History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Survivors of the September 11, 2001 attacks Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Masking tape Door Steam (content delivery) Towel Water (molecule) Surplus value Pogo New York City Subway nomenclature Jupiter-C (rocket) Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Industrial Revolution Essential oil Roswell UFO incident John Bull (locomotive) Folkestone Futurama (TV series - season 2) Relations of production Shroud of Turin Paradox USS Aaron Ward (DD-483) Treehouse of Horror IV Thermodynamics Elevator
