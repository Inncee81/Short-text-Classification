how do you cover a splash painted wall when i moved into my house the previous owner splash painted one of the bedrooms and i would like to know if there are any other ways to cover it other than sanding definitely use a primer it will cover many stains as well as unwanted paint i recommend using kilz works wonders depending on the color you are going to paint your walls you can typically have the primer tinted so that the final paint application goes on smoother and more evenly check with the paint center at your local hardware store or wherever you decide to purchase the paint my one suggestion do not use the behr line of paint at home depot takes too many coats and is blotchy i would suggest the ralph lauren line or checking out a benjamin moore paint store best of luck to you Paint Primer (paint) Carpet Redundant array of independent disks CPU cache Windows XP Casting Bong Plastic Wood carving Hair coloring Animal Crossing Light-emitting diode Upholstery Heraldry 2D computer graphics Friends Diamond enhancement British Rail Class 50 The Home Depot Sears Holdings Corporation Epoxy Hamster Charleston, South Carolina Handloading Los Angeles Clippers Stucco Glass Color Domus Aurea Impact crater C programming language Polymerase chain reaction Dinghy Ammunition The Amazing Race Lighting Boston Public Mattress Sento Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Hardware random number generator Glaze Union Pacific Railroad Mac OS X Gaia Online X Window System Berkshire Hathaway Software testing Fluorescent lamp Expert system Drill bit Explosive material PNG Ice hockey Ultraviolet Wall Street Shroud of Turin Bulk vending Apollo 8 Billboard (advertising) Wassily Kandinsky Volleyball Collision detection Compiler Betting (poker) Xanadu House Wallpaper group Arcade cabinet Southern Pacific Railroad Wilton House MUMPS Japanese tea ceremony Donald Neilson Mies Circuit design Virtual memory Computer virus Apple Computer Art forgery Alhambra Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Compiler optimization Beltway sniper attacks Password cracking Prostate cancer The Apprentice 3 Poker jargon HIV test Lightning Social aspects of clothing Caedmon's Call Aluminium Pacific, Missouri Straw-bale construction Caracas Fenway Park Henry Ossawa Tanner 64-bit
