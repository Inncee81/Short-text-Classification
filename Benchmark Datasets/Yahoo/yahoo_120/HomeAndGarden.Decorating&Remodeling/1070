i got an estimate to have hardwood flooring put in my lower level condo kitchen only to be told that my floor cement is not leveled so before i can get flooring installed i need to get it leveled any experienced contractors out there that can give me insight to the process cost and other alternatives please only respond if you have an intelligent response do not refer me to the internet or yellow pages thanks a bunch most subfloors are not level depending on how unlevel it is depends on the best way to level it a good flooring installer should be doing this himself because a good flooring inistaller will not trust anyone's floor prep other than his own not to mention if there should be a problem you want only one sub to have worked on your floor otherwise it's going to be an exercise in finger pointing and blaming the other guy on a concrete slab if you have small dips the installer will use a cementious based leveler if you have hump they will have to grind those down floor prep is they are using the leveler usually runs for material and labor per pound of patch they use grinding usually priced by how long it's going to take floor prep is not an exact thing but without looking at it it's hard to say but this is a start engineered hardwood bruce anderson appalichain etc is lovely in a kitchen and while moisture will damage it the only thing moisture won't damage is ceramic don't mop your floor like you were in the navy a good hardwood cleaner and a dust mop will do great bruce makes an excellent one that they sell at home depot just be aware that since the kitchen is a high traffic area depending on how many people are in your family you'll start to see wear patterns in the urethane this is not a problem a hardwood sand and finisher can buff and coat your floor that is where the top layer of urethane is removed and a new layer is put on you can do this every year if you want you're not getting into the wood some people would recommend laminate pergo or others in a kitchen expecially since your subfloor is not level a laminate floor is a floating floor since it is not glued to the slab it will span some subfloor irregularities however your slab should still be relatively flat so some floor prep could still be needed the downside to laminate is that since it is not real wood it's a picture of wood with a layer of plastic on top of it when it starts to show wear patterns there is nothing you can do put replace it hope that helps if you have any other questions you can drop me an email Drill bit Plastic Seismic retrofit Parquetry Pottery Upholstery Casting Stairway Roof Knife Straw-bale construction Aerial (dance move) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Woodworking Solar cell Kitchen Concrete Extreme Programming Wood Mattress Equine conformation Diving suit Printed circuit board Pavement (material) Vacuum cleaner Table saw Glass Guitar Piano Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Hamster Spark plug Dinghy Wind turbine E85 Tobacco Fecal incontinence Heinkel He 100 Carpet Timber framing Ceramics Irrigation Transformer Surveillance Electrical wiring Opportunity rover Anchor Floppy disk Desert Fire extinguisher Pebble bed reactor Volleyball Illegal drug trade Gramophone record Reinforced concrete Fire fighting Chatsworth House Radio controlled airplane Dundas Square Polyurethane Unemployment Nuclear power Hard disk Squash (sport) West Side Highway Vegetation Platform framing Carburetor Billiards Acoustic guitar CPU design Desertification CPU cache Rapid transit Impact crater Tofu 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Road Labor theory of value Headlight IPod Bulk vending Textile manufacturing Corrosion Portland cement Cookware and bakeware Deflation (economics) Diving Explosive material
