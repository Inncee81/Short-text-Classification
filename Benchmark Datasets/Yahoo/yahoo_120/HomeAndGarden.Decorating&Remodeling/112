have problem with refinishing my chairs help i started with one chair i sanded it first then wiped and let it dry and then i put stain on and i see a few spots that seems like i didn't sand very good so the color is uneven plus the chair has a plywood part on a back of a seat it turns pretty ugly what should i do let it dry and sand it again then stain it or let it dry put primer and paint over it can i pait it you said refinishing the chairs so i assume they had some type of finish on them previously if you want to stain them you must strip them to do it correctly otherwise the new stain will look uneven yes you could paint them if that is the look you want but you will have to prime them first plywood will not stain like a species of wood so you will have to put some very little stain on a rag and lightly rub some color on and slowly add more until it closely matches the actual wood on the chair this can be tricky if you add too much stain take a rag and put some paint thinner on it and rub some color out until you get the match you can live with painting contractor Upholstery Casting Mattress Plastic Plywood Pottery Woodworking Stained glass Campfire Staining (biology) Primer (paint) Internal ballistics Wood Wood finishing Gunsmith Chair Textile manufacturing Gram staining Shoe polish Wood carving Bassoon Aerial (dance move) Varnish Drill bit Glass Dodge Charger Professional wrestling slang Hamster Color Mobile Fighter G Gundam Memorial Stadium, Clemson Laws of cricket Handloading Leaf Tank Poker jargon Lumber Histology President (game) Tobacco Gilding Volleyball Collision detection Norway national football team Printmaking Baseball bat Seismic retrofit Table tennis The Midnight Sun Wassily Kandinsky David Bautista Sand casting Strake Carpet Oriented strand board Violin Radio controlled airplane Blood on the Tracks Sandpaper Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Comanche Carpenter bee Equine conformation Paper Dune Maya ceramics Parachuting Aloe Manicure Traditional animation Tofu Typewriter Shaggy dog story Topps Zuiderzee Works Fire extinguisher Anchor Glossary of partner dance terms New York Giants Cleveland Browns English cricket team Heinkel He 112 Tooth enamel Orders of magnitude (numbers) Transformer The Legend of Zelda series enemies 2003 United States Grand Prix Animal communication Alberta Evidence of evolution The Human Stain Leather Cello Naval mine Professional wrestling match types Fire fighting Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06
