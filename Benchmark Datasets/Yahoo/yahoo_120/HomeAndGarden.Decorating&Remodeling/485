we are re painting our spare bedroom once we got home with the primer we realized it was oil based we will be using a water based color after priming is that okay or do we need to use a water based primer i called lowes just so eveyone knows they recommend oil based on oil based and latex on latex thanks anyway for the answers no more info needed what you have will be fine to use you can paint latex paint over oil primer and it is sometimes the best to use oil based primer does a better job of holding back certain problem stains that are water induced in nature such as stains from water leaks and tanin acids in wood in your case i wonder if a primer was even necessary in the first place if repainting a wall with no problems to address two coats of paint would be preferable to one coat each of primer and finish coat in order to get color depth and the full benefits of the paint Paint Handloading Primer (paint) Plastic Casting Upholstery Internal ballistics Mattress Menstrual cup CPU cache Cartridge (firearms) Varnish Polymerase chain reaction Birth control Drill bit Motor oil Wood carving Veganism Condom Lacquer Gesso Printmaking Manicure Tattoo LaTeX Titanium Staining (biology) Primer (molecular biology) Fire extinguisher Phosphoric acid Stained glass Virus Ultraviolet Carpet Petroleum Flax Thermal power station Carburetor Expert system Epoxy Oil painting Bacteria Chewing gum Glass Strap-on dildo Home repair Fossil fuel power plant Operation Petticoat Diving suit Plame affair Stucco Lead paint Brazing Liquid crystal Pneumonia Atari 8-bit family Ammonium nitrate Bulk vending Pottery Leather Painting Alcohol fuel Orders of magnitude (numbers) Social Security (United States) Omega-3 fatty acid Fish oil 2000 Australian Grand Prix Fancy rat Indian Oil Cup 2005 Linseed oil HIV test Explosive material Ethidium bromide Biodiesel Latex Wood finishing Gonorrhoea Hurricane Rita Elliptic curve cryptography Vitreous enamel Hubbert peak theory Acid Contredanse Shellac Hydrochloric acid Latex allergy MUMPS Tofu Academic art Oil well Brush Circuit design Rubber Mach kernel Aluminium Gram-negative Eastern Orthodox Church Paper marbling Thread (computer science)
