is it safe to install wallpaper in my bathroom i heard installing wallpaper in a bathroom is not a good idea because mold can develop i live in florida but wanted something other then paint which is boring you can install wall paper but its real hard to maintain if you don't put it up correctly the moisture can cause the glue to fail and you did all that work for nothing suggestion instead of wall paper why not try a textured wall there are many additives you can add to paint to give the wall a dimensional look suggestion you'd be surprised what you can do with paint and some tape try doing vertical lines in your bathroom in two different colors ex like a dark brown and then a lighter brown or even horizontal lines it's different and can spark peoples interests hope this helps o Wallpaper group Stucco Wallpaper Drawing Carpet Fecal incontinence Genericized trademark Point groups in three dimensions Toilet paper Autostereogram Wassily Kandinsky Symmetry Sundial Straw-bale construction Wood Pile Molding (decorative) Seismic retrofit Color theory Cellular automaton Surrealist techniques Hamster Piet Mondrian Manifold PlayStation 2 Human skin color Paint Plastic Wind turbine The Wall M.C.
