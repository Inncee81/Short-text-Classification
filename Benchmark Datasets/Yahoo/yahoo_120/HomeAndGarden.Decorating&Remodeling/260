what are the steps to painting your house interior personally i love painting my house and do it frequently here are the steps i take first tape off all of the woodwork unless you are painting that too then tape off the wall first prime and paint the baseboards door frames chair rail molding etc allow the paint to dry and cure then proceed i like using blue tape but be sure to burnish it down really well especially on the baseboards chair rails moldings or around doors because if you don't you may get seepage second plastic sheet off anything you do not want to get paint on this includes window and floor treatments furniture banisters etc i usually try to either move all of the furniture to the center of the room or remove it completely from the room i am painting third fill all holes in the wall with spackel allow it to dry and then sand until smooth if you are painting a dark color have stains on the walls or phantom art this is where when you took down a picture you still see a dark square where the art once was i recommend using a stain blocking primer like zinser not only does it erase stains but it can also save you coats of your topcoat as well next do all of the detail work called cutting in i call this fun because i am detail oriented use a quality brush to paint along those baseboards around closet openings door openings chair rails the ceiling or crown moldings and corners if you are changing colors allow this to dry and go back over it with the real color you are using if you primed or a second coat of color if you didn't now comes the real fun roll on roll on the color use a w formation in small x areas making sure you get good coverage i have textured walls in my home that create bubbles so i use two coats of paint to make certain i don't have white or the old color coming through you can of course simply touch up those areas when the first coat is dry if you got good coverage the first coat a couple of hints if it takes you more than one day to paint you can cover the paint in the tray with plastic wrap overnight you can also do that with the paint brush and stick it in the freezer over night let it thaw in the morning and you don't get stiff bristles and a ruined brush saves on clean up too mix all of the gallons of paint together in a large gallon bucket because sometimes the colorist doesn't exactly get the same color in each gallon get one with the lid so that you can cover it overnight and for storage later i also like to use those roller guides so that i can use the paint right out of that bucket but i use trays liners to do the detail work because i can just throw them away and don't have to clean the tray but also because it is easier to maneuver trays around when doing the cut ins if you have high ceilings or intend to paint the ceilings get one of those telescoping poles to attach to the roller they really save your neck and the energy it takes to go up and down the ladder finally keep a damp terry towel handy to wipe off boo boos which inevitable happen good luck have fun and be proud you are doing it yourself Upholstery Casting Pottery Paint Stairway Bong Fire fighting Sento Wood carving Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Knife Textile manufacturing Basement Woodworking Xanadu House Hat Drawing Seismic retrofit Professional wrestling match types Volleyball Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March RuneScape quests Japanese tea ceremony Toilet paper Polyurethane Poker jargon McMansion Jumpstart 3rd Grade Printmaking Wood Textile manufacturing terminology Brush Mattress Glossary of firefighting equipment Fancy rat Sushi The Brady Bunch Kitchen Arcade cabinet Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Floppy disk Strap-on dildo Chair Door Hamster Stucco Professional wrestling slang Items in the Metroid series Electrical wiring Glossary of nautical terms Dairy Lighting Manicure Bubble Bobble Bedbug Wilton House Wok Comanche Sin City Cruising (maritime) Primer (paint) Blood Simple Empire Burlesque Pysanka Cheese Molding (decorative) Houseplant Combine (Half-Life 2) Super Mario 64 Brewery Fecal incontinence Straw-bale construction Trail blazing The Shining (film) Christmas tree Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Mouse (computing) Architecture of the California missions Glossary of partner dance terms Genericized trademark Glaze De Lorean DMC-12 Cannabis cultivation Glossary of climbing terms Tobacco Rococo Customs and etiquette of Japan The Inside
