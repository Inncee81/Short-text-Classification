i removed wallpaper from my kitchen what do i have to do to the walls before i can paint them all paste and debris from paper must be removed the most important thing is to get the glue off the walls washing walls with a solution of white vinegar and water usually works but if this doesn't go to your local paint store for products they sell once the paste is all removed go over your walls and fill any holes and cracks with chaulk let it dry hrs and sand using a very fine sandpaper over the entire wall will also create a very even smooth surface for you after this is done use a good primer such as kilz on the wall this will keep any staining from leaching through your paint primer can be tinted to match your paint and this will be your first coat good luck it's a lot of work but the finished product is worth it i just did this in my home Sandpaper Upholstery Pottery Woodworking Wallpaper Glacier Stucco Glass Leather Masonry Wood carving Handloading Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Drill bit Seismic retrofit Kitchen Plastic Vitreous enamel Vinegar Painting Printed circuit board Brush Tofu Tanning Drawing Brazing Hamster Dishwasher Menstrual cup Primer (paint) Sushi Dairy Animal Crossing Wood Internal ballistics Painter and decorator Sulfuric acid Lionel Corporation Brewery Printmaking Windows XP Papier-m__ch__ Xanadu House Gilding Carpet Straw-bale construction Friction Sand casting Sodium hypochlorite Table tennis Glaze Nuclear fallout Gelatin Manifold Fire extinguisher Dry cleaning Horseshoe Cheese Plaster Cuisine of the Philippines Surrealist techniques Shroud of Turin Chocolate Carbon dioxide Diamond enhancement Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Solar cell Electrophysiology Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Knife Solvent Erosion Road Heraldry Toilet paper Wallpaper group Lumber Water purification Irrigation Autostereogram The Apprentice 3 Poker jargon Opportunity rover Tobacco Great Pyramid of Giza Sheaf (mathematics) Traditional animation Textile manufacturing Architecture of the California missions Campfire Washing machine Acetic acid Valles Marineris Cell (biology) Gram staining Ammunition
