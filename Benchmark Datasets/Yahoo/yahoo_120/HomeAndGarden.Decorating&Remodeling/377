can i put a one or two horse stall in my walk out basement instead of finishing the basement for dwelling use i would put an access door direct to the outdoors a rolling barn door and close off access to the house the basement is currently unfinished on one side and the garage is on the other side my great grandparents lived in a house that was years old that had a milk cow stall in the basement so they could have milk in bad weather my grandfather told me that the smell does go through the whole house you get used to it but visitors will smell it immediately plus you still have to deal with flies and rodents drawn to the feed there may be zoning laws against it too for health reasons it also could damage the house's marketability in the future when you want to move someday Dairy Livestock Basement Chatsworth House Cattle Bungalow Door Cat Conker's Bad Fur Day Toilet humour Milk Lechaina World Trade Center Isle of Wight Abbey "Weird Al" Yankovic Helicopter Air-raid shelter New Urbanism Skateboarding trick Breastfeeding Xanadu House Elevator Indianapolis 500 Blue Ridge Parkway Hansel und Gretel Ballwin, Missouri Oxford United F.C.
