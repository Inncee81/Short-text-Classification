air conditioners were the air comes out the bottom do they make such air conditioners i have one window i plan to take it out and put in a air conditioner but i need one that has the air blowing out from the bottom 'cause my window is quite high and there is a drop in the ceiling so a regular one would only blow air up into the ceiling and not into the room can anyone help me out cool air descends and hot air rises so it doesn't matter if the window is up near the ceiling because the cool air from the air conditioner would still circulate down to where you are additional the downside to the portable air conditioner mentioned below is that the hose that goes from it to the outside window becomes hot and then radiates heat from it making the area around the unit hot you pretty much have to wrap the hose in some type of insulation to not waste energy trying to keep it cool as well additional the diverter the person below mentions is i believe one of those curved plastic covers that one nomally uses on floor heating vents to move the air in a sideways manner rather than allowing it to go straight up out of the vent if you use a diverter on the airconditioner to divert it downwards however then i see two potential problems since the air would be pushed past the front of the air conditioner then much of it would be drawn back into as air to cool rather than being dispersed throughout the room which does you little good also since the air conditioner would be surrounded by cooled air then the temperature gauge in the it would be registering incorrectly so it would stop and start quite often as it was cooling the air a ceiling fan in addition to a regular air conditioner wouldn't be a bad idea though as it would help to move the cooled air about Fire fighting HVAC Air conditioning Solar power Heat Thermal power station Furnace Fan (implement) Bong Engine cooling Insulation Lighting Glossary of firefighting equipment Jet engine Diving suit Thermostat Vacuum Plastic Hot air balloon Seismic retrofit Thermoregulation Carburetor Diving regulator Explosive material Brewery Sento Pebble bed reactor Renewable energy Welding Glossary of firefighting terms Transformer Motor oil Wind Stirling engine Big Bang Wind power Drill bit Nuclear power Deep lake water cooling Flush toilet Swamp cooler Glass Climate of the United Kingdom Dodge Neon Three Mile Island Fossil fuel power plant Passive solar Gas metal arc welding Keynesian economics Water (molecule) Urban heat island Nuclear explosion Ceramics Internal ballistics Casting Thermodynamics Equine conformation Siphon Directed-energy weapon Convection Nuclear weapon design Swimming Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Fog Internal combustion engine Chevrolet Corvair Hyperthermia Volleyball Nuclear reactor Monsoon Environmental concerns with electricity generation Alcohol fuel Two-stroke cycle Radiator Supercharger Heat exchanger Water Vacuum tube Inertial confinement fusion Turbocharger Severe weather terminology (United States) Planetary nebula Turbojet Solar cell Adiabatic process Sea ice Windscale fire Mercury Atlas 6 Volcano Upholstery Heinkel He 100
