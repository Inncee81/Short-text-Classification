any advice on making a roman blind am planning to make a roman blind for my son's bedroom and recently saw roman blind tape in a fabric shop not sure how to use this am i best sticking to dowling rods and rings got any tips on how to achieve a good result for god's sake people get a grip this person was asking something pretty straightforward the answer is this you position the tape going across the width of the blind at the various intervals i usually do mine apart depending on the size of the window you sew along both sides of the tape to secure it in position although if it is a single edge tape you only sew the top edge check this with the shop if you are using rods and this is not essential if you are using the tape you can slide them inside the strips of tape although rods do give a slightly neater fold although if you are using heavy fabric it shouldn't matter that much because the weight will be enough support you then thread the cord through the back of the strips of tape and complete the blind in the usual way the tape saves a lot of work but the only thing is that you have to ensure you have attached it evenly and not at an angle otherwise you will be having a very uneven blind i hope this helps oh and by the way it is not cheaper to buy a roman blind Mattress Floppy disk Knife Poker jargon Textile manufacturing terminology Glossary of climbing terms Tire Textile manufacturing Drill bit Fast bowling Typewriter Sniper Skateboarding trick Radio controlled airplane Window Bong Slide rule Screw Car handling Wire Internal ballistics Theory of conduct Sewing Casualty lifting Sundial Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Bookbinding Carpet Bicycle lighting Chair Seismic retrofit Window blind Undergarment Condom Sewing machine Guitar Double bass Professional wrestling holds Columbine High School massacre Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Escape from New York Snowboard Dog agility Mooney M20 Avenue Q Connecting rod Parachute Sailing Colours, standards and guidons Compact audio cassette UK Singles Chart Sling (weapon) Nunchaku Single Transferable Vote Minesweeper (computer game) Amateur telescope making United States dollar Episodes of Lost (Season 1) View camera Gramophone record Wood Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Anchor High-heeled shoe Kurt Angle Cross-country skiing Justification (theology) Hot air balloon Color blindness Harmonica Eye Redundant array of independent disks Kilt IBM PC compatible RuneScape quests Manual transmission Pinball Professional wrestling throws Gag (BDSM) Door It's Walky!
