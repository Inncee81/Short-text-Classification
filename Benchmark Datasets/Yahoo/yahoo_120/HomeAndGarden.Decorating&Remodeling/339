paint patterns i am going into the th grade and i need some paint ideas for the walls of my room i already looked at the colors and the textures but i need some ideas on how to put them ex different colors on each wall i am a female and i am on the girly side but i like neons and pastels if i spelled that right hey don't forget to come to my website or tell any preteens www prettiep t com come on people i need some websites hello what about using a dark charcoal gray for one wall almost black they sell 'chalkboard paint' anyway on that wall you could stencil some interesting designs in either the neon or pastel colors if the wall is smooth you could use the chalkboard paint and turn it into a 'chalkboard wall i would do this on the wall that gets the most light so that it won't feel too dark in the room may be you could get someone to put up a 'chalk tray for you about halfway down the wlll to keep the chalk handy for the other walls maybe a medium to a lighter grey because its a neutral background and goes with pinks aquas lavenders blues etc you could create stencil frames on the wall to set pictures into using the different pastel and neon colors there are also decal or sticker options have fun rose Color theory Pastel Lighting Vitreous enamel Color Dragon Booster Printmaking Vehicle registration plate Dodge Charger M.C.
