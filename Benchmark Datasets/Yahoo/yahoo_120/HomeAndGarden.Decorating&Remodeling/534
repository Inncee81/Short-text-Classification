back saver counter height in bathroom i have a year old bathroom in my home i am looking for some economical ways to update it the existing cabinets are a classic style and i plan to update the handles i'd love to have the higher back saver counter height is there a way to modify or lift the existing cabinets actually there is but it's a lot of work you can remove the cabinet from the wall with the counter top still attached in most older homes decide how much you want to lift the unit measure the base length x width pre fab a solid plywood base to raise the unit to the desired height cabinets have a dead space between the bottom of the shekf and the floor this is where the pre fab will go the base should fit snugly inside the cabinet at the base so add that into your design in order for this to work you will need to put some braced inside the underside of the cabinet subtract the width of the bracing from the heigth of the prefab the bracing will screw directly into the side of the cabined turn off the water carefully disconnect the drain line carefully disconnect the water to the sink at both ends take the caulking off the countertop where it attaches to the wall remove any nails and screws in the cabinet and remove the entire unit now place the unit against the wall where you want it to go and mark the spot where the plumbing comes out of the wall cut a section of the base big enough to accomidate the new plumbing and remove that section from the back this can be done in a much more professional way but i'm pressed for time this morning put the prefab in place screw it to the floor and the wall s put the cabinet on top of the prefab once the cabinet is in place screw the bottom to the prefab it would also be a good idea to put some screws in from the side re plumb the lines from the wall and slide the cabinet into place remember to attach it to the wall re connect the plumbing and drain with new lines this will require a trip to the hardware store you will also need basic plumbing tools to do this as you will be connecting old lines with new pipes re caulk the countertop now you will notice that the cabinet overhangs the new base by the width of the wood used to make the cabinet that is called a sub facia and can be decorated any way that you like however you will probably want to put something there that will help support the cabinet sd Drill bit Seismic retrofit Equine conformation Stairway Kitchen Table saw Timber framing Textile manufacturing Screw Bong Dialysis Volleyball Anchor The Brady Bunch Elevator Tire Chair Basement Upholstery Professional wrestling throws Windows XP Timpani CPU cache Panama Canal Locks Skateboarding trick Wood carving Glossary of nautical terms Atari 8-bit family Siphon Lathe Thermal power station Clinker (boat building) Central processing unit Dundas Square Flush toilet Dinghy Canal lock Urinal Space elevator Israeli West Bank barrier Hamster Rail terminology Mattress Arcade cabinet Swingout Passenger car Glossary of climbing terms Mercury 4 Bicycle frame Strap-on dildo Glossary of partner dance terms Great Pyramid of Giza Amateur telescope making Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina McMansion Mach kernel Stave church Professional wrestling holds Plumbing fixture Technology Casting Motor oil Sailing Skateboard Trombone Sail-plan Propeller Dam Bass guitar Zuiderzee Works Sento Pottery Toilet paper Snooker Light-frame construction Japanese tea ceremony BS 1363 Clarinet Domestic water system Solar power Dance Dance Revolution Wrench Stage lighting B-47 Stratojet Plastic Virtual memory Woodworking
