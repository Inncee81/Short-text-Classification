what is a good color for a living room that fades into an eat in kitchen the rooms have a half wall that divides them but there is no way to paint the rooms a different color my kitchen cabnets are light maple just darker than natural and the floor is linoleum the floor is basically white choose a bold color for the longest wall then choose a lighter more neutral color for the rest of the walls so it doesn't cramp the space there is no reason you can't paint the two rooms different colors if you paint one wall in each area a bold color and let the rest blend if you choose complimenting colors you should have no problem good luck Kitchen Color theory Wood Color Paint Wood carving Wallpaper group Light-emitting diode Fancy rat Human skin color Black Rococo McMansion Drawing Jumpstart 3rd Grade Upholstery Doom engine Lighting Bungalow Impressionism M.C.
