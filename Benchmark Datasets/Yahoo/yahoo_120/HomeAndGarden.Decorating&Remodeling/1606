where do you hang your wreaths my partner and i are in a disagreement and i was wondering what the consensus was on wreath hanging its a floral wreath and in my mindset i say it should be hung on the door outside he says it should be hung inside my problem is its kinda ugly but it was a gift from his sister inlaw and neither of us want to offend her i have never in years seen a wreath on a wall inside the house exception being christmas time i guess i should describe the wreath and out style in the house the wreath is a bright silk floral with pinks yellows etc the house was recently renovated and furnished modern conservative contemporary the kitchen is painted pineapple fizz with honey maple cabinets green granite counter tops and black appliances the living room is a light lilac very neutral color and black and off white furniture the living room matches the kitchen if i put the wreath inside it would stand our like a sore thumb the rooms themselves pop and are like those you see in magazines and the wreath well looks like something created with things picked up at the dollar store and is very flamboant i agree with u Kitchen Grace Cossington Smith The Brady Bunch Color Wilton House Hogwarts Floor Directory Coat of Arms of Canada Jumpstart 3rd Grade Lighting Floristry Japanese tea ceremony Refrigerator White House Frankfurt kitchen Flag of South Africa Greco-Buddhist art Sin City Asterix and the Laurel Wreath Christmas tree Le Corbusier Buckingham Palace Chatsworth House Warrant Officer In-N-Out Burger 10 Downing Street Stole Color theory Professional wrestling match types The Inside New Orleans Mint James McNeill Whistler Light-emitting diode Eight ball Sento Monarchy in Canada Door Wood carving Rathfarnham Space opera in Scientology doctrine Dundas Square The Waterboys Serenity (Firefly vessel) Animal Crossing Carnivorous plant Liberal Democrats (UK) Carpet Color space Futurama (TV series - season 5) Basement Stove World War Three (Doctor Who) Cuisine of Denmark Aes Sedai The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Furniture Aliens of London Sari G-Man (Half-Life) Pulp Fiction Beavis and Butt-head Pysanka CPU cache Harrow School Wood Glossary of partner dance terms Wheel of Fortune Blenheim Palace Holkham Hall Joseph Chamberlain Vitreous enamel Flowering plant Bristol Grammar School Silent Night, Deadly Night Fluorescent lamp Surveillance Bubble Bobble Culture of Korea UK Singles Chart Bacon Canadian National Exhibition Billboard (advertising) Aberdeen Frederick & Nelson Let's Make a Deal Rococo Billiards Eastern Orthodox Church Slayers The Time Machine McMansion Father's Day (Doctor Who) Common bean Codename: Kids Next Door Gaia Online Disney's Contemporary Resort Colony in Space Royal Standard Electrical wiring (UK)
