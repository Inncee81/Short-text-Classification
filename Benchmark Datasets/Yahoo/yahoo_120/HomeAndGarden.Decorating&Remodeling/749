brak wants to know why most people in new houses leave their walls white why don't a lot of people get colorful and whatever and why not put up wallpaper i live in a house that just turned months old and we have all white walls i think it could use a little color but mom dad like it all white white has a good selling point when your ready to sell your house i suggest taking that blue color you think is so cool and paint it a neutral color this leaves the market open for majority of people to buy first image is everything white is a color that accepted by most people though when i remodel a house i suggest somethign that is little more than white but not far from it kinda like antique or light yellow mixed in natural colors are easier to mix than darker ones so with that said white being not only the most accepted color its the cheapest and perhaps why most people leave it like that is because its paid for paint cost money time and aggrivation wall paper is a hastle and really should only be left to certain rooms but only as borders and installed by intelligence installation isn't exactly hard but problem it is like paint every novice thinks they can do it making it look really horrible and wallpaper is a hastle to remove very very painstaking work my advice leave the wallpaper to minimum if any at all and keep with neutral colors if you want to add color buy a canvased picture or purchase some fresh flowers its easy to change and no contractor or mess required kraze Color theory Wallpaper group Autostereogram Wallpaper Animal Crossing Illegal drug trade Paint Sento Surveillance Drawing Color blindness Francis Bacon (painter) Rum Lighting Digital photography Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Color RuneScape quests Diamond Light-emitting diode Wayne Corporation Supply and demand United States dollar Impressionism Social rule Wood IPod IBM PC compatible School bus Copy protection Hydrogen economy Wassily Kandinsky Photography Aes Sedai Drill bit Bulk vending Mutual fund Craps Bong Traditional animation Advance Wars: Dual Strike Plame affair The Amazing Race White House Wal-Mart Fancy rat PlayStation 2 Technicolor Atari 8-bit family Gross domestic product Piet Mondrian Mahjong Vehicle registration plate Snooker Windows XP Best Buy Monetary policy Fischer Random Chess Mario House of Leaves Viva La Bam Warren Buffett Jute Surrealist techniques Casting Social Security debate (United States) Sicilian Expedition Japanese tea ceremony My Little Pony Microeconomics Pennsylvania Railroad Tofu CMYK color model Formula One regulations Short selling Blood on the Tracks Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Fiat money Obedience training Fenway Park The Adventures of Pete & Pete Uranium Color space Pysanka American Psycho Gamut Commodore 64 Betting (poker) Ocean's Twelve Hair color Georges-Pierre Seurat Plastic Pansy Toilet paper Public good Driver's license
