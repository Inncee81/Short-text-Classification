how do you fix a bad paint job i am trying to paint my room a reddish color i have been told that this is one of the most difficult colors to put on smoothly the guy at home depot recommended one coat of tinted primer and two coats of color so i did that but it still looks horrible you can see all of the stroke marks and there are parts that are way darker than others what should i do should i continue to put more coats on or will that only accentuate the flaws being a former hd paint assoc my self when you paint keep your lines even and straight go all one way not all over the place in x's also make sure you are using the correct nap roller for your walls a nap is pretty common but if you have smooth walls try using a smaller nap roller also this was taught to me by a glidden rep ask about using a grey primer under your red paint sounds weird i know but with some dark reds a grey primer works better than a pink one red paint espically darker shades do take lots of coats to look good i have heard some people doing up to coats good luck Sunglasses Paint Color theory Primer (paint) Drawing Red Glass Blue Billiards Light-emitting diode Microsoft Paint Mario series enemies Atari 8-bit family James McNeill Whistler Diamond enhancement Handloading Color Wassily Kandinsky Fancy rat Table tennis Impressionism Blood on the Tracks Black Color blindness Stucco Amateur telescope making Gray Wolf Sundial Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Wood carving Shetland Sheepdog Rolling-element bearing Frans Hals Labrador Retriever Dolly Parton Circuit design Upholstery Hair color Plastic Horse Heraldry Piet Mondrian Wood Dog Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres Pysanka German Shepherd Dog Carpet The Wall Diamond Union Pacific Railroad Bassoon Keeshond Flag of Denmark Cheating in poker Epoxy 2000 Australian Grand Prix Dragon Booster Betting (poker) Lighting Roller hockey My Little Pony Barbed wire Eye color Cosmetics Jean Grey Xanadu House Cat Glasses Human skin color Snooker Drill bit Lionel Corporation Staining (biology) Roan (color) Carl Barks Collectibles in Bionicle Caracas Clown Opportunity rover Coat (dog) Colours, standards and guidons Operation Petticoat Avenue Q Poker jargon Cat coat genetics Roller coaster Grace Cossington Smith Great Dane Rainbow Brite Casting Babe Ruth Pennsylvania Railroad House of Leaves Typewriter Team Rocket Billboard (advertising) Golden Retriever
