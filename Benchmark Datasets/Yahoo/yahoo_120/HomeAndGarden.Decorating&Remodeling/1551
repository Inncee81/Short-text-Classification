tuscan style bedroom i'd ike to redecorate my room tuscan style any ideas also my room isn't very big so i can't hold too much furniture i like the first suggestion i would say think decor that has a patina or distressed imperfect things i'm a little concerned that if you attempt to replicate an authentic look you might stress yourself out never stress it's just decor instead you can do your own artistic rendition or a homage or a fusion it sounds fun best wishes Buckingham Palace Italian language Sicilian Baroque Tuileries Palace Rococo Wilton House Jazz Blenheim Palace Parkour Blonde on Blonde Kyle Broflovski Indie (music) Music genre Modernism Neoclassicism Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) Interior decoration Furniture Consonance and dissonance Milton H.
