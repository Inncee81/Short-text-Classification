what do you use to paint over panelling cupboards i'm moving into a house in a few weeks and the cupboards are panelling and are peeling a little i'm just wondering what kind of paint i should use to paint over it sorry i need prep info too thanks a good quality latex would be fine use a gloss or semi gloss as this can hold up to scrubbing of course do your prep as thats the most important but you only asked about kind of paint in additon to i have been painting for many years and theres no guarantee that the paint is oil based alot of construction even todays is not oil based oil is often represented as quality but if you don't understand completly how to use it you will screw up your project latex paints have come a long way but if it is then it is correct that latex will not stick to oil paint and it will peel but reading the question what kind of paint should i used to paint over it i can usually tell whether a paint is oil or latex by the feeling it oil paints have the tendency to be very smooth to the touch while latex paints have a more grainy rubber feel since your objective is to paint over the old paint the easiest way to tell is to rub an area of the paint with either denatured alcohol or a paint deglosser if it is latex paint a small amount of paint may be removed and or the paint surface will become slightly tacky if the paint is oil nothing will happen latex qualities is usually cheaper fade resistant easier clean up environmentally friendlier faster drying requires no special thinners or solvents requires stirring less often less dust pick up preferred for walls ceilings and primed woodwork and latex is the most widely used paint used by professionals and amateurs alike oil's qualities are better flow properties allowing for a smoother finish harder more scrub able stronger bond to many surfaces slower set up time allowing more time to work a particular area however to make latex flow better and allow more time to work you can add flotrol to the paint this is what i use prep wash the cabinet with warm water scrape away any loose paint sand the edges feathering them out to blend in take a tsp solution avaliable at local homeimprovement paint store and wash the cabinets let completely dry take a brush and spot prime the bare areas of wood with kilz primer oil based is fine use several coats to try to bring the exposed wood with the rest of the nonpeeling paint after you get the paint to fairly match up then prime the whole thing twice with the kilz primer take your choosen paint quality sherwin williams is good i have used quality glidden and even behr and i have not had any problems with them but if you want more of a reputation use the sherwin williams the staff there usually is good to help you and they have good knowledge to not let you forget any additional supplies homedepot lowes and such don't have this type of customer service take your choosen paint and paint flotrol prefered using coats keep your brush moving and dont' stop let completly dry between coats note i just found out by a major paint manufacture rep that they are banning the use and production of oil base paint pretty soon you wont' be able to buy it because of the epa has too much toxins Casting Mattress Upholstery Drill bit Knife Plastic Menstrual cup Diving suit Pottery Typewriter Leather Wood carving Textile manufacturing Woodworking Bong Violin Carburetor Motor oil Brush Manicure Biodiesel Dry cleaning Brewery Internal ballistics Wood Welding Screw Primer (paint) Handloading Fan (implement) Friction Dairy Heinkel He 100 Solar cell Tattoo Gilding Thermal power station Hard disk Japanese toilet Poker jargon Illegal drug trade Sento Timpani Theory of conduct Fire fighting Carbon dioxide Solar power Coffee Kitchen Glass Floppy disk Mouse (computing) Fire extinguisher Jute Tire Alcohol fuel Explosive material Oscilloscope Water (molecule) Titanium Lionel Corporation Portland cement Drawing Printed circuit board Seismic retrofit Brazing Amateur telescope making Hiberno-English Totem pole Condom E85 Car handling Soldering Fast bowling Paintball Water Lighting Future energy development Rum Energy development Table tennis Sewage treatment Photography Arcade cabinet Varnish Radio controlled car Renewable energy Nuclear fallout Corrosion Opportunity rover
