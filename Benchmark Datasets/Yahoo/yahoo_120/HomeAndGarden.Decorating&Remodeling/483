rug issue do you think this rug http www csnrugs com milliken c kc html would go with this bedding http www flickr com photos n if not what color should i choose my walls are already a shade of green so i'm kind of looking for another color i don't think it makes for a good match first of all the room would be too pink heavy and in that sense would be uninteresting it would also be very loud and i think a bedroom should have at least some elements that lend themselves to rest tranquility the bedding by itself is very attractive and the colors provide a great punch that punch is lost if you then go ahead and bring in all that additional pink i think the solid pink rug pictured would really detract from the bedding also i think the rug also lacks interest being as it is one large unbroken field of pink another issue is that the bedding and the rug will be adjacent to one another and your eye will absolutely hone in on how the pinks reds don't quite match of course having green walls i understand wanting to stay away from green and having a colorful and patterned bedding set i understand wanting to go for a solid or simple rug i don't know the exact color of your walls or what else is in the room but i would consider picking up on the chocolate color that is in the bedding it would be nice in my opinion if you picked up on the relatively neutral calm chocolate but had the rug with a border in the red pink or in green depending on whether the room color and the green in the bedding are a good match when i could not find a rug that was right for my needs i went to some rug stores and looked at carpetting many such stores are equipped and prepared to make you a rug with a border you pick one carpet for the field color and another for the border decide what size you want your border to be and how far from the edge eg you want a border that starts from the edge of the carpet they bind the edges so that it's finished and voila you have the rug you want in the size you want with the exact colors and borders you want an advantage to this of course is you can take a piece of the bedding in to the store with you and use it to pick the shades and textures that are best for you if you do want to go with a pink red rug i really recommend doing it this way so that you can get the best color match and i also recommend doing a chocolate border to pick up on that color of the bedding hope that helps eta who makes the bedding Cascading Style Sheets Mattress Color CPU cache Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Contender (television series) Drill bit Light-emitting diode Tag Color blindness Carpet Pixel Domain Name System Textile manufacturing terminology 2000 Australian Grand Prix Drawing Theory of conduct Mario series enemies Camouflage Roomba Hamster Japanese tea ceremony Laserdisc Carolina Panthers NTSC Kasparov versus The World Boston Bruins Glossary of graph theory Dog agility Lighting Atari 8-bit family Magical objects in Harry Potter Upholstery Tofu Dragon Booster Paint Snooker Basement Doom engine XML M&M's Fancy rat Representational State Transfer Bubble Bobble Common Unix Printing System Sin City Color theory Digital photography Marching band Ramsey's theorem JavaServer Pages Kender Wood Fast bowling Equine conformation Pittsburgh Steelers Pebble bed reactor Fischer Random Chess Insomnia Chocolate Knife P-47 Thunderbolt Hash table History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Shaggy dog story Autostereogram Airport Traffic light Kitchen Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Sunglasses Animal Crossing Expert system Cat Circuit design RGB color model Billiards Surveillance Sundial Radon Operation Barbarossa EIA-708 CIE 1931 color space Franco-Prussian War RuneScape quests My Little Pony Thermal power station Compiler optimization Xanadu House Photography Digital camera Bedbug HTML element
