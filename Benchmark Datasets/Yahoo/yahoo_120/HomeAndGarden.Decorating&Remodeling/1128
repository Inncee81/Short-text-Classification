what should we do we had some nails coming out of our ceiling on a corner wall so we got some guys to come and nail them back in re texture the ceiling and repaint it but they layed the texture to thick so we called them back to redo it and so they take off the old texture put on new one and repainted it except they didn't put a cover on the side wall so now the top part of the side wall is spray painted white and the workers keep leaving every like minutes and they don't come back for like an hour this has been going on for the course of like weeks i'm tired of this and i just want the damn job done what should i do to make them get it done i would call the company that they are working for and tell them that you are not happy with the job that is being done sometimes threats of sueing them will get their attention just remember to log things down and take videos or pictures of the work just in case it does go that far Nine Inch Nails Time Out of Mind Oasis (band) Casting Paint Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Green Day Real Love (song) Wood 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tire Seismic retrofit Sistine Chapel Fire fighting Stairway Wood carving Stucco The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bread Mattress Dundas Square Humphrey Bogart Volleyball Architecture of the California missions Tile Racquetball Wallpaper group Super Mario 64 Doom engine The Wall The Inside Asbestos Shaggy dog story Red-black tree Opportunity rover British Rail Class 50 Cleveland Browns Drawing Social rule NWo Ocean's Twelve McMansion Computer animation Ridge Route Textile manufacturing Duomo di Siena Avril Lavigne 1957 World Series The Last Supper (Leonardo) Unemployment benefit The Marshall Mathers LP Eric Bischoff Queen (band) Extra Texture (Read All About It) British Rail Class 86 Meat Loaf Manicure Slow Train Coming Journey (band) Atlas Comics (1950s) Battles of Lexington and Concord Blonde on Blonde James T.
