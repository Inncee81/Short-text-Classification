what are some neat kitchen themes i do not want roosters fat chefs or grapes but i do want something neat please help this is such a personal thing the truth is anything can be a theme for a kitchen but what makes it your kitchen is that you are into it so the answer lies in your hobbies sports music travel fine art animals a certain animal and just like any other room you could be inspired by any country any time period anything anything since it is a kitchen maybe you could do a food item and just go all the way i don't know many people who don't like chocolate maybe you could do your room in candies and chocolate theme white choc tones on walls to keep it bright and then cabinets or counters in a rich hershey color you could do drawer pulls that look like licorice you know how twizzlers look like a simple shape that got twisted maybe you can find simple hardware in that shape and paint it red and paint your round knobs to look like peanut butter cups or assorted chocolates each with a unique design looking like they all came out of a heartshaped box you could also take a logo's colors and use those as your color scheme milky way has cream tan brown green red reese's has brown and orange musketeers has silver red and blue maybe you could put a gum machine somewhere and have it dispense boullion cubes instead of gumballs i don't know if you wanted to use this theme your best bet is to go to a candy shop and look at all the different shapes and colors and recreate them with similar shaped items you could also do a room inspired by citrus or berries or melons or another food family like tomatoes whatever you choose make sure it is something you enjoy jot down your hobbies on paper scraps pick one and then pick that hobby apart what colors does it involve use them what equipment can serve as props for the kitchen without being in the way you can try to use functional items like if your hobby is basketball you can use your fav teams colors cut a basketball in half and match it to the size of a bowl then smear glue on the outside of the bowl then cover the outside of the bowl with the ball and attach something flat like a wooden plaque base or whatever so the bowl doesn't roll off the counter fill the bowl with fruit or something non food so you don't have to try to keep the bowl clean you could sew a basketball net shut and suspend it from the ceiling or in the kitchen window to hold a potted plant or a collection of plastic sacks or your plastic wraps and foil sponges etc you could paint the cabinet doors to look like a scoreboard banks of neighboring cabinets that's doors next to each other or split apart by a sink or an appliance could serve as the two scores each door gets a digit paint the overhead cabinets with home and guest to be centered above each number do them in dots with red or lime green or orange so it looks digital like a lit display of course these are details about basketball which may or may not be right on the money but you get the idea take something you love dissect it for ideas how to decorate functional things in that theme don't try to add props that serve no function because this is foremost a workspace and needs to remain uncluttered another kitchen theme might be your fav soda or another fav beverage using the colors and or a few pieces of memorabilia from earlier ads for that product coca cola has very easy to find decor pieces Japanese cuisine Kit Kat Bulk vending Kitchen Breakfast Japanese tea ceremony In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of Denmark Coffee Gatorade Wood carving Chocolate Cuisine of the Philippines Hamster Pottery Fanta Bread Billiards Tea Genericized trademark Peanut Plastic Jewish cuisine Bong Table tennis Sears Holdings Corporation Comanche Casting Dairy The Apprentice 2 Cuisine of the Southern United States RuneScape quests New York Giants Ice cream Traditional animation Glass Vermicompost Camouflage Textile manufacturing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film) Drill bit Poker jargon Confectionery Peruvian cuisine Jelly Belly Lighting Stone Age Nintendo GameCube Machinima Light-emitting diode Dice Topps Atari 8-bit family The Brady Bunch Knife Vehicle registration plate Guitar Bubble Bobble Pinball Color Cincinnati Bengals Jumpstart 3rd Grade Barbecue Chatsworth House Upholstery Beavis and Butt-head CPU cache Homer Simpson Monopoly (game) Internal ballistics Pittsburgh Steelers Hell's Kitchen (television) Tofu Milk Wheel of Fortune Cube (film) Epcot Fecal incontinence Soft drink Tobacco Peanut butter Magical objects in Harry Potter The Truman Show Sushi Potato Butter My Little Pony Tattoo Frankfurt kitchen Shaggy dog story
