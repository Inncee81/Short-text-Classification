what color should i paint my walls if my furniture is black details inside i bought new furniture i don't have a picture of it yet but it is from wickes it is black and has a glass table top on the dresser with mirrors and the edges of the glass are green i was thinking of a light green but i feel that it is too juvinille and maybe a darker color will suit me better please help pics would be great you didn't say what color your floors were or what your style is so that might change my decision but you could go with a neutral color like a light tan or or taupe color you could do a faux finish like sponging or ragging over the colors to create a softer muted finish in contrast to the bold furniture color not sure if you are single or married but if single bcuz guys probably won't like this you could paint them a ballet pink for parisian decor or a soothing lilac color i personally would stay away from darker colors unless you wanted to do an accent wall do the darker color like a red on the accent wall and make the rest more neutral and tie both colors in with your linens flowers or pillows this might work better in an asian themed room i think the light green would be pretty just pick a crisp green not like a mint green color i like honeydew from sherman williams i sent you a link to a couple of bedrooms off of hgtv designer portfolios that looked like they had black furniture and you can enter your style that you like modern traditional asian whatever and look at more that might suit your taste the other one is a sherman williams paint color finder that can also teach you how to do faux finishes good luck Rococo Upholstery Color theory Wilton House Wood carving Buckingham Palace Grace Cossington Smith Japanese tea ceremony Color Francis Bacon (painter) Poker jargon Furniture Mattress Glass The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Baroque Home & Garden Television Camouflage Christmas tree Textile manufacturing terminology Neoclassicism The Wall Blenheim Palace Le Corbusier The Brady Bunch Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Paul Is Dead Toilet paper Door Sento Carpet Chatsworth House Impressionism San Jose, California Window Black (people) The Catcher in the Rye Interior decoration Detroit Tigers Colours, standards and guidons Irna Phillips Queen Anne Style architecture Eye color Drawing Big Brother (USA TV series) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Boston Bruins Mahjong Red Dodge Charger Modernism Light-emitting diode The Apprentice 2 Victorian fashion King's Head Inn, Aylesbury Stanton Macdonald-Wright Pittsburgh Steelers Gamut Kitchen Dragon Booster Arts and Crafts movement Funeral Animal Crossing Staining (biology) Eiffel Tower Gothic architecture Diamond simulant Palace of Westminster Paint Leather Cross-stitch Sistine Chapel Frans Hals New York Jets Anaglyph image McMansion Barbie Snooker Tibetan people Oakland Athletics Human skin color Sakura Wars New York City Subway nomenclature Care Bears Classical music era Xanadu House Pysanka __douard Manet Power Rangers Brett Whiteley
