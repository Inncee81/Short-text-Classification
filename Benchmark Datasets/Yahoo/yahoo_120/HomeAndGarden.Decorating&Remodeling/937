i am getting married in a very plain church any suggestionson decorating i am getting married in november i can't get married in my own church because it isnt big enough so we had to go with another church i went to look at it the other day so i could decide weather or not i liked it well it was ok but i like my church better for one it doesnt have stained glass windows and ugly white blinds also the walls are very plain and are white there is nothing on the walls at all this is pretty much my only option what can i do to make it better and by the way the pughs in the church are beautiful what should i do i think a flower and ribbon chain along the phews would look good and placing flower bouqets on the ends of them would well also on the walls you can't really do anything permanent so i would suggest drapes whites pinks blues whatevr goes with the colors of the dresses and flowers you could even pinup flowers in the drapes for the windows they make an adhesive film that goes over the windows and has all types of patterns and designs you could find a stained glass design and place over the windows the blinds would be a harder fix i would suggest a curtain over them to help disguise them if the church allowed it ask them if you could remove the blinds temporarily this will bring in light and the feel of a wedding along the step of the sancturuary place candle all along the side to create an ambonance feel hope it turns out well Window Stained glass Wood carving Textile manufacturing terminology Pysanka Lighting Staining (biology) Volleyball Rococo Poker jargon Glass St. Raphael's Cathedral (Dubuque) The Time Machine Tai shogi Plastic Door Eastern Orthodox Church Upholstery Gothic architecture Carpet Sari Flag of India Christmas tree Molding (decorative) Microsoft Windows Light-emitting diode Japanese tea ceremony IMac Betting (poker) Duomo di Siena Hereford Cathedral Dai dai shogi Sento The Brady Bunch Tent Funeral Jon Secada Days of our Lives Ultraviolet Notre Dame de Paris Tallit Paul Is Dead Typewriter Alhambra Paint Religious Society of Friends Enigma machine Cambuslang Kilt Mahjong Tintoretto Potton Clothing B-47 Stratojet Santa Maria del Fiore Windows XP GunZ The Duel John Hancock Tower Rosa Parks Mario Web design Stage lighting Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword BZFlag Taikyoku shogi Car body style Customs and etiquette of Japan The Shining (film) Diwali Piccolo Junior Saga Chu shogi Washington National Cathedral Tenjiku shogi About a Boy My Little Pony Wa shogi System 7 (Macintosh) Tooth enamel Robert Lawson (architect) Scrubs Drill bit Flag of Hong Kong Flower Cathedral of Chartres Black tie Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Benjamin Mountfort Characters in the Smurfs Mosaic Dai shogi King Khalid International Airport Stole Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Color Blues Solar power Social aspects of clothing Gunpowder Plot Anchor Friends
