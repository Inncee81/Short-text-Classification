what color should i paint my room im i like pink blue and purple i want a bright fun room it cant be babyish because when i get older i wont be able to repaint i have no furniture yet bright fun room then i would suggest something that my cousin did and it looks great i can also give you some suggestions on furniture etc my cousin painted three of her walls a light pastel pink and then one wall which she made the center of attention a darker hot pink it makes a great effect and makes the room look very fun i guarentee that you'll love it when you're older too my cousin is and she just painted you could also do this with three light pastel blue walls then one darker navy blue wall or three light pastel purple walls with one dark purple or bright purple wall the other things that i would recommend for furniture try to go with a look that you like but that's kind of teen so that you won't have to update the look of your room every year when you shop for a bed consider getting a queen size if the price is right but you can also get a twin size what i have and i love it like this for covers pick simple comfortable covers that go with your walls i always like soft plain sheets and a cozy overstuffed comforter something else that my cousin did was she found an antique quilt that she threw over her bed it made a great finishing touch and looks really cute to do this make sure that your comforter is very simple buy a pillow case to match either the comforter or the quilt as an alternative for using an antique quilt and to make it more bright and fun just use a fleece or other cute quilt that's pretty for on top of your bed to top it off throw on some pillows to save some money make a fleece tie pillow that's where you have to pieces of fleece cut it to the size of a pillow make a fringe on it and stuff it with fiberfill you can find directions easily on google and they look really cute for a fun room i feel that once you've chosen the bed and finished it off with the final look everything else revolves around it put a chair or a loveseat in one corner of your room and put a couple of those fleece tie pillows or throw pillows on that make sure that they match your bed and that the seating is basic enough that it matches your bed as well a great thing to put next to a chair or loveseat is a bookcase you might not think so but it will become your favorite place to read for your wardrobe just make sure that it's not really in the way and that it's not too close to anything else this will make your room look cluttered and messy and small try to put in a desk if you have room make sure that the wood of the desk matches the wood of the wardrobe and the wood of the bed when you buy a chair for the desk go back to the bed and the walls remember to make it match finish off your new look with a new rug can be very cute some new curtains match the bed and walls of course and some more crafts teen and preteen bedroom crafts books or just online crafts are available at tons of places or online i also would recommend feng shui ing your room i'm redecorating and that's something that i would like to do pretty much you can research what to do and what not to do while feng shui ing your room but here are a few quick tips always keep your room free of clutter and neat do not put any pictures of water or any source of water in your room if you have an adjoining bathroom always keep the door closed at night never put a mirror opposite your bed use feng shui colors pastels hide or cover all electronic devices as much as possible don't put your bed right between your door and your window it interrupts the chi use the nine squares mapping technique for your room can find online never put your bed against a window never put your bed somewhere where your feet will be pointing towards the door however always keep the door in sight can be tricky but very 'zen' and calming it can help you sleep and has a lot of great things about it i hoped that the wall colors and furniture ideas helped best wishes all the best nicky Wood carving Chair Textile manufacturing The Shining (film) Professional wrestling match types Chatsworth House Wood Wilton House Blood Simple Furniture Buckingham Palace Francis Bacon (painter) Milton H.
