singing help i can sing in tune but the problem is i dont have a nice singing voice it sounds really babyish does anyone know how i can improve my singing voice without lessons if you have access to a piano or keyboard try hitting the notes on the piano go as low and high as you can it might help also practice singing different types of songs see which type is good for you for example try singing slow songs like some by norah jones her songs are mainly deep and are good practice in singing beyonce her songs involve a lot of breathing techniques in order to hold long notes and a lot of power in you voice or carrie underwood her songs do not go too high or low and do not require as much power as beyonce's i hope this helps i am not an expert but this is something that i would try hope this works Beyonc__ Knowles Destiny's Child Piano Minnie Riperton Throat singing Stuttering Clarinet Crazy in Love Kelly Rowland Whose Line Is It Anyway?
