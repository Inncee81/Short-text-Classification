what do you think about individuals with hiv aids who try to justify being sexually active i hear it time and again its part of my 'quality of life' and i have the right to have sex if i use precautions i think these 'precautions' they are reffering to are not always fool proof and they are putting people at risk it just seems to me like having sex for your 'quality of life' should be the last thing on your mind when you are dealing with something that is going to kill you and possibly kill other people isn't it saving a lot of grief and pain if they just jerk off miata do you have aids is that what this is all about if not then go ahead have sex with one of your friends for some years and contract it because oh whats the harm having aids is like having the cold virus huh its people like you who i actually think promote std's your a jerk hiv aids positive individual can be prosecuted criminally for engaging in sexual activity without the knowledge of their sexual partner however if someone voluntarily has intercourse with them while knowing beforehand i have nothing to say about that except that is a totally stupid idea if someone with hiv aids wants to have sex they probably should find a support group and meet someone their who also has problems and not selfishly coerce innocent individuals into emotional entanglement so they can prey upon them they should go rub off a batch and try to reflect upon their life and not be so shallow Human sexual behavior Sexually-transmitted infection AIDS Sexual abstinence Safe sex Sexual intercourse Sex education AIDS pandemic Lawrence v.
