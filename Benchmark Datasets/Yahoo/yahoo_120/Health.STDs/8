anyone ever try using dental dam what can you say about it was it awful or ok i have for sure and no it wasn't awful i would suggest that you experiment before hand with various types of non lubricated condoms the lube on lubricated condoms tastes gross you can even find flavoured non lubed condoms so pick a flavour definitely apply lubricant to the side of the dental dam that will be in contact with the genitals vagina or anus to make it more pleasurable for your partner some people opt to use non microwaveable saran plastic wrap the microwaveable ones have small pores while there has not been much research in this area there has been one study that i am aware of it was with glad saran wrap non microwaveable of course and showed that it did prevent transmission of hsv and hsv but it is important to remember that plastic wrap is not subject to the rigoruous production standards that condoms are some people complain that dental dams made from condoms are too small and awkward and prefer plastic wrap but they are taking more of a risk bottom line it is better to use a latex polyurethane condom made into a dental dam or buy actual dental dams dentists offices use them mine calls them plastic raincoats to prevent stis but if you don't have one non microwavebale plastic wrap is better than nothing and try to use glad as it has been tested albeit in a small study Condom Oral sex Strap-on dildo Anal sex Herpes simplex virus Personal lubricant Orgy Menstrual cup Masturbation Human sexual behavior Birth control Sexually-transmitted infection Motor oil Pornographic movie Genital wart Fisting Human papillomavirus AIDS Anal masturbation Manual transmission Sexual intercourse Butt plug Child sexuality Cervical cancer Gay bathhouse Die (manufacturing) Diaphragm (contraceptive) Dentistry Methamphetamine Prostitution Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Gonorrhoea Tooth Crystal methamphetamine and sex Tampon Unsafe sexual practices Milk Prostate cancer Vulva Tattoo Screw Dental brace Sexual abstinence Rape Dyspareunia Medical analysis of circumcision AIDS pandemic Hazing Group sex Proper Condom Use Tooth enamel Goatse.cx Thermal power station BDSM Polyurethane Drill bit Orgasm Glycerin Doctorate Tofu Barebacking Female genital cutting Halitosis Hangul HSV color space Dental caries Genericized trademark Lubricant Professional wrestling throws Casting Circumcision Anus Intersex surgery Paranoia Agent Harm reduction Bong Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Multiple sclerosis Plastic bag Vagina Skateboarding trick Chair Glacier Lionel Corporation Vulvovaginal health Gross domestic product Wire Sexual arousal Nonoxynol-9 Phthalates M16 (rifle) Timpani Solar power satellite
