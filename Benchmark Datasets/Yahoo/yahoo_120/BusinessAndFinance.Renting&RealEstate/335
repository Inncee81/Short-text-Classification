buying first home lease to own is it a good idea my husband and i want to buy our first home we have been living abroad and will be returning to the us we have no rental history and my husbands credit rating is poor would lease to own be our best option as we desperately want to own a home and get his credit fixed or are they just another scam a lease option or lease purchase can work very well for you but you have to read the contract very careful and either have a real estate attorney or at lease a lic realtor look over it for you the good a lease purchase contract will help you to establish credit you just need to ask the seller to report to the credit bureaus how a lease purchase works most of the time you will have to have a certain amount down this downpayment will go to the seller part of the downpayment can go towards your purchase price you make monthly payments like a rent plus an additional amount towards your principal for example you pay amount are going to the seller as a kind of rent and will be applied towards the purchase price with a lease purchase in the current market you lock the purchase price so if the market bounces back and prices are going back up your purchase price will stay the same as it was when you entered the lease purchase agreement after year or years your credit should be established enough that you can apply for your own mortgage and pay the seller off the bad most sellers will not transfer ownership until you paid in full if you get in default with your payments the now still property owner can kick you out and you loose your downpayment and your house so my answer is if it is a scam or not depends on the seller and how careful you are in reading the small print on the lease purchase contract it can be a good way to own property for situations like yours one of our sons is buying a property on lease purchase and he is doing just fine with it in a few month he will be able to get his own mortgage he will get a good interesst rate and can lower his monthly payments Mortgage Leasing Islamic banking Real estate bubble Real estate broker Derivative (finance) Housing cooperative Insurance Leasehold estate Babylonian law Futures contract Microeconomics Hire purchase Taxation in the United States Tax Mortgage-backed security Government National Mortgage Association Monopoly (game) Estoppel Bond Gross domestic product Short selling First-sale doctrine Gold standard Credit derivative FairTax Option Concurrent estate Money Student loan Rental agreement Intellectual property Security (finance) Capitalism Contract Life insurance Title insurance Surplus value Deflation (economics) Inflation Supply and demand Interest Property tax Unconscionability Internet fraud Auto insurance Credit card Mutual fund Arbitrage Labor theory of value Free trade Call option Monetary policy Anarchism and capitalism Stamp duty History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of the United States Property (ownership right) Capital accumulation Price discrimination Predatory lending PE ratio Rational pricing Option style Oakland Athletics British residential property market Allodial title Commodity markets United Kingdom corporation tax Health insurance Economics Put option Minimum wage Bretton Woods system Warranty Collateralized mortgage obligation Intermediate consumption B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch American individualist anarchism Unemployment Hyperinflation Renting Airline Bulk vending Credit score Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Copyright Public housing Economy of Russia Municipal bond Land reform MMORPG Prostitution in Germany Income trust Economic rent Conveyancing Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)
