a question for agents homebuyer i am in the process of waiting on a counter offer from a seller it is a forecloser the home is in great condition no water damage clean etc on the listing it says the seller will not turn on electricity does this mean there's a problem with the wiring that they don't want to disclose or is this common for them not to turn it on the previous tenants were renting to own they did not pay so they were kicked out also is it possible for the previous renters renting to own can come back and claim the property if they pay what they owe i will not be renting to own i will have a loan outright any advice appreciated when you enter a contract to purchase a home the property must be 'free of incumberances' which means that the seller needs to bring taxes up to date outstanding utility bills and end any leases rent to own or other contracts on the property also most purchase offers include a contingency that a home inspection must be satisfactory to get a thorough home inspection most inspectors will need the power water and gas turned on so that they can test all the household systems plumbing air heat for function and leaks they might not turn on the power just for you to walk thru the property but need to for an inspection a 'satisfactory' inspection does not mean the house 'passes' or 'fails' it just means that whatever the inspector turns up is ok with you you might be ok with fixing some drywall but not ok with mold in the basement you as the buyer gets to decide what is satisfactory enough for you the previous renters potential purchasers can't claim the property if the seller followed their contract and evicted them properly ask the seller to document that the rent to own contract is void or terminated if the property was a simple rental then the family who got evicted don't have any rights to the property at all Mortgage Contract Rental agreement Leasing Leasehold estate Real estate broker Microeconomics Renting Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Security (finance) Monopoly (game) Conveyancing First-sale doctrine Capitalism Economics Allodial title Electrical wiring Oil-for-Food Programme Supply and demand Plame affair Tax Housing cooperative Manitoba Hydro Intermediate consumption Surplus value Islamic banking Assignment (law) Land reform Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Public housing Short selling Irish Land Act Property (ownership right) SCO-Linux controversies Concurrent estate Blockbuster Video 2004 World Series Eviction Public domain Legal system of Hong Kong Hire purchase FairTax American individualist anarchism Guantanamo Bay Money Home repair Estoppel Title insurance Toyota Prius Property tax Neville Chamberlain Nuclear power STS-61 Explosive material Robert Walpole Free market Satchel Paige Copyright law of the United Kingdom B__rgerliches Gesetzbuch Downing Street memo Operating surplus Iran's nuclear program Stuyvesant Town Article One of the United States Constitution Enron Corporation History of the British constitution Economy of Nigeria Kitchen Autonomous building Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Squatting Common criticisms of Microsoft Option Thermal power station Home insurance Trademark Copyright infringement of software Economic rent Taxation in the United States Oakland Athletics Real estate bubble Central processing unit Apartment Asbestos Stock Karl Rove Anarchism and capitalism Gentrification Appeal
