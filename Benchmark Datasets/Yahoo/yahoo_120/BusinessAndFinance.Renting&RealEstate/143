how does house flipping work i love watching these shows about house flipping i see the headaches and problems they encounter but still seem to think it would be fun and a great way to make money what i can't figure out is how seemingly ordinary people i e not already rich can afford their own residence while also buying another house and sinking as much as k in renovations into it if you already own your own home do you just go to the bank and get another home loan i would think the bank wouldn't approve such a risky venture at first and even if you do get approved how do people get in liquid cash to be able to do the renovation i just don't undertand i can understand how someone does it if they have investors lots of personal money or know construction workers who can do the work for cheap but for others flipping who are doing their first house how do they do this that's why a lot of these have teams who do this three or four get together often including a real estate agent who can scout for and sell the properties a money person accountant banker or mortgage broker who can arrange financing a contractor type to supervise do the actual work and often a money partner a person like a doctor or lawyer with money they need to invest normally at least one and preferably several need good credit to pull off the financing almost all of these scenarios involve the flipping investor s to get temporary financing which is normally at a high interest rate this gets them going for a few months while they do the renovations that is one reason they are often talking about getiing things done quickly and worrying about delays every day delayed costs them hundreds if not thousands of dollars there is a lot of profit in these things but if you get over your head or delayed or the renovations go over budget you can easily lose money there are other ways to do it sometimes you can buy from a bank reo real estate owned department and they will be so happy to sell they will provide financing also the va has a program for investors of their va foreclosed homes they have a vender financing proghram where anyone including nonvets can buy foreclosed homes with little down at a good rate and no worry about credit scores all ou have to do is show proof you have income to pay the mortgage those who will live in the house can get a loan for zero down investors the same but down you can get a streamlined loan process for down good luck Deflation (economics) Bank Insurance Bond Citigroup Economy of Russia Islamic banking Construction Gross domestic product Money Derivative (finance) Finance Capital accumulation Security (finance) Donald Trump Annuity Stock Government National Mortgage Association Life insurance Mergers and acquisitions Capitalism Economy of the United States Investment bank Monetary policy Microcredit Predatory lending Real estate developer Gold standard Short selling FairTax Corporate finance Federal National Mortgage Association Financial markets Universal Studios Corporation Privatization Warren Buffett Bretton Woods system Surplus value Real estate broker PE ratio Financial services Great Depression Charles Ponzi Interest Hyperinflation Personal finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Student loan Toronto-Dominion Bank Money supply Economy of Nigeria Real estate economics Enron Corporation History of the United States (1918-1945) Margin (finance) Sears Holdings Corporation Inflation Yield curve Advance fee fraud Concurrent estate Anarchism and capitalism Bulk vending Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Primerica Financial Services Usury Cooperative Economy of Cuba Taxation in the United States Tax Arbitrage Credit card Bank fraud Dividend Supply-side economics Savings and Loan crisis Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Ponzi scheme Berkshire Hathaway NASDAQ U.S. public debt Central bank Savings and loan association Government debt Monopoly (game) MMORPG Housing cooperative Coalition Provisional Authority Law of value Timeline of the Enron scandal
