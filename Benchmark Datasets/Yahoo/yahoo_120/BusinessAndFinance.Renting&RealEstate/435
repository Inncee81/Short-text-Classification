my landlord didnt pay mortgage and house foreclosed what can i expect the home we rent was sold to the bank days ago our landlord said he will return our august rent and security deposit now we're just waiting to hear from the bank we already know our rights but i'm curious to know the experiences of anyone else who has been through this our attorney said we could be contacted any day or it could be months we were also told some lenders will pay the tenants to move any personal experiences or insights would be great it greatly depends on what the bank wants to do and what your local laws are what you can expect at worst is that you will be given days notice to vacate if you have a leasing agreement they might buy you out of it or just keep you on if that's the best economic strategy for them i've lived in an apartment in a house that was sold and had no lease i had days notice to leave as the new owners chose to completely remodel but they gave me the option to stay on if i was willing to put up with the construction if i were you i'd call the bank directly and ask them what you can expect it's an important question Leasing Mortgage Leasehold estate Rental agreement Bond Estoppel Monopoly (game) Foreclosure Concurrent estate Security (finance) Eviction Babylonian law Insurance Renting Serfdom New Deal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Property (ownership right) Islamic banking Student loan American individualist anarchism Rent control Plame affair Financial markets Anarchism and capitalism Harlem Government National Mortgage Association Derivative (finance) Taxation in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Short selling Apartment building Citigroup Fixtures The Inside Apartment Annuity Popular, Inc Allodial title Yarralumla, Australian Capital Territory Public housing Predatory lending Donald Trump Irish Houses of Parliament Interest Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) ACORN Oakland Athletics Appeal Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim History of the United States (1918-1945) Economics Real estate Modding Hire purchase Real estate bubble Copyright Debt Real estate broker Irish Property Bubble Manorialism Miss Saigon Capitalism Stuyvesant Town Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Schabir Shaik Trial Intellectual property Ocean's Twelve Waste (law) Thomas de Littleton Section 8 (housing) Squatting Temasek Holdings Great Depression Barrister SCO-Linux controversies Liability Contract Newstead Abbey Gold standard Poker jargon Bankruptcy in the United States Monetary policy Credit card Surplus value Option Israeli settlement Federal National Mortgage Association Bretton Woods system Real property Art Modell Capital accumulation Economy of the United States Corporation Government of Maryland
