rental agreements after june i thought my tenancy had become month to month but now that i am trying to move out my landlord says that my lease is year to year so i cannot move out until the end of the new lease even thought at the end of my lease he never gave me another lease he told me to read my lease and this is what it says this agreement will in effect from june until june unless renewed or extended pursuant to the terms herein and is based on a yearly term last year on sept he raised my rent but now i am thinking if my lease is year to year he had no right to raise my rent because on june we had entered into a new year of the contract so i feel that i have been overpaying him rent and now want to sue him for the overpayments am i rigth laws vary from state to state so for any of us to really comment is great and a starting point but in the end you are going to have to talk to a lawyer if i was you i would just move and let him keep my security deposit he might take you to debtor's court you can appear for your self and the judge will assist you in your case i really don't think that he would file in most states to extend a lease one must sign a new lease the facts as stated above doesn't indicate a open ended lease there by the lease would extend on a month to month basis i would fill the squares i would give him notice that i was going to move and that i expected my deposit returned to me once the inspection is done clean it really well and take photos of every thing if he says you are locked in to another year tell point blank show me where i have signed another lease he no doubt is going to say i told you before to read your lease say i have and there is nothing that says i can't move you then tell him that you are going to file suit and very well may file criminal charges against him for fraud he has done this to other folks along and has gotten away with it so he figures that he can do this to anyone an additional thought come to mine keep a short diary of events dates and conversations with him if he says that he is going to take you to court tell that is fine and i will counter and pray for the overage that you have been charging me and court costs i would then give him my new address i will also tell you that when you go hunting for another place to live tell the new landlord what is going on if you don't he might call this guy and ask about you we both know that your landlord is a a hole and will do what ever to keep you there so he isn't going to say anything nice about you Leasing Plame affair Rental agreement Contract Estoppel Public domain Babylonian law Appeal Eviction Schabir Shaik Trial Karl Rove Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Barrister Trademark United Kingdom corporation tax Property (ownership right) Lawsuit First-sale doctrine International Criminal Court Judiciary of Hong Kong Annuity 2005 trial of Michael Jackson 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Islamic banking Intellectual property Conspiracy Enron Corporation Copyright Article One of the United States Constitution Lawyer SCO-Linux controversies W.
