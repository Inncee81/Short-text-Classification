i took a class on state tax liens on homes can the average investor make good money on tax liens the class told us all we needed was two hours a week for a large fee the company would stear us to the best liens do i need this company or could i obtain good liens on the internet for free almost all of these online website won't do you any good they sell knowledge for huge fees that you can get on your own with a little sweat in fact this is an area where doing your own research introduces you to the major players and gives you valuable resources these internet sites can never give the question is what state to work in in some states the interest you get and restrictions on foreclosing on property are very bad for the investor so you want to avoid those other places like california florida and texas are excellent but there are thousands of investors who flock there expecially the big counties where there are lots of properties in some places like dade county florida banks and financial corporations show up and buy millions of dollars of tax liens for investments if you can it is best to work your own state in your own county and the counties around you it is best if you know the area and have a sense of property values i've seen people buy tax liens and foreclose to get the property only to find it was a toxic waste dump so you have to do your research on what you are bidding on most tax liens go through the counties so you can contact your local county to find out how it works what are the legalities and where the tax liens sale are held only a very few places hold their tax lien sales on line but many counties do provide websites that announce lien sales and list the properties that are expected to be available most counties hold tax lien sales either every or months so if you work several counties you could be going to tax lien sales times a year another good advice is to go to your first tax lien sale without wanting to bid just observe get a feel for what things sell for and what the process is then on the next one register as a bidder and get your feet wet good luck Mutual fund Mortgage Donald Trump Foreclosure Mergers and acquisitions Temasek Holdings MMORPG Microeconomics Capital accumulation Corporation Investment bank Auction Bank FairTax Capitalism Warren Buffett Internet fraud Economy of Russia Insurance Bond Tesco Security (finance) Wal-Mart Privatization Construction Hedge fund Finance SCO-Linux controversies Education in the United States Taxation in the United States Advance fee fraud Credit card Allodial title Citigroup London Congestion Charge Software patent debate Free trade Life insurance Gold as an investment Michael Milken Stock Short selling Berkshire Hathaway Microsoft ITV National Kidney Foundation Singapore MG Rover Group Surplus value Poker jargon America Online ROC presidential election, 2004 Tax Monopoly (game) Electronic commerce Personal property Neopets Property (ownership right) Politics of the Republic of China Kuomintang Trademark The Standard Income trust Productive and unproductive labour Asian financial crisis Universal Studios $ale of the Century Supply and demand Unreformed House of Commons Make money fast Ford Motor Company UK Singles Chart Minimum wage Municipal bond Dividend Bretton Woods system Concurrent estate Mikhail Khodorkovsky Economy of the United States Capital gains tax Erling Dekke N__ss Air New Zealand Nintendo United Kingdom corporation tax Anarchism and capitalism YUKOS Copyright Hyperinflation Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporate governance Lottery Contract bridge Expert system Canadian and American economies compared Commodore International Galactic Civilizations Bank fraud
