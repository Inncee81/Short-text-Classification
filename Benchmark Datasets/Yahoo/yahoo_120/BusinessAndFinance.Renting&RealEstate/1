is there a formula for calculating the estimated price i should spend on buying a home k yr i am looking for a formula that will give me the price range i should be looking at based off of my annual salary of per year there is one rule of thumb and one more complicated formula rule of thumb is between x your annual salary so between and would most likely be ok rules of thumb are just that and could vary significantly depending on many factors downpayment amount credit score history other debt etc the better calculation is the rule this means that no more than of your gross income should go for your housing payment in your case that is about per month that is usually referred to as piti principal interest taxes and insurance principal and interest are dictated by price of home rate on mortgage size of downpayment etc taxes and insurance vary greatly by region so look at it closely the part of the rule is that all of your debt payments shouldn't exceed of your monthly income in your case this means any car loans credit card payments student loan payments etc the rule will keep you reasonably happy about your debt load banks used to use this ratio and were strict about it in the past years or so they seemed to relax quite a bit and now that is coming back to haunt them so i would imagine that it is returning to these types of standards good luck Mortgage Annuity Insurance Student loan Real estate bubble Gross domestic product Tax Personal finance Interest Economy of Russia Credit card Social Security (United States) Microeconomics Inflation FairTax Taxation in the United States Life insurance Bank Money Unemployment benefit National Insurance Debt Economy of India Cost of capital Capital accumulation Islamic banking Surplus value United Kingdom corporation tax Monetary policy Great Depression Gold standard Measures of national income and output Auto insurance History of the United States (1918-1945) Derivative (finance) Deflation (economics) Bretton Woods system Economy of the United States Hyperinflation Primerica Financial Services Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Federal National Mortgage Association 401(k) U.S. public debt Security (finance) Health insurance Economy of Pakistan Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Education in the United States Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Government debt Estoppel Pension Government National Mortgage Association Credit derivative Compensation of employees History of post-Soviet Russia Income trust Leasing Donald Trump Euro Economy of Romania Mortgage-backed security Collateralized debt obligation Municipal bond Dividend Annual percentage rate Weighted average cost of capital Savings and loan association Unemployment Productive and unproductive labour Short selling Finance Corporate finance Supply and demand Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Arthur Laffer Small business Explosive material Property tax Solar cell Publicly funded medicine Marshall Plan Social Credit Monopoly (game) PE ratio Free trade Subsidy Income tax Economic relations of Japan
