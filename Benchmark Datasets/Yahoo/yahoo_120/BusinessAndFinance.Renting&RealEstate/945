ripped off i applied for an apartment today i left a check for an application fee and a check for a deposit i was told the deposit was to hold the apartment and would not be cashed until the lease was signed i was not approved for the apartment and was told i would recieve my deposit in about weeks because the leasing agent had already run the check when i asked why he told me that is not how they normally do it they just did it cause they thought i would be approved i need that money to put down a deposit on another apt what should i do if they told you that they weren't going to run the check until the lease was signed then they were in the wrong you should contact the better business bureau or something to try and get that money back usually they'll just get scared and give you your money back good luck Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Internet fraud Bank Money supply Octopus card Ocean's Twelve Rent (musical) Public domain Friends Credit card Miss Saigon Avenue Q Automatic teller machine NorthBridge Apartment Complex Money creation Bank fraud Psycho Advance fee fraud The Invisibles Oplan Bojinka Escape from New York Schabir Shaik Trial Intellectual property Charles Ponzi World Championship Wrestling Money laundering Security (finance) Plame affair timeline Paintball W.
