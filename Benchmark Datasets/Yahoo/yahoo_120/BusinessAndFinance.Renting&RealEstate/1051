i rented a house put down a deposit but the owner foreclosed on the house how do i get my deposit i have put a large deposit on a house that i am renting i just found out that the house has sold at a foreclosure sale i'm not sure if it went back to the bank or a third party i have no problem moving i just would like my deposit back who owes me the deposit i'm in missouri it was a very non formal contract so it doesn't have stated who is going to pay the deposit but in my previous rentals the new owner paid the deposits back i just need to know where the law stands on this issue hate to say it but it's fairly likely you have been screwed if you paid a deposit to the previous owner and that person didn't put it in escrow they have the money now they are obviously insolvent the money is probably spent you could sue them for your money back and you would win however considering that their house was just foreclosed on the likelihood of you collecting on a judgement is fairly slim if you want to play total hardball if you can prove that the house was in foreclosure when you signed your contract and paid your deposit you might be able to prove fraud and go for criminal prosecution adam Contract Credit card Allodial title Leasing Tom DeLay Advance fee fraud Annuity Schabir Shaik Trial Public domain Bankruptcy Universal Studios Internet fraud Security (finance) First-sale doctrine Tax Bond Patent Estoppel Salary cap Mary Astor Housing cooperative Appeal SCO-Linux controversies Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Mikhail Khodorkovsky Oil-for-Food Programme Renting Government of Maryland Bankruptcy in the United States Divorce George Galloway Life insurance Enron Corporation Trademark Deflation (economics) Babylonian law ACORN Surveillance Corporation Money Oakland Athletics Fred Phelps Savings and Loan crisis Karl Rove Extreme Championship Wrestling Plame affair Dred Scott v.
