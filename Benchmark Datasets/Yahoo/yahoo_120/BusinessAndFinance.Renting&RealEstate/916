where can i find a free list of tax sale homes in washington state every county has a list at the assessors office and some countys have it on line i went to the one in pierce county last year and it was a waist of time they were about a people there and they were bidding the houses up of dollars and its all cash your not going to get one for like you see on tv pierce county has a tax auction around december the one thing no one seem to understand is that if it is owned by a bank in is not a forclosure it is a reo and if the bank ownes it and it did not sell at the auction because the opening bid was too high opening bid was more than the house worth so no one bid on it just because it was a forclosure does not mean it is a good deal even realtors don't seem to understand the difference between a house in forclosure and a reo Auction Contract bridge Donald Trump Real estate broker Jean Schmidt Ra (board game) YUKOS Economy of Russia Microeconomics Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania Tax Temasek Holdings Live 8 Warren Buffett Bank fraud Mutual fund Central bank Gross domestic product Online auction business model FairTax REO Speedwagon Property tax Inflation Mergers and acquisitions Money Mortgage Ford Motor Company United Overseas Bank Amazon.com Winner's curse Pacific Century Cyberworks Pacific, Missouri The Walt Disney Company Hyperinflation Bond Mikhail Khodorkovsky Political subdivisions of New York State Government of Maryland Mikhail Kasyanov Terry Pratchett Initial public offering Network effect Arbitrage Bank of America U.S. public debt Illegal drug trade Capital accumulation Sid McMath Monetary policy Berkshire Hathaway Jefferson County, Alabama Wal-Mart Security (finance) Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Fort Ashby, West Virginia Enron Corporation Protectionism Personal finance Foreign exchange market Pierce Butler Supply and demand TAM Linhas A__reas Internet fraud Market system Vodafone Insurance Corporate personhood Foreclosure Christine Gregoire United States dollar Trust (Law) USA Citigroup Banknote Domesday Book Supply-side economics Art theft George Soros Indiana Middle Island President of the United States Pierce County, Washington NFL on television Jefferson Davis Mineral County, West Virginia Tesco Value added tax Corey Haim Treasury security James J.
