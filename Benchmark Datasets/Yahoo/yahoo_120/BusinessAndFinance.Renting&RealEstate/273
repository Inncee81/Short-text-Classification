how can my company buy rental property i want to diversify my business it is no way related to real estate at all i am looking at the possibility of buying a rental property or possibly a vacation rental property i e a condo at a ski resort or something along that line which mortgage companies specialize in this i assume they will want financial statements from the company or can i do a stated loan what size down payment would be typical i know i could contact a lawyer real estate agent bank and a mortgage person but i don't want their salespeople to start bugging me right now i get too many telemarketers calling me now as it is i want to get some background info so i can ask intelligent questions when i start talking to those people mentioned above fortunately for you i am not one of the people on yahoo that doesn't have a clue so i'll let you know that unless you have a very favorable relationship with a banking establishment you are going to have to get a commecial loan which depending on the strength of your balance sheet or collateral that you are willing to pledge on top of the property itself will require you to buy with anywhere between and ltv this is called non recourse lending since you cannot be personally held liable for the loan they can only come after business assets if you default unless you are offerring collateral you will also most likely not get a year amortization on the loan that most homeowners get your rate will be higher as well as your loan is considered high risk lending criteria have loosened some and there are many programs that banks will offer now that they didn't traditionally allow in the past primarily because their residential portfolios are not growing at the rates they used to so you may be able to find a better deal so i would send some kind of correspondance to a group of lenders explaining what your criteria would be for buying a property and letting them have the mortgage and let them get back to you if they have something which fits your parameters like you said you don't want to talk to several bankers they will chew your ear off for a week my recommendation is to buy the property personally if you want personal buyer terms and then gift title into the company that way you get protections of liability from the property not being in your name you may also want to consider not titling the property anywhere near your company if it is asset rich as anything that happened on that property would put your whole company at risk of being absorbed by a lawsuit on the property you may want to consider the use of trusts or llc's to hold the property with your company as the beneficiary or member manager respectively these are options best discussed with a financial planner and attorney in your state Insurance Citigroup Security (finance) Real estate broker Debt Islamic banking Collateralized debt obligation Life insurance Microcredit Microeconomics Bond Federal National Mortgage Association Mutual fund Real estate Trust (Law) USA Leasing Finance Capital accumulation Deflation (economics) Annuity Monetary policy Central bank Corporate finance Predatory lending Derivative (finance) Economy of the United States Interest Government National Mortgage Association Primerica Financial Services Labor theory of value Income trust Credit card Wells Fargo Student loan Corporation Title insurance Financial services Economy of Russia Berkshire Hathaway Taxation in the United States Housing cooperative Personal finance Bretton Woods system Plame affair Mobile home Securitization Intellectual property Savings and loan association Tax Collateralized mortgage obligation Financial markets Futures contract Real estate bubble Lawyer Stock Mergers and acquisitions United Kingdom corporation tax Toronto-Dominion Bank Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Privatization Money supply Contract Interest rate Capitalism Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Asset Government debt Property (ownership right) Concurrent estate Credit derivative Temasek Holdings Hong Kong Monetary Authority Economic relations of Japan Usury Surveillance Gold standard History of the United States (1918-1945) Institutional fund management Liability Bank of China (Hong Kong) Property tax Schabir Shaik Trial Enron Corporation Michael Milken FairTax Babylonian law Asian financial crisis Unconscionability Cost of capital Surplus value Home insurance
