what do i need to do to my house to make it ready to rent out the home is years old and the paint is about years old do i still have to paint the entire home inside is it required to shampoo entire carpet does it require any type of inspection by anyone first california if the paint still looks fine then don't worry about that you do need to shampoo the carpet and give the entire place a good scrubbing i would suggest you walk around the entire house photograph everything and then have dated copies of the pictures made for your renters to sign this will help in the event of a damage dispute later i don't know of any inspection requirements although i'm not in california as the landlord you will be responsible for fixing everything even after they move in unless it is due to their neglect so having a prior inspection shouldn't really be necessary research contracts even get a lawyer involved if you can afford it make sure you have them sign and or initial each individual point make it clear what condition you expect the house to be in when they are done living there expect normal wear and tear deterioration from every day living though best of luck kyanna Plame affair Rental agreement STS-114 Leasehold estate Contract Public housing Copyright law of the United Kingdom Animal Crossing Sento Trademark Babylonian law Estoppel Casting Psoriasis Life insurance Photography Nuclear proliferation Royal Assent Buckingham Palace Westheimer Street Festival Toyota Prius Social rule Renting Unlawful combatant Gentrification Carpet Insurance Leasing Shampoo Article One of the United States Constitution E85 Scottish clan Cancer Bike lane debate Radio controlled car Eviction Monopoly (game) Stroke Yu-Gi-Oh!
