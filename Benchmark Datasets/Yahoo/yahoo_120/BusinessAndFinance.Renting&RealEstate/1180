what is the best method for synchronizing the sale of an existing home with the purchase of another i am soon to be married and currently own a home however we would like to by a new home that's ours my philosophy is to wait until mine sells or at least have some people who are seriously interested in mine before making an offer on the new one my fiance already has a home picked out that she likes and would like to go ahead and make an offer before someone else buys it out from under us but since it's a buyer's market i am afraid that we could end up with two mortgages if we do this please wait until your house sells if you buy a new home then list yours it could take another months to sell meanwhile you will have mortgage payments you don't want to start off your marriage being over your heads with bills i'm in the real estate business and i've seen too many people get into real financial crisis' for buying before they sell there will be another house that your fiance likes when the time it right there are a ton of houses out there Mortgage Real estate broker Government National Mortgage Association Security (finance) Federal National Mortgage Association Donald Trump Housing cooperative Islamic banking Insurance Deflation (economics) Real estate Bond Real estate bubble FairTax Treasury security Toronto-Dominion Bank Microeconomics Mortgage-backed security Internet fraud Gross domestic product Life insurance Primerica Financial Services Mergers and acquisitions Personal finance Irish Property Bubble Supply and demand Money Concurrent estate PE ratio Option Wells Fargo Savings and loan association Financial markets Bank Futures contract Derivative (finance) Oakland Athletics Leasing Pyramid scheme Municipal bond Finance Unconscionability Tesco Stock Predatory lending Personal property Price discrimination Annuity Berkshire Hathaway Arbitrage Stock market Debt Sears Catalog Home Toyota Prius History of the United States (1918-1945) Amway Publishing Marketing Auction Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Taxation in the United States MMORPG Wal-Mart Sears Holdings Corporation Stamp duty Great Depression Monopoly (game) Health insurance Insider trading Warren Buffett Ashton-Tate Commodore International British residential property market Babylonian law Tax Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Citigroup Emerson College Gold standard Speculation Surplus value Real estate developer Electronic commerce Monetary policy Bill Gates Inventory National Australia Bank Foreign exchange market Paul Martin Business Los Angeles Clippers Privatization Investment bank Leeds United F.C.
