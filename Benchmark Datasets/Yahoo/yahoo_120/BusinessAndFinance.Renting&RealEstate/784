can you sue someone on social security an ex tenet who was evicted is now sueing my grandfather for un returned security deposit well that sounds nice but you cant take money from social security or his pention right please provide your'e information source p s the tenet didnt get her deposit back because her cat pissed all throughout the house causing a few thousand dollars in damage basicly the ex tenets where white trash as to why my grandfather never gave them a notice i don't know but its like it told him don't bother going to court they cant take garnish your social security or pention one more thing my grandfather is to cheap to get an estimate on the damage so no use in counter sueing btw welfare the state paid her secerity deposit not her blue october you are very ignorant it is impossible for anyone who is on social security to be sued social security and pensions are protected benifits and even if the person did try to sue what will they get nothing but grief and court fees the only cases where social security can be taken are student loans and child support if your grandfather owns other assets then they can be hampered with but in this case it is unlikely the tenant will win the case if it ever does go that far Plame affair Capital accumulation New Deal Security (finance) Microeconomics Social Security (United States) Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Karl Rove Social Security debate (United States) Article One of the United States Constitution Mortgage Bond Social welfare Insurance Economy of the United States Plame affair timeline Child support Tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Intellectual property Corporation Donald Trump Public domain American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Babylonian law Gross domestic product Trust (Law) USA Government debt Social security SCO-Linux controversies Pension Bank fraud Copyright Divorce Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Leasehold estate Contract Lawsuit Credit card Economy of Russia Money supply Eminent domain Liberal Democrats (UK) Slander and libel Asian financial crisis Heather Wilson Rental agreement Mikhail Khodorkovsky Bail bondsman Enron Corporation Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Democratic Party (United States) Internet fraud Money creation Arguments for and against drug prohibition Fractional-reserve banking Student loan Fox hunting Taxation in the United States Discovery (law) Bank Trademark Flat tax Evan Mecham Charles Ponzi Tort reform Wal-Mart Non-aggression principle 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy and irregularities Estoppel Capitalism Citigroup Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Rick Santorum Software patent debate New Zealand National Party Housing cooperative Medical malpractice Public good Common law Annuity 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Surveillance Warren Buffett Unemployment benefit Graduate school Ponzi scheme Short selling Common criticisms of Microsoft Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Neoliberalism H-1B visa Mutual fund Payroll Appeal New Zealand general election, 2005 Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Politics of the United States
