how can i sell a town house without a realetor im trying to sell my townhouse without a professional if you have no real estate knowledge then it will be difficult but not impossible if you are willing to do the work and research a little you can sell your home yourself remember that selling a home is not easy and extremely time consuming especially in the current state of the real estate market if you have very little time and an inflexible schedule then i would recommend getting a realtor if you do have the time and some money to spend on advertising then give it a shot you can always get a realtor later if it doesn't work out i once had a seller call me and asked me if i could talk to some of my pre qualified clients there is nothing worse then agreeing with a buyer and finding out later that they did not qualify for the loan to buy it hope this helps Real estate broker Microeconomics Mortgage Internet fraud Real estate Real estate bubble Technical analysis Life insurance Option Capitalism Mergers and acquisitions Supply and demand Privatization Economics Insider trading Citigroup Marketing research Stock market Gross domestic product Islamic banking Joseph P.
