my husband and i have been renting this condo for years now recently new buyers purchase the unit below us the new buyers below us are creating such a hassel for us they have just closed escrow on the th of july and have already complained to the hoa rep that we are loud and blast our music to in the morning not true anyway they even complained to our rental office we are great tenants have had no complaints and i think these people are harrassing us banging on their ceiling when we watch movies in the middle of the day they might even have some drug addiction going on we have spoken with them twice and both times the owner has slurred her words and has seemed out of it help us you may think about calling the police or the property manager to at least start the process of documenting everything you must document everything to protect yourself you may want to see if there is another condo in the same complex that is for rent nothing is worth dealing with neighbors like that and it seems they won't be going anywhere anytime soon the police is probably your best bet calling the property manager can be useful just to have it on record but they really can't get involved in neighbor disputes Harlem Rental agreement Leasehold estate Mortgage Estoppel Leasing Land reform Housing cooperative Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Condominium Eviction Public housing Donald Trump Concurrent estate CBS Maison Ikkoku Capitalism Copyright infringement of software Poker jargon Renting Microeconomics Illegal drug trade Motion picture rating system Plame affair American individualist anarchism Slander and libel Advance fee fraud Ombudsman Oil-for-Food Programme Trademark Guantanamo Bay Property (ownership right) Beverly Hills, California Monopoly (game) Property tax Islamic banking First-sale doctrine Copyright law of the United Kingdom Digital rights management Timeshare Oakland Athletics Intermediate consumption Arab-Israeli conflict Xerox Apartment building Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Insurance Apartment Stuyvesant Town Gentrification Real property Contract Surveillance Real estate broker United States House of Representatives British residential property market Stakeholder Easement Gun politics Friends Babylonian law Days of our Lives Rape Intellectual property Conveyancing Internet fraud Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Rent control RoboCop 2 Waste (law) Hong Kong Police Force Al-Aqsa Intifada Houston Chronicle Commodity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Boston Red Sox Surplus value Medicine Jean Charles de Menezes Home insurance Huntingdon Life Sciences State North York, Ontario Allodial title Dred Scott v.
