can you lease a house with poor credit i was trying to buy a house but go tinvolved with the wrong mortgage broker and she lowered my score from a low to some of them into the high fours and low fives grrrr well i am currently living in a home owned by my mother but she wants to sell it so i am probably going to have to move out and i have two large dogs so i know my odds of leasing are much better than renting an apartment i just want to make sure that people who lease out homes work with people with limited credit and if i explain it to them and they look at my inquiries then i know i will have to lease for at least a year to get my credit back up to where it needs to be to buy a home i was just wondering if they tend to be more leniant of it the just look for broken leases or what not i worked with a mrotgage broker and she lowered my credit from low s to high s and low s she did this by sending me to several different programs all i wanted to do was buy fha and she said my dti was too high and that it was hard and this and that i am jsut not convinced she knew what she was doing i later switched to another broker but by that time i was in the low 's and it was just rough trying to get it worked out just how did this broker lower your rating so much it depends on the person who is renting the house astute ll's pull a credit report and go from there edited to add that explanation only makes sense if your credit report was pulled over times in a period that exceeded a day period it could have been pulled a within the first days and would not count against you but time Mortgage Housing cooperative Mutual fund Leasing History of the United States (1918-1945) Insurance Short selling Student loan Citigroup Leasehold estate Citigroup Center Miss Saigon Arbitrage Real estate broker Monopoly (game) FairTax Battery electric vehicle Gross domestic product Predatory lending Boston and Lowell Railroad Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Tide Credit score Day trading United Kingdom corporation tax Supply and demand Mobile home Cable television Federal National Mortgage Association Airline Diode Emerson College Aerial (dance move) Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act New Deal Mergers and acquisitions Real estate bubble Tesco Microeconomics Berkshire Hathaway Money Identity theft Apartment Derivative (finance) National Certificate of Educational Achievement Technical analysis Good Times HIV test First-sale doctrine Debt White flight Equine conformation Government National Mortgage Association Taxation in the United States Wells Fargo Dominoes WEPN Weight training Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Farmers' Alliance Car handling Stock Appeal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pump It Up Sin City Grade (education) Humphrey Bogart XERF United Artists Annuity Flat tax Intelligence quotient Security (finance) Bulk vending Meat Loaf Warren Buffett Urban sprawl Stamp duty Hard disk Discordianism Public housing Squatting Friends Surplus value Economic rent Brewery Free trade Avenue Q Islamic banking Digital photography Speed of light Inflation Plame affair Los Angeles Clippers Abigail Folger
