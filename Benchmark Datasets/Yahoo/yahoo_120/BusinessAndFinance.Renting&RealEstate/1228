my next door neighbor knocked down my fence and is refusing to pay for a new fence what can i do my neighbor's landlord knocked down my fence years ago and is now refusing to pay half for a new fence i called the county and they said there is nothing i could do but i think it is considered a public nuisance since it is visible from the street and is a safety hazard to my family also the landlord who rents the house is not giving me or her tenants any privacy the landlord owns a million house and is still refusing to pay let me clarify it is my grandmas house and she has given up so i decided to step in my grandma is and the landlord claimed that my grandmother knocked the fence over i wish i can knock over a fence when i'm there was only one section of the fence that was leaning over but it wasn't bad the landlord deliberately knocked the fence down on her own without notifying my grandmother hope that is a little more clear thanks for the answers they're what i expected so far if the house was on your side of the property you can sue him for the full amount if the fence was on the property line you would split the cost of the fence if the cost of the fence is under you can go to small claims court he would be responsible for some or all of the cost best of luck Leasehold estate Rental agreement Public housing Estoppel Poker jargon Monopoly (game) Babylonian law Waste (law) Leasing Harlem Property (ownership right) Israeli West Bank barrier Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Craps History of Ireland (1801-1922) SCO-Linux controversies Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Downing Street memo Baseball Plame affair Taxation in the United States Easement Rick Santorum Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Burglary Nuisance Anti-Defamation League Irish Land Act Eviction Wrigley Field Absentee landlord Tort Public good Divorce History of Santa Monica, California Martial art Blackjack Hubert H.
