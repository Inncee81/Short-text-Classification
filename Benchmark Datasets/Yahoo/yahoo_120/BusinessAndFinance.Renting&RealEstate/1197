after reading my whole question can someone tell me the pros of renting out our home i know the cons how do i know what to rent it out for also my mortgage went up because i thought we'd move out by years so now that we're a little behind i decided not to refi since i thought we'd be selling however its a tough market so we may have to rent it out should i refi to get the mortgage payments lower before i rent it since the mortgage is definitely high for our home i need advice and ideas of how to maybe rent but make a little money too anyone rent out there and how do you work it and figure out what to make the rent amount do you think based on the national average of yrs the location of the property and shape that it's in that it will double in value if so may i suggest something a little outside the box refi into interest only no pre pay penalty payments try to get half back in rent if you get more bonus the rest of the balance you should be able to get back from your tax return from writing off the mortgage and depreciation if you can create at minimum breaking even until the property value doubles then you can refi and pull of the equity out if it is worth now you would be able to pull out of tax free money the only real risk is if you think that the property will not appreciate very well but if you are breaking even then there's no real loss anyway rental property can be a great investment but don't get too caught up in trying to get the rent payments to match the mortgage payments it usually doesn't happen unless you have paid down more than half of it already and don't forget about your deductions good luck Life insurance Insurance Monopoly (game) Taxation in the United States Leasing Microeconomics Annuity Deflation (economics) Debt Mutual fund Bond Government National Mortgage Association Estoppel Islamic banking Money Gross domestic product Real estate bubble United Kingdom corporation tax Economic rent Property tax 401(k) Mortgage-backed security Operating surplus FairTax Keynesian economics Capital accumulation Renting Donald Trump Profit Interest Progressive tax Leasehold estate Intellectual property British residential property market Federal National Mortgage Association Warren Buffett Flat tax Value added Poker jargon Inflation Economy of the United States Security (finance) Income trust Cost of capital Collateralized mortgage obligation Student loan Economy of Russia Allodial title Concurrent estate Investment bank Reaganomics Personal finance Derivative (finance) Predatory lending Capitalism Social Security debate (United States) Free trade Tax Reform Act of 1986 Bretton Woods system Salary cap Municipal bond Mobile home Income statement American individualist anarchism Arthur Laffer Real estate developer Babylonian law Bank Measures of national income and output Minimum wage Primerica Financial Services Monetary policy $ale of the Century Gold standard Rent (musical) Avenue Q Squatting You Don't Know Jack Harlem Geolibertarianism Government debt Corporate finance Consumption of fixed capital U.S. public debt Knots Landing Public good Subsidy Productive and unproductive labour Economy of India
