im moving into an apartment for the st time any advice thanx when you first move in take pictures of anything that is wrong with the apartment and document it that way when you move out they can't accuse you of any damages that were there before you moved in even take pictures of little scratches in the floor or walls even if they don't look like a big deal you never know if they could blame your for it also when you move out take pictures again and document buy your basic furniture you can always add more stuff as time goes on you don't want to spend all your money trying to get everything all at once good luck Paramount Pictures Craps Neopets Great Teacher Onizuka Great Depression Aerial (dance move) Bratislava Castle Galactic Civilizations United Artists Buckingham Palace Francis Bacon (painter) Arthur Laffer James T.
