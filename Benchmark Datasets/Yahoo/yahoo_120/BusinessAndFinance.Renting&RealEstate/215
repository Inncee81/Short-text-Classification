has anybody ever used john beck's system it's supossed to teach you how to buy properties at government tax auctions i wanted to know if it's worth th mony to pay for it thanks thanks i figured that if i did enough reasearh i could find the same info with out wasting my money and if his system were helpful and worth it then i may have considered it now i know that it's not worth it i have a best answer i just have to wait an hour to select it i bought his free clear system a few years ago i was thoroughly unimpressed with it all the manuals were chock full of spelling errors it looked so unprofessional like nobody'd even taken the time to review it before it was published i took that as the first bad sign because how can you have respect for your product and your customers if you leave your product looking like crap of course spelling just happens to be one of my biggest pet peeves so maybe it upset me more than other people the actual information in the manuals cds was also a lot different than i'd expected first of all a lot of the website links didn't work and were dead ends i gleaned some useful information from it but didn't feel that the system went into enough depth in a nutshell i was disappointed my co investor my dad ended up going to a tax sale in our county and was completely shocked when he realized that there were perhaps a dozen or more other investors with a lot more money there ready to pounce on the properties john beck wants you to believe that there are scores of properties available for or even or something but my dad says that the bidding would go up to about within a minute i was shocked to hear dad's report about that i don't think john beck tells you about the high level of competition there really is among these properties that being said i did learn some stuff from the free clear course that i didn't know before although i later found that same information for free on the internet oh yes if you buy the system beware after i bought it i started getting calls from men saying they wanted to be my free clear mentors and help me buy properties as long as i coughed up several thousand dollars i later found out that this was a scam and that it happens to other john beck customers too it is possible to buy cheap homes at tax sales but you'd probably be better off skipping this course and finding the same information online for free The Apprentice 2 Craps Shaggy dog story Internet fraud Bulk vending Confidence trick FairTax MMORPG Extreme Programming Gross domestic product Advance fee fraud Contract bridge Wal-Mart Amazon.com The Amazing Race Alex Ferguson Monopoly (game) Make money fast Donald Trump Education in the United States Babe Ruth Capital accumulation Live 8 Temasek Holdings Warren Buffett Hey Jude Enron Corporation Economy of Russia Tax Supply and demand Knots Landing Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Copyleft Outsourcing Poker jargon Pitaten Neopets Gold as an investment Life insurance Amway Tesco Best Buy Corporate governance David Beckham The Standard Annuity Electronic commerce Ra (board game) Canadian and American economies compared Tax protester Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban MapleStory Daredevil XERF U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Scientology beliefs and practices PE ratio Information Services Procurement Library Major League Baseball television contracts Free trade Wealth James J.
