should i buy now or wait i currently have about in equity in my home the prices in my neighborhood started dropping like a rock about months ago we are planning on moving about an hour away and buying a larger home to accommodate our growing family the houses there are not dropping at all do we buy now even though the payments on the new home will be a big stretch or do we stay and hope they go down in the new area my fear is that if the price of ours goes down farther while the other house stays the same that soon we will not be able to afford to move at all advice the market is what the sellers demand to move makes it if you have to move from the area now then you usually drop the price to get out quick but if you can hold on to the home hypothicate and get your other one now its always better to wait out the buyers for your special home don't give re away that's what they call a buyers mkt lock one in now and save for the long run yours will sell soon and you will get your price consider what you may have paid yrs ago for your home and what its worth now that's the tale in this dilemma Stock Option Stock market Mortgage Supply and demand Real estate broker Technical analysis Deflation (economics) Hyperinflation Microeconomics Derivative (finance) Price discrimination Short selling Real estate bubble Wal-Mart Bond Gold as an investment Poker jargon Day trading Housing cooperative Margin (finance) Advertising MMORPG Billboard Hot 100 Financial markets Gold standard Sears Holdings Corporation Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Call option Arbitrage Auction Security (finance) Enron Corporation Health insurance Ford Motor Company ITunes Music Store Keynesian economics PE ratio Capitalism Internet fraud Temasek Holdings Capital accumulation Illegal drug trade Rational pricing Bretton Woods system Berkshire Hathaway White flight Monetary policy 1973 oil crisis Predatory lending Economics Warren Buffett FairTax Hire purchase Investment bank Monopoly Annuity Public transport Rosa Parks Gross domestic product Surplus value Dividend Mutual fund Estoppel Labor theory of value Insider trading Economy of Russia Marketing New York Stock Exchange Adverse selection Islamic banking Credit derivative Toyota Prius Mobile home Shortage economy Mergers and acquisitions History of post-Soviet Russia History of the United States (1918-1945) WTVJ Subscription business model Trading Places Great Depression Market economy Irish Property Bubble Miss Saigon Put option Warranty Government National Mortgage Association Urban sprawl Minimum wage Tax Option style Sears Catalog Home Common Agricultural Policy Bulk vending Exchange rate Video game crash of 1983 Dot-com Closed-end fund
