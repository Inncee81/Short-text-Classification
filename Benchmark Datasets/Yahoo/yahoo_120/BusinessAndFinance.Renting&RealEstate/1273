how can a k house cost mo w a rate at y fixed mortgage good friends of mine are about to become st time home owners and told me unflinchingly that their mortgage payment would be mo for a house less than k this is through national city bank and not even a broker they are using a year fixed rate at how is this possible i pointed out that using an amortization table their payments should be just under excluding taxes and home owners insurance neither of which could possibly explain the month difference they are living in the midwest in a lower tax area estimated the taxes are about yr i am trying to find the right way to explain to them that they are being taken advantage of without jeopordizing our friendship but i wanted to make sure there was nothing i was missing that could explain why they are paying month more than i think they should based on that purchase price and rate thanks definitely a year fixed not a year fixed not the property taxes they live in the country of ohio our taxes are low for this house about per year you should read the truth in lending disclosure which gives you the true annual percentage rate interest and all fees the total of payments the total of all interest etc personally and without a truth in lending calculator i think their figures are in the ballpark because of the years of interest due as a rough guideline the interest on a year loan will be about double the total principal so if they borrowed the total due over years will be that comes to roughly per month then you have to add the escrow for insurance and real estate taxes so per month seems reasonable don't forget they will get a sizeable tax deduction for their interest payments Insurance Tax Taxation in the United States Annuity Bond FairTax Microeconomics Mutual fund Annual percentage rate Student loan Deflation (economics) Predatory lending Gross domestic product Inflation Islamic banking Government National Mortgage Association Real estate bubble Leasing Mortgage-backed security Title insurance Federal National Mortgage Association Health insurance Property tax Real estate broker Social Security (United States) Surplus value Municipal bond Interest Donald Trump Social Security debate (United States) National Insurance Warren Buffett Compensation of employees United Kingdom corporation tax Debt Variable universal life insurance Savings and loan association Collateralized mortgage obligation Microcredit Reaganomics Personal finance Economy of Pakistan Operating surplus Free trade Supply-side economics Monetary policy Publicly funded medicine Consumption of fixed capital Bank Value added tax Gold standard Government debt Unemployment Dividend Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Capitalism Productive and unproductive labour Economy of the United States Finance Stamp duty Inheritance tax Income tax Futures contract Capital gains tax Primerica Financial Services Value added Cost of capital Progressive tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Value product Certificate of deposit Salary cap Concurrent estate Intellectual property Unemployment benefit Mobile home History of the United States (1918-1945) Auto insurance Mergers and acquisitions Corporation U.S. public debt Islamic economics Subsidy Stock Hyperinflation Cost accounting Income trust
