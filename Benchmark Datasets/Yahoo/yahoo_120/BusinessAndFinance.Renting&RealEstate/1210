if i buy my first home with bad credit and agree to all terms that come with a sub prime loan and say a month or two later my credit is good middle score over then can i refinance my loan to a prime loan i was just about to apply for a home loan as i have good credit due to authorised user tradelines since this will change on sept i wanted to get my loan before that this morning i notice an incorrect entry on my credit report i will fight it but it will take to days too late for me because as soon as sept hits the au lines will not be considered and my middle score will crash you have to make a decision i have a couple of questions do you have a home under contract presently are you pre approved for a loan of any kind sub prime or anything else you indicated you are about to apply for a home loan so i can safely say that the answer to my two questions are no since you have neither applied for a loan or have a house under contract wait until you have fought the credit bureaus and cleaned up your credit a bit with a higher credit score you will be able to lower your interest rate thus lowering your monthly payment if you get pre approved and find a house before sep you will get a loan that has a pre payment penalty that will be in effect for a minimum of years and could be in effect as long as years but normally they go no further than years so make up your mind what you want to do and what is important to you i hope this has been of some use to you good luck fight on Student loan Mortgage Monetary policy Deflation (economics) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Debt Annuity Credit score Credit card Short selling United Kingdom corporation tax Refinancing Schabir Shaik Trial Islamic banking Bank Insurance Bond Microeconomics Predatory lending Unemployment Interest Article One of the United States Constitution Economy of Russia Annual percentage rate 401(k) Government National Mortgage Association Kyoto Protocol FairTax Personal finance Economy of Pakistan Debt consolidation Bank fraud Primerica Financial Services $ale of the Century Real estate bubble Minimum wage Credit history National Certificate of Educational Achievement Education in the United States UK Singles Chart Tertiary education fees in Australia Contract Health insurance Money Bretton Woods system Supply and demand Economy of the Philippines Internet fraud Deficit spending Futures contract Consumer finance Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Divorce Savings and loan association Certificate of deposit Appeal Hyperinflation Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Taxation in the United States Capitalism Speed limit Parliament of the United Kingdom Estoppel Great Depression Air America Radio Parliament of Canada Economy of India Inflation Derivative (finance) ACORN Interest rate CPU cache Keynesian economics Royal Assent Salary cap Paul Martin Sydney Riot of 1879 Mensal__o scandal Japan-United States relations Laws of cricket Social rule Trade union Tennessee State Constitution Federal Reserve Anarchist economics Gross domestic product Liberal Party of Canada Leasing Subsidy Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Leeds United F.C.
