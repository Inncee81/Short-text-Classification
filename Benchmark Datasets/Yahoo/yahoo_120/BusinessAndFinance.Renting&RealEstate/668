landlord question i have been living in a new apartment for about a month since its new there have been a lot of problems and things which had not been tested before we moved in we have a persistent problem with the fridge and when it does turn off we lose the contents of our fridge it is co managed by the landlord and the owner of the apartment what measures do i take now to complain calls are getting no where and they blame each other but get nothing done there are only so many times i can wait on the phone for a engineer to fix the fridge the washing machine the boiler can anyone help hi everyone i arranged for a fridge engineer twice what the landlord did do is send the reciept so the service was free however it isnt working and there arent too many days i can take off for waiting for an engineer and also the many calls if you have given adequate notice to the landlord and have given them adequate and reasonable time to fix the problem and they are not doing anything to help you then you could either pay to have the problem fixed yourself and send them a reciept and withhold that amount from your rent payment or threaten to take them to landlord tenant court they have a responsibility to fix your problems in a reasonable amount of time if you decide to withhold rent then they will either realize that you are very serious and go ahead and work with you or they might try and tell you things like they will evict you for non payment however they will have no legal standing if you defend yourself in court with accurate records and pictures so go ahead and start recording everything and take the lead in this issue and do what you have to do good luck Leasehold estate Eviction Estoppel Microeconomics Rental agreement 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Leasing Anarchism and capitalism Bretton Woods system Taxation in the United States Insurance Royal Assent Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Judiciary of Hong Kong Social rule Scottish clan Appeal CPU cache Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Oh My Goddess!
