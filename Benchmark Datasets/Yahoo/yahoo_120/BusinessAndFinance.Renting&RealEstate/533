help rent just went up dollars with no notice can a new landlord just raise your rent with no notice furthermore can a landlord give you a day eviction notice with no previous warning raising the rent is not illegal in any state regardless of what some posters here say you have to be given a day notice though he had to inform you by july if the raise is in effect aug the day eviction is a warning and does not require any other warning it is not an eviction but a notice that he is going to file eviction if you don't pay your rent evictions take days i would strongly recommend you avoid that they stay on your credit report as a warning to future landlords that you do not pay your rent it is hard to find a new place with that on your record Leasehold estate Rental agreement CPU cache Plame affair Taxation in the United States Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849) Squatting Accounting methods Motion picture rating system Estoppel Irish Land Act Identity theft Public housing Harlem Big Brother UK series 6 Irish Land League Appeal Microeconomics Money Big Brother (Australian TV series) Michael Davitt Assignment (law) Big Brother (USA TV series) Insurance Interplay Entertainment Highland Clearances Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ABC No Rio Windows XP Anarcho-capitalism Gentrification Computer virus Minimum wage Mensal__o scandal Surveillance Pinoy Big Brother Monopoly (game) Social Security (United States) Satchel Paige Mary Jane Kelly Leasing Freedom Party candidates, 2003 Ontario provincial election History of Ireland (1801-1922) Supply and demand Annuity Strategic lawsuit against public participation Judiciary of Hong Kong Ocean's Twelve Small claims court Operation Murambatsvina Housing cooperative Khalid al-Mihdhar New Deal Highland Land League Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Mortgage Sinn F__in New Hampshire Supreme Court Nawaf al-Hazmi Rent (musical) Renting Israeli settlement Capital accumulation Modding Freetown Christiania Great Depression 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Automatic number plate recognition Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 British national identity card Big Brother UK series 5 Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Poverty line Anarchism and capitalism Annexation Economy of Africa Road-rule enforcement camera Karl Rove Neville Chamberlain Campaign finance reform Mixed martial arts 2005 trial of Michael Jackson George W.
