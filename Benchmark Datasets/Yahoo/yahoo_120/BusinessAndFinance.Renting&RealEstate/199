can you lose your house in a bankruptcy filing even if you are not late on your mortgage payments you can be foreclosed even if you make every payment on time it's rare but it does happen if you break any terms of the mortgage not just the payment terms the lender has the right to accellerate the loan and require you to pay the entire outstanding balance however judges do not like to grant foreclosures on people who are current on their loans so there has to be a good reason for the lender to do this traditional banks almost never foreclose unless payment is not made banks are in the money lending business not the real estate owning business however non traditional lenders individuals investment companies etc may find owning a property tempting especially if the property is worth far more than the loan this is how it usually happens bill borrower tells lucy lender he wants to buy a house to live in and that he has a large downpayment lucy lends bill the money needed to buy the house at a lower interest rate than she would have if bill had told her he was a landlord and that he was going to rent the house out lower interest rates for people who will live in a house compared to people who intend to rent a home out are common bill never lives in the house he rents it immediately a term of the mortgage states bill must live in the house lucy finds out about it and forecloses she was damaged because she gave a lower interest rate than she would have if she had known the truth bill ripped lucy off even though bill is current on all his payments the judge would grant the foreclosure because bill ripped off lucy in the last real estate bubble this set of circumstances was fairly common Deflation (economics) Insurance Bond Bank Government National Mortgage Association Debt Real estate bubble Predatory lending Islamic banking Real estate Finance Donald Trump Financial markets Student loan Allodial title Foreclosure Security (finance) Concurrent estate Annual percentage rate Federal National Mortgage Association Real estate broker Debt consolidation Money Microcredit Mortgage-backed security Leasehold estate Annuity Housing cooperative Leasing Monetary policy Taxation in the United States Economy of the United States Capital accumulation Personal finance Title insurance Interest rate Mobile home Great Depression Savings and loan association Microeconomics Islamic economics Estoppel 401(k) Wells Fargo Subsidy Federal Reserve Monopoly (game) Economy of Pakistan Gross domestic product Citigroup Credit card Harlem Intellectual property Short selling Economy of India United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Credit score Privatization Renting Surplus value American individualist anarchism Payday loan Anarchism and capitalism Corporation Bank fraud Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Business cycle Tax Supply-side economics Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Hyperinflation Real estate developer Schabir Shaik Trial Ponzi scheme History of the United States (1918-1945) Money supply Derivative (finance) Savings and Loan crisis Bankruptcy Babylonian law U.S. public debt Personal property Municipal bond Keynesian economics Free trade
