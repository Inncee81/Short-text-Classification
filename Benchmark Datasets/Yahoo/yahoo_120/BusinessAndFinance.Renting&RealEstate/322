new mobile home on my own land installation issues i am considering purchasing a double wide mobile home in the next days i already have more than enough money in the bank due to the unfortunate passing away of my father by way of the life insurance settlement i am just trying to figure out now wether it would be better for me to buy land for the mobile home or place it inside a mobile home park i already have all the information about pricing except for one thing if i purchase land for my mobile home how much would it probably cost to have the utilities connected i mean there's water lines sewer lines power lines and everything that has to be connected and i don't know how much something like that would run and who to call to get to do it the people moving the mobile home from the factory to the site have told me that they pretty much only deliver the home and they do not hook up anything also dosen't the bottom of the mobile home have to have like a concrete slab or something on it help i will be living in lake county indiana if that helps your own land is better but it will cost for things depending on your area a septic system would be the most unless there's municipal water close by the lines would be less than i'm guessing there should be others with mobile homes in the area that can give you details on what it would cost for the various items check with your town because they might have some restrictions too we had a mobile home in a park but the prices kept escalating faster than we realized then they started to charge for the trash collection that used to be free then they wanted to collect for the water that used to be free then the lawn service that used to be free and on and on no you don't need a slab they can set the home on concrete blocks that you can buy at home depot or one of the box stores be sure it's concrete not cinder block Surveillance CPU cache Octopus card Autonomous building Mutual fund Solar power MTR Monopoly (game) Public transport Microeconomics Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sears Holdings Corporation Mortgage Internet fraud Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) GSM services Tesco Hard disk Irrigation Gross domestic product Virgin Mobile Annuity Solar cell Voice over IP UK telephone numbering plan EFTPOS Commodity markets Berkshire Hathaway Wal-Mart FairTax Filling station Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus North American Numbering Plan Windows XP TGV London Underground Thermal power station San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Philatelic investment Kitchen Mobile home $ale of the Century Modem Poker jargon Insurance New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad Money Transport in Hong Kong Price discrimination Seismic retrofit Midlothian, Virginia Health insurance Heinkel He 100 IBM PC compatible Dawson Creek, British Columbia Textile manufacturing ITunes Music Store Taxation in the United States Network Switching Subsystem Capitalism Euro USB flash drive Bank Naval mine Dorothea Puente Craps Stock Redundant array of independent disks Hybrid vehicle Washington Metro Anchor Laptop United States Postal Service Manitoba Hydro Economics Dam Wheel of Fortune Free trade Hyperinflation Publicly funded medicine Cremation Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Password Mac OS X Natural monopoly Glossary of American football Warren Buffett Jersey City, New Jersey Mars, Pennsylvania PHP Internet IPod Rapid transit Railway signalling Bay Area Rapid Transit
