should people who mortgaged more than they should have and they knew it be bailed out vs bankrupcy i've always wondered how people who are just starting are miraculously able to afford a house well of course they went for the extremely risky loans that were being offered to them left and right no income verification interest only variable rate etc when interest rates were really low so is it now our fault and we're supposed to bail them out or else it will affect the economy nonsense they took and knew the risk and recent 's history warned them what could happen and they ignored it i mean am i the only one who opens a history book any more but then there will be a glut of overpriced houses on the market so it will be a temporary thing believe me people who really can afford it will buy up those houses at discount prices and reap the rewards as they should should people who live beyond their means expect sympathy from those of us who play by the rules sacrifice wait and save up for things what do you think before i weep for any banks let them sell the pricey properties that they own huge mega skyscrapers in the most expensive acreage in major cities there's no reason in today's electronic age for any bank to occupy a mega skyscraper in manhattan chicago l a miami or any other major city they could have a building out in dogpatch kansas and consumers could care less in fact they owe it to their customers to do just that save money by moving to depressed areas thereby helping that local economy and cutting their bottom line costs passing higher interest rates along to their depositors i agree completely no bail out for the customers or the lenders let them all sink for making bad decisions it's called personal corporate responsibility Mortgage Bank Credit card Monetary policy Debt Capitalism Bond Deflation (economics) Citigroup Interest Microeconomics Inflation Predatory lending Student loan FairTax Privatization Life insurance Mutual fund Finance Central bank Supply and demand Annuity Islamic banking Federal Reserve Gross domestic product Microcredit Health insurance Asian financial crisis Economy of the United States Rational pricing Capital accumulation Taxation in the United States Economy of Russia Arbitrage Say's law Corporation Hyperinflation Price discrimination Wal-Mart Gold standard Savings and Loan crisis Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Toronto-Dominion Bank Supply-side economics Money Government debt Keynesian economics Corporate finance Sport utility vehicle Federal National Mortgage Association Temasek Holdings Money supply Financial markets History of the United States (1918-1945) Free trade Subsidy Tax Security (finance) Real estate bubble Great Depression Derivative (finance) Intellectual property Publicly funded medicine Housing cooperative Usury Mergers and acquisitions Interest rate Income trust Labor theory of value Anarchism and capitalism Modern portfolio theory Tariff New Deal Short selling Flat tax Capital asset pricing model Yield curve Donald Trump Education in the United States Wall Street Investment bank Eugene Fama Futures contract Wells Fargo Auto insurance Risk Arguments for and against drug prohibition Sears Holdings Corporation Mobile home Surplus value CPU design Criticisms of socialism Tesco Leasing
