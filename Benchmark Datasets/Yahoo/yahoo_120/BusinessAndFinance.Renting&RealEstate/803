what would you do buy it anyways i found my perfect house for i called and it had an accepted offer on it already subject to financing on the th i put in a backup offer anyways just in case financing didnt go through for the offer the house is vacant so i went there by myself to chck something out and there was a car so i played it cool like i had just seen the sign and stopped it was the people with the accepted offer they told me they would sell it to me for k over are they fricken nuts they have it listed one week at this price as well in the paper privately so i already have a backup offer with the original seller do you think i should put an offer in with these ripoff bastards too like maybe it is an alright deal at but no the there asking what would you do i don't want to put in an offer with them because i just cant beleive they raised the price that much without even touching it they dot know i have the backup offer the original real estate agent says she is not very confidant in the financing of seller she is selling for her parents they are aware i know what it was orinally i told them it was listed already for that price and also i am in canada and we aren't having a housing crisis or anything like that wait a minute you are not making sense here and there are red flags all over the place on this one first off it is not the seller who put in the offer if the real estate agent is selling it for her parents than that is ok now my question is this how did you find out the details of that first offer that real estate agent just did something against the law and i'm not sure i would trust her at all are you sure she is an agent or just helping her parents with the sale of their home how do you know it was the people who put in an offer they can't offer to sell a house that isn't even theirs yet yet let alone make the statements they did to you they can't even list the house officially without having title to it if you have already put in a backup offer leave it at that so you aren't brought into this situation you can't put two offers in on the same house either do not speak with these people don't put in an offer legal and binding in with them or do anything else it doesn't matter if you would offer a penny at this point red flag means possible fraud Contract Real estate broker Microeconomics Plame affair Internet fraud Trust (Law) USA Short selling Estoppel Mediation Mortgage Paul Martin Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Property (ownership right) Tax Auction Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Insider trading Jennifer Lopez Sponsorship scandal Theory of conduct Economics LiveJournal Social rule Hyperinflation Security (finance) United Kingdom corporation tax Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Citigroup Option Donald Rumsfeld Capitalism Insurance Babylonian law Philosophical skepticism Stock Plame affair timeline Gresham's law Oil-for-Food Programme Pyramid scheme Ocean's Twelve Grandview, U.S.A.
