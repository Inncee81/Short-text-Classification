what are some things to justify the cost of a house whats considered good quality and whats bad quality you can use any measure to justify the cost if a house the final justification is what will someone buy this house for in this market it is as simple as that concerning appraisals generally a real estate agent or an appraiser will first start with comps competitive prices for other similar properties in that neighborhood normally they check those comps and firct break them down into a cost per square foot basis for each house this will give them a range for how prices are going in that area that will give them a range of prices say from sqft to sqft from there you just look at your property check to see how it is quality wise if everything is top notch compared to the other properties it will be in the sqft range if it is in poor shape more towards the sqft range in this example if it is in good shape but doesn't have all the conveniences of some of the others poorer design etc then in the middle somewhere good quality bad quality is simply what do buyers in that area consider important an outdoor pool in southern california is a huge selling point but in alaska it is not in some places a c is not really important but in arizona it is mandatory with central air a big positive against only evaporative coolers in one neighborhood where it is all upscale homeowners then upgraded kitchens and gold fittings in the bathroom is a huge plus but a few blocks away in a primarily rental area then just basic appliances and fittings are much better for value so these are all local questions depending on the market for that town and even that neighborhood Microeconomics Supply and demand Mortgage Economics Kitchen Real estate appraisal Tax White flight Gross domestic product Inflation Insurance Surplus value Real estate broker Paintball Binoculars Capital accumulation Toyota Camry Natural monopoly Bicycle lighting Illegal drug trade Property tax Mutual fund Labor theory of value Cable television Free market Free trade Comparison of 21st century fighter aircraft Carlsbad, California Law of value Education in the United States Mattress Monopoly Property (ownership right) Theory of conduct RISC New Urbanism Harlem Commodity FairTax Urban sprawl Monopoly (game) E85 Sugar Land, Texas Deflation (economics) Technical analysis Scottsdale, Arizona Berkshire Hathaway Yacht Urban renewal Carburetor Welding Price discrimination Sport utility vehicle Goodness and value theory Fair market value Nintendo Trademark Model (economics) Housing cooperative Political economy Transformation problem Public housing Normal distribution Externality McMansion Prices of production Supply-side economics Diving suit Commodity markets Intellectual property Marketing Islamic banking Autonomous building Chevrolet Camaro Wall Street Warez Diamond Economic history of communist Czechoslovakia Economic calculation problem Gold standard IBM PC compatible Solar power Plastic MMORPG CPU cache Mainframe computer Leasing Real estate bubble Milwaukee, Wisconsin Productive and unproductive labour Incandescent light bulb Sears Holdings Corporation Public policy
