how do i deal with a younger supervisor i've just recently started working for a fitness company would rather not mention the name i don't have an issue with the operations manager however her assistant is the problem she seems to have an issue with me upon filling out my new hire paperwork she became frustrated with me as i was taking my time filling out my tax information i wanted to be sure everything was filled out correctly as it is my money and my paycheck she grew furious because she was off at pm and it was now pm when i reached the pertinent information she kept pressuring me to hurry up she was rude to me and demeaning to me in front of other customers and co workers i am years old she's and the assistant manager now i realize age isn't the issue but the fact that she's younger than i am and higher up i think she feels she can belittle me anyway i told the manager about her behavior and how i'm not willing to tolerate it on a daily basis i'm not the only one to complain about it so my question is how do i deal with her because now that i've complained to my boss about her she's gone and told the manager that i arrive at work late i'm never on time and yada yada yada which isn't true i'm always minutes early and i work full time this is only my part time evening job what do i do to deal with this issue it's obvious my manager is not going to handle the situation so how can i continue to deal with her on a day to day basis any suggestions i feel that because shey's younger and higher up she has gotten this very big ego over it and now thinks she's tough s another thing that made me angry was that she insisted on filling out my direct deposit information assuming i didn't know how it's gotten to the point to where i have to hunt her down when i get to work to let her know i'm at work so she doesn't march over to my manager and lie and tell her i came in late and on top of that i have to clock in why can't she just leave me alone and focus on her job the way clocking in works it doesn't matter when you clock in you'll be clocked in for the time you are supposed to start to the time you are to stop working i was told by my manager if i was minutes late and i clocked in it would still be for the time i was supposed to start and end either way they don't know if i'm late or not which is poor disorganization on the companies' behalf not my fault however there's no way for my manager to know i come into work minutes early regardless because her assistant manager who seems to despise me for some reason keeps telling her i come in late it's no fixing it i like this job and would like to keep it it's only something i do to keep busy because i do make good money with my fulltime job why can't she just mind her own business grow up and do her job to start age and maturity will always be an issue at any job if you are treated unfairly and in front of people document it and bring it to the hr of the company do not neccesarily go directly to your manager the next thing is you clock in system is messed up you should be paid for the time your there that you should be rewarded for coming in early because why come in early if people are being rewarded or not being docked for coming in late my suggestion since this is a part time job move on if it was a full time i would say other wise i have been going through a situation lately with a team lead that i am currently more qualified unfortunately life isn't always fair but if you work hard and stick up for yourself you will be ok just make sure you do not drop to that persons level bring issues up in a professional manner and always document any wrong doings 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Friends Scientology beliefs and practices Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Economics The Apprentice 2 Characters in the Smurfs Knots Landing Avenue Q K' Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act The Smoking Room Philosophical skepticism Transactional analysis W.
