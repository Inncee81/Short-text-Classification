how to deal with this what would you do i know this person who is for a lack of better words to describe her very difficult to be around i have known her for years or so and she has continually been one of those friends that you never really want to do anything with but feel guilty if you don't atleast do something with her now and then she puts up the biggest fuss over the smallest things everytime we go out its very embarrassing to even be seen in public with her because of her annoying tendencies i don't feel right telling her no all the time or even lying to get out having to do stuff with her but when i do go out with her i feel like i have really wasted my time and energy trying to have fun only to be miserable half the time i have tried confronting her with the issues that bother me and that just starts an arguement and i don't want to have to deal with the drama does anyone know an easy way to avoid hurting her feelings yet gives me an excuse not to be around her btw we are both single women thanks so far your tips are all great however writing a letter is futile it will also start drama as she will track me down at work in public or call me and start crap she doesn't realize that she is the problem she thinks everyone else is just too immature she is older than me and our mutual friends who also can't stand her we have all tried to talk to her and it does no good we can't find her a boyfriend so i'm in the process of finding one for myself thanks sexy dixie boy good idea i have the same problem with a friend that i've been best friends with for over years aswell its a hard situation to be in but you have to do what's right by you this is what i did to help my situation so i hope this may give you some hope ideas with you own situation i decided that because my friend was extremely demanding starting issues over the smallest of things if we were at a restraunt you could see myself trying to sink under the table whilst my friend would rant and rave if we were at a clothes shop i would prented to be looking at anything other then my friend ranting and raving at some ppor sales assistant at how short the t shirt sleeves and and how long the shirt is in the body and do not get me started with the public transport system either oh lordy in the end i found i too was changing into this bitter and twisted person and i was not liking who i was becomming so i decided that right then and there i would change so i enrolled myself in a hobby that i alwaysed liked and i knew they would have no interest in and suddenley i became busy and as my hobby grew so did the lack available time i have with my friend there was nothing the friend could say because she knew my excuses for why we couldn't catch up were now days i'm lucky that if i catch up with my friend once in a blue moon sure we may e mail but that too is now easy down to the occasional e mail once a month type thing hope this helps you Social rule Kodocha Shaggy dog story Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) EastEnders 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Adventures of Pete & Pete Blood on the Tracks The Ashlee Simpson Show Pitaten Undergrads Little Britain Kim Possible Trailer Park Boys Aerial (dance move) Time Out of Mind Alcoholics Anonymous Theory of conduct Futurama (TV series - season 2) Humphrey Bogart Craps Fancy Crane George Costanza Earth Girl Arjuna Sin City One Piece minor characters The Catcher in the Rye Ranma __ characters Sex and the City The Smoking Room James T.
