i work in a restaurant and have something to say mostly to african americans the restaurant customers are african american i've been there for years i've always tried to remain non prejudice but last night changed my outlook for good during my employment i've witnessed children being told to shut up slapped in the face or wherever eat their food or else one woman pointed a knife at her child and told him to shut the f up i've seen them dragged into the bathroom while they're screaming parents arguing with they're children on cell phones loud enough for others to hear and last night all the little girl wanted was to sit by her mommy daddy said no she cried and he said you're coming with me so outside they went i said something to him as they were going outside and he said mind your damn business i've also found dirty diapers tampons and a g string under the tables servers complain about tabs and getting tips or no tip at all so if you're african american please explain what i should think true there's ignorance in all races you're right nikki this is not meant for everyone and yes i've seen some very nice families christien did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today b i t c h i think she didn't mean to trash about their race or color etc just wondered about that abnormal behavior if it's kind of normal in cultural ways and if she came here and asked that on line that is surely because she's very surprised i would too a tampon a panty but it's true people no matter their color are treating their children like they were their enemies too bad about the mother pointing a knife to her kid awfull i know kids can make loose patience to anyone but if you are a parent you should behave yourself 'cause kids are what they learn from their parents Joke The Shining (film) Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Avenue Q Sin City The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Miss Saigon Garfield The Marshall Mathers LP Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Little Britain Milton H.
