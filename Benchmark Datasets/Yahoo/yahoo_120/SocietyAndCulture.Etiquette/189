ok what should i do i'm so not a mean person and i try to be considerate of others i live on the top floor of three floors my neighbor beneath me was banging on her ceiling i guess to let me know my son was making too much noise my son is years old and believe me i try everyday to make sure he does not jump or run too much as to disturb the neighbors below but i don't catch it everytime so my neighbor downstairs is a flight attendant and when she's gone she leaves her dog alone and he barks sometimes all night long when she is at home sometimes as early as am in the mornings she is yelling so loudly at the dog i can hear her every word so should i be concerned that she's banging on her ceiling to try get my attention about my son or should i ignore her well she definitely verbally abuse her dog i'm not sure if she's physically abusing it i try to stay away from confruntations especially with someone like her if she can be so mean to a dog i don't want to know what she'll try to do with me but i will be moving to a house in months the carpet is in poor condition and not well padded at all i asked them to change it when i moved in and they refused funny thing about it all is the person who lives beneath her is the apartments courtesy officer and a real police man go figure i've been in this situation with my child if the landlord rented the upstairs apartment to you knowing you have a three year old then i would not try to change my three year olds behavior he is a three year old and needs to be free to be active you do have carpeting right i wouldn't let him run around in cowboy boots on a hardwood floor use common sense here's what i did one day when the downstairs neighbor was banging on the ceiling i took my empty plastic bathroom garbage can and turned it upside down and banged on the floor about times every time she bangs on the ceiling you do the same on the floor maybe she'll get the message good luck and enjoy your beautiful three year old Stairway The Inside Friends Dog training Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Good Times Avenue Q Russian joke Humphrey Bogart The Catcher in the Rye Tag EastEnders Carl Barks Joy (novel) Shaggy dog story Social rule Reservoir Dogs AFI 100 Years series Richard Chase Kitchen Blood Simple Infantilism I Want to Hold Your Hand Columbine High School massacre Henri Murger The Marshall Mathers LP Pitaten Milton H.
