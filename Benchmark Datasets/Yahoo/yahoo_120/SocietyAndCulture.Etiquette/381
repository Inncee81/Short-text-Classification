smack in front of people anyway or only at home i've just got back from a day out with my yr old daughter she was cheeky disrespectful deliberately does what she knows she shouldn't copies bad behaviour hits shouts and generally causes a scene so everyone gets to watch what i do with her she's been naughty since she was i never used to smack her but i shouted and took stuff away etc i've always been strict recently i started to smack her on the hand because her behaviour became uncontrollable it works like magic she's much better when i can smack her but in public i feel like i can't like today she makes a scene everyone's looking if i smack i get rude comments glares etc why i'm only basically tapping on the hand it doesn't even hurt her even if i just speak to her firmly i get dirty looks so i tell her i'll deal with her at home and keep her quiet and ignore until she's nice again the problem is because there was no smack at the time she does it again next time we go out shall i smack her anyway and bugger them ignore what others say a smack on the hand is nothing in the grand scheme of things and doesn't scream abuse people who moan about smackers moan about kids playing up so you can't win if it works i say use it my mum used to smack me hard on the bum in or out of public if i needed it and i'm ok oh and ignore the 'time out' and 'get down to their leval' people it doesn't work which is why we have a generation of disrespectful thugs now Shaggy dog story Spanking The Jim Rome Show Social rule Escape from New York Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Transactional analysis 2000 Australian Grand Prix Anger management Eddie Guerrero Domestic violence True Crime: Streets of LA Beavis and Butt-head Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Marshall Mathers LP EastEnders Notable lines in the Star Wars series The Fast Show Dog training About a Boy Poker jargon Tag Avenue Q The Prodigy Indianapolis 500 Green Day Dixie Chicks Moaning Lisa Little Britain Blackjack The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Hey Jude Kodocha Prisoner's dilemma Ranma __ characters Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Inside The Beatles discography Fair use Sharon Tate Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) I Want to Hold Your Hand Computer virus Negima The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Silent Night, Deadly Night Weebl and Bob Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) 50 First Dates Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aerial (dance move) Volleyball Guilty Gear 1957 World Series Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles The Shining (film) Big Bad Beetleborgs Russian joke Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Pitaten Professional wrestling slang Surveillance CPU cache Hooliganism Hollyoaks The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Electrophysiology Sin City The Star-Spangled Banner Cheating in poker Blooper Abduction Phenomenon Eric Cartman Australian words Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Football chant The Wizard of Id Ron and Fez Jam (TV series) Ty Cobb Minor Discworld concepts Evil Rais massacre AFI 100 Years series Hip hop collaborations Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Trailer Park Boys Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children History of the English Bible Fruits Basket Babe Ruth's Called Shot Kimi Finster Ron Weasley The Apprentice 3
