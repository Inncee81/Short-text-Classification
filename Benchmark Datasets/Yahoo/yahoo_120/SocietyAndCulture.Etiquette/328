my dog licks leftovers off our dinner plates is this ok or nasty is this nasty sometimes i think it is but other times i tell myself it's ok because i do wash the plate after but i wouldd never do it when visitors are at my home so that leaves me to believe i really shouldn't do it since i wouldn't do it in front of other people what about all you other dog owners out there do you let your dogd lick your leftovers straight out of the dinner plate ah my family and many dog families have done this it is gross but as long as you wash the dishes in hot soapy water you're fine i agree though you shouldn't allow that in front of guests Dishwashing Korean cuisine Meal Roman eating and drinking Customs and etiquette of Japan Obedience training Japanese tea ceremony Dog training Saimin Agar plate Friends Pizza Cuisine of Denmark Feet washing The Apprentice 2 Cha chaan teng Table setting Cuisine of the Philippines Dishwasher Textile manufacturing Futurama (TV series - season 5) Shaggy dog story Soap Lisa the Vegetarian Car washing techniques Passover Kitchen Gilding Fountain TV dinner Teapot Derbyshire lead mining history Jewish cuisine Sento Collodion process Toronto Blue Jays Hygiene Social rule Escherichia coli O157:H7 Chinese New Year Dog agility Licking County, Ohio Dinner Sterling silver Fujian tea ceremony Characters of Lost Hot dog Brewery Dumpling Washing machine Vehicle registration plate American Eskimo Dog Infant baptism Wine Hal Trosky Cookware and bakeware Tire Oscilloscope KISS (band) Garfield Domesticated turkey Campfire Tales Rice pudding Washington, D.C.
