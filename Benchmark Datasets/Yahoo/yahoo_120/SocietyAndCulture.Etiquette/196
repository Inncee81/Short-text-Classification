shower invitation proper wording to let guests know they don't have to pay for themselves so i'm having my sister's baby shower at a restaurant probably in a private area should be about people my plan is to have it at like p m and i will order pay for a selection of appetizers and salads for the group to share as well i will pay for soft drinks how do i word it on the invitation so that people don't think that they have to pay for their own meal or chip in i picked a later time so that people wouldn't think it was dinner i plan on telling the waiters not to give out menus what else can i do to make it clear am i better to have it at like pm to reduce the chance that people would order alcohol i really can't afford to pay for alcohol for everyone people are likely to drink at any time but perhaps p m is a less likely time than after dinner perhaps you can say come enjoy a night of appetizers and refreshments if you are going to provide the food and drink then you are going to have to foot the bill regardles of the price you can't start limiting people during the night or cutting them off at a certain point so perhaps a way around this is to ask the waiter or waitresses to bring x amount of wine to the table however much you want to pay so that people know that what's on the table is what they get any other alcoholic beverages can be billed to the individual people or you can say come enjoy a night of appetizers and refreshments non alcoholic this kind of gets the point across without bieng too abrupt Korean cuisine Wine Meal Restaurant Cuisine of Denmark French cuisine Soft drink Alcoholic beverage Cha chaan teng Tea Peruvian cuisine Menu Tip Food Knots Landing Hell's Kitchen (television) Roman eating and drinking Coffeehouse Waiter Breakfast Culture of France Jewish cuisine Health insurance Poker jargon Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Greece Tea (meal) Sauna Delicatessen Friends Alcohol Customs and etiquette of Japan Expert system President (game) Prohibition Coffee Little Britain British cuisine Sento Arak (liqueur) Beer Social rule In-N-Out Burger Breastfeeding Drink Public house Humphrey Bogart Word of Wisdom Conveyor belt sushi George Brown, Baron George-Brown Shaggy dog story Betting (poker) Slot machine Culture of Ancient Rome Alcoholism Passover Seder Serbian cuisine Craps Dim sum Fast food Public transport Olive Garden Cuisine of Turkey Cafeteria Publicly funded medicine Mothers Against Drunk Driving Food Stamp Program Vodka McDonald's Moonshine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Tax Halaal The Apprentice 2 Quesadilla Sukkot Fecal incontinence Supermarket Epcot Blackjack Distilled beverage A&W Restaurants Yum cha Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Filling station Mormonism and Judaism The Human Stain Pizza Hut Taxation in the United States Economy of Russia Dinner Rum Ron and Fez Fish and chips Trailer Park Boys The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Las Vegas, Nevada
