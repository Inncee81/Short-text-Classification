can someone offer me etiquette advice before i visit a friend from mexico tomorrow my friend rosa from jalisco mexico is cooking tamales for my entire family tomorrow her food is amazing i just wondered if there was anything i should know about customs etiquette etc what would be a nice hostess gift there is a pretty big language barrier yet we have become good friends so i want to behave politely while visiting her home thanks in advance i'm mexican and agree with most of what the other guys have said i like the pot plant gift idea it's something that everybody welcomes and bringing something for dessert is also something that we do a lot when visiting and having dinner at a friend's place a bottle of wine is acceptable too but it doesn't go that well with the tamales also beware tamales are not eaten with your hands if they serve bread with them then you are allowed to make yourself a torta de tamal you put the tamal inside the bread to make a sort of sandwich and eat it with your hands but only that we do not consider it impolite if you eat all of the food in your plate and even ask for more if that's what you feel like doing you can also try to help when serving the beverages during meal time or when they start picking up the table after dinner but as they said they will most likely not allow you to help you can also offer to help them serve the dessert especially if you brought it coffee enjoy the tamales i'm sure they'll be delicious i love them and my mom cooks some wonderful tamales as well Tamale Meal Cuisine of the Philippines Customs and etiquette of Japan Chopsticks Korean cuisine Breakfast French cuisine Passover Tea (meal) Jewish cuisine Peruvian cuisine Kitchen German cuisine Restaurant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hamburger Cuisine of Argentina Tomato Cha chaan teng Japanese cuisine Yum cha Coffee Kosher foods Fondue Comanche Little Britain Passover Seder Tea McDonald's Domesticated turkey Chinese cuisine Pea soup Pizza Cuisine of Turkey Coffeehouse Food Swedish cuisine Flour Wine The Apprentice 2 Tofu Cuisine of Laos Etiquette British cuisine Apple Day of the Dead Sandwich Christmas worldwide Bread 613 mitzvot Eucharist Dumpling The Fairly OddParents Cuisine of the Southern United States Rice pudding Epcot Mojave people Conveyor belt sushi RuneScape quests Betting (poker) Banana Singlish Futurama (TV series - season 4) Mexican cuisine Poker jargon Alcoholic beverage Fruits Basket Theory of conduct Dim sum Funeral Barbecue Ice cream The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Hot dog MRE Pasta Hell's Kitchen (television) Garfield Mexico Recipe Supper Pancake Spanish cuisine Marmite Tuxtla Guti__rrez W.I.T.C.H.
