what can an allergist do for me i have this appointment with an allergist in an attempt to control my crazy allergies however i'm not very optimistic about what's going to come out of it i have to take or tylenol allergy everyday just to make it through and that's literally just to make it through it's doesn't control the symptoms however taking acetometaphin every day isn't exactly great for your liver i just don't know what he's going to be able to do for me i've tried everything claritin allegra zyrtec none of them have done anything for me it was like i took nothing and i had to take the tylenol allergy again what other pills are left wait can he prescribe the ingedients in tylenol allergy but without the tylenol part an allergist can do skin testing to see what you are allergic to the obvious answer is to stay away from the items you are allergic to like peanuts eggs milk etc but other items are not so easy to stay away from like dust mites pollen dander etc so the allergist may suggest that you get shots every week to every month to build up immunity to the allergen eventually ideally you will no longer be allergic to these items any more it can take up to years however you may develop allergies to new things in the meantime a friend told me that clarinex is times stronger than claritin maybe you can ask your allergist about this good luck Allergy Hay fever Asthma Immunoglobulin E Food allergy House dust mite Eczema Chronic fatigue syndrome Mast cell Psoriasis Tattoo Insulin Chimera (genetics) Urticaria Coeliac disease Conjunctivitis Urinary incontinence Common cold Breastfeeding Protein Air pollution Menstrual cycle Multiple chemical sensitivity Paracetamol Toxic mold Food Cannabis (drug) Hypersensitivity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Crohn's disease Clomipramine Scabies Quicksort Medicine Acne Basophil granulocyte Fancy rat Amiodarone Cat Sulfasalazine Stomach cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Cephalexin Infectious mononucleosis Pitaten 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders Social rule Rosacea Mastocytosis Methylsulfonylmethane Arguments for and against drug prohibition Polyvinyl chloride Doxepin Sinusitis Aspergillosis Theory of conduct DNA__ Tuberculosis Nasal congestion Maprotiline Promethazine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Multiple sclerosis Kender Fecal incontinence Emphysema Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hiberno-English Tocopherol Propranolol Antihistamine Extreme Programming Rodney McKay Homeopathy Loratadine Ulcerative colitis Diseases of the honeybee Bee Dexamethasone Oh My Goddess!
