irritated after sex forgotten latex allergy i had sex with my boyfriend last night for the first time it didn't cause me any pain at the time but after waking up this morning i am very swollen and itchy down there i've never been sexually active before so this isn't something that i've dealt with in the past however i just started to remember when i was yrs old i went to the allergist and had a full test of everything that i'm allergic to and latex was one of them unfortunately i forgot about that last night before my boyfriend put a latex condom on what can i do to make this swelling and itching go away it's incredibly uncomfortable are there any creams or drugstore products that i could purchase to remedy this i am so appreciative of everyone who's been answering i've taken some benadryl now and it is definitely relieving some of my pain unfortunately i'm still really swollen and red awwww i'm allergic to latex too and that sucks p first of all let me tell you that trojan makes polyurethane condoms called supras they are just as safe as latex and look almost the same but they are thinner they transfer heat and they do not smell at all i love them so now that latex condoms are out look for trojan supras most drugstores carry them in the normal condom section lol and you can always take some benadryl take a cool shower and wash yourself down there to relieve the itching and swelling but definitely take benadryl Condom Safe sex Tattoo Conjunctivitis Menstrual cup Hay fever Allergy Eczema Latex Strap-on dildo Psoriasis Oral sex Mattress Anal sex Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cat Sexual intercourse Food allergy Masturbation Angioedema First aid Latex allergy Coeliac disease Casting The Star Wars Holiday Special Birth control Gay bathhouse Mast cell Futurama (TV series - season 5) Urticaria Chlorpromazine Diaphragm (contraceptive) Scabies Social rule Herpes simplex virus Itch Yarrow Mesothelioma Menstrual cycle Avenue Q Little Britain Personal lubricant Multiple chemical sensitivity Urinary incontinence Vulvovaginal health Genericized trademark Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Insomnia Human sexual behavior Sento Sex doll Orgy Body piercing Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Sin City Human penis size Circumcision Proper Condom Use Fecal incontinence Breastfeeding Acne Food Odysseus Chronic fatigue syndrome Unsafe sexual practices AIDS Fisting W.I.T.C.H.
