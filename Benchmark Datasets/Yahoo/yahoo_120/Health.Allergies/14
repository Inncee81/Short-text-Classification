how long do allergy shots take i am allergic to cats but i love them more than any other pet we couldn't have a cat at our house because it affected my mom more than it affected me i am about to move out and get a place on my own i feel the need to get a cat to keep me company and i miss having one so much i plan on getting shots to stop me from being allergic the question is how long do shots take if the allergic reaction isn't that bad around cats would it just be okay to own one while i am getting the shots please let me know the shots are an ongoing thing they are to help you control your allergies while you are around the animal or whatever you are allergic to i have cat allergies and recently got a cat i've been taking hour claritin and it helps tremendously also there are wipes that you can use on the cat to reduce the allergen good luck with that because my cat runs like the dickens when i pull them out but they do help also make sure you brush your cat regularly to remove the hair and dander vacuum your carpets and furniture obsessively if you live in a place with hardwood floors that's even better the best thing for you but hardest thing for the cat will be if you keep it out of your bedroom it's good to have your bedroom cat free so that you can breathe at night and give your sinuses a break from the dander also when you are picking out a cat try to go for short hair versus long hair and i've read that female cats aren't as hard on allergy sufferers as male cats keep in mind if you get a kitten versus an adult cat your allergies to them may get worse as he she grows the allergy is really to the saliva and kittens don't have as much of a build up of dried saliva on their coats as cats do Hay fever Cat Asthma House dust mite Dog Peanut Tooth Pitaten RuneScape quests Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Feral cat The Fairly OddParents Tattoo Havanese Fancy rat The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Shaggy dog story Flea Phoebe Buffay's songs Procrastination Vacuum cleaner Eczema Air pollution Insomnia Azumanga Daioh Upholstery Kodocha Ranma __ characters Immunoglobulin E Tarantula Food allergy Pet skunk Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Adventures of Pete & Pete Food Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garfield Domestic rabbit Ferret Carpet Red Dwarf characters Multiple chemical sensitivity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Common cold Kitten Air purifier Cornish Rex Darkwing Duck 2000 Australian Grand Prix Wood Tooth enamel Manx (cat) Ron and Fez Charles Dickens Cocaine Sin City Hamster Xiaolin Showdown Friends The Inside Antihistamine Phoebe Halliwell Saved by the Bell Series finale Care Bears Social rule Great Teacher Onizuka John F.
