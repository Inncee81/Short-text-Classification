i think i had a food reaction pleease help im gunna cry there are bumps on my stomach and back and one on my theigh they are in groups i took claritin and that cleared up some of the bumps they itch liek mosqiuto bites i had burger king a couple of hours ago and i had sweet tomatoes for lunch a buffet is this normal and will i hve to go to the doctor am i gunna die please help im gunna cry you definately had an allergic reaction it might be due to the tomatoes im allergic to them too what you got on your back and arms are called hives and they seem to be the biggest telltale sign of an allergic reaction my advice would be to take a benadryl asap but you've already taken a claritin so chill for now you wont die it doesnt sound like your reaction was that serious by serious i mean you didnt go into anaphylactic sp shock something that can sometimes happen as a result of food allergies you should however schedule an appt with your doctor so you can discuss this more and perhaps get a skin allergy test its not fun but it might save your life you seem new to this whole food allergy thing so its best to find out if you have any other food allergies in the presence of a trained physician rather than find out the hard way again and ps keep an eye on yourself if you begin to find it hard to breath or feel faint anytime soon get to a hospital more than likely its not that serious but just be safe these things are tricky Hay fever Food allergy First aid Anaphylaxis Tattoo Eczema Stomach cancer Food Multiple chemical sensitivity Tomato Peanut Latex allergy Shock Cat Monosodium glutamate Conjunctivitis Coeliac disease Mast cell Immunoglobulin E Urinary incontinence Angioedema Medical prescription Cephalexin Hypersensitivity Nut (fruit) Loratadine Triage Charles Darwin's illness Aspergillosis Clomipramine Medicine Spider Urticaria Mastocytosis Breastfeeding 2000 Australian Grand Prix Anesthesia Happy Tree Friends Aspartame Hamburger Insulin The Caves of Androzani Psoriasis Crohn's disease Kodocha Dexamethasone Gastroesophageal reflux disease Explosive material Propranolol Sulfasalazine Group A streptococcal infection House dust mite Scabies Stroke The Amber Spyglass Mosquito Al-Razi Antihistamine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Protein Alcoholics Anonymous Paracetamol Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Fancy rat Shaggy dog story Blood transfusion Scenes from a Memory The Empty Child Grief The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe John F.
