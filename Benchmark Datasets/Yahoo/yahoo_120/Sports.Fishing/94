fishing question my husband tells me when a fish swallows a hook and we have to cut it off that the hook dissolves and the fish is fine is that true or is he trying to make me feel better or did somebody lie to him it's true i only freshwater fish for bass but if i deep hook a fish i do not even mess with the hook this is to keep from doing anymore damage than i have already done i just cut the line about in outside of it's mouth it will rust the hook out in a few days it might not eat during that time but it has a far better chance of living than if you pulled on it's guts i have had more fish die on me by hooking them in their tongue than deep hooking them i fish competitively and i have kept some deep hooked fish and did what i said to do and they lived all day and swam off after i let them go but every fish i have hooked under the tongue has went belly up in a few hours or minutes Trolling for fish Fishing Angling Happy Tree Friends Leviathan Drowning Striped bass Fugu Pok__mon Abilities Fly fishing Shark Tetrapod Dinghy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jellyfish Link (Legend of Zelda) Tooth Seine (fishing) Sawfish (fish) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Nile crocodile Megadeth Diving Poker jargon Whale Shaggy dog story USS Thresher (SS-200) Knife Oral sex Tlingit Kodocha Big-game fishing Professional wrestling holds Old wives' tale Tongue Benjamin Hooks Snake Jaws (film) Lake Joy Division (band) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Mixed martial arts Boxing training Catch and release Piranha New Order Myxobolus cerebralis Lake Burley Griffin Aerial (dance move) Boxing Leatherback Sea Turtle Kenny McCormick Sushi Time Out of Mind Deluge (mythology) Dolphin Johnny 5 Chinook salmon Bocas del Toro Province Albert Fish The Amber Spyglass Frog USS Sea Devil (SS-400) Ice fishing Patrick Star New Morning Smelt Atlantic herring Gas bladder Jon Secada USS Flying Fish (SS-229) Humpback Whale Snooker Antarctic krill Fly lure Sport fishing USS Threadfin (SS-410) Tuatara Tony Galento Oily fish Tanya Donelly Lamprey Tofu United Airlines Flight 93 History of swimming Suplex USS Tang (SS-306) One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish Wire Harp Walleye Grunion Seppuku Mercury 4 Aquarium Gar 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Harp Seal Charles Peace
