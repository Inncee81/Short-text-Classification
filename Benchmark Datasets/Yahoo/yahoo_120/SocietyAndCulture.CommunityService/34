i am trying to organize a charity drive to help the homeless and i don't know exactly where to start and who to ask whether they want to donate or what to do basically i am doing this for a particular organization cfls but i was wondering how i could start this drive well i have conducted i think three donation drives in the past being only i realize it's hard to believe but in my eyes as well as a study ran last year the biggest spender in our generation is none other thatn the kids us so from there i look at and try to target what kids will buy or donate from that point i try to work through and with my school attend a student council meeting introduce your idea and how you want to use it maybe at your next dance instead of the funds goingt o the school introduce the idea of maybe splitting the profits that way you can earn plents of money or id you are looking to donate clothes rather of money you could make the admission to the dance maybe you fill in and an article of clothing that will be donated to the homeless work with something like that of course you can always have a car wash and make a deal with your school for hosting it to gain some of the profits once again you ca split probably that's your safest bet other things will work to you can have your school host a rummage sale what ever is left can be donated catch my drift you have to experiment with things like this i will be happy to help you if you have an more questions feel free to e mail me the year before last i raised about for the katrina relief through red cross things can be done and i am so happy to see kids like us wanting to make that difference good luck Garth Brooks Microeconomics Animal Crossing The Amazing Race The Apprentice 2 Poker jargon Economics International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement Glastonbury Festival Alcoholics Anonymous Comic Relief Great Depression American Red Cross Craps Fundraising Target Corporation Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school 1919 World Series Hurricane Katrina disaster relief Mutual fund Theory of conduct Education in the United States Game show Political economy Live Aid Card Sharks National Kidney Foundation Singapore LiveJournal International response to Hurricane Katrina The New School at West Heath Tsunami Relief Cardiff Dog agility Public education The Catcher in the Rye Something Awful Aristotle Gaia Online Knots Landing Mail fraud Education in England United Church of Christ MoveOn Boston Public Destiny's Child House music Tears for Fears Investment bank $ale of the Century Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses United Kingdom corporation tax EastEnders Value added tax School choice The Adventures of Pete & Pete Gloria Estefan Brown University Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Article One of the United States Constitution Insurance The Drifters Hard disk 2005 Kashmir earthquake Altruism Salvation Army Stanley Ho Shaggy dog story Donald Rumsfeld Non-profit organization Capital accumulation Strategic management New York Giants Supply and demand Utilitarianism Babe Ruth Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong Amazon.com Hyperinflation Flat tax Tax Final Fantasy XI Teachers (film) MMORPG 1964 New York World's Fair Wheel of Fortune Corporation Canadian federal election, 1993 Cindy Sheehan Neopets Hurricane Katrina timeline Japanese tea ceremony Independent school (UK) Blackjack Driver's license The Emancipation of Mimi Copyleft Initial D Advance fee fraud Louis MacNeice
