finding where someone last logged onto myspace we are trying to find a girl that ran away she logged onto myspace from wherever she is and we are trying to find her does anyone know how to find where she is you would have to request that the myspace technical team monitor that account of course i haven't dealt with this kinda thing personally so i dunno how complicated that would really be they can probably monitor it and whenever a user logs into that account they can do a trace on the computer's ip address which reflects her exact location in the world from there they can get an idea of where she is but like i said i dunno if authorities or myspace would be willing to do that i don't know their exact policy terms on those issues good luck with that though Cross site scripting Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act CPU cache Debugging MySpace E-mail spam Windows XP Password LiveJournal Contract Common Unix Printing System RSTS/E RuneScape cheats Mainframe computer Public-key cryptography Domain Name System Spyware Database Software engineering Trademark H2G2 World Wide Web E-mail Surveillance Data retention Web traffic Software bug Theory of conduct Btrieve America Online 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines HTTP cookie Social software Pretty Good Privacy Identity theft Internet Relay Chat Sender Policy Framework Warren Ellis Computer Otakon Blog Phishing Master Control Program Corporate governance Monetary policy Anonymity Telephone tapping Secure Shell ARPANET Windows Installer Windows 2000 Architecture of Windows 2000 Bluetooth Server Quicksort Thread (computer science) Global Positioning System IP Multimedia Subsystem X Window System Abortion Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Hacker Transport layer User (computing) Automatic number plate recognition Logic Telegraphy Computer virus Virtual machine World of Warcraft Steam (content delivery) SETI@home Shit Fast Fourier transform Grid computing Independent Media Center Hash table Trusted computing Apple Open Collaboration Environment Booting Password cracking Windows registry A Course In Miracles History of the Internet Spam (electronic) Computer security Richard Stallman Science Embedded system Database management system Information Services Procurement Library Web design Consensus decision-making Netfilter/iptables File sharing Java programming language Dynamic Systems Development Method Carlos Castaneda BitTorrent History of the graphical user interface
