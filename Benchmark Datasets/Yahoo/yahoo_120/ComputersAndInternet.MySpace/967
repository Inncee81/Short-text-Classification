myspace messaging question i sent a message to a friend a few days ago and never received an answer i have to admit that i was a bit nervous to sent it because it was about asking someone to hang out someone i don't spend much time with i look in my sent box and it's not there i was told to send it again because it could be a glitch should i send it again even though this person could've just ignored it completely if it doesn't show up in the sent box does that mean they never received it okay you need to remember what happened when you sent it did it take a long time to say send did you have to refresh the page if so it probably was never sent most likely if it wasn't in your sent box then no it wasn't sent but lets say you did send it the worse thing that can happen is it doesn't get responded too just simply type at the beginning of the letter hey i wasn't quite sure if i had sent this already because i was having computer problems but do you wanna hang out then immediately check your sent box Theory of conduct The Ashlee Simpson Show Jumpstart 3rd Grade StarCraft: Uprising E-mail Anonymous remailer Social rule Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hey Jude Little Britain Internet fraud Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Objective-C Kurt Cobain Time Out of Mind The Star Wars Holiday Special She Loves You Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an God Emperor of Dune Dog training 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Domain Name System IP (complexity) Cliff Richard MySpace Halting problem Plame affair Unified Modeling Language Datalore (TNG episode) Piccolo Junior Saga Kasparov versus The World Internet Group Management Protocol Avenue Q I Want to Hold Your Hand Object-oriented programming Make money fast Symbiosis (TNG episode) Morse Code Past teachings of Prem Rawat You Don't Know Jack Shadow the Hedgehog Wonderland (McFly album) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Friends Hamming code Error correction and detection Intelligent design Milton H.
