need help w circles write the equation of the circle containing the points j k and l show all work to receive credit find the circumference and area of a circle that has a rectangle inscribed inside it with sides that are by centimeters write your answer as decimals rounded to the nearest hundredth given a circle with an inscribed equilateral triangle with each side of the triangle having a measurement of cm what is the probability of selecting a point at random inside the triangle assuming that the point cannot lie outside the circular region leave your answer in exact form in a circle the radius is units and a chord of the circle is units part a how far is the chord from the center part b find the measure of the arc created by the chord in a cone with a slant height of feet the slant height forms a degree angle with the radius find the volume of the cone show all work please as these one at a time this is hard work Circle Triangle Trigonometric function Pi Hipparchus (astronomer) Angle Antenna (radio) Coriolis effect Area (geometry) Polygon Archimedes Parallax Conic section HSV color space Volume Ellipse Trigonometric identity Longitude Spherical trigonometry Regular polytope Reuleaux triangle Wallpaper group Multiple integral 3-sphere Map projection Pythagorean theorem Tide Degree (angle) Symmetry Geographic coordinate system Opportunity rover Equation of time Stairway Latitude Equine conformation M__bius transformation Geometry Dividing a circle into areas Great Pyramid of Giza Centripetal force Timeline of mathematics Schwarzschild metric Radar Vesica piscis Torque Great-circle distance Ruler-and-compass construction Hexagonal lattice Delaunay triangulation Sphere Geodesic dome Trilateration Dynamical system Ptolemaios's theorem VHF omnidirectional range Pappus of Alexandria Lattice (group) Lebesgue integration Circumcircle Hockey rink Tetrahedron Astrodynamics World line Computer representation of surfaces Collision detection Manifold Haversine formula Z-transform Geodesy Cellular automaton History of geodesy Hyperbolic geometry Versine Glossary of graph theory Random walk Trigonometry Extraterrestrial skies Josip Plemelj Apollonius of Perga Black hole Geology of the Moon Lorentz group Softball Wassily Kandinsky Parabola Quadrilateral Roman surface Cricket Escape velocity Flag of the People's Republic of China Metric system Lagrangian point Keplerian problem Radius of convergence Rotation Vowel
