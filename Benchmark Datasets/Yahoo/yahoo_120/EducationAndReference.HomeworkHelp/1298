science help its for eighth grade science define word use in sentance density mass characteristic property volume mass those are the words plz help i am very bad at science i forgot one weight im not stupid if thts wat u guys think i take all ap classes i appreicate the help everyone but remember i am only in th grade but it in terms i understand all u have to do is gimme definitions and sentances density mass per unit volume the density of that block on cement is very high unlike that bunch of cotton mass the quantity of matter related to weight but cannot change that fat man has so much mass volume the amount of space measured in cubic units that an object or substance occupies contains that container has lots of volume or space weight the amount or quantity of heaviness how heavy an object is the weight of that pen is about a few ounces sorry i don't know about characteristic property i have not learnt it yet because i am in th grade hope this helped Density Mass Ton Explosive material Temperature Volume Pound Phase (matter) U.S. customary units Systems of measurement Flux Gravity Vacuum Diamond Units of measurement Helium English unit Vector (spatial) Energy Heat Entropy Gallon Thermodynamics Metric system Mathematics Parts per notation Wood Kilogram Dark energy Cooking weights and measures Force Internal ballistics Mole (unit) Planck units Weighing scale Puberty Function (mathematics) Concentration Water (molecule) Open cluster Nuclear weapon design Goodness and value theory Time Imperial unit Caffeine Specific impulse Avogadro's number Metrication Dynamical system Protein Sun Faster-than-light Chemistry Illegal drug trade Aerodynamics Silicon Solar system Electric field Species Black hole Uranium Angkor Wat Supply and demand String theory Normal distribution Tensor Philosophy of language Plasma (physics) Dark matter Tide Statistical mechanics Anorexia nervosa Breastfeeding Transformation problem Measurement Maxwell's equations Materials science Magnesium Depleted uranium Relative density SI prefix Algebraic geometry Holographic principle Light rail Litre Polymer Navier-Stokes equations Metaphysics Interpretation of quantum mechanics Heat capacity Electron Peanut Nondimensionalization Gee Labor theory of value Silver
