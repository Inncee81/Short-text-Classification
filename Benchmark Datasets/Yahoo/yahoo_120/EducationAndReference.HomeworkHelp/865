math help algebra the slope and y intercept of x is m b m undefined b none m undefined b m zero b none none of them m undefined b none because you can change that to x which is a vertical line that crosses the x axis at so it never crosses the y axis meaning there's no y intercept and vertical lines have undefined slopes Slope Linear equation Exponentiation Derivative Wallpaper group Tangent Parabola Minkowski diagram Division by zero Point groups in three dimensions Aberration in optical systems Mathematics Ellipse Conic section Rotation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Modern portfolio theory Supply and demand Manifold Perspective (graphical) HSV color space Algebraic geometry Precession Tetration Van Stockum dust Duality (projective geometry) Phase diagram Elasticity (economics) Cartesian coordinate system Cissoid of Diocles Morse theory Polynomial Twin paradox Covariance and contravariance Frieze group Special relativity Lathe Exponential function EIA-708 Projective transformation Quaternions and spatial rotation Electricity pylon Phillips curve Cournot competition Complex number Symmetry combinations Car body style Calculus Trajectory M__bius transformation M__bius function Interstate Highway standards Theodolite Trigonometric function Infinity Extended real number line Axial compressor Tank Hangul Torus Stress (physics) Symmetry Lorentz group Antenna (radio) Wind turbine IS/LM model Serial number Brahmagupta Variation of the field Microeconomics Flight controls Sundial Geography of Africa Chern class Spectrogram Laplace transform Catenary Algebra Matrix (mathematics) 0 (number) Vertical service code Multiplication Imaginary number Anemometer Action potential Political spectrum Modern warfare Cross Orthogonal matrix VHF omnidirectional range Stairway Magnetic declination Vertical deflection Pendulum Cross product Pointer Map projection Relational algebra Casualty lifting
