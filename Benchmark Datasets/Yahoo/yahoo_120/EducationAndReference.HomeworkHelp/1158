need help using the slope intercept form y mx b driving down a mountain tom finds that he has descended ft in elevation by the time he is mi horizontally away from the top of the mountain find the slope of his descent to the nearest hundredth i would like how to do the equation and the answer please i'm lost with this you actually have two points with which to find the slope if you were to graph it make his starting point the origin then as he decends ft that would be the y coordinate and driving horizontal the x coordinate is mi however note that the units are different one being feet and one being miles so we must change one to suit the other changing mi to feet is easiest since one mile is ft multiplying we get ft for our horizontal change now we can use the slope formula with the two points and slope m change in y change in x finally divide to get the slope to the nearest hundredth which is Slope Trigonometric function Polynomial Force Derivative Linear equation Geographic coordinate system Stairway Cissoid of Diocles Andes Parabola Projective transformation Trajectory Calculus Coriolis effect Multiple integral Complex number Mountaineering Vector (spatial) Circle Horizontal coordinate system Quadratic equation Minkowski diagram Production theory basics Gradient Skiing Equine conformation Supply and demand Napier's bones Glossary of climbing terms Sundial Geodesy Cartesian coordinate system Exponential function Apennine Mountains Geography of Africa Conic section Great Smoky Mountains National Park Electrical resistance Geology of the Grand Canyon area Geology of the Appalachians Algebraic geometry Microeconomics Special relativity Dog agility Glacier National Park (US) Slide Mountain (New York) Rwanda Mount Whitney Coordinates (mathematics) Opportunity rover Function (mathematics) Coordinate system Geography of India Mount Washington Cog Railway Duality (projective geometry) Mount Everest Action potential Roman surface Mechanical advantage Units of measurement Connecticut Planetary orbit Random walk Madeira Islands World line Pascal's triangle Elasticity (economics) Discrete Fourier transform Gliding Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Bicycle frame Contract bridge Tangent Dynamical system Highway Alpine skiing Geography of Spain M__bius transformation Vedic mathematics Labour economics Radar Angle Oscilloscope Wind Avalanche Geographic information system Gaussian elimination Torque Gravity Yosemite Valley Frame of reference Topographic prominence Siphon Extreme points of the world Slippery slope Incidence (geometry) Cascade Range
