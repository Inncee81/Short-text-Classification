can you proof read something for me hi i finally finished writing my essays for my summer assignment yay can you proof read these for me just the grammatical and spelling stuff thanks in advance have you ever had to face a major conflict everyone in everyday life comes across many obstacles some of the conflicts people come across can be little such as scrapping a knee or failing a test but some of them are bigger than that such as getting into an argument with a close friend or even the death of a close family member in the truth about forever by sarah dessen the main character macy queen overcomes many difficult obstacles during her summer vacation one of the many obstacles that macy must overcome is the pressure she feels to be perfect but part of my new perfect my new perfect act was my appearance if i wanted people to see me as calm and collected together i had to look the part ch pg this quote shows us that she feels pressured to be perfect and to act how people expect her to because macy is concerned about how people will think of her she becomes jason s girlfriend when asked about jason and why she went out with him she replies well i began he s perfect you know great in school smart all these achievements he can do anything and when i was with him it was like good for me it made me better too ch pgs from this quote we see that macy thinks she must live up to everyone s expectations and thinks that she will not be loved anymore if she doesn t one day after being told off by another girl that works at the library macy realizes something important then about a year and half too late it hit me i was never going to be perfect and what had all my efforts gotten me ch pgs from this quote we can tell that macy finally realizes that she will never be perfect but that s okay because she realizes that no one is perfect and no one will ever be that is just one of the many obstacles that macy queen overcomes another obstacle that macy queen has to face and probably the most difficult is the death of her father my dad died and i was there this is how people knew me not as macy queen daughter of deborah i was macy queen who d woken up the day after christmas and gone outside to see her father splayed out at the end of the road a stranger pumping away at his broad chest i saw my dad die that was who i was now ch pg the death of her dad devastated macy because they had been so close there was so much i wanted to tell my mother like how much i missed my dad how much i still though about him ch pg from this quote we see just how much macy missed her dad she was so depressed by his death that she even stopped running even though it was a major part of her life as i started to run feeling my feet get under me i listened for the voice i knew so well the one i always heard at the beginning ch pg towards the end of the novel macy begins to run again and from this we can see how she realizes that her dad would have wanted her to keep running and to not let his death stop her from having a normal life even though macy faces some major obstacles she also faces some smaller conflicts one if the smaller conflicts that macy must face is that she has to deal with rude co workers in a tone that mad e it clear asking me would be a waste of time the first few times this had happened i d figured they were just letting me get my feet under me after awhile though it was obvious in their minds i didn t belong there ch pg from this quote we can tell that her co workers have been obnoxious around her but she gradually realizes that the job is not meant for her and quits another conflict that macy overcomes is something that everyone in life has to go through breaking up with her boyfriend a break i knew what that meant it was what happened right before something was officially and finally broken finished regardless of the language it was most likely i was out all for saying i love you ch pg from this quote we see why her boy friend broke up with her through talking to her new friends macy overcomes this and realizes that she was going out with jason for all the wrong reasons a third conflict that macy overcomes is something that everyone goes through while growing up arguing with her mother macy never before had i flinched at the sound of my own name but i did now i want you to go home get changed and get into bed we ll discuss this later ch pg from this quote we can tell that her mother is mad at her after discussing the situation with her sister and seeing how her mother has changed macy begins to understand why her mother was mad and punished her the way she did these are just some of the smaller conflicts that macy faces in conclusion we can see that in the truth about forever by sarah dessen the main character macy queen overcome many difficult obstacles during her summer vacation some of the things that macy overcame were breaking up with her boyfriend arguing with her mom dealing with rude co workers and ultimately overcoming her father s death through all of this macy learned that nothing will never be perfect and also understands that it is important to not dwell on the past but still remember her dad the end of the first one i don't know how i'm going to do this but i'll try nd paragraph nd sentence my new perfect my new perfect take one of those out rd paragraph library comma macy and after you cite things and put the source in you should put a period after every end since you are starting a new sentence after each one th paragraph needs a period and you put though you need to change it to thought sorry don't remember quite where read thru it you'll find it under me comma you have a period i somewhere in there you have the word made there is a space between mad e close that up you have boyfriend as two words i e boy friend close that space if you want it boyfriend when you talk about the many things macy had to overcome you put overcome it needs to be overcame you did it right the second time in that same paragraph and lastly you say nothing will never should be nothing will ever hope this was helpful good luck Shaggy dog story The Lovely Bones EastEnders
