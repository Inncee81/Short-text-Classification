find the maximum profit the of units that must be produced and find the maximum profit the of units that must be produced and sold in order to yield the maximum profit for r x c x r x x x c x x i'm haviing a lot of trouble with this any help the easiest thing to do here is to find a profit equation since profit revenue cost use r x and c x to write a p x profit function then find the derivative of that function and set it equal to to find the x value at which the maximum profit occurs that x will equal the optimal number of units to produce plug that x value into your original p x function to find the value of p x at that x value that is your maximum profit you can check your answer by putting the r x c x and p x function into excel and getting the program to give you the values for a range of x values you should see that p x rises peaks at your x value and then falls again Profit maximization Supply and demand Prices of production Stackelberg competition Optimization (mathematics) Derivative Surplus value Halting problem Principle of maximum entropy Normal distribution Welfare economics Monopoly Productive and unproductive labour Model (economics) Ordinary differential equation Strategic management Labor theory of value Doomsday argument Capital accumulation Trajectory Law of value Production function Compiler optimization Explosive material Derivation of the partition function Maximum likelihood CPU cache Computer numbering formats Function (mathematics) Ethernet Derivative (finance) Particle in a box Datatype Lisp programming language Numerical analysis Dynamic programming Complex number Political economy Lagrange multipliers Profit Inflation Tri-Stat dX Fuel injection Common Lisp Quartic equation Mathematics Labour economics Yield curve Progressive tax Anarchism and capitalism C syntax Tide Polynomial Functional programming Combinatorics Dither Extreme Programming Ra (board game) Stationary point Artificial neural network Slot machine Central processing unit Impedance matching Sturm-Liouville theory Matroid Action (physics) Hash table C programming language Boolean algebra Credit card Dimensional analysis Estimation theory Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Power (physics) Recurrence relation Principal-agent problem Natural monopoly Quantum computer Abstract interpretation Variable universal life insurance Relational algebra Large numbers Assembly language Ford Motor Company Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Polymorphism (computer science) Neoclassical economics G__del's incompleteness theorem Commodity Production, costs, and pricing Airline Monopsony Riemann zeta function
