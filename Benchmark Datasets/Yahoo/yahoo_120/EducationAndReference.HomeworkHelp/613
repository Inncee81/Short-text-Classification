do you know any information about gravity that kids can understand well it depends how young the kids are but if i were trying to explain gravity to a kid i'd say that the earth's core is like a giant magnet so everything within the atmosphere is pulled down to it no matter what once you leave the atmosphere there isn't any gravity you could demonstrate with jumping and say that the reason everything doesn't just float around is because there's an invisible magnetic force pulling everything down to the earth i haven't taken physics in a couple of years but i think if i were or even younger i'd understand that pretty well Gravity Sun Moon Planetary nebula Tide Mercury (planet) Stellar evolution Solar wind Planetary orbit Black hole Solar system Magnet Supernova Luminiferous aether Fundamental interaction Modified Newtonian dynamics Plate tectonics Hydrogen Neutron star Special relativity Spacecraft propulsion Quantum mechanics Anti-gravity Causality Diamagnetism Neptune Force Neutrino Physics Saturn History of physics Supersymmetry Planetary habitability Earth's magnetic field Weightlessness Earth Solar variation Isaac Newton Big Bang Magnetism Geology of the Moon Timeline of the Universe Superconductivity Celestial body atmosphere Creationism Jupiter STS-62 Artificial gravity Earth's atmosphere Items in the Metroid series Lunar Prospector Theory of everything Force powers Physical cosmology Hollow Earth Fermi paradox Grand unification theory Planet Dyson sphere Xen (Half-Life) Physical science Geodesy Coming of Age (TNG episode) Terraforming Theory of conduct Quantum gravity Unified field theory Space colonization Magnetic field Nuclear magnetic resonance Mass Gas giant Newton's laws of motion Center of mass Geophysics Robot Master Cassini-Huygens Non-standard cosmology Intelligent design Space elevator Equivalence principle Etheric plane Phase (matter) Time travel Bong Heat Gravity Probe B Perpetual motion Speed of light String theory 2001: A Space Odyssey Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 Bubble Bobble Gee Rare Earth hypothesis Unidentified flying object Weight Loop quantum gravity Tether propulsion
