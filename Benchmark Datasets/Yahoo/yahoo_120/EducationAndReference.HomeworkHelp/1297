a question my sis well my sister wanted to know how she could keep herself focused and interested in her world history book oh and how she could keep what she reads in her head any tips a lot of world history books are very dry and hard to get enthused about which is a pity given that they really ought to be interesting i have three tips for staying interested when studying history remember that everyone in a history book was at one point a real living human being who grew up and learned and fell in love just like any other human being including us the history book might not include all the interesting stuff but that doesn't stop you from guessing read books and watch movies set in the time period you're studying studying roman history watch gladiator or rome french history queen margot world war ii schindler's list or saving private ryan this brings history to life and gives you a reason to study to find out if the film makers and authors were making things up or not finally remember that those who don't understand history are destined to repeat it if you see ways that the history you're studying is being repeated in the world today i guarantee it'll be more interesting good luck Theory of conduct Pitaten Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism A Course In Miracles The Ashlee Simpson Show Sharon Tate Rich Mullins AFI 100 Years series Current teachings of Prem Rawat The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) W.
