hey i have a problem i can't define this sentence could you help me it's the newest in place i hear the reason people go there is just to be seen it's about a club not quite sure what you are asking but if you are asking what the sentence means it means this when it says it's the newest in place that just means that it is the cool place to be when something is in like in style or in the in crowd that means that it is what is popular at the moment when it says people go there just to be seen it means that people associate going to that club with being cool being popular they just go to it so other people like their friends will see them there and think more highly of them Germish The Beach Boys Aphasia Hearing impairment Hip hop culture Jazz Hey Arnold!
