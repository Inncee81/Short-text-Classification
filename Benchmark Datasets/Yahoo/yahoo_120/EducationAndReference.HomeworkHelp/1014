velocity and average force of a bullet fired a gun fires a bullet of mass grams out of a barrel cm long the gun is attached to a spring from the recoil of the spring and the masses of the gun and the spring we determine that the gun recoiled with a total momentum of kg m s how do i find the velocity of the bullet as it exits the barrel what was the avg force exerted on the bullet as it accelerated along the length of the barrel what average force would be felt by the individual holding the gun for the time the bullet accelerates along the length of the barrel first start with conservation of momentum if the gun and spring have a total momentum of kg m s then the bullet must also have kg m s just in the opposite direction normally when dealing with such vectors we would denote one as being positive and the other negative thus making the conservation work but we'll stick to positives knowing that they are just in opposite directions anyway momentum is defined as mass times velocity or p m v since we know the momentum p and the mass of the bullet m we can determine the velocity but we must make sure we have consistent units let's convert the mass of the bullet to kg from g g kg g kg units cancel out of fractions just like numbers then we can insert our 'knowns' into our momentum equation p m v kg m s kg v m s divide both sides by the bullet's mass and units so the kg's cancel out to get v m s the average force on the bullet is its mass times its acceleration we know the mass kg so we need to find its acceleration a the relationships between distance d cm or m v a and time t are v a t assuming a constant acceleration d a t t so we'' solve for a in the upper and substitute it in the lower a v t d v t t t or d v t insert our knowns for d and v and solve for t m m s t t s use v a t to find a m s a s a m s s so if f m a then the force on the bullet is f kg m s f kg m s this mess of units in combination is called a newton and it has nothing to do with figgy cookies since force is also a vector that is conserved the person holding the gun would also feel newtons just in the opposite direction Internal ballistics Classical mechanics Gravity Newton's laws of motion Velocity Energy Torque Momentum Vector (spatial) Kepler's laws of planetary motion Angular momentum General relativity External ballistics Two-body problem State space (controls) Derivative Spacecraft propulsion Acceleration Machine gun Frame of reference Escape velocity M16 (rifle) Explosive material Special relativity Tide Coriolis effect Specific impulse Center of mass Centripetal force Angular velocity Rocket Carbine Terminal ballistics Planetary orbit Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution .22 Long Rifle Circular motion Mechanical work Fictitious force Flux M60 machine gun Action (physics) Dynamical system Bullet Shotgun Particle in a box Rifle Revolver Hamiltonian mechanics Siphon Suppressor Dirac equation Harmonic oscillator Trajectory Rigid body dynamics Kinetic energy Tsiolkovsky rocket equation Modified Newtonian dynamics Phonon Magnetic field Dark energy Potential energy Speed of light Determinism Aerodynamics Electron Inertial guidance system Trigonometric function Artillery Space elevator Moment of inertia Philosophy of space and time Stopping power Air gun Nuclear magnetic resonance Geodesy Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Faster-than-light Navier-Stokes equations Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Bussard ramjet Recoil operation Noether's theorem Plasma (physics) Heckler & Koch USP Renormalization Kinematics Schr__dinger equation M__bius transformation
