do you have any recycling ideas it is for my science project thanks would it work to demonstrate how things decompose or not this one takes a bit of time not good for a last minute project for instance put soil in a box outside bury various items in it and check and record the decomposition at various times be sure to include some items that say they are biodegradable and something that isn't like a soda bottle another idea would be to make a laminated chart for families to use to hang above their recycling container to remind them of what goes in the recycling box use pictures so even the little ones can participate good luck peace be with you Plastic Recycling Decomposition Waste management Hydrogen peroxide Professional wrestling match types Dynamic Systems Development Method Glass Jute Biodegradation Cremation Vending machine Hey Jude Getting Things Done Burial Bottle Compost Polyethylene terephthalate Luck Object-oriented programming Bong Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Late Night with Conan O'Brien Hall & Oates Landfill Dry cleaning C plus plus Magic (illusion) Biogeochemical cycle Propaganda L4 microkernel family Recycling of PET Bottles Blue Peter Water purification Vampire Goodness and value theory Product Lifecycle Management Ecology Horseshoe The Strangerhood Hamster Haloalkane Charles Goodyear Monopoly (game) About a Boy The Late Show with David Letterman The Amazing Race Aluminum can Plastic recycling Hydroponics Projection (linear algebra) Daryl Hall Jackass: The Movie Scuba set Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Polystyrene Polyvinyl alcohol Timeline of underwater technology Explosive material Pools of Darkness Acetic acid Intelligent design Energy development RuneScape economy Good Vibrations W.
