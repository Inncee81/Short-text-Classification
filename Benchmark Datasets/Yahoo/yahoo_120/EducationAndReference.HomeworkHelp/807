if sinx and cosx find tanx sinx is the ratio of the opposite leg of the triangle to the hypotenuse or opposite over hypotenuse to find the length of the third leg of the triangle use pythageroean's therom a b c with a and b being the legs and c being the hypotenuse useing algebra substite the values you know from sinx and you get a a a a or the square root of the second part to this problem is cosx when is a number less than when it's a negative number when is cosx negative in the second and third quadrants quad all all trig functions are positive quad s tudents only sin is positive quad t ake only tan is positive quad c alculus only cos is positive since cosx is negative it must be in the second or third quadrants but we know sin is positive as given in the problem and sin is only positive in the first and second quadrants this means that this takes place in the second quadrant tanx is the ratio of the opposite and adjacent opp over adj legs in the second quadrant so tanx sq root or you add a negative because tangent isn't positive in the second quadrant i hope this wasn't too confusing Trigonometry Triangle Polynomial Irrational number Trigonometric identity Pythagorean theorem Particle in a box Square root of 2 Cissoid of Diocles Complex number Projective transformation Derivative Ordinary differential equation Quaternion Parabola Vector (spatial) Newton's method Pi Angle Taylor series Integration by parts Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace 3-sphere Fibonacci number Vector field Heat equation Timeline of mathematics Exponentiation Mnemonic Orthogonal matrix Division by zero Natural logarithm Lebesgue integration Haversine formula Golden ratio Tangent Basel problem Josip Plemelj Ellipse 3D projection Ruler-and-compass construction Hyperbolic motion GED RLC circuit Hyperbolic function Conic section Real number African American Vernacular English Negative and non-negative numbers Cartesian coordinate system Dirac equation Circle Phonon Standard deviation Anosov diffeomorphism Discrete Fourier transform ___1 (number) Window function Antenna (radio) Regression analysis Abul W__fa Airy function Pendulum Tangent half-angle formula Arbitrary constant of integration Pentagram Formal power series Elementary algebra Collision detection Trigonometric rational function Fourier series Slide rule Lattice (group) Associativity TI-89 series Golden ratio base Hipparchus (astronomer) Kepler's laws of planetary motion Joseph Louis Lagrange Tetration Logarithm M__bius transformation Professional wrestling holds Quartic equation Quantification Spherical harmonics Bayesian inference Phase-shift keying Magic square On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences 0 (number) Boundary value problem Normal mode
