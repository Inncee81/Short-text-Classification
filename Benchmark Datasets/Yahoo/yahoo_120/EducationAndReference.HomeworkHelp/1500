slopes and intercepts math help i really need help on my algebra ii packet and i seemed to have forgotten everything about any math i learned in the past two years i'm doing linear equations i know the slope intercept is y mx b but i don't know how to plug it into my equations please help y x x y x y x y please tell me how to solve these simple terms would help the first problem is already in the right form m b the rest you need to solve for y if you forgot algebra i'll show you step by step the second problem then you can do the rest x y y x y x y x m b Mathematics Ordinary differential equation Linear equation Polynomial Algebraic geometry Algebra Linear algebra Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Elementary algebra Mathematics education XSL attack Vedic mathematics Linear Numerical analysis Dirac equation Newton's method Projective transformation Slope Quadratic equation Exponentiation Complex number Aberration in optical systems Partial differential equation System of linear equations Matrix (mathematics) Einstein's field equation Exponential function M__bius transformation Gaussian elimination Fermat's last theorem Clifford algebra Geometry Derivative Perturbation theory Quartic equation Finite element method Basis (linear algebra) History of mathematics Calculus Moscow and Rhind Mathematical Papyri Kernel (algebra) Transmission line Green's function History of computing hardware Lie algebra Mathematics of general relativity Orthogonal matrix Quintic equation Welfare economics Cubic equation Harmonic oscillator Clay Mathematics Institute Recurrence relation Ruler-and-compass construction Group theory Trajectory Polynomial interpolation Computer vision Heat equation Galois theory Dynamical system Al-Khwarizmi Computational fluid dynamics Oliver Heaviside Artificial neural network Richard Feynman Computer algebra system Luminiferous aether Trigonometric function Problem solving Navier-Stokes equations Curve Normal mode Linear differential equation Numerical ordinary differential equations Matrix exponential Maxwell's equations Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms Calculator Mathematical physics LU decomposition Gauge theory Linear regression Prime number William Rowan Hamilton Adjoint functors The Princeton Review Fibonacci number Complexity classes P and NP Random walk Boolean algebra Separation of variables Matroid Josip Plemelj Timeline of mathematics Linear system of divisors Newton's identities Discrete Fourier transform Associative algebra
