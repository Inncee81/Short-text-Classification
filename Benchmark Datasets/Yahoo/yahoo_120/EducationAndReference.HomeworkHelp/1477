hi i have a research assignment i need to complete for uni the topic ive been assigned is 'australia at war' this is a huge topic and am unsure what angle to take or where to begin would anybody have any suggestions thanx people perhaps you should attack it from ww and work your way through to present day with emphasis on the way the public felt about each conflict and how it impacted on lives of civilians and soldiers eg ww and there were a lot of volunteers wishing to fight for their country's freedom and the soldiers had massive public support vietnam the police action was all about conscription and the public had little support for the soldiers etc i am looking at it from the humanistic angle but you may just wish to look at it from the historical angle i am not sure what you are studying Conscription Vietnam War United States Army Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War Conscription in the United States Tet Offensive Conscription in Australia South Vietnam U.S. invasion of Afghanistan Democracy Military history of the United States Total war Waffen-SS Iraq War History of the Australian Army War Military history of Australia Social psychology Pacifism Provisional Irish Republican Army Guerrilla warfare Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003 World War II casualties First Indochina War Medal of Honor Vietnam Veterans Against the War Vietnam Multinational force in Iraq History of East Timor Combat stress reaction One Year War Military use of children Battle of Gettysburg Peacekeeping Governments' positions pre-2003 invasion of Iraq Anglo-Irish War Military history of the Soviet Union Conscription Crisis of 1917 Neville Chamberlain Post-Confederation history of Canada Irish Civil War USS Walke (DD-723) World War II Israel Defense Forces Conscientious objector Vietnam veteran Foreign relations of Australia Second Chimurenga Australian Army Amnesty International U.S. 82nd Airborne Division Arab-Israeli conflict Open access German student movement Philippine-American War Six-Day War Freedom of speech Military history of Canada Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam Napoleonic Wars National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam U.S. 25th Infantry Division Participants in World War II 1948 Arab-Israeli War Swedish allotment system Australian 8th Division Yom Kippur War Iran-Iraq War Sociology Winter War Sino-Soviet split Chu-Han contention Suicide bombing Special Air Service Second Boer War Conscription Crisis of 1944 War on Terrorism History of modern Croatia Athrun Zala Indochina Wars Bloody Valentine War USS Taussig (DD-746) Militant Just War theory Canadian Armed Forces Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Anglicanism Community emergency response team Malayan Emergency Schutzstaffel Ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka Sniper Military of the Republic of China Military police __lvaro Uribe Battle of Long Tan ANZAC Day Korean War Hong Kong Police Force Franco-Prussian War
