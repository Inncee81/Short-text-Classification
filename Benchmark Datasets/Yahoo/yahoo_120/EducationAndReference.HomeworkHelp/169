why is the resistor connected in series with a voltmeter called a multiplier i have found out that the resistor connected in series with a voltmeter is called a multiplier why is it so does it multiply something as its name suggests if so what is it a multiplier resistor is put in series with a voltmeter internal the voltmeter device to allow the voltmeter's needle or digital display to cover a greater range of measurement the in series multiplier resistor creates a voltage divider with the voltmeter's internal resistor reducing the voltage which basically gives the needle or digital display a greater range of sensitivity so the multiplier resistor is in actuality multiplying the range of display for the voltmeter its a bit confusing but it is very well explained at the following web site http www allaboutcircuits com vol chpt html read it and re read it it does make sense good luck Resistor Circuit design Volt Voltmeter Electronics Digital-to-analog converter Voltage source Potentiometer Electrophysiology Decibel Sensor Phase-locked loop Transistor Series and parallel circuits Linear regulator Oscilloscope MOSFET Color Wind power Electronic amplifier Light-emitting diode Capacitor Electrical generator Digital Vacuum tube CPU design Sinclair ZX81 World Wide Web Dither Impedance Analog-to-digital converter Central processing unit Circuit breaker CMOS Logic gate Ammeter Electrical network Electric motor Electrometer Digital photography Likelihood principle Audiophile HyperText Transfer Protocol Battery (electricity) Apollo Guidance Computer Wind turbine Read-only memory Hardware random number generator Piezoelectricity Voltage regulator Transformer Power (physics) Current source RGB color model Digital circuit Dynamic random access memory Preferred number Action potential Extended display identification data Analysis of resistive circuits Solar variation Electricity RLC circuit Analog computer Carburetor Crystal oscillator Slide rule Diode Electrical element Calculator Gramophone record Impedance matching Computer Photography Cascading Style Sheets RONJA Flash memory Ion selective electrode Output impedance Nixie tube HTML 7400 series Commodore 64 Nominal impedance Enterprise content management Incandescent light bulb Inductor PID controller Radiation hardening Character encodings in HTML Unicode and HTML Trigonometric function Electronic color code Pi
