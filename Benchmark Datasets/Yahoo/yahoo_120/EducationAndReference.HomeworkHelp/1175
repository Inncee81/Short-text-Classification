what body metabolic process involves oxygen describe the process please d thanks cellular respiration cellular respiration the metabolic process by which an organism obtains energy by reacting oxygen with glucose to give water carbon dioxide and atp energy cellular respiration describes the metabolic reactions and processes that take place in a cell to obtain biochemical energy from fuel molecules energy is released by the oxidation of fuel molecules and is stored as high energy carriers the reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions in metabolism Photosynthesis Metabolism Glycolysis Biochemistry Citric acid cycle Carbon dioxide Glucose Enzyme Anabolism Oxidative phosphorylation Fatty acid metabolism Hydrogen sulfide Insulin Poison Anaerobic respiration Fuel cell Fermentation Adenosine triphosphate Signal transduction Protein Mitochondrion Nutrient Carbohydrate Hydrogen peroxide Whole proteome analysis Alkane Hemoglobin Glucokinase Origin of life Hydrogen economy Skeletal muscle Water (molecule) Alcohol Methane Sulfur Chemistry Respiratory system Mitochondrial genetics Ketosis Alternative biochemistry Homeostasis Energy development Life Iron Hypoglycemia Radical (chemistry) Nutrition Brewery Sewage treatment Viking biological experiments Diabetic ketoacidosis Hyperventilation Acetic acid Sugar Bacteria Gas exchange Senescence Lung Potassium Primary nutritional groups Methanol Drowning Rebreather Sulfuric acid Nitrogen oxide Combustion DNA repair Carbon monoxide Diabetes mellitus Ammonia Red blood cell Fuel Thylakoid Proton-exchange fuel cell Water Alcohol fuel Hydrogen vehicle Chemoluminescence Biology Organic reduction Chemical reaction Passive transport RuBisCO Soil C4 carbon fixation Nuclear reactor Lac operon Gasoline Corrosion Polychlorinated biphenyl
