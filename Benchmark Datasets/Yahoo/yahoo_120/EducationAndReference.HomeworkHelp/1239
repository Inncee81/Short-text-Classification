help me please x x x x x well i'm not really sure what you need to do simplify or solve the inequalities together to simplify the first one x x x x for the third one x so if you need to solve the inequalities as a whole it'll be x Traveling salesman problem Welfare economics Legendre transformation Random walk Capitalism Simplex algorithm Elementary algebra Quantum harmonic oscillator Optimization (mathematics) Joseph Louis Lagrange Inequality Conic section Absolute value Multiple integral EPR paradox Birthday paradox Market failure Fluid dynamics Prime counting function Algorithm Quartic equation Simplified Chinese character Debye sheath Microeconomics TI-89 series Frame problem Cauchy-Schwarz inequality Mean field theory RLC circuit Trigonometric identity Partial differential equation Liberalism Neoliberalism P-complete Thabo Mbeki Chinese character encoding Navier-Stokes equations Nonlinear programming Jensen's inequality Projective transformation Economic inequality Betting (poker) CHSH inequality Income inequality metrics Boundary layer Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means Basel problem Dynamical system Gini coefficient M-theory (simplified) Hermann Minkowski Martingale Poverty line TRIZ Examples of differential equations Andrey Kolmogorov Thue___Siegel___Roth theorem Intelligence (trait) Bell's theorem Thought Cram__r-Rao inequality Trajectory Bell test experiments Newton's method PH Internet protocol suite Hydrogeology Least squares Inequity aversion Affirmative action Trickle down effect Root-finding algorithm David Bohm Isoperimetry Hilbert's problems Federal Communications Commission Particle in a one-dimensional lattice (periodic potential) Hartree-Fock Calculus of variations Economy of Africa Sudoku Computer and video game genres Timeline of quantum mechanics, molecular physics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics Black body Law of value Traditional Chinese character Linear differential equation Riemannian geometry Ising model Simplex Derivative Fragmentation Configuration interaction Technology Linked list Black-Scholes Wind Kernel (algebra) Uncertainty principle
