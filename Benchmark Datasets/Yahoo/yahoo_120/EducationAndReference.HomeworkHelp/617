find the absolute max and min values of f x x sin x on pie specify both the x and y coordinates of the absolute max and absolute min give your answers in exact form please help the answer is abs max is at x value pi and the y value at that point is pi sqrt the abs min is at x value pi and the y value there is pi sqrt to do this you take the first derivative and set it equal to zero to find all max and mins f' x cos x you solve for x and find that the x values are x pi and pi then to solve for the y values at these points you can solve for the y values by plugging in the x values of the max and mins solved earlier into the function basically f x y at pi the f x pi sqrt at pi f x pi sqrt final answer absolute max x pi y pi sqrt absolute min x pi y pi sqrt just in case sqrt square root good luck Absolute value Complex number Trigonometric function Trigonometric identity RLC circuit Trajectory Conic section Square root TI-89 series Particle in a box Quartic equation Cubic equation Triangle Absolute magnitude Quaternion Ordinary differential equation Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Bessel function Multiple integral M__bius transformation Euclidean distance Linear differential equation Standard deviation Tetration Pendulum Optimization (mathematics) Dirac equation Normal distribution Quadratic equation Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Regression analysis Pi Ellipse Debye model Frame fields in general relativity Coordinates (mathematics) Gas in a box 3-sphere Julia set Green's function Heat equation Projective transformation Radius of convergence Exponentiation Great-circle distance Grover's algorithm Combinatorics Hyperbolic function Gamma function Phase-shift keying Spherical harmonics Black-Scholes Parabola Quantum tunneling Measurement in quantum mechanics Riemann integral Kepler's laws of planetary motion Elliptic integral HSV color space Dynamic programming Vector (spatial) Exponential function Imaginary unit Quantum harmonic oscillator Angle Halting problem Gaussian elimination Airy function Recurrence relation Coordinate rotation Quadratic sieve Chebyshev polynomials Newton's method Pentagon Boy's surface Norm (mathematics) QR decomposition Generating trigonometric tables WKB approximation Orthogonal matrix Derivative Phonon Escape velocity Haversine formula Laplace operator Estimation theory Geodesy Quintic equation Jacobi's elliptic functions Random variable Basel problem Monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave Schwarzschild coordinates Arbitrary constant of integration
