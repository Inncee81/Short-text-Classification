help please martina leaves home at am bicycling at a rate of mi h two hours later john leaves driving at the rate of mi hr at what time will john catch up with martina let x represent martina's time let x represent john's time because he leaves hours later so you know the distance formula which is distance speed x time so martina's distance john's distance so that they meet up martina's speed martina's time john's speed john's time x x or you could say x x x x x x hrs now add those hours to martina's starting time which is a m and so hours later would be p m so john will catch up to martina at p m i say that it is better to set up an equation to solve for x because what would happen if it was like hours and minutes that you had to add it would be hard to get that by drawing a diagram you can't really go wrong with the setting up of an equation unless you had set up the equation wrong right from the start hope this helps Speed of light Torque Tide Special relativity Coriolis effect Jet engine Calculus Trajectory Velocity Fast bowling Roger Federer Recumbent bicycle Equation of time Longitude Martina Navratilova Hipparchus (astronomer) Astrodynamics Faster-than-light Bicycle Minkowski diagram Tennis Martina Hingis Sundial Thermal power station Collision detection Gravity Oscilloscope Warp drive Complex number 2004 World Series Freeway Grand Slam (tennis) Transformation problem Pendulum Redundant array of independent disks Motorcycle Spacetime General relativity Autogyro Spacecraft propulsion Einstein's field equation Day Time travel Siphon Speed Steffi Graf Laws of cricket Adjoint functors Circle Extreme Programming Glossary of graph theory Force Conic section Time zone Measurement in quantum mechanics Matrix (mathematics) Quartic equation Frame of reference Speed limit History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) 24 Hours of Le Mans Tennis at the 2004 Summer Olympics Formula One regulations Bicycle helmet Zeno's paradoxes CPU cache Highway Poker jargon Cissoid of Diocles Ordinary differential equation Partial differential equation Planetary orbit Luminiferous aether Therion (band) Earth Hiawatha Line Polynomial Explosive material Escape velocity Quadratic equation Aerodynamics Electromagnetic radiation Random walk Coordinates (mathematics) Wright brothers Kinetic energy Dark energy Triathlon Digital circuit Transmission line Modified Newtonian dynamics Avalanche Ellipse Apple Macintosh Auto racing Dorama Newton's laws of motion Black-Scholes Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005
