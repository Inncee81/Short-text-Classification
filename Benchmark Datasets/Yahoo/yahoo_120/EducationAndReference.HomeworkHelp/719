why does barton on sea have destructive waves i'm doing my geography gcse coursework and this is one of the things that i have to include beach the temporary deposition of sand and shingle along the coastline without its beach a coast is vulnerable to erosion e g the cliffs at barton on sea were easily eroded following the construction of a groyne updrift at bournemouth destructive waves found on steep beaches are steeply breaking and mainly responsible for coastal erosion their backwash is much stronger than their swash destructive process in storm conditions particularly the process can cause significant erosion to beaches an example being barton on sea on the english coast and therefore is a threat to coastal communities that rely on their beaches for protection from more serious erosion the need is most obvious where there are permanent structures on the shore the loss of first the beach then of old glacially deposited sediment to longshore drift resulted in the loss of the english town of dunwich in suffolk to the sea the problem causes coastal towns in erosional longshore drift areas to employ coastal defences such as groynes which interrupt the downstream movement of sediment jetties and groynes generally do not stop longshore drift but interfere with it to the extent of retaining some of the beach material which might otherwise be removed when a groyne is constructed once equilibrium has been regained the longshore drift resumes but if the groyne has been well sited some of the beach material is retained on its upstream side this is useful in dissipating the energy in incoming waves as the retained beach breaks some of the force the part of the shore in the shadow of the groyne downstream from it is sheltered by having the waves broken by the structure Coast Glacier Bar (landform) Seawall Dam Jetty Dune Colorado Plateau Shipwreck Flood Desert Reculver Geology of the Appalachians Sea level rise Tsunami Geography of Ireland Spit (landform) Geography of Albania Death Valley National Park Breakwater (structure) Storm surge 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Sussex Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Spurn Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bournemouth Battle of Normandy Geography of Venezuela Geology of the Yosemite area Long Island Tide Desertification Deforestation Yosemite National Park Sutherland Shire Sediment Geography of Turkey Hurricane Ivan Geology of the Bryce Canyon area Amoco Cadiz Hampshire USS Sands (DD-243) Geomorphology Landing at Anzac Cove Dorset Oceanic trench Opportunity rover Three Gorges Dam Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Disaster Anchor Geography of Mexico Flood geology Snowball Earth Intermontane Plateaus Tlingit Atlantic Ocean Weymouth Levee Geography of India A151 road Natural disaster Ecology of Hong Kong Surtsey River Plate tectonics Geology of the Alps Galveston Hurricane of 1900 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Sun Radio Caroline Romney Marsh 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Impact crater Sedimentary rock Orjen Geology Swiss plateau Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign Landform Yellowstone National Park
