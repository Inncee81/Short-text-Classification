geometry how do you solve a a flower bed m by m is surrounded by a grass lawn if the width of the grass lawn is m find the area of the the flower bed the grass lawn and the flower bed the grass lawn what is the ratio of the flower bed to the area of the grass lawn b a farmer has meters of fence material he wants to build a vegetable garden if he uses all material what is the biggest area the garden can have if the length and width of the garden are whole numbers what is the smallest area if the width of the garden is at least m if the garden is at least m problem a area of flower bead is area length x width m x m m are you sure i don't think that it is possible for the flower bead to be surround by a grass lawn wiht a width of m the width has to be greater that the width of m of the flower bed in order to surround the flower bed no i can't answer or of this problem because there is a problem with problem b the biggest area the garden can have is when you have a square garden with meters of fencing and if you have a square that means that each side will be m m so area m x m m that's the biggest garden that you can have the smallest area if the width is at least m would mean that you have two sides that are m and then the remaining lengths will be m m m but divide that by because you have to lengths and so the length of the garden is m therefore the smallest area will be m x m m if the garden is at least m what i don't understand do you mean if the length of the garden is at least m if so then there really is no difference between this question and the one before this one you will still have the minimum area of m x m m Lawn mower Lechaina Tennis Garden The Time Machine Eight queens puzzle Ruler-and-compass construction Combinatorics Rigging Abbey Lawn Xeriscaping Pi Weed control Street Trigonometric function Dai shogi Golden ratio Flax GED Israeli West Bank barrier Wire Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Gardening Aberration in optical systems Desertification Balikpapan Triangle Palouse Taj Mahal Geometry Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Normal distribution Flowering plant Poaceae Plant Culture of Korea Carlton Gardens, Melbourne RuneScape quests Hamster Softball Species Dune Largest organism Archimedes Solomon's Temple Infinity Computational complexity theory Strap-on dildo Pollen Persian Gardens Equine conformation Sears Holdings Corporation Area (geometry) Bamboo Dimensional analysis Flower Mount St. Helens Flood geology Elis Prefecture Bayesian inference Chair Prime number Great Pyramid of Giza Capernaum Movie projector Minesweeper (computer game) New Jersey Wallpaper group Guinea pig Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne Comfrey Abacus Joseph Louis Lagrange Racing bicycle Hay Park Solar cell Welding Curve Complexity classes P and NP Pollinator decline Chatsworth House Shifting cultivation Organic food Christiansborg Palace Jet engine Alhambra Tick Bed (furniture) Irrigation Lebesgue integration Welland Canal Agriculture Rail transport modelling Geology of the Alps Botany Shaggy dog story
