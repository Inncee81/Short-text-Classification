how do i find the center of the circle with equation x y x y i don't know how to find the center with the equation in this form you'll have to put this equation into standard form for a circle x h y k r where the center is h k and the radius r to do this you have to complete the squares for the x and y terms balancing what you add by adding it to the other side x x y y now you have perfect squares so write them as such x y therefore the center is done Quadratic equation Conic section Quartic equation Trigonometric function Circle Projective transformation Dimensional analysis Sphere Triangle Map projection Cissoid of Diocles Maxwell's equations Explosive material Quaternion Equation of time Gaussian elimination Dirac equation Einstein's field equation Coriolis effect Joseph Louis Lagrange Orbit equation Planetary orbit Ruler-and-compass construction Pi Kepler's laws of planetary motion Antenna (radio) Great circle Equation of state Haversine formula Gravity Z-transform Elementary algebra Spherical trigonometry Linear least squares Gee Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace 3-sphere Cubic equation Real number M__bius strip Force Stress (physics) Fibonacci number Escape velocity Square root Quintic equation Hipparchus (astronomer) Curve fitting Flag of the People's Republic of China Hypergeometric series Black hole SAT Glossary of partner dance terms Huzita's axioms Lens (optics) Perturbation theory Exact solutions in general relativity Orthogonal group Circular motion Sun Navier-Stokes equations Electron Great Pyramid of Giza Longitude Stereographic projection Great-circle distance Schr__dinger equation Astrodynamics Geometry Exponentiation Parabola Centripetal force Binomial coefficient M__bius transformation Versine Complex number Pythagorean theorem Copper Archimedes Schwarzschild metric Center of mass Radius of convergence Polynomial Cricket Roman surface Dynamical system Geographic coordinate system Radius (bone) Sturm-Liouville theory Equator Proper time Potential energy Latitude Nuclear reaction Neighbourhood (mathematics) Fluid solution Covariance and contravariance Contredanse Modified Newtonian dynamics
