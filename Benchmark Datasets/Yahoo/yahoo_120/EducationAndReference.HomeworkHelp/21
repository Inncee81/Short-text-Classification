math question please help passengers boarded a plane first of the passengers got off and the original number got on then of the passengers got off and twice the number of remaining passengers got on after that of the passengers got off the plane leaving passengers how many passengers originally boarded the plane i know i'm supposed to be working backwards but the problem is it's soooooo confusing it's not really homework and wow you guys answered really fast thank you xd x number of passengers on the plane to begin with x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x y y y z z z a a a simplify and solve for x or use the equations on the bottom and work backwards easy as a piece of pie chocolate cream or the answer is Fictitious force Ordinary differential equation Complexity classes P and NP Complex number Mathematics Theory of conduct Combinatorics Random walk Pi Projective transformation Expert system NP-complete Shogi Collision detection FoxTrot Infinity United Airlines Flight 93 SAT Cissoid of Diocles X86 Halting problem Tai shogi Boy's surface Ziad Jarrah Richard Feynman Crossword Elementary algebra Many-worlds interpretation Skateboarding trick Sudoku Midwest Airlines Riemann zeta function Exponentiation Quantum harmonic oscillator Dynamical system Luminiferous aether Marilyn vos Savant Welfare economics Gimli Glider G__del's incompleteness theorem Linked list The Princeton Review Recurrence relation IBM PC compatible Zeno's paradoxes Aberration in optical systems Ruler-and-compass construction Boeing 737 Affine transformation Euler's formula Internet protocol suite Dai dai shogi BASIC programming language Exponential function Fermat's last theorem Airport (film) TI-89 series Grover's algorithm Polynomial interpolation Taikyoku shogi Quartic equation Multiple integral GED Confectionery Russian airplane bombings of August 2004 Teen Girl Squad Traveling salesman problem American Airlines Flight 191 Amtrak British Railways Mark 1 Integer factorization Fairy chess piece Goldbach's conjecture Discrete Fourier transform Orthogonal matrix Ryanair Visual Basic Hydrogeology Windsurfing Academic Games Chess strategy and tactics Wheel of Fortune Fluid dynamics Geometry Augustus De Morgan Physics Cubic equation September 11, 2001 attacks USS Windham Bay (CVE-92) Manifold Draughts IP (complexity) 2000 Australian Grand Prix R.
