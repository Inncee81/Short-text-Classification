of mice and men hello i really need help with closing arguments that i have to write to the jury in this assignment they're are putting george on trial for murdering lennie and i have to choose whether george is guilty or not guilty of murdering lennie i think that he is guilty because if prerhaps he would have not killed lennie and he would have been excused pm grounds of lack of mental competence and may have been given a better life than had with george so what i need help with is how to start my closing arguments and a few points to back my arguement i will truly appreciate your help i'm not being lazy ihave been working on this assignment for a long time and i desperatley need help now thank you once again i would vote no he'd be onlly be guilty of mercy killing at best and voluntary manslaughter at best and here's why lennie was dangerous because of his capacity to kill and not realize what he did or why because of his mental instability george also knew lennie's life was in imminent danger from the lynch mob and i think most of these people were already prejudiced against him to begin with so it's doubtful he'd even have gotten a fair trial george's motives were out of compassion for his friend who would have died a brutal death also didn't the woman he killed use lennie for her own sexual pleasure it's been so long since i read this but wasn't part of george's motive also because of this so should your jury's she knew what lennie was and shouldn't have messed with him that's reason's i'd either give george a light sentence or if it's totally within my purview i'd let the guy walk Murder Gwen Araujo EastEnders Insanity defense Sharon Tate Rape Mumia Abu-Jamal Charles Manson Capital punishment Memento (film) Leo Frank Vernon Schillinger Jury trial Socrates Wyatt Earp Lenny Bruce Plame affair 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Serial killer Friends W.
