speakin tha truth ok i just asked a question about money but i dont have enough time for a job its all about skool ok i read your last question unfortunately you don't get to pick godparents godparents are people chosen by your parents to serve your spiritual well being godparents can also be known as people who your parents choose to look after you in case of any untimely death as far as your dilemna depending on the area in which you live there are often programs set up like big brother big sister etc that won't buy you things like computers or clothes but can help you with opportunities that may improve your well being down the road i agree that school needs to be any young person's main priority but you may want to consider getting a small after school job or a weekend job that may allow you to save up for things that you may want or need you can talk to a counselor at school and let him her know whats going on at home and what things you'd like to have for yourself they may have some information to give you or may be able to help you fend for yourself thats kind of a crap situation to be in but i know lots of people who had less than desireable family situations and they have been able with lots of help from others to start the kind of life they want to have talk to anyone you can take any opportunity given to you you won't be able to just pick rich godparents but you are able to pick opportunities for yourself to make things better Theory of conduct The Fairly OddParents Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Craps Justification (theology) Rich Mullins Freeters $ale of the Century The Apprentice 2 Jiddu Krishnamurti Goodness and value theory Education in Romania Wheel of Fortune Apostles' Creed Extreme Programming Game show CPU cache MTV Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Pitaten Meaning of life U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Jennifer Lopez MapleStory The Human Stain Capitalism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Make money fast Milton H.
