can you help me figure out this statistics questions determine the mean and the standard deviation of the following frequency distribution class frequency up to up to up to up to up to the mean midpoint frequency n multiply the midpoint of the class by the frequency add them up and divide by n number of observations mean mean to find the standard deviation take each of the five numbers and subtract the mean then square it total the numbers and take the square root sqrt standard deviation sqrt i apologize for being cryptic about this explanation but it's difficult to show this concept on yahoo answers as a result i've posted a excel printout at http i tinypic com let if jpg good luck in your studies mitch Normal distribution Standard deviation Mean Complex number Pi Square root Quartic equation Hardy-Weinberg principle Spectral density Uncertainty principle Pearson's chi-square test Gravity Grade (education) Meantone temperament Margin of error Intelligence quotient Vector (spatial) Crossword Pendulum Cissoid of Diocles Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Decibel Mental calculation Quadratic equation Log-normal distribution Central limit theorem Slide rule Bayesian inference Quantitative marketing research Napier's bones Invalid proof Mann-Whitney U Random variable Interval (music) Impedance Continued fraction Dimensional analysis Pitch (music) Modern portfolio theory Checking if a coin is fair Cube root Quantum mechanics Root mean square Trigonometric identity Elementary algebra Trigonometric function Triangle Species Bell's theorem Matrix (mathematics) Randomness Debye model Figurate number Operational amplifier JPEG Statistical hypothesis testing Binary numeral system Scientific method Code division multiple access Copy protection Labor theory of value Linear regression Two's complement Langmuir probe Ruffini's rule Big Bang Six Sigma Planck's law of black body radiation Conic section Apollo Guidance Computer Many-worlds interpretation Economics Circuit design Boy's surface Phase-locked loop Exponentiation Quadratic sieve Confidence interval Correlation Numeral system Alternating current Renormalization Variance Real number Combinatorics Identical particles Evolution Synthesizer Median Kalman filter Resonance RLC circuit Regression toward the mean Angle Dither M__bius transformation Gaussian elimination Doomsday argument
