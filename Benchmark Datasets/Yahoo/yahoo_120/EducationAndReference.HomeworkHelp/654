i was just wandering is there a word without any vowles please dont say the word why i meant vowels rhythm sky cyst vowels are strictly speaking sounds not letters of the alphabet the letters of the alphabet used to represent vowel sounds are a e i o u w and y the sound of w in water and of y in yes are called semi vowels or glides however these glide sounds are not the only sounds which w and y represent they can represent full vowels as well as in crwth and cyst and sky furthermore w is associated with u and y is associated with i so that u and i also represent the glide sounds in water and yes as in quite and onion had history gone a little differently we might now be spelling these last two as qwite and onyon so the little clause and sometimes 'y' is really a misleading little clause it presupposes that the glide sound in yes is to be considered a consonant otherwise the y would be considered a vowel the same as a e i o u i e always a vowel and if y is not a vowel when a glide then neither is i and there should be another clause saying that i is only sometimes a vowel it not being so when it represents a glide as in onion in summary i u y and w are all used to represent both glides semi vowels and full vowels Vowel Phoneme Hangul Pinyin Latin alphabet International Phonetic Alphabet Diacritic Slovak language Writing system Hindi Cyrillic alphabet Alphabet Georgian language Finnish language Tatar language Korean language Romanian language Thai alphabet Greek language Umlaut Consonant Hebrew alphabet Vowel length Languages of India Swedish language Arabic grammar Dutch language Lojban Glottal stop Standard Mandarin R__maji Non-native pronunciations of English Latin spelling and pronunciation Spanish language Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Esperanto phonology Singlish History of the Arabic alphabet Hungarian language Tengwar Hiragana Russian language Silent E Writing Acute accent English words with uncommon properties Old English language Greek alphabet Schwa Y Gurmukh__ script Polish language Thai language Chroneme Apostrophe (mark) Welsh language Indonesian language Taiwanese (linguistics) Vietnamese language Voiceless glottal fricative Portuguese language Bulgarian language Romanian phonology Tone (linguistics) Vowel harmony Aramaic language English as an additional language Diaeresis Open front unrounded vowel Esperanto orthography American English Warlpiri language Slovenian language Phonetics Japanese phonology Abjad Shavian alphabet Serbian language Russian phonology Tetragrammaton Sound symbolism Syriac language Revised Romanization of Korean Canadian English Bengali language Wolof language
