how do you stop feeling afraid of your final exams i always tend to do worst in the finals this time i am behind on my lectures because they forgot to send me to rest of the dvd lectures which i am waiting for when fear takes over me it's really hard to concentrate help don't try to study in a room with a television or radio or even with a computer that's hooked up with internet access you need a place that's quiet well lit probably one without windows or with covered windows try going to the school library see if they have study rooms if nothing else get some good ear plugs and study at a restaurant or a coffee shop you'll want to avoid eating sugar and simple starches like french fries and candy bars even white bread and pasta coffee is okay the caffeine will keep you going but studies have shown that your ability to recall what you're studying is much greater if you have the same chemicals in your body at the time you learn something as you do when you take the test in other words if you're going to juice up on caffeine to study you might want to juice up on caffeine before you take the test also get some exercise twenty minutes of walking running swimming anything that gets your heart rate up a couple of times a week will help your brain work better also take notes while you read keep a legal pad with you and if the material is too overwhelming to read all at once just skim each paragraph for important points and write them in your notepad you're much more likely to remember and learn if you're writing notes longhand good luck in your exam Fecal incontinence Word of Wisdom Hypoglycemia Coffee Caffeine Breakfast GED Sleep Coffeehouse Stuttering American and British English differences Mnemonic Cuisine of Denmark Insomnia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Singlish Alcoholic beverage Chocolate Hangover Speed reading Dublin City University Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Game show Addiction Sugar Dyslexia Futurama (TV series - season 5) Pasta Bread Japanese cuisine Milk Atkins Nutritional Approach Reading (activity) Japanese tea ceremony Tea Tobacco smoking Trinity College, Dublin Starch Milton H.
