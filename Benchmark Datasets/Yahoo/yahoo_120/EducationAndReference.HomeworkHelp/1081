how did ferdinand magellan help man's happiness and welfare i have to write an essay for ap european history of how magellan is a humanist i can support myself in saying that magellan helped humanity and undermined the church thereby disregarding salvation unfortunately i can't find how he helped man's happiness nad welfare because as socrates said no man does anything unless he believes it will make him happy it might have been aristotle don't hold me to that in fact yes it was aristotle anyway how magellan helped man's happiness and welfare hinges on that belief i'm talking about the ideal of freedom man as an instinct desires to be free and in some ways exploratory when most people undermine an authoritary figure like the church in those times they fail and usually quite gruesomely however being able to draw on just one instance of success like that of magellan's encourages others to pursue that same ideal i guess you could say he lead his fellow man to happiness by example Socrates Nicomachean Ethics Aristotle Ferdinand Magellan Democracy Goodness and value theory Altruism Independence Party (Iceland) Theory of conduct Moral objectivism Philipp Melanchthon Social justice Free will Capitalism Theodicy Republic (dialogue) Objectivist philosophy Human nature Patriotism Theology Soul Salvation Army Religious conversion David Hume Human Trinity Summa Theologiae Philosophy of language Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Jean-Jacques Rousseau Donald Davidson (philosopher) Leo Strauss Military history of the Philippines Predestination Meaning of life Happiness Separation of church and state Paternalism Phaedo Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Classical education S__ren Kierkegaard Baptist John Howard Yoder Inference Merit The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex History of Western philosophy Flat Earth Margaret Thatcher Athenian democracy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Derek Parfit Polyamory Plato American individualist anarchism Karl Marx Salvation Guns, Germs, and Steel Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Reinhold Niebuhr Soka Gakkai International Republicanism Duties of the Heart Economic inequality Pacifism Liberal Democrats (UK) Socratic method Opus Dei Dialectic Libertarianism History of Chile Progressive Democrats Simone Weil Ayn Rand Christian eschatology John Wycliffe Love Southeast Asia Chile Neoconservatism in the United States Evangelicalism Heaven Religious pluralism State Same-sex marriage Aesthetic Realism Neoliberalism Church of Christ, Scientist Thomism History of philosophy Biblical inerrancy John Wesley History of science in the Middle Ages A Course In Miracles Freedom of religion Criticism of libertarianism Meme Max Weber God
