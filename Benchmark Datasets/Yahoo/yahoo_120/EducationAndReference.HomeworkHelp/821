solve using lcd lowest common denominator x x x x x x focal is right on with your lcd but here's a little bit more x x because x x factors multiply each individual term by your lcd x x x x combine like terms and set equal to zero i subtracted x from both sides here in one step x x factor x x good luck u can do it Vedic mathematics Complex number Vulgar fraction Quartic equation Projective transformation Elementary algebra Cissoid of Diocles Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Trigonometric identity Discrete cosine transform Computer numbering formats Continued fraction Partial fraction Vector (spatial) Dimensional analysis Microeconomics Liquid crystal display IMac Decibel Square root Slide rule Quadratic equation Betting (poker) Interval (music) Invalid proof Central processing unit Quantum computer Irrational number Binary numeral system Bayesian inference Factor analysis Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm Catalan number Poker jargon Two's complement Liquid crystal display television Orthogonal matrix Apollo Guidance Computer Stereoscopy Trigonometric function Conic section Contract bridge Refresh rate Finite field arithmetic Units of measurement M__bius transformation Addition Color Lebesgue integration Bitwise operation Aberration in optical systems Gaussian elimination Napier's bones Elementary arithmetic COBOL X86 assembly language Roman arithmetic State space (controls) Z-transform Combinatorial species Fast Fourier transform Photography Polynomial P-adic number Handheld game console Empty product IBM 1130 Digital photography Welfare economics Matrix (mathematics) Renormalization Timbre Reduction (complexity) Shor's algorithm Recurring decimal Canon T90 Operational amplifier Multiplication algorithm Polarization Subtractive color Ordinary differential equation Depth of field Planetary orbit Grade (education) Skat Mathematics Genetic algorithm Similarity (mathematics) 1 (number) Relational algebra Fundamental theorem of arithmetic Truss Inventive step and non-obviousness Light-emitting diode Linear differential equation Keynesian economics Derivation of the partition function TI-89 series Gee
