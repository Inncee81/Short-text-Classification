the hobbit i'm reading the hobbit for required reading for high school and i need help with this question when bilbo spares gollum does he make the right decision chapter i believe i don't understand it how did bilbo spare gollum he just ran for his life i don't know how he spared gollum just before bilbo escapes into the cave with goblins he has to jump over gollum and for a moment he considers killing gollum he must stab the foul thing put its eyes out kill it it meant to kill him then he reconsiders no not a fair fight he was invisible now gollum had no sword gollum had not actually threatened to kill him or tried yet and he was miserable alone lost a sudden understanding a pity mixed with horror welled up in bilbo's heart so instead he just jumps over him and runs away he could have easily stabbed gollum from behind being invisible and all but he decided otherwise Gollum The Hobbit One Ring The Hobbit (1977 film) Weapons of Middle-earth Gandalf The Lord of the Rings Saruman The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film) The Return of the King The Two Towers Orc (Middle-earth) Sauron Faramir Timeline of Arda Nazg__l Riddle Dwarves (Middle-earth) Hobbit Middle-earth Shelob Battle of Five Armies Red Book of Westmarch Blood (computer game) The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series) F__li and K__li Council of Elrond Drizzt Do'Urden Balin (Middle-earth) Middle-earth canon The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film) Socrates Ghosts 'n Goblins Will o' the wisp Retcon Kain (Legacy of Kain) Chuck Palahniuk Uncanny Valley Book of Isaiah Red Vs.
