can somebody please help me write the equation of a function whose domain is fx x x g and whose range is fy y y g what point s in the rectangle x y cannot be on the graph draw a graph of your function we must have the same teacher hook 'em horns see you in class although i have no idea who you are Function (mathematics) Derivative Henri Lebesgue Supply and demand Complex number Polynomial Self-adjoint operator Linear equation Continuous function Combinatorial species Elliptic curve Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Trigonometric function Multiple integral Random walk Integral Frequency spectrum Operator Scene graph Denotational semantics Order theory Exponential function Lebesgue integration Factorial Production function Leonhard Euler Mathematics Glossary of graph theory Calculus Numerical integration Loop-erased random walk Hooke's law Graph theory Algebraic geometry Topology Many-worlds interpretation Laws of Form Matroid Image Extrapolation Graph (mathematics) Hypergeometric series Homeomorphism Algorithm Proofs of Fermat's little theorem Stationary point Cubic equation Category (mathematics) Connected space 0 (number) Legendre transformation Potential energy Class (computer science) Topological space Cellular automaton Expert system Graph isomorphism problem Economics Exogenous growth model Literacy Graph drawing Quantification Map projection Binary relation Calculator Cheminformatics Quadratic equation Linear Probability density function Comma category Musical notation Dirac delta function Standing wave ratio Tensor Ontology (computer science) Bessel function Jacobi's elliptic functions Compiler Conic section Finite element method Stochastic process Tangent Cartesian coordinate system Curve Fundamental theorem of calculus Nomogram Extreme Programming Riemann integral Item response theory Sim__on Denis Poisson RLC circuit Planar graph CPU cache Graphing calculator Infinity Timeline of mathematics Numerical analysis Error function Hyperbola
