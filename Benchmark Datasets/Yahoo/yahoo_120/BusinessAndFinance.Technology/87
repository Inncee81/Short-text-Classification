are there any jobs that are not full of disappointments it's a decently loaded question disappointment generally stems from expectations what you really need to ask yourself is what your expectations for your job and career are some job expectations are perfectly fair we expect to be treated with respect we expect to work on projects that are interesting and exciting to us we expect to like the people we work with and for finding a job where these expectations are nicely matched in reality isn't always easy but it's more than possible with enough work reach out into your personal network and find which of your friends and colleagues have jobs that fulfill them you'll find a few things in common with most people who like their jobs their employers are flexible and they tend to like and respect their coworkers look into working for organizations that foster these feelings on the other hand if your expectations are unreasonable you may find any job to be disappointing if you're expecting immediate autonomy or the ability to call the shots on major projects you may be disappointed when you find that these things take time to earn ultimately i think that this question is about attitude what can you change in your attitude that will let you find the job that satisfies you Theory of conduct Social rule Goodness and value theory Economic inequality Ethics Graduate school Infantilism Government of India Act 1935 Mach kernel Social psychology Religion Finnish Civil War Extreme Programming Coercion Objectivist philosophy Polyamory Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Charles Grandison Finney Software engineering Gender role Alex Ferguson Professor The Smoking Room Gender-neutral language Shaggy dog story Strategic management Universal pragmatics Labour economics Hospitality service Microeconomics Honey and Clover Coming of Age (TNG episode) Current teachings of Prem Rawat Reality New York Jets Capitalism George Costanza Baseball Richard Feynman Employment W.
