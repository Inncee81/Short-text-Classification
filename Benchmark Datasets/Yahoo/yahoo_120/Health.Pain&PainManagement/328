i'm visiting my first chiropractor this week any suggestions for me any do's and don'ts do make sure they take x rays before they manipulate anything do tell them it they are hurting you too much or some chiro's use an electrical charge to adjust you and it doesn't work for everybody let them know after a day or two if you felt this approach did not benefit you they may also use physical manipulation techniques for those the little zapper doesn't work on sorry for ending in a preposition uck do ask for exercises if not offered to strengthen your structure that will support your chiropractic therapy don't be afraid to give them an honest evaluation of how often you will be able to come in for appt's some of them tend to be very high pressure ha ha insisting you must come in several times a week to properly support the adjustments you need although in some cases this may be true most of us have too many obligations and sometimes not enough insurance to legitimately make it to the chiropractor's several times a week they will work with you if you are honest and they are a good chiro about your availability for sessions good luck hope this helps and you get to feeling better Chiropractic Osteopathy Prostate cancer Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Traumatic incident reduction Scientology beliefs and practices Massage Carpal tunnel syndrome Urinary incontinence Transactional analysis Poker jargon Fecal incontinence Unemployment Weight training Alternative medicine Microeconomics Life insurance Insurance Explosive material Aikido Stuttering Breastfeeding Ra (board game) Social rule Reparative therapy Psychoanalysis Health insurance Psychotherapy Alexander Technique Cancer Transsexuality Traditional Chinese medicine Ethics Narcissism Ranma __ characters Medicine Clinical depression Homeopathy Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Capitalism Obesity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Alignment (role-playing games) Aortic dissection Decision making Chronic fatigue syndrome Alcoholics Anonymous Physical therapy New Deal Landmark Education Neuro-linguistic programming Electrophysiology Sydney Riot of 1879 Japan-United States relations Requirements analysis Wal-Mart Hypnosis FairTax Deconstruction Gestalt therapy Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Adoption Law of value Post-traumatic stress disorder Current teachings of Prem Rawat American Medical Association Advertising Time Out of Mind Reflexology Brainwashing Duties of the Heart Corporate governance Reiki Chess terminology Tears for Fears Spacecraft propulsion Ex-gay Electroconvulsive therapy Blackjack Economy of the United States Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Meme Information warfare Subluxation Repetitive strain injury Milton H.
