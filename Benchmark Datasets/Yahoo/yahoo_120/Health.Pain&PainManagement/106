opiate addict weening off anyone have any first hand knowledge of suboxone so you have all heard the stories with the i had this and that surgery and the doc gave me this and that yep same here for a while i was taking up to norco 's per day all of a sudden my doc stopped prescribing them to me so i got them off the street my habit was costing me a month easily one sunday about weeks ago i decided to stop cold turkey the first hours were hell the second were equally as bed and the third day i started feeling a little better but still crappy i went back to my doc and the pain management spc said to ween me off so he gave me and i started decreasing from a dose down to i got another and am down to pill twice a day but miss the high and have already gone to buy some more off the street just so i can ween even slower i am confident i will ween down and stop but once that is done i need a plan so has anyone ever had any first hand experience or knowledge of suboxone my plan is those and na hey there jay well im definitely familar with what you're going thru my husband and i have tooken painkillers like vicodin norcos percs etc you get the idea i started taking them just because of the hype very dumb and found out wow i like this feeling my husband took them for the high feeling and for his lower back pinched nerve we too have have bought them off the street his mom has had previous back surgeries and spends unfortunately about week on pills off the street this lady puts anyone to shame pops like a day its sickening but anyways back in february my husband decided enough was enough he figured why bother wasting his money for a feeling of you're first high experience you'll never really feel again so he went to his doctor who specializes with suboxone he prescribed him mg of it when he made the appt the nurse told my husband on the phone when he comes in he has to be in a mild moderate withdrawal therefore when they gave him the suboxone it could work properly because if you pop a pain pill before you take suboxone your body can actually go into more of a feening craving withdrawal feeling so that first day he took a whole suboxone the way to take this medicine you have to stick it under your tongue and let it dissolve so it goes into your bloodstream that first day was still pretty rough for him he layed in bed pretty much all day because he actually felt high from the suboxone which you do feel somewhat to get you away from the other opiates but then after the first day he broke the pill into 's and took a piece at a time he hated the way it tasted even though they try to make the pill not taste too bad since you're suppose to let it dissolve for a few minutes so he just would swallow the piece of the pill then later in the day if he felt like he was starting to feel that craving or withdrawal feeling he would take another piece but all in all since ive tooken painkillers as well i too have taken suboxone as well it does help alot and it really gets you thru the tough shitty times some people are anti medicine only natural spiritual things can help yeah that maybe so but to me some people like myself and husband need that extra kick in the butt and suboxone worked for us but of course this is just from our experience and im definitely no doctor if you're from the detroit mi area i know a doctor who prescribes them and helps people with this problem now if only his mom would get help but thats her choice i truly wish you the best of luck i hope this sorta helped in anyway go to this website for more information www suboxone com Kurt Cobain Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Milton H.
