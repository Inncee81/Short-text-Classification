in chinese does 'bi zui' translate to shut up because my freind said that but i speak and i thought it was 'bu yao shou hua' literally translating to 'do not take the action of talking' so i guess it's a mouthful but it sounds one hell of alot cooler than just bi zui lol so if you are fluent a native speaker help me out here which one would you use first sorry i know i can't put characthers up here that would probably help a ton but i guess i only know the pinyin for bizui any way so it wouldn't matter haha actually bi zui is much more informal than bu yao shuo hua bi zui you would usually use with friends or people you are familiar with in china if you tell someone to bi zui and you are not familiar with them they'll most likely be offended if you are trying to say please don't speak politely you can say qing bu yao shuo hua bi zui please stop talking hope this helps Chinese language Hakka (linguistics) Standard Mandarin Personages of the Three Kingdoms Gang of Four Shanghai China Hua Guofeng Mandarin (linguistics) Standard Cantonese Yao Ming Demographics of Taiwan Zhao Yun Taiwanese (linguistics) Zhuang Pinyin Cao Cao Chinese spoken language Hmong Wang Tao Ken Chu Korean language Written Cantonese Qingdao Names of China Wade-Giles Chinese name Chinese calendar The Legend of the Condor Heroes Hunan Taiwan Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China Taiwanese aborigines Qing Dynasty Hakka Confucius Jiang Qing Taoism Chiang Kai-shek History of the People's Republic of China Sun Yat-sen Guan Yu Cantonese (linguistics) Mid-Autumn Festival Greek language Japanese honorifics Communist Party of China Singlish Shit Xiongnu Romance of the Three Kingdoms Japanese language Kung fu Yin Shun Yiquan Emperor of China Singapore gay theatre Falun Gong Guqin Hongkonger African American Vernacular English Taiwan independence Huangshan Mountains Mainlander John Woo Hua Mulan Chinglish Other characters of Fullmetal Alchemist People's Republic of China Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China Jinyong Emperor Wu of Han Buddhism in China Political divisions of China Water Margin Chinese surname Esperanto as an international language Zhao Ziyang Vietnamese language Manchuria Republic of China Triad Chinese character Romanization Shaanxi Irish language Guangxi Languages of China History of China Manchu language Mao Zedong Confucianism Guangdong Dialects of Mandarin Warring States Period Russian joke
