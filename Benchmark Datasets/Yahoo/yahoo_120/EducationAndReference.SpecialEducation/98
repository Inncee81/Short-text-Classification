why are some autistic kids fixated on pleasuring themselves my neighbor is upset because her yo autistic son spends most of his time touching himself she thought it was a phase that he'd go through but that doesn't seem to be the case he's probably too weird and spastic to get a girlfriend she hopes he would what can she do should she look for a paid sex surrogate or something maybe some meds rebecca i don't think calling them retards is very nice people with autism have a tendency to stimulate themselves because their sensory systems are not wired the same way as a neurotypical person's are because autism is a spectrum disorder no two cases of autism are the same the autistic symptoms my year old daughter displays may be very different from someone else's year old son or year old nephew etc etc some individuals with autism are hypersensitive to things like bright lights loud noises scratchy fabrics etc while others may be impervious to pain or gain pleasure from rubbing a piece of fabric over and over again etc the repetitive behavior of spinning banging heads rocking flapping hands or yes even touching themselves brings comfort by calming their nerves that are inflamed by living in a world that is not built to accommodate their particular sensitivities and which they don't particularly even understand and let's face it having those parts touched and fondled is something that is pleasurable to just about all year old boys not just those with autism although he probably gains more than just sexual arousal from it the big question here is how to teach him that there is a time and a place for that type of behavior stimming behavior as those types of repetitive behaviors are called in the autism world is actually beneficial to helping those with autism to stay calm without it they'd probably be a lot more prone to extreme meltdowns than they already are so your neighbor just needs to teach her son when and where it's appropriate if she wants to say that it's only ok in his room with the door shut at bedtime then once he learns that's the rule he will follow it the rest of the time she needs to teach him a command word like hands or something like that that means hands need to be out of his pockets or on the table or something like that every time he goes back to the undesireable behavior say the command and remove his hands when he goes the whole day or the whole morning or whatever keep a chart without engaging in the inappropriate behavior he gets a reward gradually you can extend the length of time he has to go without engaging in the problematic behavior in order to achieve the desired reward maybe having an hour of alone time in his room each night can be the reward for abstaining from it all day this really is not all that unusual of a problem in the autism world i urge your neighbor to contact an autism support group to get some input from other parents who have faced similar problems also there are lots of books out there that address similar issues as well http www autism resources com nonfictiontopics adolescent html it's not the end of the world she'll teach him and he'll come around it just might take a while is all hope this helps Sensory Integration Dysfunction Autistic community Neurodiversity Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders Ethical challenges to autism treatment Autistic spectrum Gifted Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Autism epidemic Human sexual behavior Clinical depression Infantilism Drug addiction Pervasive developmental disorder Traumatic incident reduction Addiction Brain Milton H.
