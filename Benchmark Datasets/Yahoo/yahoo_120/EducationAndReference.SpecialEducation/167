my son is autistic can you help us my name is ronit and i am a mother of four children who i am raising by myself my youngest son elad was born december his early development was normal however when he was just over one year of age he started to regress he stopped talking cried a lot and stopped moving forward with his development soon after that elad was diagnosed with autism and the rollercoaster began autism is best described as a group of disorders with a similar pattern of behavior in three key areas communication social interaction and imaginative thought as a child with severe autism elad has difficulties with communication social development learning and behavior at present elad is not talking at all this makes his world very confusing frustrating and scary elad s lack of communication skills means that interacting and forming relationships with the people around him is very difficult and at times impossible i began to look into programs for my son i sought advice from a psychologist at autism victoria my son s pediatrician and read a great deal of information and research from around the world based on this research the general consensus from professionals in the field of autism is that aba applied behavioral analysis therapy is the most effective treatment program for children with autism evidence gathered that the best outcomes for children with autism are achieves by intensive early behavioural intervention recent studies have shown that quite dramatic and long lasting improvements can result aba is a treatment program focusing on the skills a child needs to be able to function successfully and to enjoy life to the fullest language social play academic and self help skills are all addressed aba is effective for children with autism as it teaches skills through a very structured program targeting the fact that such children do not learn naturally for the environment research indicates that the best outcomes for children with autism come from early and intensive intervention the new york state department of health has identified that for programs to be effective they must start early and include curriculum specifically designed for autism the intervention must be intensive a minimum of hours of one on one in other parts of the world including the usa uk and canada governments provide adequate funding for families to access early and intensive evidence based treatment they clearly recognise the importance of getting maximum and appropriate treatment at a very early age they know that if they don t provide this type of intensive intervention then the cost to the tax payer government of not treating those children in later life will be enormous autism and related conditions such as asperger syndrome and rhett's syndrome cost the australian community up to billion each year according to a new report on the economic impact of the disorder the report due to be released in brisbane today at the start of autism awareness week analyses healthcare costs education social services unemployment and informal care related to people with autism unemployment of people with autism was the greatest burden at an estimated billion a year autism spectrum disorders which affect one in australians are characterized by impaired social activity communication and imagination an estimated australian children suffer from the conditions synergy economic consulting which prepared the report for the autism early intervention outcomes unit described its modeling as conservative the report recommends greater investment in early intervention strategies that maximize the capabilities of people with autism if this improves education and employment outcomes for even a small number of people the benefits via reduction in costs and improvements in quality of life outcomes will be sizeable the report says in the federal government released a report entitled a review of the research to identify the most effective models of practice in early intervention of children with autism spectrum disorders which concluded to be successful early intervention needs to be extensive and intensive a minimum of hours a week over two or more years is essential for young children to make major gains unfortunately the australian and victorian governments do not fund early intensive therapy without the intensive therapy i might lose my son forever what other condition affects thousand australian children and their families costs the community billion per annum and receives little or no federal government funding i trust you will be happy to know that thanks to the help from some wonderful people organizations elad started his aba therapy on june he is doing very well learning new ways to communicate and express his needs which reduces his stress level it is really great for me to see that there is a hope for a better future for my son we still have so much more to accomplish at the moment elad is getting hours of therapy a week for the amount of per week my only source of income is centerlink payments allowance these payments do not adequately cover our daily living costs never mind the additional financial burden of my son s ongoing therapy and medical costs i am extremely worried about how i will be able to go on and support my children we desperately need a lot of financial support if you reside in the us you can call your local social security office and ask them to send you an application for supplemental security income ssi since autism is a life long disability states also offer insurance for children based on your income like for fl it covers doctors visits prescriptions and dental if or older my sons are covered through the state i pay for primary care visits for specialty care such as therapy for prescriptions and for er i too have a son who has autism i'm very grateful to have this coverage for my kids there's also the women's infants and children program wic in which they will give you checks per month for certain types of foods such as milk formula peanut butter tuna dried beans cheese eggs and a few other items you can apply for a medical government grant just as long you use the money for what it's intended for you don't have to pay it back some companies offers grants to people to help cover medical costs or medical equipment may look into area autism help support groups good luck
