my daughter is being forced to take a math class that is way above her head what can i do she's diagnosed with mild mental retardation and is in the california public school system she has to take an algebra class and she is barely able to understand multiplication and division i don't want her in this class and want her to continue to focus the division and multiplication and move on from there once she grasps that has anyone been in this situation and can give me a better understanding of why the school wants her to continue this algebra and fail her final grade last year was a d it was so sad because she tried so hard to understand it she'll be starting her sophomore year in hs i have asked the school for a tutor in the class room that is dedicated to her and maybe just a few other kids they have a tutor but he's dedicated to the whole class it is a special ed math class but it seems my daughter is one of the ones who just can't grasp it i do work with her at home also math is just the hardest thing for her to understand also does anyone know what my daughter's rights are concerning a tutor wow sorry that's happening here is a link to the ca board of ed parents' rights for students with disabilities i can tell you having previously lived there how hard you're going to have to fight this is going to depend on your district you may have quite the fight ahead of you http www cde ca gov sp se fp index asp the school could have any number of reasons for wanting her to continue my guess is it could have something to do with the nclb regs algebra requires a lot of abstract reasoning skills something that your daughter just may not have yet if she's still working on mastery with multiplication and division she may not have a strong grasp of variables fractions percentages ratios or decimals all of which are necessary for success in algebra here's a link that explains most likely why they are pushing her into algebra ca has determined that all students including disabled students are fully able to grasp algebraic coursework and need it in order to graduate they have apparently decided that remedial coursework for disabled students is a hindrance rather than a benefit to them so it isn't to be offered however it does state that disabled kids are to be taught in alternate ways making algebra more concrete with manipulatives calculators activities etc to make it more accessible to them this is a requirement according to the site your daughter should have the right to an iep that allows her to take the class in an alternate way http www cde ca gov sp se fp algebra asp hopefully it will be an easier road but from what you've said they haven't been terribly helpful hopefully this info will help No Child Left Behind Act GED Education in the United States Mathematics Graduate school Grade (education) Education in Romania Stuyvesant High School Homeschooling Education in Australia Master's degree Milton H.
