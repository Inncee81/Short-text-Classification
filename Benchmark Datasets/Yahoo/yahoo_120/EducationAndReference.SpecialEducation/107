when talking to a deaf person with an asl translator do you look at the deaf person or the translator the question just happened to cross my mind i was just wondering whether it would be more proper to look at the translator while you talk or the deaf person when talking with a deaf person who uses an asl translator always look at the deaf person and 'ignore' the translator entirely i know that may sound 'rude' but it's the way both the deaf person and the translator like it best the translator is there for you as much as for the deaf person and the deaf person must pay some attention to the translator but you should only pay attention to the deaf person thank you for asking this question by the way this is not just for 'deaf people' either by the way it's the way all translators prefer to work American Sign Language Hearing impairment Deaf culture Deaf Signing Exact English Manually Coded English Second language acquisition Auslan Sign language British Sign Language Martha's Vineyard Sign Language Models of deafness Tactile signing Nicaraguan Sign Language Political correctness Milton H.
