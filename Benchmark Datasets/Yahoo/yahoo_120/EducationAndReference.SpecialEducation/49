why do the handicapped have such a hard time finding a mate does this make the saying beauty is only skin deep meaningless i know so many good hearted autistic and cp people who can't find a partner just because of their disability does this prove how shallow and disgusting the general public is island monkey thanks for your example this is exactly wat i'm talking about people are disgusting aren't they no one can deny this i don't think it proves how disgusting and shallow the public is honestly look inside yourself and ask yourself would you date someone whom you find unattractive there has to be some kind of spark to get the chemistry and conversation flowing i am not suggesting that all disabled people are ugly many of them are beautiful people but there are many whom let's face it don't look or act normal it is very sad and i do have sympathy that they cannot find a mate it is heartbreaking but i also understand why a normal unhandicapped human would not want to date someone with a handicap to not understand this would also be shallow i know we have all heard the saying survival of the fittest it is nature's way of preserving our genepool we don't want people who have severe handicaps reproducing and passing on the defective genes this is just nature it is why the strongest male elk or deer who wins the fight gets to breed with the females for example human heart defects they are rare babies with severe heart defects cannot live long in nature therefore cannot reproduce spreading the bad gene that is why heart defects are so rare and why most people live long lives they are becoming more common than they used to b c technology has now the ability to fix these defects and more people with heart defects are reproducing now more heart defects are surfacing as a result imagine if our genepool was corrupt and the doctor told you that you have a in chance of having an autistic or severe cp child or one with a severe heart defect would you want to get pregnant i know a couple that went to genetic counseling after having a two children that are expected to die early b c they have cystic fibrosis the doc told them they have a one in four chance of having another one with it a chance that it would not have the disease but would be a carrier and a chance that it would not have the disease and would not be a carrier they are already going to lose two children they decided not to have another child they could not put themselves and another kid through this heartache it is a sad but true fact of life i don't think people are knowingly shallow humans have a great ability to help one another out many people would do anything they could to help a handicapped person but there is just something instinctively that makes many people unattracted to them sexually it is the instinctive part that tries to keep our genepool stable Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cystic fibrosis Genetic disorder Theory of conduct Abortion debate Species Cephalic disorder Eugenics Hearing impairment Mental retardation Haemophilia Spina bifida Controversies in autism Asperger syndrome Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Evolution Genetically modified organism Extinction Sexual attraction Urinary incontinence Sexual selection Cancer Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Autism rights movement Acne Turner syndrome Sickle-cell disease Equine conformation Duchenne muscular dystrophy Autistic community Prenatal diagnosis Mental illness Tocopherol God Emperor of Dune Heterozygote advantage Left-handed Thalassemia Nietzschean Incest Stroke Sexual dimorphism Senescence Human cloning The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Human sexual behavior Infantilism Empathy Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus X chromosome Congenital disorder Human nature Altruism Dragons (Pern) Color blindness Kakapo The Origin of Species Gender role Human variability Autism epidemic Human skin color Physical attractiveness K' Price equation Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dog Congenital adrenal hyperplasia House Mouse Ontological argument Genetics The End of the World (Doctor Who) Reproduction Down syndrome Liger Irreducible complexity Neurodiversity One Tree Hill (TV series) Theodicy Human Bene Gesserit Meaning of life Spider Humphrey Bogart Ethical challenges to autism treatment Cholera Jon Secada Vitamin C Organ transplant Cerebral palsy Recessive gene Plame affair Y chromosome Love
