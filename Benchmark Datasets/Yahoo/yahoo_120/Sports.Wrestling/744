micky james the jobber why why is she loosing night after night if i were vince the title would revolve around micky and beth phoenix they are the best of the womans circuit hands down while alot of them are to be congratulated for their improvement and thanked for being women and still putting their hot bodies on the line for our entertainment the whole womens title picture is out of whack lol you still got it gaylord no lk i actually didnt like the pudding match im not a big fan of gimmicky matches like that cmon now im a gentleman we cant like absurdities like pudding matches it doesnt showcase any talent and you being a woman with an im guessing illustrious career should agree with me the divas are eye candy bill micky james is eye fillet mignon lk you forgot good looking jk lol hey hollywhizzle lol i love the name you're right mickie is the best diva in the wwe at the moment and she's getting treated like crap beth is amazing she's got real talent and her she's got strength why not make it a fatal four way feud between candice vs melina vs beth vs mickie they haven't had a fatal four way match or triple threat match for the women's title for ages i was waiting for the time when beth returned because i knew that she and mickie were going feud remember their feud last year when trish brought beth to the wwe and beth interfered in mickie's match well i thought for sure they would feud eventually it will happen no doubt about it since mickie turned face wwe had no choice but to make beth heel which is the way i like it all the divas are beautiful well most of them but mickie and beth have got the talent also victoria but she's on sd which was a really bad idea when they did the draft i miss the days when they had battle royals for the women's title and when they had triple threats etc now all they have is one on one matches which are still good but only if they can wrestle properly and they had the 'pudding match ' now hollywhizzle i know you might like the divas in pudding right but we need real talent i mean anyone could get in a bikini and jump around in pudding but not everyone can do widow's peak mickie dt stratisfaction moonsault etc wwe needs to realise what they are doing vince just picks the divas for their looks which i really really really hate it does bring ratings because the guys want to see them obviously but it's just not fair for us girls i want to see the divas beat the hell out of eachother and that's what i call entertainment mickie and beth having amazing talent and them being beautiful in their own ways is just a bonus but vince obviously doesn't realise that great point you made there starred lol i can't get over what gaylord said that's some funny sh t right there hollywhizzle you are in a million i am glad you didn't like teh pudding match and yeah i sure can agree with you it doesn't showcase any talent at all that's why i respect you so much because you know real talent and you respect the divas illustrious career awww thank you so much you are truely a gentleman Shawn Michaels Mark Calaway Professional wrestling slang Chris Jericho Vince McMahon Glen Jacobs The Rock (entertainer) World Wrestling Entertainment Candice Michelle Amy Dumas Eddie Guerrero Chris Benoit Extreme Championship Wrestling Paul Wight Ashley Massaro Hulk Hogan Stacy Keibler World Championship Wrestling Jason Reso WWE RAW Professional wrestling match types Bret Hart Matt Hardy Randy Orton David Bautista Taboo Tuesday WWE Judgment Day Montreal Screwjob WWE No Mercy Professional wrestling aerial techniques WWE Armageddon Leon White Ric Flair Mick Foley NWo John Layfield Professional wrestling attacks Jacqueline Moore Eric Bischoff Professional wrestling Randy Savage BG James The Great American Bash Page Falkenberg Booker Huffman The Invasion Diva (professional wrestling) WrestleMania XX Stephanie McMahon-Levesque Brock Lesnar EastEnders Torrie Wilson WWE Vengeance Christy Hemme Professional wrestling throws Nelson Frazier, Jr. SummerSlam Noreen Greenwald Yoshihiro Tajiri Andr__ the Giant McMahon-Helmsley Faction Greg Valentine Warrior (wrestler) Four Horsemen (professional wrestling) WWE Championship Solofa Fatu Andrew Martin WCW Monday Nitro Shane McMahon WWE Unforgiven Sharmell Sullivan A.J.
