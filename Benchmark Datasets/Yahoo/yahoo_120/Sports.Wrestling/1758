why does tna have low ratings not bashing tna just wondering i mean on wwe's worst day they still get higher ratings than tna also i noticed they have or are trying to make batista and john cena the next austin and rock they're the two main stars but the only problem with that is they aren't pushing anybody up to try to meet their status if they were to push more stars to meet their level and they were to be defeated more than once a year sarcasm would that change your views of those two as always when the promotion gets started it has to build remmeber wwe wwf has been around for years and at the start wasn't to well thought of as we know from all the ufc people that still bash it today the mcmahons worked hard to get to where they are in sports entertainmant and i expect that as tna hires new talents and develops there story line and advertising they will climb up the ranks the sided ring is different and takes some getting used too as well as a few other things the belt divisions for one but wasnt all that long ago they didnt even have a tv format you could only see them on ppv and they had to use bigger name guys to draw people to order so slowly but surley there climbing the sports entertainmant ladder nwa wcw vs wwf wwe see it comes and goes but theyve come along way already and i expect from all the talk about them on here that they are gaining more fan suport every year then can do more house shows around the world and get bigger ratings rome wwe wasn't built in a day World Championship Wrestling World Wrestling Entertainment Vince McMahon NWo Eddie Guerrero WWE Championship Shawn Michaels Mark Calaway John Layfield Kurt Angle Total Nonstop Action Wrestling Scott Levy Eric Bischoff Extreme Championship Wrestling Chris Jericho Ric Flair World Heavyweight Championship Paul Levesque The Great American Bash WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
