why do cena fans think cena haters are jealous of cena all i see is oh your just jealous because your favorite wrestler hasn't been champion as long wow yeah thats why i dislike cena not i dislike cena because he always 'overcomes the odds' i saw some say that if orton was champ for as long as cena was every wud hate him to well i got letters for you j b l i don't remember any being mad when he was champion for that long it's not the fact that cena has been champion forever mainly it's just it's the same thing to expect cena gets the shit kicked out of him until the ppv then he 'some how' wins another thing that i don't like about cena is because he is only champ because of little kids and girls buying all of his merchandise that shows that wwe only cares about the money but little kids teenage girls and new wwe fans eat it all up anyways wrestling question i guess whats the chances of batista losing at summerslam hey i'm a teenage girl and definately not obsessing over cena i really don't see why people make a big deal about liking him or disliking him either way people still talk about him and he'll continue to be famous for years to come do i like knowing that fact not exactly there's alot of other great wrestlers who don't get the attention they deserve because it's all be absorbed by no other john cena John Cena Eddie Guerrero Shawn Michaels John Layfield Stone Cold Steve Austin WrestleMania XX Carly Colon Kurt Angle Hulk Hogan Paul Levesque David Bautista Bret Hart WWE RAW World Heavyweight Championship Taboo Tuesday Evolution (professional wrestling) Mark Calaway Adam Copeland World Wrestling Entertainment Glen Jacobs WWE Championship WrestleMania 21 Randy Orton Extreme Championship Wrestling SummerSlam WWE Draft Mick Foley WWE No Mercy Jason Reso Music in professional wrestling Mark Copani Royal Rumble WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
