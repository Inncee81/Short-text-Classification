if u think jericho needs to come back star this question and also which brand would u want him to be on i do think he needs to come back he's one of my all time favorites and i've been wanting him to return for a while if he returns i think he should go to smackdown because they really need some help there because they have so many superstars out on injuries and on raw there are already too many main eventers John Cena Kurt Angle WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
