can a diva take a regular sized guy not like someone in the wwe but your average joe lol jeff be my guest lol cmon now this is a serious question you pervos gary v thats exactly what im saying i dont think many guys would want to street fight a woman no matter how strong she is its just not right you know i just mean in a wrestling match nothing profane or explicit or sexual just a straight up professional bout dead survivor you rock the freebirds are one of my fav tag teams of all time aww diva thats cute the way you stick up for your little friend i agree that in fact a diva could take a regular guy but im a little bigger than the avg guy so no your friend has never could never and will never beat me hell you can be her tag partner if you want joking or serious im not scared either way lk yawn i respect you too but a double submission hold how pray tell do you think you are going to apply it you think im just going to let you think again lol what was that you said about me as intimidating as a basket of puppies hey you better watch what you're saying hollywood lol diva i love ya me and you can defiantly kick some hollywood ss hehe but ummmmm lets get back to the point of coarse a diva can take a regular sized guy as i said before it's not the size it's the experience some people think gilrs are weak and that they don't belong in the wrestling sport and they say that it's a man sport that really pisses me off diva's can do just about anything that an ordinary guy can do if not more ok i do have a big ego and i'm sure you have noticed lol but when i say this i mean it i think i can beat most guys in a wrestling match lol the divas in the wwe are too skinny and some don't have any wrestling ability as good as a wrestler as mickie is she's just too small btw i'm a huge mickie fan so i'm not teasing her or anything like that i think beth and victoria could take on a regular guy and chyna would just destroy them lol ummm so yeah diva's can take on a regular sized guy and that's the bottom line coz legend killer pac ofc kfc said so yeah i said it and me and diva would put you in a combined submision move and you'll be tapping with both hands lol jokes you know i respect you hollywood starred diva legend killer pac ofc kfc and heart break gal diva dominators lol oh god hollywood you have so much to learn diva sending all my australian love lol ok so it doesn't sound as catchy as london love but hey it's a great deal of love for you diva and hollywood when you said you think im just going to let you lol do you actually think you have a chance in stopping us lol diva will lock in the sharpshooter i will lock in the crossface and you you will be tapping both hands oh and about your question yawn lol jokes Professional wrestling slang Shawn Michaels Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Trish Stratus Eddie Guerrero Stone Cold Steve Austin Professional wrestling throws Chris Benoit Bret Hart Glen Jacobs Extreme Championship Wrestling Professional wrestling Mark Calaway Paul Levesque The Rock (entertainer) World Wrestling Entertainment Lisa Marie Varon Amy Dumas Professional wrestling aerial techniques Hulk Hogan NWo Chris Jericho Humphrey Bogart Bob Backlund WWE Unforgiven WrestleMania XX World Championship Wrestling Mick Foley John Cena Mixed martial arts Greg Valentine Paul Wight A.J.
