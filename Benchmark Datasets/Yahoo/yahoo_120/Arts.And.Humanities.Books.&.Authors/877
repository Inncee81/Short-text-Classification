calling all in the middle of publishing novels people if you may have any info from answerers you can put it here to share with everyone else including me there might be stuff already said but i still appreciate it nick i post this answer all the time don't you believe it i promise you this answer is totally true i am always in the middle of publishing a novel your book has to be edited for that you need to hire a professional editor to take your manuscript and hone it so it is in marketable shape that means far more than just checking your punctuation and spell checking it means making margin notes with regards to things like the pacing of your story the style description character study etc unfortunately most of the novice writers who come to this forum feel they have no need for editors they think they can spell check themselves and that they write well enough to forego a professional edit that is a huge mistake there has only been one author in history who wrote without the use of an editor and that was o henry so unless you are turning out work the quality of the gift of the magi and i assure you none of us are you need an editor confidence in your abilities is good overconfidence is professional suicide those who choose to skip over the editor part will learn that lesson the hard way when the rejection letters start rolling in and just don't stop their loss have your work edited many think that the book gets edited by the publisher that is only partially true the publisher does have the right to re edit it but unless the book is in a marketable form first it won't get to a publisher hence you need an editor first you are inexperienced editors have the experience you need to get your book in shape so it will sell then you can either use writers market which you can buy for dollars or literary marketplace use it at the library's reference section it costs a year and seek out agents or small publishers who are seeking works in your genre note you cannot get through to large a list publishers directly only a list agents can they do not accept unsolicited submissions when you have found a couple that interest you research them google the hell out of the name start with preditors and editors site and absolute write water cooler bewares and background checks forum for any information on the publisher agent there are a lot of fakes frauds and companies on the brink of bankruptcy out there when writers have been hassled by a publisher agent we write about it you will find information in these forums involving other writers issues with the publisher agent if so find others and steer yourself away from problems what you send first is a query letter and synopsis each agent and publisher has their own set of submission guidelines and they must be followed to the letter you will get rejected if you do not submit properly you never ever send a manuscript first just the query you have to learn to have a hide as tough as a herd of elephants because you will get rejections it's the nature of the beast gone with the wind got just send out another letter to another agent or publisher and try again eventually when you get a bite they will ask to see either a full or partial manuscript and a book proposal that is a very specific document you can get books on how to write one this is one of the ways using a professional editor comes in handy they will also be able to work with you on your book proposal that is the document your agent will use to sell your book to a publisher an editor knows how to prepare and sell a book they know what sells they cost money but it costs money to make money but it's extremely worth it it will take a good book and turn it into a great book very few of the overconfident wanna be authors here even know what a book proposal even looks like let alone how to write one then you wait again there is a lot of waiting involved while you wait you keep writing and working on a new book if you wind up not getting any bites on your first novel try another one very often an author has one or two books they never sold consider them practice novels you can also go to resolved questions and search keywords publisher and publishing there are a lot of answers here some good some not so good but they are good to print out and study you have to learn to advocate for yourself the more you learn the better off you are good luck pax c Peer review Publishing Search engine optimization A Course In Miracles Open Directory Project Infantilism On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Legal
