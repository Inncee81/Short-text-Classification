why do adults read harry potter it's intended for kids and no one over the age of the characters in the books are kids well it has been what like ten years since book came out a lot of people were when book one came out and have continued enjoying even now when they're nearly i personally think that the more recent books are pretty mature but agree that a lot of harry potter's popularity is due to wanting to escape into that world otherwise why would you see so many people dressing up and wanting to buy fake wands and harry potter candy and the like Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter (character) Treehouse of Horror XII Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Sirius Black Magic (Harry Potter) J.
