do you believe those that say that harry potter is a form of escapism some people believe that reading harry potter lures the reader into an escapist world something that causes us to lose our touch with reality i personally strongly disagree with this doesn't this make it the same as reading any fantasy fiction book why is it that only harry potter is targeted in this respect popularity is it wrong that adults also find the series appealing and they too enjoy the fantasy does the fact that we read harry potter necessarily mean that we are only concerned with the fantastical world that has been created and that we don't bother about what's going on around us in reality i think not comments reading harry potter and being manic about it would not necessarily cause you to lose touch with reality unless you're an escapist to begin with it's fiction like any other fictional works out there if those that say it is a form of escapism do they watch movies and tv series they're fictional do they lose touch with reality it's just that harry potter became hugely popular that it's inevitable that it would be targeted with such baseless arguments some people just hate other people's success and happiness would sourgrape and try with all their might to pull it down my husband and i have read all the books and for a week weeks at the most that would be the subject of our conversations the interest dies down on its own we have kids to feed and care for jobs to attend to bills to pay we enjoy reading not just harry potter but it's just reading enjoyment something to do to pass boredom when we ran out of books to read we pull the books from the shelves again the only escapist period i get is the first hours when i first read the books nothing could disturb me unless i say so like going to the bathroom eating and having a drink don't mind the sourgrapes darling enjoy the books and the experience we're one with you Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter Hermione Granger J.
