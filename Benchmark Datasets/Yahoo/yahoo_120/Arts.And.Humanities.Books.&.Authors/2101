do you have to hire an editor before you get an agent to read your book i'm confused i've read that the literary agent acts as an editor these days that if your book is in such bad shape with grammar and typos and format whatever they won't touch it but then on yahoo answers i read someone talking about you having to hire an editor to edit your book before you even get to the point of trying to find an agent so i'm confused i know hiring an editor will cost you money cause you are hiring someone do bestselling authors pay editors before the agent gets their newest book i thought writing should pay you and stuff bah i'm so confused no you don't have to hire an editor if you are really bad at grammar and just the general rules of the english language perhaps writing isn't for you to begin with if you are lucky you might have a friend who is really good at english and enjoys what you write who might proofread and comment on what you have written this is what we do in my college english courses i'm often emailed to critique other classmates papers because all they are getting is fluffy comments from other classmates looking to make a few extra credit points i read them looking for flaws tearing it apart but helping them put it back together but i digress no you don't have to hire an editor but if you get rejected by every agent you query you might consider the option in some way shape or form A Tale of a Tub English grammar Publishing Anne Rice Theory of conduct Wheel of Fortune Style guide House of Leaves Oxford English Dictionary Editor Plame affair Theodicy The Apprentice 2 Contract H2G2 Social rule Peer review Finnish language Esperanto as an international language Avenue Q Philosophical Investigations The Catcher in the Rye Sydney Riot of 1879 The Lovely Bones Screenwriting Singlish Karl Rove Poker jargon Ann Coulter Frank Herbert Robertson Davies XML Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Outsourcing Great Teacher Onizuka Noam Chomsky American and British English differences Homestar Runner Slashdot trolling phenomena Thomas Chatterton African American literature Literature Documentary hypothesis Neil Gaiman J.
