is jk rowling really writing a 'wizarding world encyclopedia' as i was cut off from the internet for a month i haven't heard anything of it is it true i thought she was writing another novel for adults or something i watched an interview with her on dateline the other night she said that she doesn't think she'll be publishing for awhile she wants to enjoy writing without having a deadline she has no idea what her next book is going to be about and she didn't purposely leave the end of harry potter open so that she would be able to write more she actually wanted to give the book closure so no i don't think she'll be writing an encyclopedia i'm sure another author will have you ever read any of those what happens in harry potter books other authors write books based off of her world J.
