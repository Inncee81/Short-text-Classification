harry potter book question spoilers ok so my only question was this harry told valdermort that the reason why his wand was not working was because harry was the right ful owner however he said it was because he disarmed malfoy so there for that wand should be his but how did malfoy get it from dumbledore i can not for the life of me remeber because malfoy disarmed dumbledore on the night he was killed in half blood prince simply disarming the current owner of the elder wand no matter what wand they're using at the moment transfers ownership of the wand to the disarmer since harry disarmed malfoy at malfoy manor the ownership of the wand then transferred to him Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Dates in Harry Potter Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Albus Dumbledore Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Ron Weasley Draco Malfoy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Diagon Alley Harry Potter: Book Seven Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Death Eater Harry Potter (character) Rubeus Hagrid Battle of Hogwarts Ginny Weasley Bellatrix Lestrange Minor Hufflepuffs Minor Ravenclaws Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Horace Slughorn Weasley family Lucius Malfoy Unbreakable Vow Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Nymphadora Tonks Rita Skeeter Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Minor characters associated with Quidditch Hogwarts Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) Kreacher Fred and George Weasley Sirius Black House-elf Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Dumbledore's Army Regulus Black Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Minor Slytherins Cedric Diggory Fawkes Dobby Pansy Parkinson Horcrux Wizarding world Neville Longbottom Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) Money in Harry Potter R.A.B.
