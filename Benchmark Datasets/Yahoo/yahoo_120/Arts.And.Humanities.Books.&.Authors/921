is this a good story so far this morning was going to be dreadful i thought i dressed in my usual black i grabbed the first black shirt i saw same as the pants i snatched my boots from my closet i grabbed my phone attached it to my pants hey jason called for me from his phone i grabbed it hey i m almost ready ill meet you at the office i told him now hurrying i quickly brushed my teeth ran the brush threw my hair skipping breakfast i got into my car pushing my foot harder on the gas pedal urging the sleek car to go faster i got to the office in the nick of time jason meet me out there with kirk right behind him we have a new case for you kirk informed me jason gave him a cold stare what kirk asked him jason just shook his head anyways you need to enroll in this high school today and try to find out as much as you can about aden and felix derson he finished i stepped out of the car why i asked looking up at jason as did kirk i didn't like it i can just hope you don't take offense with that and give you some pointers first the opening is very bland you need something to hook the reader the first line doesn't act like a hook because you're directly telling us that 'the morning will be dreadful' that's where 'show don't tell' would be useful and 'usual black' doesn't mean anything that leaves the sentence hanging and leaves us asking 'a black what ' you haven't yet grasped the basics of grammar and punctuation i recommend you read strunk and white it's the only writing guide you can really trust here's a link http www tothegame com screenshot asp id too many of your sentences are subject first for the opening paragraph that means everything starts out with an 'i he she or a person's name' this always becomes repetitive very quickly vary your sentence structure when ever a speech tag she said he said follows dialog the quotation should end with a comma and the next word outside should not be capitalized unless the word needs be the following is correct hello john said mary the following is incorrect hello john said mary this applies for all punctuation points hello john said mary what are you doing asked john make a new paragraph for every new speaker like so what time is it john said around ten o clock mary replied john set his watch to the correct time thank you now i won't be late you're welcome you've also got a lot of spelling mistakes never tell us obvious things like above you said 'he finished' after he spoke but it's obvious he finished because he stopped talking at that point reading through all of it i can't say much about the plot but this segment tells us nothing if this is a long story then this is incredibly rushed it's even rushed for a short story Shaggy dog story The Inside Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Singlish English grammar Quotation mark Theory of conduct Escape from New York Hiberno-English Aerial (dance move) Non-native pronunciations of English Little Britain The Shining (film) Plame affair Time Out of Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Avenue Q Russian joke Grandview, U.S.A.
