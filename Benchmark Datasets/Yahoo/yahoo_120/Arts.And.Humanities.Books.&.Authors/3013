how long does the crucio curse have to be used before it has a permanent effect i know this is kind of a wierd question but in the th book voldemort holds ollivander hostage for months and it doesn't seem to have any permanent effect on him hi i think it depends not only on how long but how strong the curse is voldemort wanted to torture ollivander not to kill him because he still could help him answer so many questions about the elder wand and wandlord itself he was still of use to voldemort on the other hand voldemort tortured people wanting them to die after he sucked all the good and pain out of them he'd just do the avada kedavra course and kill them straight away now bellatrix on the other hand tortured the longbottoms for fun sure at the start she wanted information but at the end she just got carried away now the crucio does not have a permanent effect on them they are not to be left in pain permanently but a permanent consecuence they lost their minds and everything else they are just not who they were anymore it is very important to difference this also i think it depends on who is receiving the curse and who is giving it i think a powerful wizard can hold strong even though being jinxed that an unprepared one i mean neville's parents where strong enough to be in the order they could take a lot on the other hand if start a crucio curse on a year old i think he wouldn't last minutes remember that to give it you also have to mean it harry uses this on book towards bellatrix because he's mad she killed sirius but the curse barely sends enough to be hold this is because deep down harry did not have the heart to do it back then this counts too goodluck Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Lord Voldemort Dates in Harry Potter Blood purity (Harry Potter) Death Eater Harry Potter (character) Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Harry Potter: Book Seven Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Albus Dumbledore Order of the Phoenix Sirius Black Battle of Hogwarts Peter Pettigrew Hogwarts subjects Sybill Trelawney Ron Weasley Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Ginny Weasley Horcrux Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) James and Lily Potter Azkaban Hogwarts Houses Remus Lupin R.A.B.
