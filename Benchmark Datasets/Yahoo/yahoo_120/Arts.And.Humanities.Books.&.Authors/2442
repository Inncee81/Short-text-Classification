so what happened to harry potter's grandparents the books make a big deal out of the fact that the dursleys are his only living relatives and we know what happened to his parents but what about his grandparents sirius mentions in the fifth book that he moved out of his parents' house when he was and moved in with the potters james and lily were in their early s when they had harry it's unlikely that james's parents passed away from old age where did they go in that short timespan between and early s and assuming the potters were killed in the mess with voldermort what about lily's parents they were muggles they wouldn't have been affected by the war in the magical world i'm surprised that a book with so much emphasis on parentage orphaned boys that also has so much emphasis on the similarities between harry and james would leave out a detail like that james's parents were old when they had james so yes they did die of old age even if it does't sound likely and lily's parents died natural deaths there wasn't any violence with the gradparents i found this on wikipedia what is known about lily and james's parents is a statement from an interview that petunia and lily's parents normal muggle death james's parents were elderly were getting on a little when he was born which explains the only child very pampered had him late in life so he's an extra treasure as often happens i think they were old in wizarding terms and they died they succumbed to a wizarding illness Blood purity (Harry Potter) Relatives of Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) James and Lily Potter Dates in Harry Potter Dursley family Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Lord Voldemort Severus Snape Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter Sirius Black Ron Weasley Magic (Harry Potter) Magical objects in Harry Potter Weasley family Wizarding world Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Diagon Alley J.
