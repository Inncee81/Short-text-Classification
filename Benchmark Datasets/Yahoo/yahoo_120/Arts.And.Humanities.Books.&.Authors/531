would you consider cyrano de bergerac the book a romantic or realistic piece of literature and why all opinions are welcome romantic cyrano was in love deeply in love with roxane however she was in love with christian cyrano would protect christian on the battlefield even though he was with the woman of his affection because he cared so deeply for her and wanted her to be happy the moment of irony when roxane believes she is speaking to christian on the balcony when she was really speaking to cyrano it's almost too poignant to put into words i would definately say it was romantic due to the style era of the book not only that but the concepts of love and war are concepts that are generally used in romantic writing Cyrano de Bergerac Romantic music French literature of the 17th century Dark Ages Love Novel Eastern Orthodox Church Sexual orientation Classical music era Objectivist philosophy Reality Postmodernism Dragon Booster Nazism Unrequited love New Testament History of science fiction English literature Magic (paranormal) Humphrey Bogart Same-sex marriage Richard Wagner John Wesley Polyamory Romanticism Irony The Amber Spyglass God Simone Weil Diadochi Hell Edmond Rostand Nonviolence InuYasha (character) Friedrich Schleiermacher Socrates Leo Tolstoy Bible Cosmic Era list of characters United Methodist Church Johann Gottfried Herder Christian eschatology Shakespeare's reputation Book of Daniel French literature of the 19th century Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Joke Kitsch Brave New World Shaw Festival Jewish principles of faith Torah Laura Schlessinger Immaculate Conception Ye Shengtao Origen Biblical inerrancy Culture of the United States Dynasty (TV series) Romantic nationalism Anglo-Saxon religion Book of Isaiah Marriage Michel Henry The Merchant of Venice Anthony Burgess Lolita Cool (song) Canadian literature Ayn Rand Sexuality in Christian demonology Saint David and Jonathan Derek Parfit Prayer in Christianity Victorian literature Church of Scotland Theory of conduct Adam Mickiewicz Halakha Literature Fictional character Iliad Portuguese literature Susan Ivanova John Howard Yoder Bertrand Russell 1990s in film Urantia Idolatry All Quiet on the Western Front History of literature Tamil people Friedrich Nietzsche Translation Oscar Wilde William Shakespeare Knight Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief
