i just read the book uglies and i love it can anyone recommend anything similar it's a social commentary projected into the future like gattaca or the island in the movies i love stories of that nature exploring the what ifs of solutions to our problems and where they could lead i would enjoy reading more books like this or movies if you know of any more too yes i am going to read the rest of the series the pretties is the next one in the series i liked the uglies better though but it's really good too i also recommend the bar code tattoo by suzanne weyn it takes place in the future and everyone is getting the tattoo but kayla the main character dosen't want to get it also double idenity by margaret peterson haddix is really good it also takes place in the future and well i don't want to give the book away but it is really a page turner hard to put down it would be hard to explain without giving the book away you may also like the shadow children series also by magaret peterson haddix takes is about how in the future a couple can only have two children and rd children must be killed by the population police if found in hiding and to live as a rd child in higing your parents or someone must get you a fake id card and so the main characters in the book who are thrid children want to free all third children the giver takes place in the future and is based in a utopia um i didn't really like it but a lot of people do hope this helped Charmed Young adult literature Theory of conduct Neighbours Babylon 5 Days of our Lives Grand Theft Auto III The Giver Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Utopia AmigaOS Software engineering Memento (film) Phoebe Halliwell X Window System Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire Boba Fett Divorce Gattaca Robert A.
