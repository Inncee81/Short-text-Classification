sudden disinterest in my writing i fancy myself an author writing both fanfiction and my own novel but for the past couple of months i have just been totally disinterested i go to write and i just get bored really quickly i know this isn't just losing interest in writing altogether it is my favorite thing to do and i never want to give it up i still want to write all the time but when i get around to it i just can't bring myself to type anything what could this be by the way i'm still looking for some people to review what i have so far of my novel send me an e mail d wow welcome to my world this is totally natural if you think about it you probably experience it in other areas of life too sometimes you really feel like eating spaghetti other days the thought has no apepal to pick a bizarre example i think what might help you or at least what helps me is to find something you're really excited about writing sometimes that means taking a break from novels ongoing fanfiction because you feel so invested there try doing some writing exercises or a random short story or even some non fiction freelancing if you're interested in ideas you can check my blog http carynswark blogspot com and that's another idea to keep in the habit too btw blog whatever happens accept the slump and don't get too down on yourself it will pass Fan fiction Ernest Hemingway FanFiction.Net Anne Rice Social rule Ranma __ characters Daria Milton H.
