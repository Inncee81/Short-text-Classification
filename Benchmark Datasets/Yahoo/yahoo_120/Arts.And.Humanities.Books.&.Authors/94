i want to become a writer help i'm only right now but i've been been writing before i could actually write my parents used to write it for me i write everything stories poem songs but i don't like other people reading it and i hate having to read my work in front of the class anonymously and have mine be one of them but people know which one is mine because its usually the most interesting and best written and i hate it how can i overcome this fear i don't have enough room but in added details i'll write the beginning of my new story hey i shouted at a small black cat don't bite the chords she looked up at my and tipped her head slightly giving me that i'm innocent look and she jumped from a chair near me onto my shoulder and licked my chin i sighed and went back into my room and just as my foot touched the blue carpet the phone rang hello i'm calling to see if you'd like to sorry my parents aren't home i hung up the phone and continued into my room and sat down with the cat still on my shoulder i stroked her soft head and told it it was anything except bad luck and it purred in reply as she fell asleep i played with its foot and made her twitch and tried not to wake her up laughing that got boring fast and i fell asleep too this was my dream i was in a graveyard standing over my grandmother's grave crying and suddenly the ashes found its way out of the urn and past the dirt and into the air and someone not my grandmother formed from them it was a man i gave a confused look i actually just wrote that a little while ago it needs some editing but its a rough draft kind of start i can't choose a best answer everyone helped a lot thank you i'll leave it up to the voters definitely keep writing even if you aren't ready to share everything you write yet keep seperate notebooks one for work you don't mind sharing this probably will include final drafts of stories etc one for work that you aren't ready to share with people just yet rough drafts personal writing you could start a blog on blogspot com and write short stories poems songs etc give the blog address to close friends and family you don't mind sharing your work with this will make it easier for you to let people read and comment on your work because you won't be watching them do it nor will you know when your work is obviously good so when you read it aloud or let someone else read it remember that practice reading aloud in the mirror alone then read aloud to family then friends just keep practicing performing your work then you will eventually be more comfortable Shaggy dog story Time Out of Mind Tag Little Britain RuneScape quests The Amber Spyglass Aerial (dance move) Parsifal Milton H.
