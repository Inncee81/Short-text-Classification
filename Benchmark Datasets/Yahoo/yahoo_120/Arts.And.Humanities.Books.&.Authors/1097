do u think edward will turn bella into a vampire in eclipse ok this thing has really been bothering me i don't think she will be turned into a vampire in eclipse but i do think she will eventually be turned into one there were several times where i have wondered where is stephenie meyer going with this because really bella is the example of human and she is such a kluts if when she is turned into a vampire supposedly she is going to be graceful and a man eating monster bella also she will forget all or most of her human memories which would include falling for edward also charlie and renee which leads me to believe that he immunity to the vampire's special abilities will play into this somehow not in a bad way like she can't become a vampire but in an unexpected way Vampire Kain (Legacy of Kain) Buffy the Vampire Slayer The Life and Times of Juniper Lee The Vampire Chronicles Conker's Bad Fur Day BloodRayne Undead (Discworld) Dance of the Vampires Time Out of Mind Vampire Hunter D Castlevania: Lament of Innocence Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Series finale Vlad III Dracula Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Double bass Ghoul Nightmares (Buffy episode) Jim Steinman Buffy Summers Blade (comics) The Sims 2 Immortality Legacy of Kain Monster Force AVN Awards Mahou Sentai Magiranger Ravenloft domains Donovan Baine Treehouse of Horror IV The Queen of the Damned Kender Wario Angel (vampire) Alucard (Castlevania) Alaga__sia Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Can't Hardly Wait The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Werewolf Vampire lifestyle Tenchi Muyo!
