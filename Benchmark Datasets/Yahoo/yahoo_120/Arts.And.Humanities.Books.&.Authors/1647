harry potter ending questions spoilers spoiler alert ok so i just finished the last hp book and i am a little confused about a few things at the end what is the deal with voldemort killing harry and then harry killing voldemort i mean i understand that harry can't die when voldemort is still alive but at the same time when volemort dies isn't harry supposed to die with him as well 'one can't live while the other survives' i understand that lily's protection is still in voldemorts blood but that protects voldemort than too doesn't it and didn't that expire anyways im majorly confused even thou i re read ending twice how is malfoy the owner of the elder wand he never stole it from dumbledore or am i missing something so you have to kill the last owner to be the true master of elder's wand right so how the hell is grindewald still alive in his prison and dumbledore is the new owner also how did he win the duel if the elder wand was stronger than his own thanks voldemort made a serious mistake when he took harry's blood in essence he made himself akin to a horcrux for harry by taking harry's blood he can now touch harry but he also made it so that as long as he lives harry can choose whether to live or die should he be killed when harry met dumbledore at king's cross station which i see their meeting as being at a point between the mortal realm and the spirit realm a point where the near dead and the dead who have crossed over can meet dumbledore explained that voldemort's having harry's blood in him ties harry to life very much like voldemort's horcruxes do the same for him but harry had the choice to continue the fight or board a train as dumbledore put it in otherwords harry could choose to pass on into the spirit realm to truely die voldemort on the other hand required a piece of him to remain in the mortal realm to tie him to it that's why he was making his horcruxes even though his physical body is a piece of him it's not enough he needs a bit of his soul or blood that has been wrongly taken to reamain so he made horcruxes six intentional and an unintential seventh had harry managed to destroy the six intentional horcruxes voldemort could still have returned from the dead due to the fact that he harry was the unintentional horcrux but voldemort destroyed the horcrux when he killed harry so there was no longer a part of him in harry harry's blood could not tie him to the mortal realm after nagini the last horcrux to be destroyed was killed it was harry's not his malfoy did not have to steal the elder wand in order to become it's master and he was only it's master but never it's owner the night dumbledore died he disarmed him before dumbledore had the chance to fight him when dumbledore died as planned by himself and snape the wand's allegiance was given to the last person to defeat him that person was draco malfoy no see what i said above while throughout history most of it's new owners had killed the previous owner to become the wand's master the wand gives it's allegiance to the last person to defeat it's current master at the time gergorovitch seems to have been the wand's master at the time grindelwald stole it from him and grindelwald's stunning spell may have been how he defeated him dumbledore defeated grindelwald and the wand swore allegiance to him it doesn't matter that the elder wand is supposed to be the most powerful wand dumbledore was the more skilled dueler and most likely he either stunned or disarmed and stunned grindelwald in the end Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Ginny Weasley Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Hogwarts Sirius Black Lucius Malfoy Horace Slughorn Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Sybill Trelawney Kain (Legacy of Kain) Order of the Phoenix YuYu Hakusho Draco Malfoy Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books James and Lily Potter Bellatrix Lestrange Rubeus Hagrid R.A.B.
