harry potter i have read the books and i red the full summaries of can i read the th book without being confused thanx mr sunshine fag depending on how full the summaries where you may be able to but you may be unclear on something or not realize some important connections ie you may know that harry had occlumency lessons in book but the memories he saw by accident are connected to an event in the th book if you decide to read it i'm sure plenty of people would clarify anything you don't understand people who read the entire series still have questions but i recommend reading both the order of the phoenix and half blood prince the seventh book is of course based on them and the experience is much more suspensful if you read the entire series have fun whatever you decide to do Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Magic (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Occlumency Minor Hufflepuffs Magical objects in Harry Potter Hogwarts subjects Ginny Weasley Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter: Book Seven Minor Harry Potter Beasts Legilimency J.
