othello iago's motive in shakespeare's book othello the character iago causes lots of damage to all the other characters and this results in most of them dieing he never really shows any motives for his actions one of his possible motives is to get cassio's job as lieutenant or even othello's job as general but i do not think that this is reason enough to justify his actions another theory is that iago is gay and in love with othello and can not stand to see him married to desdemona but there is little in the book to suggest this can anyone give me their opinion as to why they think iago behaved in the way he did or at least their interpretation if i had to pick a single reason it would have to be iago was racist at one point he flat out states i hate the moor not i hate othello or this or that other thing to hate othello is to suggest iago simply dislikes the mans fame or decisions to hate the moor suggests iago has reduced othello to a social political and racial slot he doesn't even give him the dignity of a name that's not to say iago isn't angered by other matters but i think they can all be filtered through his racial hatred Othello Otello Shakespeare on screen Reputation Paradise Lost Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism William Shakespeare Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis Palpatine Theory of conduct David Hume Hate speech Paul Robeson Racism Homophobia O (film) Hate group Utilitarianism Alignment (role-playing games) Bertrand Russell Slander and libel Ranma __ characters Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith Causality Hate The Smoking Room British National Party Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Characters in the Southern Victory series Reversi Little Britain Nicomachean Ethics Rei Ayanami Characters in the Smurfs Hate crime Freedom of speech Economic inequality Nigger Augustan drama Lawrence v.
