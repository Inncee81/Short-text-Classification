sidney sheldon hw do you rate his book his earlier stuff without question is exceptional he has been criticized for not having enough depth but i think he writes kick ass suspense he has tight plotting you don't always see where it's going and his stories are original he's way better than dan brown try the otherside of midnight omg is it good i think girls like him better than guys cause he does write a good romance storyline in his books which you often don't see in books by men Tony Award for Best Musical Sidney Sheldon The Golden Ass What would Jesus do?
