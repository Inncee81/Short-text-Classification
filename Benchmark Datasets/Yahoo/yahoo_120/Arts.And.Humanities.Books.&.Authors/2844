where do wizards such as voldemort and dumbledore get their knowledge from after hogwarts wizards such as lucius mr weasley umbridge etc came from hogwarts and their magic isn't as grand as voldy and albus so where do they get their spells from do you have to go search for sepreme magic ex ppl say voldemort was a powerful wizard because he got outstanding on all his owl's well so did charlie bill percy weasley but ppl don't speak about their greatness do you have to win duels and kill ppl to be know as one of the greatest sorcerers in the world some wizards are just born with extraordinary talent in the sixth book pensieve dumbledore mentions how voldemort was able to channel his magic by the time most other wizards couldn't they could've also had more enthusiasm than other students like hermoine she knew more than the average student because she spent time in the library and was enthusiastic about her work voldemort likely was because he felt at home at hogwarts and had a special interest for magic voldemort also was keen in immortality he was new to the wizarding world and didn't understand why witches or wizards could die thus leading to his horcruxes they also could have traveled to places where foreign wizards dwell exchanging information about magic you don't have to be in school to learn after all we learn something new every day that probably also applies to riddle and dumbledore Hogwarts subjects Magic (Harry Potter) Ginny Weasley Horace Slughorn Harry Potter (character) Death Eater Ron Weasley Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Wizarding world Severus Snape Diagon Alley Rubeus Hagrid Horcrux Hermione Granger Order of the Phoenix Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Battle of Hogwarts Fred and George Weasley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Dumbledore's Army Harry Potter: Book Seven Tom Riddle's diary Draco Malfoy Sybill Trelawney Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year James and Lily Potter Lucius Malfoy Weasley family Sirius Black Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Minerva McGonagall Hogwarts Houses Rita Skeeter Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) Dark Art Percy Weasley Tom Riddle Minor Hogwarts teachers Wizard Minor characters associated with Quidditch Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Harry Potter Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Fawkes Minor Ravenclaws Dolores Umbridge Hogwarts Floor Directory Minor Hufflepuffs Professor Quirrell Neville Longbottom Minor Harry Potter Beasts R.A.B.
