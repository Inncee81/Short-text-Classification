page of half blood prince read the page did anyone remember that little scene with moaning myrtle as they read through the chapter sectumsempra i didn't but when i looked back through randomly i saw it moaning myrtle refers to malfoy as sensitive lonely and unafraid to show his feelings and cry i personally am fascinated with malfoy's mind structure and am glad rowling showed some of the human in him like that but how did other people react to that yeh its interesting because even though he and harry were enemies from the start malfoy is not completely evil like voldemort he couldnt bring himself to kill dumbledore and in book we did not see much of his nasty side because he was so petrified of voldemort and what he threatened to do to his family at least the malfoy family do love each other and thats why they had a change of heart towards the end of book but i still think its rather selfish because they only did so because their own family was in danger if it was anybody elses i doubt they would have saved them as long as the malfoys are safe thats all they care about Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Draco Malfoy Lord Voldemort Dates in Harry Potter Severus Snape Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Ginny Weasley Lucius Malfoy Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Tom Riddle's diary Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Hogwarts subjects Magical objects in Harry Potter Albus Dumbledore Weasley family Nymphadora Tonks Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter (character) Hermione Granger Minor Hufflepuffs Hogwarts Sirius Black Blood purity (Harry Potter) Harry Potter: Book Seven Rubeus Hagrid Rita Skeeter Harry Potter Magic (Harry Potter) Death Eater Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Cho Chang Battle of Hogwarts Minor Ravenclaws Cedric Diggory Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter James and Lily Potter Minor Slytherins Dark Art Sybill Trelawney Dobby Diagon Alley Unbreakable Vow Remus Lupin Hogwarts Houses Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Occlumency Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) R.A.B.
