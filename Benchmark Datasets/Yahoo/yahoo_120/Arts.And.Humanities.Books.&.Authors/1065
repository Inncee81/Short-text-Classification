i'm writing a book about a woman who accidently hits a little girl who runs across the street after her puppy the little girl is instantly killed the woman stops and weeps over the little girl would she have to go to prison for this it was an accident and she stopped rather than a hit and run it is unlikely that she would go to prison i think it would be more realistic if she didn't cry at first but was in some kind of shock then maybe her life could go on kind of normally like she gets away with it i think it would make a better book if the conflict was inner her own guilt rather than outer getting punished EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Days of our Lives Charles Manson Knots Landing Female guards in Nazi concentration camps W.I.T.C.H.
