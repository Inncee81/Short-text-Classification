who's the perfect girl for harry potter cho chang ginny luna hermione who do you think and why personally i dont think cho and hermione are good for him since he liked cho mainly on her looks before he got to know her then he realised he didn't really like her that much and as for hermione she has loved ron since she first met him so yea they are only friends why can't people see that luna might have been good for him since they get along pretty well but i dunno in my opinion harry ginny are the perfect couple i mean she is strong and courageous but is the only person who truly understands him having been possessed by voldemort herself and everything and their sense of humour and love of quidditch is shared and besides she has loved him forever and he is so jealous when she is kissing dean etc etc etc so glad they got together harry ginny shipper ron hermione shipper this question is in the 'books' section coz all the harry potter questions seem to be here i say ginny he really felt something for her more than he did cho and she stood by him from books to she also knew what it was like to be controlled by voldemort cho may have liked harry but she still was sprung over cedric and she couldn't make up her mind between liking harry and her ex cedric hermonie was meant for ron they always argued like an old married couple glad they ended up married plus she's one of her best friends luna is just too weird she would have been better with neville or dean Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Cho Chang Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Minor Ravenclaws Hermione Granger Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Dates in Harry Potter Hogwarts Houses Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Luna Lovegood Dumbledore's Army Weasley family Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film) Hogwarts Viktor Krum Neville Longbottom Minor characters associated with Quidditch Harry Potter: Book Seven Minor Hufflepuffs Death Eater Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter Lord Voldemort Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Blood purity (Harry Potter) Diagon Alley Harry Potter fandom Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Rita Skeeter James and Lily Potter Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game) Rubeus Hagrid Severus Snape Cedric Diggory Battle of Hogwarts Pansy Parkinson Minor Harry Potter Beasts Triwizard Tournament Tom Riddle's diary Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) House-elf Lucius Malfoy Draco Malfoy Mary Sue Fred and George Weasley Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film) Fleur Delacour Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter newspapers and magazines Nymphadora Tonks EastEnders Felix Felicis Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books Horace Slughorn Boggart (Harry Potter) R.A.B.
