have writers been successful in selling e books online i remember some famous authors tried selling their new book online with out the aid of publishers but i have never heard if they were successful with that method actually a lot of 'famous' writers also sell their work as e books with the aid of their publishers because publishing houses are all about selling books in whatever medium is required e books while certainly not cornering the market have a strong foothold on the market sony has just released an incredible e book reader that stores hundreds of e books what makes it incredible is the technology gives the user the benefit of holding a reader that has the look and feel of holding a hardbound edition of a book whatever book is being read there are pages to 'turn' people are calling it a good piece of technology because it enables a user to take multiple titles with them without the weight of multiple books in their briefcase suitcase or travel bag there's also national e book week in march schools are using e books in classrooms because they're grossly less expensive than paper textbooks and many schools are beginning to issue laptops to students so having the ability to carry all your textbooks inside a laptop as opposed to inside your book bag is going over really big many libraries are carrying e books in fact i recently read an article about the new york city library which has a backlog of readers waiting for e books because they have the ease of going on line with the library and downloading the e book without having to physically visit the library as for e books as an avenue for a new writer yes it should be considered however a writer needs to be wary of e publishers and really do research on one before selecting it there are e publishers out there that are not choosy in what they accept there are also e publishers out there that expect and demand the same kind of quality work a traditional publisher expects and demands those e publishers put a manuscript through the same rigorous editing process that a paper book goes through however distinguishing between these two types of e book publishers requires that an author do their homework and perhaps dole out some cash for an e book here and there and actually read it if the book is full of errors in grammar spelling and punctuation then it's from a 'puppy mill' type e publisher however if it's high quality in product as well as story then this is an e publisher to consider epic is an organization made up of e publishers as well as authors of e books there are pitfalls that await all new writers the tricky part is learning to avoid them o Publishing Ebook Windows XP Oxford English Dictionary Visual Basic DVD Microsoft Book Software engineering A Course In Miracles Open access Blog UK Singles Chart Extreme Programming Manga Textbook Copy protection Peer review IBM PC compatible Octopus card Printing press Copyleft Vanity press Gramophone record GED Frank Herbert Education in Japan Musical Instrument Digital Interface Windows Vista John Lott MP3 Compact disc Illegal drug trade Copyright Cascading Style Sheets Laserdisc Wikipedia Digital photography Floppy disk Newspaper Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Podcasting Graduate school Enterprise content management Apple typography IPod MAME MDAC Education in the People's Republic of China Apple Computer Object-oriented programming C plus plus Internet fraud Bookbinding Economics Privatization CPU cache Mach kernel Theory of conduct British comic RISC Everything2 Photography Academia Legal research Encyclopedia The Skeptical Environmentalist Radeon Ajax (programming) Password H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Jacques Derrida Atari 2600 United States Postal Service ZX Spectrum Intelligent design movement Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Francis Crick Inflation Nintendo Doctor Who spin-offs Science fiction Style guide Electronic commerce Dynamic random access memory Spyware
