who thought voldemort should have died a more brutal death the way he was killed was tame in my opinion then again i guess the afterlife he was headed to was punishment enough yes i thought his fate would be to suffer something much more horrible than death because his only fear was death and dumbledore even told him that his failure to recognise that there are things much worse than death was his greatest weakness i thought he deserved to be punished in a way unlike the death that many of harry's friends and protectors had like maybe have his soul sucked out by a dementor or something but then again he would be forced to live in the form of the gruesome baby like thing that harry spotted at 'king's cross or so i guess which is quite good of a punishment his greatest and only fear was death and he was the reason for the death of hundreds of people both enemies and supporters of his alike so he deserved to be led to that fate Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Lord Voldemort Death Eater Dementor Capital punishment Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter (character) Rubeus Hagrid Horcrux Harry Potter: Book Seven Minor Dark wizards in Harry Potter Phaedo Sirius Black Afterlife Theory of conduct Magic (Harry Potter) Dolores Umbridge Messiahs in fiction and fantasy Azkaban Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) James and Lily Potter Ginny Weasley Sub-Zero Severus Snape Merit Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Napalm Death Blood purity (Harry Potter) Minor Hufflepuffs Albus Dumbledore Sin City Hogwarts Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Simone Weil Ministry of Magic Sybill Trelawney Soul Remus Lupin Magical objects in Harry Potter Appeasement Dursley family Legacy of Kain Order of the Phoenix Horace Slughorn Tom Riddle's diary Dead Like Me Zhao Yun Cicero Nicomachean Ethics Macbeth Jewish eschatology Resurrection of Jesus Naraku Regulus Black Hogwarts subjects Immortality Sin Dates in Harry Potter Summa Theologiae Minor Ministry officials in the Harry Potter books EastEnders Utilitarianism John Howard Yoder Minor members of the Order of the Phoenix Peter Pettigrew Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Neville Longbottom Sharia Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Barty Crouch Jr. Franco-Prussian War Battle of Hogwarts Death Heaven Theodicy Ayyavazhi mythology Abortion debate Reincarnation Yusuf al-Qaradawi Crime and Punishment Romulus and Remus Angel Sanctuary Jack (comic) Socrates Christian eschatology Death (personification) Seppuku Fatality Anselm of Canterbury Decapitation Luna Lovegood Goodness and value theory Punisher James II of England The Death Gate Cycle Hell Crucifixion Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)
