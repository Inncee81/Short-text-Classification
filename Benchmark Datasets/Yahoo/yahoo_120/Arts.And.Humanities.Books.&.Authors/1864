is it common for authors to bond with their characters i'm currently writing a fantasy sci fi book and and halfway through finishing it in reading over what i've got i notice that i haven't created any characters that i don't like even the bad ones i still like reading about and for those who i feel i need to for lack of a better term kill off i always feel sorry for them and sympathize when the others have problems or whatever i find this kind of odd and wonder whether other writers feel the same way my proof readers think it's because all of my characters are given at least one of my own personal traits and that's why i feel bonded to them because they all repreent a specific side of me what do you think that's great that you have a strong bond with your characters it makes them more real for you which makes them more real for your audience as well there's nothing worse than a one dimensional character do you read stephenie meyer's books she is the best selling author of twilight on her website she claims she has discussions with her characters in her head they are so fully developed she claims her character edward for example told her that he needed to leave another character bella for her safety and meyer said she didn't want to do it but knew she had to because it was what edward would have done when i write i try to create a bond with my characters so the reader can feel the same way about them that i do if that comes naturally to you that's great hope i helped Science fiction Fan fiction Screenwriting Narrator Novel Theory of conduct Asperger syndrome M (James Bond) Arthur Cayley Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Canadian literature Survivor: Palau Intelligent design A Course In Miracles Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Science Paul W.
