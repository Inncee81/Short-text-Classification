harry potter and the deathly hallows has anybody else found that final chapter nineteen years later a real let down throughout the entire saga i'd kind of read the books in real time ignoring the fact that there was a gap of years between novels identifying with each year that was represented by the book as if the events had unfolded in the same year i'd read them in another sense all this time i'd been identifying with a boy and at the end of it harry potter turns out to be years old ok i miss calculated his age i obviously was paying that much attention to that final chapter after all but thanks to you all who have actually answered my question rather than just pointing out that harry is now and missing the point of the question all together he wuz the end of nineteen yrz later Harry Potter: Book Seven Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter R.A.B.
