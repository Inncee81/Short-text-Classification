if you've read the hp and the deathly hallows what did you think of it i have read it so you don't need to worry about spoiling it for me it was definitely the best in the series and the best book i've read so far the ending was great all the strings were connected and the plot was sick the only con would be that they focused more on the deathly hallows than the horcruxes and r a b 's identity was too obvious the rest of the book compensated that big time if you're looking for other books to read i definitely recommend artemis fowl and the inheritance trilogy eragon Eragon The Foundation Series Eldest C.
