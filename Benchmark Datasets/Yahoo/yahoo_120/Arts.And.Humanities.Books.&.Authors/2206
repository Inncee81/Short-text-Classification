what's the best book you've ever read and why i love fantasy the most so specifically the best fantasy books you've ever read would be great harry potter the lord of the rings and other books by jrr tolken are already well known so other suggestions would be greatly appreciated speaking pickily i think it's best if the main character is a girl and if the book moves at a fairly medium to fast pace i also enjoy fantasy but since you have already named my two favorite series i will suggest my third favorite try the abhorsen trilogy by garth nix the three books are sabriel lirael and abhorsen the main characters are female moves at a good pace i actually couldn't put them down and it is a really good fantasy series the sum of the story is about a family of necromancers but they are a different sort of necromancer where instead of bringing the dead back to life they are trying to send the dead back trust me this series rocks Garth Nix Necromancy Harry Potter The Chronicles of Narnia J.
