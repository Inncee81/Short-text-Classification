is anyone else completely infatuated with snape i love him i am a huge snape fan when i first stared reading the books he was a little scary but i soon felt drawn to him because there was always a little hint of excitement and anticipation when he turned up because you didn't know what he was going to do i think it moved up to the next level when i saw alan rickman in the movie i already liked alan rickman and he not only looked good but came across as really fiery and passionate ooh and i love his growlly voice i also loved how he would storm out of a room with a swirl of his cape i was intrigued even more when he killed dumbledore because i couldn't believe he'd done it and also because i was desperate to believe dumbledore when he said he trusted him and finally it was so heart wrenching when we found out that he had loved lily potter for all these years it shows he had a big heart and was very brave as well so i think he has it all a hint of badness and danger sexiness and passion brave and a loving heart what's not to like Severus Snape Harry Potter (character) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) Alan Rickman Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Ron Weasley Hogwarts subjects Harry Potter: Book Seven Magical objects in Harry Potter Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Ginny Weasley Lord Voldemort Dates in Harry Potter 1957 World Series Hogwarts Houses Shaggy dog story Roxette Spoiler (media) EastEnders Sirius Black Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Blood on the Tracks Remus Lupin Death Eater Minor Hufflepuffs Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Magic (Harry Potter) Battle of Hogwarts Minor Ravenclaws Characters in the Smurfs Rubeus Hagrid W.I.T.C.H.
