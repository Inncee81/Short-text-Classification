reviews on eclipse i just finished eclipse and i wondered what everyone else thought about it i thought the part were charlie tried to give bella the sex talk was hilarious i loved when she tried to sleep with edward too and he like didn't understand what she wanted for the longest time hysterical i was a bit suprised by how much bella really loved jake i mean i knew she loved him like a best friend but the whole thing with him being her other soul mate shocked me a bit i was just glad that she realized she loved edward more and she always will i can't wait for the next book when they tell charlie about the engagement i bet her ring is so beautiful i'm glad alice was so happy about planning the wedding i really hope jacob comes around i know it's going to be really hard for him but i still wish him and bella could at least be friends i thought the battle with the newborns and the whole thing with victoria was done well too overall i thought the book was excellent what did you think my honest opinion i thought the first two books yes even new moon was more well written than eclipse mind you that doesn't mean it wasn't a good book in the first place let's tear off the band aid first shall we i found some parts awkward like the hormonal bella and the imprinting thought that was fascinating up until it involved a toddler but i understood what meyer meant by it also thought the marriage thing a bit odd i want to take bella's side a bit why couldn't they marry later i thought the cullens wanted to be inconspicuous and let's not mention the repetitive stakes haha get it stakes on bella's life james' coven is an annoying inconvenience notice how james attacks in twilight laurent in new moon and finally victoria in eclipse now the lollipop afterwards the fire and ice analogy jacob and edward was very interesting two different forces of supernatural nature fighting against each other for one thing love i also loved it when bella finally considers her humanity notice how she doesn't get too freaked out by dying in previous books the histories of rosalie and jasper was pretty impressive too sort of opened bella's eyes to the negativities of being a vampire while carlisle edward and alice's stories are more positive plus jasper's story tied the present conflict of vampire wars ah and the jacob factor you gotta admit he was there for bella through thick and thin so i'm not too surprised she loved him too it was actually pretty obvious in the previous book through her actions and what she says though not directly that she deeply cares for jacob oh and favorite scene edward and jacob talking of their love for bella in the tent and here's the big whopper that a huge part of the climax of the story to me the passionate kiss scene between jacob and bella now that was beautiful yet heartbreaking seeing her human future for the first time woo hoo finally i enjoyed the epilogue poor jacob i didn't see that coming at all hope his conflict gets resolved and he becomes happy and imprints on someone overall i loved the book and can't wait for breaking dawn and midnight sun EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Poker jargon Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Friends Piccolo Junior Saga Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Haven (TNG episode) Spice Girls K' Scenes from a Memory Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Days of our Lives One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Series finale Marilyn Monroe W.I.T.C.H.
