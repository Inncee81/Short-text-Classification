what do you think of my story any suggestions or comments are appreciated http www writing com main view item item id it's about a year old boy whose life changes when he is recuirted into the cia the soft purr from the engine and the churning of the waves was all that could be heard in the shipyard it was chilly a slight breeze blew from the sea in his right hand a tall man firmly held a long brown shotgun as he walked down the dock behind two large men both wearing black button down shirts the tall man wore a black toque which covered most of his head with the exception of some tufts of sandy blond hair which stood out in the night he wore dark jeans and a plain gray t shirt overall the story is not bad a few things throw you in the opening of the story your assailant is carrying a long brown shotgun but yet his sandy blond hair stood out in the night problem for a descriptive is that if it is dark enough to really cause the hair to stand out it may be to dark to make an identification on a weapon also if torture was the objective of the scientist being shot in both arms with a shotgun so much tissue damaged would have resulted most likely severing the arms it may be better to carry this from the angle that they were dragging the individual who was beaten severely a few fingers severed as you can imagine to get information they may cut of a finger with a pocket knife or such instrument as they stand at the end of the dock the individual that is walking behind him pulls from a concealed position a firearm a auto is nice or a pistol with a silencer the report from a shotgun would attract a lot of attention in boston harbor from some potential witness not a likely mob style hit or professional assassin either you want as little attention as possible for what its worth Internal ballistics Firearm Columbine High School massacre Sin City Archery Blood (computer game) Punisher Perfect Dark Team Fortress Classic Shotgun Wyatt Earp Knife The Inside Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Dragon Booster Gunsmith Cats Professional wrestling match types Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Plame affair Turok: Dinosaur Hunter Terminal ballistics Combine (Half-Life 2) Volleyball Aerial (dance move) Double bass Bong Fast bowling Dog Boy Scouts of America Grand Theft Auto III Roswell UFO incident Concepts in the Wheel of Time series Men in Black Stopping power Manhunt (video game) Softball M16 (rifle) Shaggy dog story Rifle John Browning M4 Carbine John Lott Comanche Heckler & Koch MP5 Rais massacre War of the Worlds (2005 film) Technology in the Stargate universe Counter-Strike Diving Kilt Glossary of American football Mario Snooker Poker jargon Paul Is Dead Star Wars: Battlefront Cobra Commander Tank Airsoft Double Dragon Equine conformation Drill bit Glossary of nautical terms Sling (weapon) Shotgun shell Mumia Abu-Jamal Worms weapons and tools Salad Fingers Boxing Horse .22 Long Rifle Second Battle of the Atlantic EXpanded MultiPlayer Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Carpal tunnel syndrome Baseball Japanese tea ceremony The Amber Spyglass Quake III Arena Rod Stewart Hijab Aikido Leo Frank Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Reservoir Dogs Jean Charles de Menezes Gun control in the United States (by state)
