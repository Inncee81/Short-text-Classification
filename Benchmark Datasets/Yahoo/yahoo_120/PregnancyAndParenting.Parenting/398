can he have a problem my step son yrs is spending the summer with us after amost yrs of not coming our home due his mom the problem is i have notice he lies a lot my hubby seems not to believe i don't spank him or punish him i just give orders to him as i give orders to my other kids the problem is that when my hubby comes home ask how did he behave sometimes i just don't tell but when is a big thing i do tell him so he can punish him for doing wrong so i tell my version in front of the kid but he change everything so i end up being a liar i have notice my hubby believes him more than me we end up in discussion don't know if the kids does this on purpose or does he have a problem i have known him since he was parents were divorce by that time if i don t punish him is because of the big deal the mom will form as soon as she finds out but i don't know what else to do i have told my hubby that the kid maybe has a problem that i need his support what to do help you have a big problem but it isn't with your stepson this year old is learning from his mother and others in his life how to lie and manipulate punishment and discipline are two very different things he's coming to your home and the rules are different than he has at his mom's house plus his mother obviously has some bad feelings toward you that she may be passing along to her son you just need to give him a clear set a rules and define the discipline tell him straight out that lies are unacceptable and if he caught in a lie you will ask him to go to his room to think about why he shouldn't lie or whatever discipline you decide on putting him in time out won't hurt him and his mother shouldn't have a problem with it if you don't spank him but you can't allow him to get away with this and he needs to be clear about that right away you could give him a chance to change his lie into the truth by saying i'm not so sure if that is the truth are you sure you don't have something else to say that let's him know that you are on to him and let's him get things straight without getting into trouble but if he persists in lying you have to discipline him the problem that i see is with your husband if he doesn't believe you but believes his son over you and doesn't discipline him at all he is teaching his son by example that you are not that important and that he can do whatever he wants where you are concerned and not get in trouble you are going to have to talk to your husband and find out why he thinks you would lie to him about this child's behavior then make sure that he understands that he is your husband and needs to be your support and united with you in your decisions if you are being kind and fair your husband should back you up all the way especially in front of your children stepchild or not Theory of conduct Social rule Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theodicy Spanking Transactional analysis The nature of God in Western theology Aerial (dance move) Cindy Sheehan Randomness Lie Friends About a Boy Goodness and value theory Logic Moral Politics EastEnders Pitaten Scientology beliefs and practices Malcolm in the Middle Extreme Programming Kodocha Beetle in an Anthill Laura Schlessinger Fathers' rights Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Poker jargon Ten Commandments God Emperor of Dune Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Humphrey Bogart Jumpstart 3rd Grade Epistemology Philosophy of language Avenue Q Paradox Bill O'Reilly (commentator) Jiddu Krishnamurti Muslim ibn Aqeel Atheism Coming of Age (TNG episode) Nicomachean Ethics Alcoholics Anonymous The Amber Spyglass Human sexual behavior Sheepshead Halting problem Dog training Good Times W.I.T.C.H.
