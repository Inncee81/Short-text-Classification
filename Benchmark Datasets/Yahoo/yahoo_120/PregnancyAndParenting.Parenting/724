am i wrong i finally got my six year old to pick out a pair of crocs and both of my kids go these sneakers that the guy said were great without socks but my kids still want to be barefoot to schools starts which i still allow going barefoot is very healthy for the feet general posture and the body as a whole it is not dangerous or gross feet get very tough very quickly and are fully washable an occasional minor scratch may happen but if they skin their knee or cut their finger you're not going to let them go around with knee pads gloves all day every day do you the fears related to barefooting are greatly exaggerated it's a very good thing to do for people of any age and especially for growing children if people give you a hard time about it call you a bad parent use some of the material from the source to set them straight Diving Aerial (dance move) Barefoot Equine conformation Fast bowling Professional wrestling holds Muay Thai Boxing Skateboarding trick High-heeled shoe Flat feet Volleyball Horseshoe New York Giants Shoe Chair Kender Tai Chi Chuan Field hockey 1957 World Series Sock Fencing Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Social rule Mixed martial arts Mattress KaBlam!
