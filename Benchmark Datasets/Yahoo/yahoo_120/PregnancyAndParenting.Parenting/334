what do other parents think of using child restraint leashes i'm thinking of using one my son isn't walking yet but when he is i've thought about using a child leash but so many people seem to think they're terrible what are your opinions i think it's something that the parent can judge best everyone knows what their child is capable of and whether or not they're likely to 'listen' and follow instructions or if they're more inclined to run off or dart into the street personally i would much rather see a child in toddler reins that being hit by a car i think that whether or not you 'like' them is irrelevant you have to respect that they exist for a reason and that these days there are so many risks to young children both natural and human that any measures you take to keep them safe is better than doing nothing and putting them in danger i honestly don't see how people can make such wild judgements about this i probably won't use them either i just prefer using a pusher or pram but i see absolutely nothing wrong with them i think it's just another thing for people to get on their soapboxes about good luck with your little one Theory of conduct Baby transport Abortion debate Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Human sexual behavior Theodicy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Polyamory Goodness and value theory Human nature Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus The nature of God in Western theology Property (ownership right) Ethics Adoption Ontological argument Shaggy dog story Stoicism Autism rights movement Social rule Moral relativism Summa Theologiae Atheism Dog training Freedom of speech Customs and etiquette of Japan Contract About a Boy Originalism Luck Economic inequality Utilitarianism James Bulger Horse Scientific method Objectivist philosophy Spanking Ferret Child Anarcho-capitalism Aerial (dance move) Sexual orientation School bus Project Orion Road safety Decision making Hearing impairment Evil Birth control Brian Close Milton H.
