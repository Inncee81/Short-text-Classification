daughter having problems with her friend afterchool situation my daughter has had this ongoing problem with this girl for the last two years there are three girls my daughter is close with one used to be with the other but not anymore the other girl is close with her basically the three of then can't hang out together because the one girl had had serious issues with it the problem is my daughter always gets the bad end of it the ignoring the talking about etc she goes and has been going for two years to the one girls' house afterschool because i work well for the last three weeks she is ignoring my daughter's phone calls emails im's it used to be like a day she is now with the other girl all the time she has maybe once or twice wrote hi but then ignore my daughter when she writes back i don't know what to do about afterschool now do i send her somewhere else do i say something to the mom i hate to get in her business but hate to see her so hurt any advice i think you need to say something to the other girl's mother only because that is where your daughter goes after school if she does not know about a negative and hurtful situation that her daughter is involved in she can't help mediate i think that if this is going on in her home then she should know but if it were only at school you have to let the girls work things out on their own it sounds like the one girl has some serious issues but she is a girl and unfortunately girls arent taught to get a long together but to compete and be hurtful i know how your daughter feels i had similar issues years ago when i was in school if your daughter wants to consider looking at other after school options tell her before you mention anything to anyone depending on how old she is that may be more traumatic than the experience itself hopefully her old friend will realize what she is doing but if she doesnt then you need to encourage your daughter to get involved with other kids and activities Kodocha Ranma __ characters The Fairly OddParents Traumatic incident reduction Plame affair About a Boy Boston Public Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Social rule Charmed Kim Possible Scenes from a Memory Saved by the Bell The Shining (film) Anne Rice The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Adventures of Pete & Pete Transactional analysis Cindy Sheehan Avenue Q Dilbert Ron and Fez The Inside Laura Schlessinger Pok__mon Live!
