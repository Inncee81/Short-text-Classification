why do parents respect and treat better the son that cheats uses and lies to them the one that brings pregnant tramps home neither and i can assure you none of mine would turn out that way and if they did they'd be living on the street and ellie i'm sorry your life turned out that you were the neglected child but when you have kids of your own you will understand why they try so much to save the bad apple a teacher once said to me that he was only as good as his worst student meaning i think that reaching that one student is more worthwhile than the ones who can fend for themselves and make it i think your parents knew you would be ok in life but it was heartbreaking to them to not be able to save your brother it's sad they became totally absorbed in him and neglected you and i try to explain to my kids too sometimes why my focus may be more on one of them than the other it's not that i don't love one less it's that another needs me more but i try to spend my time equally with them all and make sure they all get what they need it isn't always easy Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Boston Public One Tree Hill (TV series) About a Boy Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Catechism Infantilism Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist The Life and Times of Juniper Lee EastEnders Polyamory Knots Landing The Fairly OddParents Son Gohan Child abuse True Crime: Streets of LA The Isley Brothers Current teachings of Prem Rawat For Better or For Worse Phoebe Halliwell Hey Arnold!
