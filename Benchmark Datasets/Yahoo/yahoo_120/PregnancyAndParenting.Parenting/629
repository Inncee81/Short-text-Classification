parents of boys ok i have a yr old son and yesterday he was playing and he ran into the coffee table and he hit his pee pee he was in so much pain and crying and i could just see the pain in his eyes i started crying cause it hurts me to see my child in pain and my husband was just sitting there like nothing i yelled at my husband cause i would think him being a man that he knows the pain and he did nothing to comfort my son i was angry and hurt is it cause he is a man and he knows the pain and that it will be alright and did i just over react cause i am female and i don't know that pain idk i was just mad and was very sad for my son also what can i do to teach him to be more careful there well i didn't run to comfort him i was sitting on the floor with my daughter when it happened and he just stood there grabbing himslef crying and i started crying cause i could just see the pain in his eyes and my husband did nothing so i called him to come to me and i more like cried at my husband cause it hurt my feelings that he just sat there when i had my daughter in my arms and i thought it was more of a male thing and he should have comforted him sprintwalker totally lost me spiritwalker i mean thanks i see your guys point its just that my son is the love if my life and i hurt when he hurts i am already an emotional person as it is and when my kids are hurt it just hurts i still get sad right now cause i can still see the tears in his eyes and the pain he expressed it kills me he is my first born and my only son i am not this big sucker i am pretty firm and strict with him and i don't bend easily but when it comes to my kids getting hurt i think it hurts me more it's a guy thing and trust me he will be more careful now poor thing you did not overreact you're his mother mother's hurt when their children hurt that is normal im sure your husband wasn't indifferent to your son at all he was probably thinking to himself oh that gonna leave a mark but like most men he just figures that he'd be alright he wasn't bleeding etc i do think yelling at your hubby was a bit much hon and only adds more stress to the situation for your son it's normal that men and women will react differently to situations like that my husband wouldn't have just sat there but i dont think he would have broke down in tears like i would have and have done when my kids get boo boos he probably would have hugged him and said you'll be okay buddy and left it at that it's a father son thing i think cause if my daughter had banged her head or something my husband would have freaked daddy's girl lol guys are weird EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story The Marshall Mathers LP Humphrey Bogart Jon Secada Piccolo Junior Saga Kodocha Friends The Shining (film) Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Milton H.
