how to deal with irresponsible parent s first i want to make it clear that i don't think i am super mom but i do think i am a normal responsible parent so my question is how do you deal with parents who won't take any responsibility over their children i swear i live in irresponsible parent capital city let me throw you an example one winter i was outside playing with my two daughters who were and years old at the time there were other older kids outside making a snow fort my youngest being a toddler didn't know better and stole some of their snow from their stockpile a boy who was years old got really angry and tried to beat her up my daughter was literally hiding behind me while i was holding this kid back the kid was all in my face while i told him to back off i decided enough was enough and went to his house to try and speak to his mother it was like talking to a brick wall she thought her son did nothing wrong by threatening a year old little girl continued her explanation was that my daughter should have known better not to steal their snow i tried to reason with her that it does not justify violence and wasn t she concerned that he had no qualms about beating up a baby who just happens to be a girl wasn t she concerned about the fact that he didn t back down after a parent myself interfered nope all that mattered to her was that my daughter stole their snow nevermind the fact that there was a whole football field of snow around i was pratically screaming in frustration when i left her doorstep this is just one example of many that i have had to deal with over the years from multiple parents so how do you deal with irresponsible ignorant parents is there a way thanks welcome to society today you will have to follow your girls around and make sure they are supervised all the time or you will have an incident where a child could beat up your girls parents are clueless they dump their children outside and forget about them here are some tips that i have for you since my son is older get a fence and and much property as you can don't deal with parents they are clueless and stupid and don't like to be corrected be careful of where you send them to school private schools don't equate to better parents look for schools that stress family values etc and ask if the parents are involved good luck i feel really bad for you but i would say you are an old fashioned parent like me and there we account for about of the parents that i see out there Poker jargon Kyle Broflovski Theory of conduct Sin City Kodocha The Shining (film) Infantilism EastEnders The Marshall Mathers LP Knots Landing Fathers' rights Abortion debate Shaggy dog story Boston Public About a Boy Billy the Kid Pitaten Friends Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Rais massacre Characters in the Smurfs Domestic violence Ethics Adoption One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Plame affair Criticism of libertarianism Trailer Park Boys Milton H.
