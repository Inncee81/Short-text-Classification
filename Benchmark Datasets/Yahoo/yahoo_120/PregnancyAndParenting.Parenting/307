please help me i need your opinions about what is your opinion to the unwed mothers i feel you will get a big debate of different answers on this subject here's my take people look down on unwed mothers becasue society thinks it is wrong but how many people get married and have kids that end in divorce today i feel marriage isn't something that you should do because your pregnant it is harder on the single parent but it depends on that persons ambitions on how their life goes i agree that some kids have a hard time with growing up without two parentss but why marry and ended up in divorce that cause problems for the kids as well i think kids need two parents and just because the parents didn't marry doesnt mean they cant have parents the real questions should be why have kids if you dont want to be a parent because having kids is a lot of work and if you aren't willing to make sacrifces in your life then don't have them so i feel it isn't a fact for unwed mothers that they have low education poverty ect it is simply a problem that exsists for unwed mothers divorced mothers divorced fathers unwed fathers and many wed parents as well society doesn't accept because we all have a white picket fence view of life and it doesn't exsist we can believe that it does but we are only lying to ourselves there are bigger problems in our world than a single unwed mother Marriage Divorce Theory of conduct Abortion debate Friends Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Adoption Roe v.
