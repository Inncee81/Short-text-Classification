visitation rights etc advice please after some advice from you all my partner of years walked out on me i am months preganant with his rd child and our sons months ago he is and with a year old girl who has a year ols son herself not his and has social services involved with her child since getting with this girl my ex has threatened to try for custody of our children or rights to them my eldest son is and has decided himself he doesnt love daddy etc my other son is and doesnt really understand they have seen their father physically hurt me to the point where my eldest would sometimes say stop hurting mummy and all of his attitude he has let the kids down by lying saying he would buy them things and doesnt etc during our relationship he didnt help out with the kids to the point where if i was at work and our youngest pooed he wouldnt change him and leave him like it used to get very moody with them over small things etc he does not pay me maintenance for them either in my opinion i think it would be in the childrens best interst if he stayed away as all the will learn from him is violence abuse how to lie and be let down by him he never worked during the years i was with him and i dont think its right for my kids to go near a girl who has social services envolved with her own son advice please anyone else been in this situation he also does not care one bit about the baby and wont even let him have his surname when hes born one thing i am fed up to the back teeth of is people telling me i am telling my son not to love his father because i am not i still love their father so why would i try and turn them against him my point is they have seen him hurt me threaten me turn up at the house at all hours etc they even saw him tell his new g f and her sister to sort me out and one of them come flying at me with them in the car he is old enough to see what his father has done and is doing i saw similar when i was younger and still has visions of it to this day so no i am not telling my kids what to do or influencing them also since being gone he has made no effort to ring me and ask how the kids are talk to them and within the last month has seen them once for min and i had to travel miles for him to do that i love hockey how dare you suggest i am a bad mum my ex never ever hurt the children and all i have ever done is out my children first and tried to make my relationship work with their father so they wouldnt end up like me and him with parents that have split up my children have and always do come first if you have never been in this kind of situation how can u judge if i was a danger to my children dont you think i would have social services or something envolved and just for the book i havent people are making this more complicated that it needs to be let me make it simple he has not held a job for almost years and you have not only done that but more or less raised your children on your own any judge with half a brain won't even consider giving him custody and they'd have to be brain dead to consider giving custody to the girlfriend it won't happen they will make him pay child support but if he can't hold a job don't ever count on actually getting the money due most women never do shame on you for waiting for him to leave you you should have left him abuse is never okay and if there is anything that will harm you in the court proceedings it will be on questioning why you endangered your children and self by staying in an abusive relationship if he is dangerous the children shouldn't be allowed around him and you can bring this up to the court so that his visits will be supervised by child services or the court system Divorce About a Boy Fathers' rights Knots Landing EastEnders Atomic Kitten Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Pitaten Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Child support 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Charmed Breastfeeding Infantilism Theory of conduct Marriage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Smallville (Season 4) Laura Schlessinger The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Phoebe Halliwell Transactional analysis Boston Public The Human Stain Little Britain The Shining (film) Sin City Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Dog training Scenes from a Memory The Amber Spyglass Avenue Q Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Miss Saigon Sharon Tate W.I.T.C.H.
