mothers how many kids would you recommend having i am getting married next year and we both say we want a big family but my friends that have one kid are telling me i'll change my mind about wanting several kids after i have my first one because they are so much time and energy comments please i'm thinking i want it'll depend on a lot of things and you really can't say until you're in the situation i wanted as many kids as my body would produce but if you're responsible please be responsible your finances will limit that if you're an average person we can afford to have several kids but not at the rate of one every year or two for the next how ever many years plus we want to be able to give our kids nice clothes not ones that have been handed down times first also our house can only hold so many people or we'll have to get a new one i want my kids to have a chance to go to college and i'd love to be able to pay for it and i can't afford college educations for us its a matter of being responsible to the children we have and limiting how many more we have so that we can take care of them well and fully plus you can't give undivided attention to a billion kids i think is a fine number still a large family in this day and age but small enough you can care for their needs physical and emotional and they do require energy but it just kind of happens when you have kids you get used to it good luck and have those babies Humphrey Bogart Social rule Abortion debate About a Boy Divorce Theory of conduct Microeconomics Diaper EastEnders Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Pitaten Extreme Programming Charmed Marriage Education in the People's Republic of China Gender role Education in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Jon Secada Normal distribution The Fairly OddParents Dualism (philosophy of mind) Cancer Transsexuality Luck Motion picture rating system The Contender (television series) Sharon Tate Adoption Brewery Piccolo Junior Saga Origin belief Social Security (United States) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sant Thakar Singh W.
