any good ideals on how to get a year old boy and his year old sister get along they will get along good for short periods but fight most of the time they tattle constantly and if i try to get them to work it out on their own it turns violent to top it off they have a year old brother who loves to copy big brother and sister help there were kids in my family but we were not as lucky as my kids and had to take care of each other there were a few fights but we usually got along i have been where you are sometimes it gets hard to bear on your nerves but the best thing i found out was to get them time to do things alone or put them in separate rooms and before you know it they will be wanting to involve the other in what ever they are doing and that means getting along this is normal for siblings so if nothing else take time for yourself before starting a whole new day of some of the same old thing About a Boy The Adventures of Pete & Pete Kimi Finster Humphrey Bogart Ed, Edd n Eddy Family The Catcher in the Rye Kylie Minogue Silent Night, Deadly Night Care Bears Boy Meets World Philip J.
