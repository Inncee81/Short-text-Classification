what do you think of the show super nanny i was flipping through the channels last night and came apon it after reading some many comments on here about it and people refering to it i decided to watch it for a few minutes what do you think of it i find humor in how parents can't control their kids so they look for people like supernanny to get their kids in line for them it's the same thing over and over kids running around screaming beating up on eachother cussing etc and the parents are like please don't do that it is not okay and supernanny comes in with her only discipline tecnique which has to do with time outs whether it is naughty corner chair rug bench stair room pond etc goes on and on and on it amazes me how people can't seem to control their kids nowadays it really does and what amuses me more is people use supernanny as a reason to not do other types of discipline apparently they don't realize how much reality tv is edited to make you believe stuff no spoiled brat turns into a little angel in an hour worth of time and time outs definitely do not work on every children so i bet the ones supernanny couldn't fix aren't even aired on tv supernanny is just an amusing show that i finally got bored of because it's the same exact thing over and over Shaggy dog story Humphrey Bogart The Amazing Race The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Milton H.
