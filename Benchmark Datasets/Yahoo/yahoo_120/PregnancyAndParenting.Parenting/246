daugter and disrepecting so i have two kids one is and the other will be at the end of this year my daughter has just started kindergarten and wanted to know why she would be disrespecting her mom me and her are very civil in front of the kids and say nothing bad to each of the kids but my daughter will not talk to her or listen to her at all i am able to talk to my daughter and and discuss how her day went i am able to get her to do simple chores like dishes laundry cleaning and vacuuming her room the mom on the other hand states that she is not able to get her to do anything and ignores her pretty much all the time i am sorry i didn't say that she has been doing it for a little while already it has just gotten worse this past week since she has started school it's hard to tell from your question who the child lives with or if you and your wife are living together or separated but it's perfectly normal if the daughter is for her to be going through her romantic phase this is the time of a girl's life when she briefly detaches from the mother who will be her main support and confidante most of her life and expresses her preference for her father this is very normal and just means she will like boys when she grows up psychologists call this the romantic phase but of course it has nothing to do with adult romance or sexuality she is just imaging you in her affections and bonding with you as a daughter this phase doesn't happen with sons because they continue their romantic feelings toward their mothers throughout their childhood and never need to change from them Kodocha Pedophilia Transsexuality Love About a Boy Infantilism The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Sexual orientation Laura Schlessinger Transactional analysis Child sexuality Alois Hitler Childlove movement One Tree Hill (TV series) Narcissism Maison Ikkoku The Fairly OddParents One Life to Live Charmed Humphrey Bogart Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 Shaggy dog story English grammar Sharon Tate Puberty Recurring South Park characters Baby Blues Phoebe Halliwell Incest The Ashlee Simpson Show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kylie Minogue Domestic violence Pitaten Theory of conduct Kimi Finster EastEnders Gwen Stacy Luke and Laura Spencer Jean Grey Kindergarten Doug Another World (TV series) Extreme Programming Kim Possible Serial killer Cindy Sheehan Kurt Cobain Days of our Lives Human sexual behavior Springfield Elementary School Timmy Turner Kyle Broflovski Alena Taken For Better or For Worse 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Modernism T'Pol Androgen insensitivity syndrome My Life as a Teenage Robot Phase (matter) Babe Carey Asperger syndrome Boston Public Megan Griffin Knots Landing Earth Girl Arjuna Philip J.
