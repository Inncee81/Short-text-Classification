why does my mum seems to think that i am not capable of taking care of my child my baby is now weeks old and my mum is staying with me to help take care of him she wants to do everything herself bathing feeding and changing diapers she even insists on sleeping with the baby at night its my first child and i know she is just being helpful but i hardly have any chance to bond with my baby and this makes me feel miserable she makes me feel that i am a useless mother especially when she says things like you have no idea how to do this let me take over and she will just take the baby away from me without giving me a chance to try i am going back to school in oct and i really wish to spend as much time as possible with my baby now it is one of two things first she is feeling guilty about being a poor mother to you and is trying to make it up to herself by doing the things she knows she should have done for your for your child or she is right sometimes mothers are just intuitively right and your mother knows you are a poor mother lets hope not but we all know there are mothers out there reading this right now who are letting their kids roam the streets who are spending grocery money on drugs who are beating and hurting their kids your reference to going back to school kind of puts me on a track you are a young kid probably not yet and the childs dad is not on the scence if this is the case talk to your mom and tell her not to do it for you but to show you how you might really need the help but she may not know how to give it very well you guys will need to talk but if she gives you grief you may have to be the parent and tell her you need the help but cant take it the way she is giving it About a Boy EastEnders Parenting Social rule Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Knots Landing Grandview, U.S.A.
