what do you think of the duggar family of arkansas having now children naturally at this point i'm betting they'll have they keep on saying they want more my eyes are still wide in disbelief yes one of my grandmothers had children naturally but that was a different time and place i just can't imagine having over children a family in this day and age me personally i'd be happy with just one child is my limit and maybe if i'm ever really wealthy and have at least one set of twins well i have to say these are really good answers i'm glad the family finds a way to make ends meet and accommodate every child they have but yeah it is a little freaky i think one of the reasons why they use so many old fashioned hand me down self made clothes is because of money issues i'm sure because let's be honest buying a wardrobe at a regular store is pretty expensive over time imagine trying to buy like now wardrobes every year and yes population is a concern and i do figure their old fashioned christian values have something to do with why they obviously don't use birth control tube tying methods etc and let's face it there's children in smaller households that are completely neglected so of course not every child in that family will feel their needs met i wonder if any of them have moved out of the house or going to college katrina when i say natural i mean without ivf which if she is quiverfull would be against her religion i know she had one cesarean and the lastest one she had a vbac vaginal birth after cesarean which i've never heard of before i saw the documentary on them a few days ago on discovery health but it must've been filmed a few years ago because they only had kids at the time and she was pregnant with her th child if you haven't seen the documentary i highly suggest it they are part of the quiverfull sect of christianity do a search for it it'll freak you out there were multiple things that weirded me out about this family for one the way this family looked was unreal from the little house on the prairie clothes the girls were wearing to the mom's hairdo that looked like she uses a bottle of aquanet daily the other thing that weirded me out about this family was the homeschooling and the mom being the teacher she was teaching the young ones about bankruptcy what kind of homeschooling is that i feel sorry for the older kids because rather than having a chance to be a kid and develop to find out who they are they are forced to become young surrogate parents by taking care of the little ones it is not fair to any child to have to care for another child and to put this burden on her children is just plain selfish it's a good thing they live in the boonies of arkansas because they would never ever survive in an urban or suburban environment for that matter if her kids ever went to a public school or college which i seriously doubt since they seem to stress having litters of kids i don't think the kids would be able to cope people should have as many kids as they can financially emotionally physically and spiritually afford they might have the financial part down but if her other kids have to take care of her younger kids then she's not really being a parent i too believe that it's people like this as to why there is overpopulation in the world i guess they think the world has infinite resources i don't want to be mean but there's a bumper sticker that i've seen that says stupid people are breeding you make the connection and in response to cowgirl below no my answer was not hateful the fact is that the children born into this family do not have a choice they don't have a choice to go out and make friends and socialize with others outside of their family go to a public school what clothes to wear etc these actions are very similar to a brain washing cult children form their own identities and develop a sense of who they are by being allowed to make choices and being given the opportunity to become independent the kids in this family never get that opportunity because they are too busy caring for the younger siblings to deprive a child a chance to grow experiment and learn about themselves and other things in the world is just plain selfish and bad parenting what happens if the parents die unexpectedly the older kids will be left with the burden of caring for the rest and or the children will have to go into the foster system there's a reason why there's a saying everything in moderation excess is hardly ever a good thing Abortion debate Homeschooling Infantilism Gender role Adoption
