when you have a baby toddler and you have to go to the bathroom or take a shower do you take them with you or what do you do i was just thinking about this today while i was watching my friends little kid when you have a baby say in one of those slings on you or one of those front pack carriers do you take it off and set them down or take them too or what if you have a crazy toddler who gets into everything i am not a parent yet in case anyone asks i'm and am getting ready to plan a family common sense tells me when you have a baby youd just put them in the swing or something or go while they're sleeping but i dunno about the rest just being curious hahahaha i love this question because i am a sahm and i wish i could go to the bathroom without a toddler banging on the door there are a few things i do i will put him in his crib and give him a book and a toy this usually buys me about minutes for a shower and then i blow dry with him in the room with me i figure if he hates it crying for minutes will not kill him and i can get some privacy while i am washing my ahem never mind i wait until he sleeps when he was younger he would take a morning nap for minutes everyday at a m that was my getting ready time too bad for me he is down to one nap a day when i go the the bathroom i just close the door i am so rude and he cries because he can't be in there with me but again seconds is not going to kill him and he learns that everyone needs some time when all else fails i put him in his highchair turn on his baby einstein and get ready then he really really loves those shows who knew i have heard of people telling their kids to sing them a song through the door while they go to the bathroom my son isn't quite there but i thought that was kind of a creative answer they have something to keep them occupied and you get your time alone Shaggy dog story Friends Phoebe Buffay's songs Jon Secada Episodes of Lost (Season 1) EastEnders Knots Landing Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart The Shining (film) Avenue Q Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Catcher in the Rye 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Columbine High School massacre The Star Wars Holiday Special Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
