how do i accept my son with a mental disability this if very difficult to ask and i would appreciate it if you could refrain from bible bashing me or telling me i'm satan i have gorgeous kids my year old daughter is super intelligent and we've been having in depth conversations since she was my son is two and a half and has epilepsy and developmental delay we don't know if it's permanent but i suspect he has a permanent mental disability from talking to his doctors and therapists i always knew i could handle a child with a physical disability but i always dreaded having a child with an intellectual disability people say as long as he's happy or tell me they work with mentally challenged adults and they are doing well but in truth no fully functioning adult or child wants to be friends with a person with a mental deficiency he will never get married or have a job i may have to care for him until i die and i am having a lot of trouble accepting this how do i come to terms with my future and his um that should be is not if sorry honey it's not true that no fully functioning adult or child wants to be friends with a person with a mental deficiency in actual fact the world is a scarier more hateful place for those of us with a fully functioning brain than it is for people with an intellectual disability you don't know yet if he will never get married many people with an intellectual disability go on to have normal happy wonderful rich full lives fall in love get married live happier ever after you also don't know if he'll ever have a job he's only two and a half many things could change between now and when he is grown don't borrow this trouble from the future as worrying about it now won't make it easier to deal with when the time comes it'll just mean that you wasted years of your life worrying i have a child with a permanent physical disability he is extremely intelligent in many areas but in other areas he is a little delayed i too have worried about how he will cope with friends whether he will have any whether he will be bullied will he ever find someone to love him will he get married what will happen to him after i die but there is no answer to these questions and worrying about them is doing me no good all i can do is focus on putting my energy into loving him and making his childhood something special incidentally he has many many friends his personality is charming and cheeky and he has no enemies whatsoever he is the favourite amongst his cousins he has a male cousin the same age who considers him his best friend and as close as a brother stop trying to come to terms with your future and his there's a long time for that come to terms with it when it gets here for now just keep putting one foot in front of the other i can't stress this enough there's no value in obsessing over something you can't change just deal with the here and now and the rest takes care of itself oh and try to stop comparing your children because consciously or unconsciously you are doing that in a way focusing on your daughter's intelligence and your son's lack of same will just cause you to miss out on his strengths my daughters too are very intelligent so i understand your pride in her achievement but it will only harm you all to compare two such different children who knows your son may even have normal intelligence he may just be a little slower in getting there but because your daughter was so bright in comparison it makes him seem less so your son will have his own strengths give him time to develop them and work on bonding with him and discovering his talents and special qualities the same way you did with your daughter your son is a special beautiful child in his own right and his intellectual capacity doesn't define him in any way what will define him is his support network his opportunities the way he is treated by his loved ones and the expectations you place on him don't sell him short but instead encourage him to reach for the stars he may just surprise you by getting there Autism EastEnders Infantilism Asperger syndrome Social rule Human Charmed Unemployment Theory of conduct Intelligence quotient Autism rights movement Reparative therapy Milton H.
