spanking does anyone else have this dilemma with family or friends ok i have gorgeous kids they're pretty good for the most part occasionally act out like all kids do i've always been a 'spanker' but lately i've been reading up researching talking to other moms etc and i'm seriously trying to move away from spanking i've never really felt right doing it i'm finding other methods work as well if not better anyway the problem i have is that i was brought up as was my husband in a very 'pro spank' family not that they're abusive but they believe greatly in spare the rod and spoil the child now that i'm trying to stop spanking they're all being extremely critical and are criticising me for taking notice of 'new age nonsense' i'm just trying to understand my children better and discipline them the best way i can i really feel more in control not spanking and much calmer i didn't really believe that was possible lol has anyone else experienced this or have any suggestions all advice welcome i have exactly the same problem with my family they are all very 'pro smacking' also except in their case that is all they use they will refuse to even consider a different form of discipline i also tend to think about things from a child's perspective and try to get through to their little minds children are so much smarter than we give them credit for but i think a lot of people don't like to be open to other options and possiblities i know in my family the concept of 'lifetime learning' is absolutely lost you just need to be firm don't explain yourself and don't justify what you are doing this sounds like you're making excuses which you don't need to do just tell them that you're very happy with your children's overall behaviour and you're pleased that you've found a discipline method that suits you well whatever that may be if they continue just nod and smile and say well the results speak for themselves they will either give up or you will have to really tell them to butt out just remember usually when people push that hard over something it's because of their own insecurities about it good luck hope this helps Spanking Theory of conduct Corporal punishment James Dobson Social rule Infantilism 2000 Australian Grand Prix Scientology beliefs and practices Past teachings of Prem Rawat The nature of God in Western theology Kodocha Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Transactional analysis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Microeconomics Current teachings of Prem Rawat Prisoner's dilemma Adult attention-deficit disorder Theodicy Erotic spanking Religion Falsifiability Laura Schlessinger Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Rich Mullins Shaggy dog story Doug The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Extreme Programming Milton H.
