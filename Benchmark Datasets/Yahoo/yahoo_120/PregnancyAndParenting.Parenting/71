please help why doesn't my son listen okay well my son is ending his terrible twos on october th and i'm sure it'll become terrible threes my son has been getting worse he won't do simple things like pull up his pants put his shoes on turn off the t v he's sooo hard headed i just can't get through to him he's a smart kid but so hard headed what can i do he also pushes his sister right infront of me and time out is not working neither is ignoring me what can i do please help twos and three's are always loads of fun children are testing you to see how far they can push you before you snap if you are not an advocate of spanking a child then its up to you to find alterior ways to get him to listen young children often find things easier to deal with and listen better when you make things like dressing and other small chores fun make games of doing things like putting on his cloths and helping mommy with household stuff to help him learn the importance of doing things like turning off the television cleaning up his toys and being nice to his sister as for being hard headed the best way i have found to deal with a child like that i have three is to be hard headed right back you say he ignores you and doesnt pay attention to time out and taking things away from him well next time he demands a drink or wants something that is not a necessity ignore him for a few moments when he gets frustrated sit him down and explain to him that he didnt like being ignored or you not doing what he wanted you to do tell him that mommy doesnt like it when he does it to her either if he wants something extra from you he is going to have to do the things you ask as well when dealing with a toddler ages until about you have to be firm in your stand deal punishment out as soon as he doesn't listen or breaks a rule i know it sounds harsh but when he pushes his sister push him back he will learn that its not fun and everytime he does it he gets it done to him and he will eventually stop children learn by example most do not realize at young ages that pushing biting hitting kicking can actually cause pain if you do the same back to him dont hurt him but let him feel what his sister or the other child did he will figure out that its not as fun as he thought it was a tap on the diaper will get his attention and make him listen to you nothing as harsh as a spanking of course but kinda like swatting at a bug or something that may have landed on him soft but firm to get his attention he will act like his heart is broken but when he realizes mommy is not going to put up with his behavior and that he doesnt like the consequences he will stop or slow this behavior make sure you let him know and keep reminding him you love him but you are the mommy and he has to listen to what you tell him be firm be consistant and be loving but do not give in to his behavior just to make him happy or because you are worried he may think you dont love him a child who is shown discipline in their young life grows to understand and respect their parents more as they get older Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Pitaten Spanking Aerial (dance move) Blood on the Tracks Milton H.
