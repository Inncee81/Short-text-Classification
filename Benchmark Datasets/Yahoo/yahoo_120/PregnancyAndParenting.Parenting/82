how much education should be on the part of the parent here's the background my daughter's daycare is a place where the children have been together since their first year it is wonderful the kids are happy safe and actually look forward to it the parents have bonded and we do many things together outside of the school they do learn in themes but their themes may be butterflies or growing things etc this year many parents started pulling their children out of daycare because as they attempted to enroll their children in kindergarten they were told the children did not have the skills needed to start i e letters numbers shapes i feel that if she is happy and safe i can pick up the slack at home by teaching her letters and numbers i am a teacher and know what to teach and how so now my friends and i are at odds because i think that some education is part of the parent's job what do you think i also run into this problem in my school there are only so many hours in the day to teach i am a first grade teacher i agree with you if your child is happy there why ruin a good thing parents today are often lazy and assume that the school is responsible for everything i have had parents tell me it is my job to teacher their kids how to behave properly not the parent just look over the list of needed skills for kindergarten and work on those at home Kindergarten Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Hong Kong Education in the United States Avenue Q Education in Germany Education in Australia Murdock-Portal Elementary School Education in Taiwan Kodocha Education Waldorf Education Education in Japan Homeschooling Kender Boston Public Primary education One Tree Hill (TV series) No Child Left Behind Act School choice Teacher Hikikomori Grade (education) The Fairly OddParents The Catcher in the Rye Education reform Education in South Korea Culture of the United States Charter school Education in India Milton H.
