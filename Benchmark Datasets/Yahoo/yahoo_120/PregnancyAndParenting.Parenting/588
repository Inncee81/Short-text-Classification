how do we discipline our kids i have lil girls yrs old and the other one is yr old sometimes i have a hard time reprimanding them coz they won't listen they frequently fight w each other and the usual reason is they fight over for a toy or even our attention pls give me some good advise and year olds have a hard time sharing anything they haven't developed the ability to understand taking turns i don't think it as much about reprimanding as it is about teaching them how you expect them to behave it means alot of time on the floor with them showing them how explain what you want them to do clearly e i i know you want to play with the toy your sister has when she is done you can have a turn make sure that the person waiting for the toy has a turn soon after that e i your sister has been waiting to play with the toy let's let her have a turn and you can play with i use a naughty chair with my year old if he is out of control and won't listen i sit him in the chair and tell him what he is there for throwing his juice cup hitting biting ect i tell him he needs to sit for two minutes and set the timer on the microwave if he gets up before the two minutes are done almost a given i put him back in the chair after the timer goes off i tell him again what he is in the chair for and ask him to apologize for his behavior when i first started having him apologize for his behavior my husband thought i was nuts but now he will say sorry for throwing juice mommy so he is getting it at some level i also make sure i praise him alot when he is doing something that we have asked him to do he is responding well and alot of the behaviors that were driving us crazy are getting better as for the attention issue we have kids that never goes away our year old still fights as much as the year old to get our attention we try really hard to make sure that they all get at least an hour a week by themselves with one of us to do something they want to do or just to talk it's alot of work but it is also alot of fun Milton H.
