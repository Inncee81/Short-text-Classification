finally we see kate mccann admitting that they did wrong by leaving the children alone in her first solo interview kate admits that if she had thought for one second she would have realised that leaving the children was wrong so they failed to think even for a second about the welfare of their children as they leave them night after night to go drinking i wonder if gerry will now admit he was less than a perfect parent luis very common i dont know where you come from what cultural difference i am english it is certainly not common to leave children alone because everybody knows its dangerous its also against the law i really dont know where you get your information from aptly named retard boy i'm not commenting on the crime aledgedly committed by the kidnapper if there is one i'm commenting on the mccann's serial neglect of their three children you are correct it is against the law in the uk in portugal where it happened and in nearly all the other european countries it would be interesting to hear from the first person to answer just what country they think it is legal in madeline was sadly snatched because the parents broke the criminal law of portugal by neglecting all their children and leaving them alone the parents claim fifty yards away but they left the door unlocked so the children could have walked out straight into the swimming pool and drown before they could get to them i would argue that they continue to neglect the other two children by hauling them around dumping them on relatives and denying them any form of proper home security the real tragedy may be that in defending leaving the children they will suck in the gullible people some on here already who will think it ok to leave their own children or encourage others to do so that would open the door for more children to be snatched the mccann family should be saying loud and clear learn from us and never leave your children unattended EastEnders 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Avenue Q Appeal Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Capital punishment Kidnapping Plame affair Shaggy dog story Celtic F.C.
