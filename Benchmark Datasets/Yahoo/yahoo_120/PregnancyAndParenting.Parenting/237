am i a bad parent my ten year old son only wears crocs to school and the rest of the time he is barefoot and my six year old has never had any thing on his feet i always go barefoot my self because today we went to walmart and my kids wear the only kids just wearing there bathing suits we wear all barefoot and my kids did not have shirts on you are a far better parent than all those people who believe in myths and unfounded fears of every little germ their children may encounter and who give in to social pressure based on such unfounded beliefs contrary to those myths going barefoot is very healthy even in a city environment disease is unlikely unless they put their feet on the table or lick their toes our skin is made to keep pathogens out and we're at far greater risk of picking something up through our hands dirt from the ground may be more visible but with our hands we touch surfaces touched by many other people door knobs railings shopping carts etc and pick up the far less visible but no less germy dirt from those then we're far more likely to transfer those germs to our faces or food where they can enter our body on our feet it may look dirty but the dirt will just sit there until we wash it off parasites are unlikely too far most only enter the body by ingestion the hookworm that can enter through the skin has been pretty much eradicated from the south since modern plumbing has replaced the outhouses and never was a problem in cooler climates injury is unlikely feet get very tough very quickly i go barefoot everywhere never divert my step no matter how much glass i see and i get a tiny splinter maybe once a year never had a cut in the unlikely case of an injury they should have their tetanus vaccinations up to date but any active kid or adult should have that there are other ways of catching it apart from stepping on a rusty nail barefoot about social pressures please dare to be different people who wear alternative dress make the world more interesting imagine we'd all wear the same fashion clothes teach your children to accept people who prefer to look different rather than to 'dress for success' the first is a much more important lesson to learn if you ask me don't raise them to become judgmental like some of the posters in this thread Diving Barefoot Skateboarding trick Clothing Spanking Aerial (dance move) Japanese tea ceremony Volleyball Oral sex Decompression sickness Undergarment Customs and etiquette of Japan Social aspects of clothing Foodborne illness Wound Sento Human sexual behavior Comanche Paul Is Dead Tattoo Hygiene Textile manufacturing Fecal incontinence Softball Allergy Infantilism Pneumonia Irish dance Autism Common cold Columbine High School massacre Tetanus Diving suit Drowning Horse Skin Psoriasis Fast bowling M16 (rifle) Poliomyelitis Asperger syndrome Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hookworm Textile manufacturing terminology Tire Drill bit Toilet Electrophysiology Hazing Biological warfare Urinary incontinence Horseshoe Dairy Ascariasis Boston Public Figure skating Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Sauna Professional wrestling match types Fencing Codename: Kids Next Door The Fairly OddParents Gender role Trailer Park Boys Vampire Nuclear fallout Milton H.
