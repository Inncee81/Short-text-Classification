would you leave your three year old to babysit younger sister and brother while you go and have fun i was disgussted to learn that madeleines mother and father left madeleine alone with their other children whom are younger then madeleine yet they expected madeleine to baby sit if they wake up i just like to know how many parents are actually willing to leave a three year old alone let alone leave three year old in charge of younger sister and brothers i was in the park yesterday with our six year old and three year old i was amazed to see how much all mums and dads were alert about their childrens where abouts although the children were playing within the covered grounds of the park yet due to recent events most people felt that may be they are not doing enough to protect their children although whatever has happened to madeleine is not other peoples fault most people we met were just as amazed to hear that parents have left three year old madeleine alone i thought i must be the only feeling strange however it does bring questions why did they left her alone no i would not leave my year alone let alone to babysit my younger children best of all i would not leave my year old to baby sit my three year old i think this story about maddy has gone too far yes we feel bad that she is gone missing but its also irresponsible of her parents to leave her the way they did it might have been wise to get a child minder or a baby sitter to do the job at least you know they are safe you save few quids but you lose a daughter that is sad but i dont think its wise for the rest of us to sit on the bench and feel unsafe this world is not a totally bad place i take our children to the park yes i keep an eye on them but i did notice some people smother their children due to what has happenend its no body's fault but their own live and let live enjoy life while you can and be safe Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Neighbours About a Boy Kodocha One Tree Hill (TV series) Kyle Broflovski Charmed Garfield Pitaten The Fairly OddParents Rais massacre The Shining (film) The Lovely Bones Night (book) Everwood Melanie Wilkes Romulus and Remus Infantilism Father's Day (Doctor Who) Knots Landing General Protection Fault (comic) Darth Vader Wolfrider Angel Sanctuary The Ashlee Simpson Show Jon Secada Line of succession to the British Throne Pip (South Park episode) Miss Saigon Hollyoaks Dead Like Me The Family from One End Street W.I.T.C.H.
