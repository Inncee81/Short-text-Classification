would you use a babysitter that you don't feel warm and fuzzy about i interviewed a babysitter that one of my good friends recommended she's a college grad and works with autistic kids and is looking to babysit to supplement her income i have three kids one with high functioning autism so i figured she's be perfect my kids liked her she played nicely with my kids while i interviewed her but i felt like she didn't really enjoy kids or at least mine she went overboard reprimanding my barely year old daughter to say please every seconds while i was right there made some disdainful comments when my son showed her his new pirate sword she doesn't like toys that are weapons and about them watching tv they were watchign dora so i could interview her in peace she said well at least its educational i'm sure she'd take great care of my kids but i just didn't get warm and fuzzy feelings from her am i asking too much previous to this i've pretty much only had my mother babysit so i'm feeling lost thanks for any input just wanted to add in case it makes a difference that this would be a babysitter i'd use on weekends occasionally if my husband and i wanted to go out to dinner i'm at sahm but overall i'm so happy to hear you all pretty much feel the same way i do i thought i was being way too picky and asked this question to see what others thought thanks everyone she's sounds like she's using her educational knowledge a little over the top when i first got out of college degree in child development i was the same way constantly applying what i learned in school to my every day world it doesn't really work that way and as i learned when i had kids and as i'm sure she'll eventually learn you can't raise and work with kids exactly the way they teach you in school and books not every yr kid says the word please for every single thing a little tv isn't going to kill them etc but it's what she's learned in school she's going a little over board and needs to lighten up just a tad if you don't get the warm and fuzzy feeling about her when you leave and you're out you're going to have some worry on your mind what is she saying to my kids what are they doing now it's not a feeling you want to have i would want a babysitter who i know will take good care of my kids keep them safe enforce the rules but not go over board and whom my kids enjoy while i'm away not only should you have that warm fuzzy feeling about them but the sitter should have it for you too with every family i babysat nannied for as a teen and my early twenties i enjoyed the kids and the parents if i didn't i stopped you're not asking for too much i'd give her a shot let her come once or twice and see how it goes see what your kids think about her what she does while you're away and see what she does says when you call to check up on things don't be afraid to call best wishes Day care The Fairly OddParents Humphrey Bogart Autism Infantilism EastEnders Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Marilyn Monroe Baby Blues Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) About a Boy Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) One Tree Hill (TV series) Poker jargon Mina Mongoose Philosophical skepticism Controversies in autism Milton H.
