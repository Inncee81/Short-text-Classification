if people have children shouldn't they educate themselves about child development i'm now sitting in a computer lab at a college there is a single mother here with her son who is almost and is now cranky he keeps crying and she keeps telling him to shut up and that people are trying to work here i can't help but think that if she knew anything about child development at all she would realize that his behavior is normal and that it's pointless to tell him to behave differently what are your thoughts nadadime i'm not putting down single parents in fact i was raised by a single mother and i still have a great deal of respect for her i reckon people should have to go through a course on parenting before they have children it makes my stomach churn to see most of the parenting i see but then i think most people should have to go through a course on growing up before they marry too it's much more important than most of what we learn at school Controversies in autism About a Boy Friends Shaggy dog story Autism Economic inequality Milton H.
