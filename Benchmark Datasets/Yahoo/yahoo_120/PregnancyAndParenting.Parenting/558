would you punish your child's friend if for example your child and his hers friend are with you on a campingtrip or even on a day out at the beach or at the the mall and they get into trouble you decide to punish youc child for what he she has done would you also punish his hers friend the same way would you contact the friends parents first or would you just tell them when you returned i was once spanked by my best friends dad when me and my friend were with them for a weekend at there log cabin in the mountains and it was the most humiliating thing i ever experienced as a child as i can remember anyway with the kids that come over to my house i make sure to set the rules right off the bat usually if the child is misbehaving my child is also involved get to know the child before you take them to a camping trip or some place that you cannot get the child off your hands if both of the children are doing something that is not safe then they should both go to time out there is no reason why your child should be punished and the other gets to do what ever they both did the crime so they both do the time you already know that spanking is not an option talk to the parent and let them know what you plan to do if they don't like that then they can just come and pick up their little one the rules should be the same for everyone Spanking Punishment Social rule The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Erotic spanking Married... with Children About a Boy Human sexual behavior Parenting Friends James Dobson Child time-out 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Serial killer Ageplay Theory of conduct The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete Rocko's Modern Life Paddle (spanking) Jonestown Domestic violence Billy the Kid Hazing Dogville FoxTrot Recurring South Park characters Final Fantasy: Unlimited Fathers' rights Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism The Catcher in the Rye Mojave people Humphrey Bogart Father Kevin and Kell Caning Futurama (TV series - season 2) Children of God Baroque chess Kender Kyle Broflovski Patrice Lumumba The Family from One End Street The Human Stain John the Baptist Birthday No Child Left Behind Act School discipline Cindy Sheehan RuneScape quests Negima Queen of Wands Football (soccer) Theodicy Plame affair timeline Codename: Kids Next Door My Parents are Aliens Great Teacher Onizuka The Giver Plame affair The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Hey Arnold!
