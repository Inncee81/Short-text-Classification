how to nicely say your kids are monsters okay i won't use that as my reason but still some wording help please i babysit kids aged and they are complete monsters in therapy troubled emotionally disturbed learning disabled on top of two families coming together with a death of a parent on one side and an abusive mother on the other i just cannot do it i'm not qualified don't have the experience plus you can't talk to these parents because they always have an excuse for the kids behavior they had a bad home life his dad died i mean sad yes but not an excuse to break a kids finger in summer school or choke your sister how do i nicely say not only do i not want to stay at your house with them for days while youre on your honeymoon but i never want to watch your kids again i want to say it nicely and professionally how to do that another thing i assume i should give weeks notice like any other job or just hey don't come back tomorrow which i would prefer lol sigh i think that you definately need to get yourself out of that situation especially if you have already tried to talk to the parents and it's just not working the one thing that i've learned over the years of working is that if you're miserable at work then you can bring that misery home with you there's nothing worse than dreading going to work everyday and wishing you could be somewhere else i would give them my two weeks notice and let them know that you have tried everything that you can to make the situation work for you but that you just feel as though your not qualified enough to take care of children with such special needs unfortunately these children have been through a lot in their young lives but it looks like the parents need to take more responsibility in helping them rather than just making excuses for them Domestic violence Pitaten The Fairly OddParents Transsexuality Milton H.
