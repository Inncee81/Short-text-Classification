what to do with a stubborn argumentive dramatic yr old help i have a daughter that will be very soon i swear from the moment she was born she was difficult didn't sleep through the night until she was years old literally woke up very easily and screamed for an hour never liked to be held never liked to be put down this same baby is now almost and doesn't ever shut her mouth she's already been asked to leave one daycare because she is so high need so now she is in pre school and i'm starting to get soft complaints about her arguing talking back and sassy attitude on the flip side i am going through a divorce from her dad who she is crazy about he lives in another country we don't have family around us to help she is a sweet sweet child that shares easily and will help any child who has fallen or hurt themselves she extremely physically affectionate but my problem is i am worn out from constant battles if i say the sky is blue she will argue that it isn't and yes i have spanked time outs and point system etc i just wanted to say thanks for the mostly helpful answers and to ka i have heard of that term and i will look into it more thanks for your wonderful advice and also to suthernyankee too i do praise her a lot whenever she does something good she is very pleased with herself when that happens and i reward her to keep it up right now i'm promising disneyland and she does see the value in that reward lol it's nice to know i'm not the only one my friends kids seem to be so normal they seem to learn their lesson after punishments mine doesnt anyways thanks for all the wonderful comments keep them coming you just described my second child you have what is known in positive parenting circles as a spirited child google it she is intelligent and she knows it she is willful and her independence must be recognized she is more intense more sensitive and more emotional than children of different temperments she needs firm limits and you will have to enforce them often it is critical that you establish your role as the authority figure and fast also be sure you have some support from family or friends because a child with this temperament is exhausting the best thing you can do is educate yourself about spirited children and learn how to address your daughters needs catch her being good is one of the most effective methods of guiding her to appropriate behavior discipline is required for inappropriate behavior but positive reinforcement is much more powerful with this kind of child find out what her passion is my daughter is very tactile and she enjoys arts and crafts at i gave her macaroni dry beans and glue on foam trays the raised edge kept the glue contained fingerpainting with pudding or shaving cream was loads of fun shaving cream is easier to clean up as she got older i involved her a lot in food preparation kneading dough and rolling out her own pizza crust or cookies snapping green beans even washing plastic dishes was enjoyable to her if you can enroll her in gymnastics or martial arts classes the focus and discipline of those activites will help her channel her energy into something productive i encourage you to read a few books and work on catching her being good good luck Spanking The Apprentice 2 Martial art Tai Chi Chuan Kodocha W.I.T.C.H.
