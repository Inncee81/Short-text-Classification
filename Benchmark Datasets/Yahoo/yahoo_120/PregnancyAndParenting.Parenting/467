parents with experience with this when will it start to work my son just started taking mg focalin days ago wednesday on the first day i thought i was seeing a change but when i gave it to him thursday it had a small effect if any at all its bad enough that i didn't want to give him the meds to begin with but i know he needs them and it seems like its not working i was hoping to see a change before school starts for him week and days approximately how long does it take for a full effect to take place like when did you parents that have kids or know people that have kids with adhd on focalin notice a total change in your child did it take days weeks thanks i know what you are going through my eyes are watering now thinking back when i found out about my older son at the age of years of age was diagnosed withtourette syndrome and adhd it is really hard for me thinking about my son and other parent that are going through the same thing as i am and struggling life can be hard and we as parents struggle on a daily basis to learn and understand all that needs to be understood and acknowlede everything around us with the concerns of certain medicines that our children have to endure i would have to say that it all depends on the child and the medicine from a few days to even a month i went to a tourette syndrome ts support group and i have learned from other parents that some med's do not work at all and they have to change med's untill the right one works which is also hard on the child and the parent the one that you said focalin was not good at least that is what was said for about parents at the ts support group there were a couple of parents that would not use med's at all one of the parent's that did not use med's for several years untill the their child said they want to use med's because they were tired of going through the changes and because of peer pressure and fortunetly the med's worked for them my son is taking the medicine called tenex he is on a very low dose mg tenex is uses for ts and adhd i had told the dr that i really did not want him to take anything but i was stressing out so much and so was my child and the rest o the family i felt that i had to do something i told the dr that i wanted my son to be on something that is not strong but will do the work the medicine took about a month to see a big difference yes at first you will see a big difference and then change like its not working but after a while it the med's started to work my child started out with of the pill morning noon and night everyday and now at the age of he is taking at morning pill noon and night pill my son is doing a lot better now if you do not feel that the dr is not right like a quack dr for you then you have the right to change if feel uncomfortable with the certain med's that your son is taking then definatle speak your peace and if need be get a second opinion you are the boss of your child i wish you best of luck on you your son and your family with this challenging time i know we will be strong for our children ears we listen soft sounds of children's laughter's echoing afar children prancing around like feathers drifting in a breeze of air to gain the balance of living the breath that was given the flow of warming thoughts that may run through your heart knowing and understanding our growing children as they blossom with elegance boundaries of unknown nature may await their curiosity sorry if their is mis spelled words the spell check was not working and sorry if this was too long for you but i felt i wanted to make a point because i am going through with experiance hang in there and have happy thoughts Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Social rule Prostate cancer Asperger syndrome Asthma Adult attention-deficit disorder Controversies in autism Breastfeeding Autism Stuttering Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Oral contraceptive Chronic fatigue syndrome Alternative medicine Prayer Mattress Pitaten Charles Darwin's illness The Contender (television series) Transactional analysis Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Extreme Programming About a Boy Current teachings of Prem Rawat Traumatic brain injury Androgen insensitivity syndrome Jon Secada Scenes from a Memory Dyslexia Characters in the Smurfs Time Out of Mind Hearing impairment Stomach cancer The Ashlee Simpson Show Urinary incontinence Laura Schlessinger Hypoglycemia Acute respiratory distress syndrome Folic acid Blood on the Tracks Past teachings of Prem Rawat Abortion debate Ocean's Twelve Methylphenidate Medicine The Catcher in the Rye 2000 Australian Grand Prix Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Haven (TNG episode) Carpal tunnel syndrome Kurt Cobain Kender Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Giver Drowning StarCraft: Uprising Sant Thakar Singh Schizophrenia Book of Isaiah Child sexuality The Emancipation of Mimi Milton H.
