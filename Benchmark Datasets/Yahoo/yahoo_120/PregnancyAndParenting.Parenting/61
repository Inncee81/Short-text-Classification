to all parents who think it's ok to spank please read the link http www cnn com health nfm spanking index html there are many many others like this available for all to read yet still people cannot see the truth there's no point trying to talk about a difference between spankings and abuse the results of all these studies talk about spanking not physical abuse although some may argue that spanking is in fact abuse my it is genuinely sad the way people are unable to understand such an easy concept i guess it goes to prove the theory that spanking children really does harm them as all the answers from spankers shows an ignorance and sadly a determination to keep on abusing their children and not learning how to be a proper parent oh and yes i have children all together only is still at home all of them are doing excellently well as they were brought up correctly i am obviously unable to choose a best answer as none of them speak any sense but i will add a link to parenting without spanking and hopefully at least some people will read it and learn from it http wwwparenting ivillage com tp tpbehavior r html me you're very defensive and spending a lot of time revising your answer for someone who is so sure that what they're doing is right remember i'm only putting the question out there you are choosing to respond to it over and over again that's fine i welcome your input but is it me who's shoving my opinion down everyone elses throat 'olschoolmom' i would expect nothing more from you i've read your views on spanking before i pity your children and only hope someone reports you before it's too late for them okay glenda i don't listen to all these studies in which try to force people to believe what they believe i definitely don't listen to people like you who try to force others to think the same way you do you probably don't even have kids yourself all those studies and articals say the same thing over and over kids who are spanked are anti social violent little bullies who don't care about their actions when truly it's the exact opposite the kids who don't have any discipline and have best friends for parents rather than just parents first then best friends next are the ones who are that way why do you think so many kids and teenagers run around screaming at their parents disrepecting them and not being afraid of any consequences which leads them to not care about their actions are you blind enough not to see that there are so many people who look down on spanking today not just spanking is the problem everything besides talking time outs and grounding is considered child abuse so do you think this is just a coincidence i compare myself to me and my friend i was spanked rarely but spanked and my friend was not i respect my elders never got in real trouble with the law or at school never been suspended have lots of friends a happy person never been in a fist fight never went as far as a lot of kids have gone where people just throw it off as a phase wheras my friend was never spanked has hit his mother cussed her out on a daily basis tells her to shut up a very violent person who has even hit me and other friends he has has been in trouble with the police numerous of times even went as far as to bribe a police officer and got in trouble for that when you tell him to do better he just says i'm not scared of nobody and where do you think he got that idea because i know for a fact she even told me and wishes she has done differently that his mother didn't want him to fear the consequences and respect out of being his mommy's best friend evidently it doesn't work like that yet so many people want to try that and they end up with a devil on their hands so are you interested in spouting more of your little studies and articals at me kids were spanked for years and years and there was no time outs and groundings and all that stuff are you saying that every kid in the world turned out to be violent anti social little bullies how about you raise your kids who are probably nonexistant the way you want to see where they end up good for you if they end up to be little angels and let other people raise their kids their way it is none of yours or the government or the people who come up with those crappy studies and articals business in anyway how other people discipline their kids Theodicy Plame
