do any parents not let their kids drink soda because your not letting them drink soda they will wind up drinking more in the future i've never really been restricted and i barelly drink soda at all and i'm really healthy i have known many kids who are restricted to soda and when they're aloud to drink it they inhale it they thinks they're so cool drinking soda and do it when ever they can to feel cool if someone offers me one i'll only have one like of the time estimating so if you gradually let them drink a bit they'll be less tempted to drink so much in the future soft drinks should be only for special occasions and cola based ones shouldn't be given to children under about because of the caffeine just think of a soft drink can as having about teaspoons of sugar for coke they add lemon oil and salt so they can squeeze in that extra teaspoons even juice needs to be restricted to one glass per day it's almost as sweet as soft drink although it does at least have vitamins juice based drinks are better as they provide more water if you start early get your kids used to watered down juice so they get less of a sugar addiction Soft drink Tea 7 Up Coca-Cola Drink The Coca-Cola Company Breakfast Fanta Lemon Lemonade Energy drink Rum Tooth Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.
