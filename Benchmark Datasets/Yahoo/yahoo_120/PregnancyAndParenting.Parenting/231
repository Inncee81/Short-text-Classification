did u cry when u child went off to school like perschool to college i'm a mother of almost four kids and never thought i would be one to cry or be upset the day any of them started school i'm a teacher and have taught numerous grades and have seen more moms cry than kids on the first day of school my oldest son's first day of kindergarten i was fine until i walked him down the driveway to the bus stop and realized what exactly was happening he got on the bus without hesitation sat down and waved good bye with a huge smile on his face not only did i start to cry i followed the bus to school and watched him get off at the front door i have no idea why i was pregnant at the time and think maybe that was some of the reason but it was a big day hopefully i won't be that emotional when he leaves for college best wishes Shaggy dog story Kodocha About a Boy School bus Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Treehouse of Horror V Recess (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Rosa Parks Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Boston Public Education in the United States Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Silent Night, Deadly Night The Fairly OddParents Phoebe Buffay's songs Kindergarten Avenue Q The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Grandview, U.S.A.
