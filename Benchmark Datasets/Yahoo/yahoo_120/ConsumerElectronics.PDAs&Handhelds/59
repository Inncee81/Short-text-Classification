help my palm z will not respond at all to hard reset soft reset charger or usb i got it for christmas and it has worked like a dream but yesterday it just stopped responding altogether i have tried both resets and charged it on the usp and the ac charger nothing works has anyone had this problem the paln website it costs to repair it since it's out of warranty day warranty since it retails for i feel it's silly to pay more than of the purchase price to fix it especially given the fact that it's only months old last week i downloaded a thirdparty game application from a palm freeware site could this have caused the malfunction this has worked before for other z s and palm owners with rechargeable batteries on yahoo answers so try this first http kb palm com srvs cgi bin webcgi exe new kb palmsupportkb case when you say will not respond does this mean your z is just blank can it turn on anyway go down to the th reset in cradle reset the z doesn't come with a cradle just the cable however try the reset according to the instructions hook up the charger and perform the reset as described this will reset the charging circuit with the battery and allow the battery to get fully charged again devices go haywire when not fully charged and will not turn on or off or just appear as dead the battery is somehow fooling the circuit to show that is fully charged when it isn't hopefully this in cradle cable reset will restore your z back to life add the programs back into the z one by one perhaps the last program you installed interfered with the z and somehow ran the battery down this can happen if you set a scheduling alarm and it gets stuck looped good luck IPod Palm OS Battery (electricity) Atari 8-bit family PlayStation Portable USB flash drive Universal Serial Bus Xbox 360 Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Laptop Fire alarm control panel Apple Computer Bicycle lighting Nickel-cadmium battery Battery electric vehicle Windows XP Musical Instrument Digital Interface Computer Xbox Digital photography PlayStation 2 Warranty Nintendo DS Floppy disk AlphaSmart Danger Hiptop Johnny 5 Pirate decryption Oscilloscope Radiation hardening Game Boy Advance Toyota Prius IBM PC compatible Nickel metal hydride Auto insurance Atari ST Professional wrestling holds IMac The Price Is Right Apple Newton Booting Airsoft Broadband Internet access Microeconomics Spyware Internet fraud Commodore 64 Thermal power station Daylight saving time Anchor Treo 650 Halting problem $ale of the Century Bluetooth Mouse (computing) Nintendo GameCube Creative Zen Common Unix Printing System Animal Crossing RFID Voice over IP Poker jargon Bob and George Compiler optimization PlayStation 3 USS Waters (DD-115) Pinball Logopolis Free software Nintendo Entertainment System USS S-35 (SS-140) Hard disk ZX Spectrum Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Weight training X86 Episodes of Lost (Season 2) System/36 IP Multimedia Subsystem Shaggy dog story Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Reset button technique Debugging American Football League Television in the United States IBook Halo: Combat Evolved Electronic amplifier
