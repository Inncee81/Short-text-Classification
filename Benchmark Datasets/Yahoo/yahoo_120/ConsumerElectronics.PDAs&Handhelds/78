what phone has the best pda like features i have a palm z that just died on me i absolutely loved all it's features i'm thinking of replacing it with a smartphone i don't need a smartphone that can go on line and all that stuff basically i just want a phone that also has the same capabilities as my z i was thinking of getting a blackberry pearl but i'm a verizon subscriber and they don't offer it i'm a little leery of getting another palm product since mine just died after months for no apparent reason should i switch to cingular also if i do get a smart phone can i just use it as an organizer without purchasing the data plan check out the htc and the newer version the htc it is the absolute best phone i have ever used or seen or even read about in all my years of product reviewing to answer your other question no you do not have to switch to cingular and i strongly recommend against it because it sucks even worse as at t than it did as cingular because verizon has their own version of the phone the mda something google around for it and ull find that proper name im too lazy it wouldnt make sense for the company to force you to buy the data plan because hardly anyone would want to buy the phone so as long as you make sure and tell them you dont want the data plan you will be okay Smartphone BlackBerry Verizon Wireless Windows Mobile Pocket PC Personal digital assistant Tungsten Handheld Cingular Wireless Palm OS T-Mobile Bluetooth Sprint Nextel Corporation Verizon Communications Symbian OS Universal Mobile Telecommunications System GSM services Treo 650 Windows CE Treo Global System for Mobile Communications Best Buy Push to talk Modem Short message service SBC Communications Voice over IP Flash memory XML Broadband Internet access Palm Pilot Mobile phone RISC AT&T Phreaking Telephone numbering plan N-Gage Surveillance Handspring IPAQ Opera (web browser) New Coke Integrated Services Digital Network Advanced Mobile Phone System Windows 2000 Digital photography IPod Skype General Packet Radio Service Zire Handheld Toll-free telephone number Gmail Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Telephone exchange International Mobile Subscriber Identity Avenue Q Vodafone 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Ebook Telephone Telephone number 9-1-1 ITU-T Palm, Inc.
