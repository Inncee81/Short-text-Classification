microdermabrasion chemical peel or facial which should i get i'm really tanned so i was wondering if the chemical peel and microdermabrasion would make me whiter since they take a layer of skin off which would be best at giving glowing clear skin microdermabrasion and chemical peels will remove skin if you do not want to loose your tan then my suggestion would be a nice deep cleasing facial your facial should include cleansing extractions exfoliation serums and a nice steaming with a wonderful nourishing mask get your shoulders massaged and you will be glowing right along with your skin save the dermabrasion and the chemical peels for those that have thick scarring or aging skin be warned however continued tanning of the face will cause you to be one of these people later Acne Skin Scar Physical attractiveness Scarification Human skin color Manicure Sunburn Plastic surgery Shampoo Psoriasis Depilation Wound healing phases Malignant melanoma Lupus erythematosus Ultraviolet Keloid Hair Weathering Sterilization (microbiology) Tuberous sclerosis Puberty Brewery Burn (injury) Side Characters (Xenosaga) Melasma Moisturizer Soap Potato Razor Leather Tutankhamun Diving suit Essential oil Massage Boom Town (Doctor Who) Beard Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Hydrogen peroxide Mummy Ulcer Kava Fecal incontinence Black (people) Phenol Tanning Orange (fruit) Rosacea Mango Allergy Dim sum Shroud of Turin Conjunctivitis Glycolic acid Perfume Plantain Pneumonia Baldness treatments Pottery Nutrition Photolithography Tasmanian Devil Ice core Mattress Ozone depletion Sperm Whale Heat exchanger Tofu Aloe Deck (ship) Sunlight The Legend of Zelda series races Dinosaur Banana Noonan syndrome Canonsburg, Pennsylvania Joker (comics) Volcano Baldness Race The Inside Ozone layer Wolverine (comics) Embalming Dialysis Aromatherapy Ozone hole Rave party Cleanser Eczema Welding Apple Mount St. Helens Cosmetics Chemical engineering Upholstery Petroleum Fluorescent lamp
