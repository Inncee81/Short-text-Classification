just got my tongue pierced jad my tongue done days ago it didnt hurt but now i have a sharp pain in the very tip and from the ball underneath to the tip when i try to curl it up or stretch it out is that normal and will it go away and why does it do that well you asked the question days ago so hopefully the pain will have died down a little i've had mine done days ago and noticed a sharpish pain when i tried to curl the tongue around the piercing but that was also because the swelling had gone right down and the bar was able to slide up and down quite a lot if yours is still swollen i'd say swill some salty water a teaspoon of salt in half a cup of hot water topped up to a full cup with cold water should do it also invest in some mouthwash that's not alcohol based and swill that times per day that will reduce the risk of infection and hopefull take the pain away in a day or two if your tongue's still swollen make sure you have some crushed ice and allow it to melt around the tongue which will help the swelling to come down lastly try some ibuprofen which might help with the swelling and pain a little good luck Body piercing Mouth ulcer Glacier Halitosis Professional wrestling holds Glossitis First aid Tongue piercing Nipple piercing Carpal tunnel syndrome Tea Group A streptococcal infection Sodium chloride Traumatic brain injury Penis Dehydration Tattoo Water (molecule) Trumpet Sea ice Coffee Intravenous therapy Gout Happy Tree Friends Breastfeeding Bruise Corrosion Diving Naruto jutsu Lip piercing Cramp Menstrual cup Curling Mosquito Spark plug Tongue Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Earring Death Valley National Park Harmonica Acupuncture Cocaine Internal ballistics Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Baseball Paracetamol Decompression sickness Ice cream Sunburn Piccolo Junior Saga Franklin Pierce Osteoarthritis Beer Pong Trapping Oral sex Manicure Soldering Natural disaster Deluge (prehistoric) Surfing Phimosis Mayonnaise Swimming Violin Nasal congestion Tsunami Cancer Casting Bong Effects of global warming Angioedema Hepatitis Sea level rise Methamphetamine Hip fracture Dead Sea Fast bowling Shark Dental caries Chocolate Salty Balls Psoriasis RuneScape weapons Equine conformation Creatures in Bionicle Metroid Prime Radiation therapy Prince Albert piercing Common cold Ear piercing instrument Salt Pharyngitis Cat Thermal power station Gonorrhoea Vinegar Otitis externa Snooker Malaria Weight training Snake
