why do some people have half moon like markings on their fingernails where your skin meets the fingernail some people have a white or light colored half moon or circle some don't and i have them only on my thumbs why is this everyone has half moons on some people they don't show because they are hidden under the cuticle i only have them on my thumbs also if you get in the habit of pushing back the cuticles every time you wash your hands eventually they will stay back and reveal the half moons i just never think about it because i wear nail polish most of the time never push them back with harsh instruments as you can really cause a bad infection that is also very painful the cuticles are a sensitive area of the nail bed Manicure Nail (anatomy) Hair Milton H.
