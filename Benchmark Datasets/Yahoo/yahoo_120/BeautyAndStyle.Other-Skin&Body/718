can a get a tan if i layout on the hammock in my backyard i have a lot of summer homework to do so i figure if i do it in my hammock i would be able to get a tan while i do it except theres no pool around its just grass and i heard that grass absorbs teh sunlight so that i wouldnt be able to tan yes you can you can still get a perfectly nice tan out in the sunlight if you are on grass i'm not sure if grass actually does absorb the sunlight to that extent but the rays will have to go through you to get to the grass underneath anyway Sunlight Solar power Carnivorous plant Sundial Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Ultraviolet Sea ice Sun tanning Human skin color Grass Pok__mon Physical attractiveness Rayleigh scattering Pok__mon Abilities Sunscreen Tanning Upholstery The Queen of the Damned Sun D.J.
