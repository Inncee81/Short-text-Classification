when ever i get nervous or embarrassed this is probably really weird but whenever i get nervous or embarrassed instead of my face blushing my chest gets bright red whats wrong its soo annoying and i have to buy high neck clothes becuase its horrible i don't understand why this happens at first if i get really nervous if im speaking in front of a crowd it gets really blochyy then turns bright red and everyone asks what happened and i don't know what it is what is it and how can i get it to not happen thank you soo much just your chest or your face too if the both of them so you are the kind who blush on the all body sooo cute on white people blushing is much clearer to notice so you can get a tan or you can pull the cute act and say that you are blushing if you are good at this it will buy you some points but the best solution is to relax somehow good luck Teen Girl Squad Social rule Blushing Humphrey Bogart Miss Saigon Piccolo Junior Saga Hyuga Hinata Shaggy dog story Physical attractiveness Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Comanche Professional wrestling holds Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Ashlee Simpson Show Anxiety Social aspects of clothing Sin City Rosacea Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Futurama (TV series - season 2) Kim Possible Sento Lee Soo Man Characters of Naruto Equine conformation Happy Tree Friends Time Out of Mind Pok__mon Live!
