i was thinking about getting snake bites and i was wondering how bad does it hurt why is this some form of alternative healing the bite itself hurts as much as getting your ears pierced but the venom being injected into the body is what causes the majority of the pain i hope you have an anti venom kit on hand for the type of snake you want to bite you i've been bit once and i wouldn't willingly do it again however i have been called a viper and i would gladly bite you it won't kill you and it won't cost you Snake Rattlesnake Venom (poison) Viper American copperhead Spider First aid Snake charming Sea snake Antivenom Snakebite (bite) Serpent Society Characters of Naruto Venom (comics) Crossed Viper Death adder Earring Cottonmouth Tongue piercing Poison Guilty Gear Deadly Viper Assassination Squad Naruto jutsu Pit viper Scorpion Goanna Mosquito Balder Vegeta Black widow spider Creatures in Bionicle Pain Body piercing Spider-Man Serpent Alternative medicine Church of God with Signs Following Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Tarantula Tenshinhan Piccolo Junior Saga Massage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an COBRA Organization Sense Carnage (comics) Hobo spider Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater Brown recluse spider The Death Gate Cycle Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Snake handling Bushmaster (snake) Micronauts Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Venom (band) Coral snake Elapidae Mongoose Wound Bane (comics) Red imported fire ant Sesshomaru Russell's Viper Syphilis Theory of conduct The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever Ronin Warriors Ear piercing instrument Ultimate Spider-Man Hera Swimming Shen Gong Wu Lycanthropy Basilisk Escape from New York Nine Inch Nails Jon Secada Mamba Too Short a Season (TNG episode) The Big Goodbye (TNG episode) Blood (computer game) Kill Bill Taipan Vital Brazil Bothrops Carpal tunnel syndrome Avvakum Social rule Breastfeeding Krait Doom enemies Cobra (snake) V.F.D.
