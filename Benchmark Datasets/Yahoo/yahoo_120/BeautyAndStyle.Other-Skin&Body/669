double tongue piercing can anyone please tell me if it's true that you get a lisp from having two tongue piercings or even one i am aware of the other risks and issues i'm just wondering about this specific thing thanks does anyone who has a double tongue piercing have any tips for me i'm thinking of getting one soon p i am a body piercer and you can get a double tongue piercing if your tongue is long enough it doesn't cause a lisp although at first it might seem so because you have to have a larger tongue bar in to accomodate for swelling and this can sometimes cause a bit of a lisp but it goes away after four or five days and once you get a smaller tongue bar put in there should be no problem one question tho do you have your first piercing yet as you will not be able to get both at once you'll need at least weeks between both and you will need to keep your longer bar from first time around to wear in the first piercing when you get the second one anyway i've had my tongue pierced and i never had any lisp at all this is something that rarely happens and is only due to a bit of swelling if you do get a lisp it is definately not permanentl and will last days max happy piercing Body piercing Tongue piercing Lisp programming language Earring Traumatic brain injury Common Lisp Drill bit Ear piercing instrument Stuttering Penis Computer numbering formats Nipple piercing Navel piercing Variable Oral sex Cat Social rule Franklin Pierce Vowel Group A streptococcal infection Dylan programming language Barbell (piercing) Condom Lambda calculus Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Prince Albert piercing Vampire Intravenous therapy Terminal ballistics New Morning XML Programming language Non-native pronunciations of English Python programming language Spider American Psycho Old Tongue M16 (rifle) Sesotho language Archery Scheme programming language Floppy disk Lip piercing Object-oriented programming Double bass Tattoo F.
