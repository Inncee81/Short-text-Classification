nipple piercings rejecting or not okay so a week ago i just got my nipples both pierced i have been cleaning them everyday with sea salt soaks etc etc but then i was looking at them closely and there seem to be really tiny little scabby lines to the piercing holes they look like they got a little tug or something could they be rejecting or is that normal the piercer i normally go to is out of town for about more weeks but if i have something to worry about i'm going to go to another to get the captive rings off i'm freaking out about them rejecting and just want to know as soon as possible give me an answer and stop insulting me for getting them done in the first place you idiots that's not helping at all if you have enough brains to realise that they are not red nor swollen either and there is no pus seeping out either just tiny scabs but it does look like they moved slightly my eyebrow piercing rejected after only a month which makes me think that my body is very fast at healing not looking for your opinion on the whole thing just looking for someone who knows about it thanks you could be overcleaning them and generally messing with them too much if you clean em twice a day preferably in the shower after mins or so so the hot water and steam will soften the tissue everybody heals in a different way as long as the discharge doesn't smell you'll be fine really and don't listen to those folks who're telling you to take them out if it truly is infected the discharge needs an outlet if you take them out and they close the infection will worsen yer fine though don't worry Body piercing Tattoo Earring Traumatic brain injury Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Nipple piercing Breastfeeding Brewery Tongue piercing Group A streptococcal infection Prince Albert piercing The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Hiberno-English Tuberculosis Eye Urinary incontinence Sauna Action potential Abscess Ear piercing instrument Piccolo Junior Saga Marilyn Monroe Bruise Prostate cancer Fecal incontinence Team Fortress Classic Myxobolus cerebralis Manicure Lip piercing Smallpox Vitamin C Penis Internal ballistics Guinea pig Wound healing phases Shaggy dog story Swimming Wound Acne Inflammation USS Yorktown (CV-10) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ulcer Kodocha Radiation therapy Intravenous therapy Electrophysiology Herpes simplex virus EastEnders Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy Computer virus Tofu Characters of Naruto Joke USS Waters (DD-115) Hot spring Nuclear fallout American Psycho Tasmanian Devil Bathing First aid Dead Sea Opportunity rover Gout Piercing migration Phoebe Buffay's songs Hyperthermia Otitis externa Boil Terminal ballistics The Contender (television series) Mildred Pierce Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Fast bowling Kain (Legacy of Kain) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Yoko Ono Comanche Barbell (piercing) USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Fancy rat Stuttering Hamster Smallville (Season 4) Vlad III Dracula Thermal power station Time Out of Mind Obstetrics Common cold The Doctor Dances Sermon on the Mount AIDS Menstrual cup Sento Stomach cancer Janet Jackson Friends
