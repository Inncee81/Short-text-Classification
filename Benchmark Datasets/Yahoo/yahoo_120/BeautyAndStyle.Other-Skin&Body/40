what cream can i use for under my eyes all of a sudden they got very dry and showing lines help i would recommend some rich vitamin e cream i've had it recommended for the eye area many times and i've used it myself or you may prefer to buy vitamin e capsules that are filled with vitamin e oil and you can just apply the oil on lightly and rub it in with a finger tip a little drop will go a long way if you use the oil so save what you have left in the capsure for another application there are no oil glands in the eye area so that is why lubricant is needed to keep the skin from drying out and wrinkles forming easily Tocopherol Motor oil Psoriasis Manicure Ultraviolet Scar Skin Vitamin D Retinol Friction Fish oil Knife Aloe Violin Moisturizer Drill bit Massage Vitamin C Eczema Osteoarthritis Acne Casting Tofu Masturbation Milk Hamster Veganism Cat Upholstery Vitamin Prostate cancer Shampoo Pet skunk Scabies Chlorpromazine Polychlorinated biphenyl Nutmeg Head Fecal incontinence Sperm Whale Earwax Guinea pig Peanut Melanin Grease (lubricant) Peanut butter Leaf Cystic fibrosis Herpes simplex virus Condom Shaving Oral sex Gelatin Human skin color Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Folic acid Grape seed oil Almond Green tea Tlingit Lanolin Glycerin Cleanser Chainsaw Cosmetics Menstrual cup Antioxidant Drawing Lubricant Lionel Corporation Textile manufacturing Turbocharger Garlic Soybean Zinc Diving cylinder Elephant Thermal power station Pubic hair Cast iron Breastfeeding Conjunctivitis Coconut Gout Kiwifruit Anemia Yarrow Carpal tunnel syndrome Common bean Jewish cuisine Rickets Dairy Mattress Autonomic nervous system Tattoo Hydrochloric acid Lip balm Perfume Vegetarian nutrition Carbon dioxide
