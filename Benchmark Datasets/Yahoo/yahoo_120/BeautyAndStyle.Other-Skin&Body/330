how do i get a quick sunless tan are there any sprays that won't turn my skin orange or smell really bad i just would like a healthy summer glow a light tan i'm a very pale person who is also very impatient no lotions for me got any tips suggestions either get a tinted lotion so you got the colour immediately while the rest develops or use a spray can that is also tinted or get a professional spray tan done i reckon creams lotions that are tinted are the best streak free alternative if you moisturise daily already then replace your moisturiser for a tinted one even professional tans wear of badly and this way it develops gradually wont leave you orange or patchy and keeps your skin hydrated i think this is the best for fair skin Eczema Sunlight Color theory Sun tanning Human skin color Sunburn Leopard Physical attractiveness Manicure Vitamin D Fluorescent lamp Scabies Pubic hair Zinc Sunscreen Amber Contact lens Ozone depletion Puberty Tocopherol Hyperthermia Vitiligo Moisturizer Ozone hole Cosmetics Beret Stomach cancer Dragon Booster Dog Laser hair removal The End of the World (Doctor Who) Keeshond Ultraviolet Diseases of the honeybee Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Volleyball New York Mets Hair color Shaving The Legend of Zelda series races Detroit Tigers Blue Tincture (heraldry) Human Light pollution Eight ball World War Three (Doctor Who) Hair coloring Psoriasis Snooker Leather Scar Battledress What's My Line?
