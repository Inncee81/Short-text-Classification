acne medication breaking out skin i recently have been using clean clear blackhead clearing scrub it is a saliglic acid acne medication i have noticed that my face turns a little pink after using it i also noticed that my forehead has broken out well i have heard people said that after using acne medications like pro active and others you break out because the product is drawing out the pores or something and then the product will start working is this true i have sensitive skin so does should i stop using this blackhead clearing scrub from clean clear proactive sucks and yes there are certain acne medications where you break out for a month and then the rest is history lol however for over the counter products no your skin is very sensitive the salyicic acid's purpose is to dry out your skin so the oil doesn't give you pimples but you should never use it in a scrub even if they say it's okay because it's not the fact that it's in scrub form is just more harsher on your skin it's peeling your skin and making it raw you are definately allergic to this product i reccomend natural products such as booth's arbonne etc these are the companies that make nice scrubs that will do nice things for your skin loool i think you should just try a regular face wash if you want to use a scrub you're only suppose to use it once a week twice at the most Acne Psoriasis Skin Scar Puberty Tattoo Soap Rosacea Sulfuric acid Eczema Aloe Insulin Correlation implies causation (logical fallacy) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Glycerin Jute Surveillance Hay fever Fecal incontinence Hand washing First aid Moisturizer Spider Urinary incontinence Protein Textile manufacturing Kurt Angle Avenue Q Obsessive-compulsive disorder Sento Essential oil Urticaria The Legend of Zelda series races Keloid Acid Chocolate Leather Tofu Manicure Wood Dairy Hydrogen peroxide Shampoo Allergy Glen Jacobs Vince McMahon 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Boom Town (Doctor Who) TLC Retinol Dandruff Flue gas desulfurization Oral sex Potato Hydrogen chloride Social rule Clothing Smegma Body piercing Dexamethasone Tanning Wart Azelaic acid Tuberculosis Isotretinoin Nuclear fallout Benzoyl peroxide Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an 2000 Australian Grand Prix Anabolic steroid Snake Doxepin Wok Thermal power station Theory of conduct Tarantula Hemp Animal testing Herpes simplex virus Microeconomics Extreme Programming Scrubs (TV show) Raney nickel The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Plastic Milk Psychosis Kevin Trudeau Cosmetics Baldness treatments Naval mine Multiple chemical sensitivity The Legend of Zelda series enemies World War Three (Doctor Who) Menstrual cup Salicylic acid Glucocorticoid
