why does my new nail polish dry out after using it a couple times i just bought a very pretty dark dark red nail polish by revlon and it started to dry out and became hard to use after just two applications this seems to happen with every type of nail polish i try although more with darker colors than the lighter ones why does this happen and is there anything i can do i know it's not because of leaving the top off it just got so hard to apply the second time i used it i'll try the acetone thing though thanks make sure you wipe the top of the bottle off before putting the cap back on if you let polish dry on the threads of the bottle it can cause little gaps that can let air in and dry the polish out also it could be old to begin with even though you just bought it some stores have polish forever on their shelves before it is sold also try putting a very small amount of vaseline around the threads of the bottle this will help to keep the cap from sticking and also keep air out close it tightly after each use and only leave it open while you are using it close it as soon as you are done with it also try using some good quality polish like opi essie creative nail design china glaze and there are a few more good ones you will get better end results and it will be well worth the extra money spent on them one other thing if your polish gets thick after having it for a while you can thin it with a few drops of nail polish thinner don't use polish remover buy thinner made specifically for thinning polish you can find it in most beauty supply stores as for the top quality brands of polish you can find them for sale in many nail salons and also you can get some in a beauty supply store as well depending on the brand i would suggest staying away from the cheaper brands they're just not worth it in the long run Textile manufacturing Trademark Wood Diamond Glass Upholstery Poker jargon IPod Drill bit Seismic retrofit Tofu Solar cell Champagne (beverage) Cigar RuneScape economy Hard disk Casting Brewery Diving suit Digital photography Beer USB flash drive Japanese tea ceremony 2000 Australian Grand Prix Illegal drug trade Floppy disk Final Fantasy XI Time Out of Mind Billiards Bicycle lighting Transformer Hyperinflation RuneScape skills Nintendo Circuit design Earring Sears Holdings Corporation Colours, standards and guidons Tire Textile manufacturing terminology Spark plug Plastic Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Solvent Tobacco Ramen Alcoholic beverage Tea Money DVD Violin Rum Sake Shoe polish Diamond cut Menstrual cup Bulk vending Paintball Impressionism Paint Mouse (computing) Nintendo DS Second Battle of the Atlantic Ammolite Nine Inch Nails ITunes Music Store Coffee Gas metal arc welding Typewriter Pysanka Pharmaceutical company Sand casting Mach kernel Condom Cider Thermal power station Diablo II: Lord of Destruction 1957 World Series Geology of the Grand Canyon area M16 (rifle) Drag racing Sea level rise C programming language Aluminium CPU design Cigarette Carpet
