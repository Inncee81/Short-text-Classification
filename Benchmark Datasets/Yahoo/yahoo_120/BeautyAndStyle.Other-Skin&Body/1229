tanning hi i was considering going in to get a spray tan but i'm insecure about my body don't feel all that comfortable having someone spraying me while i'm in my skivies ha are the spray tans you buy in the store any good i don't want anything that's orange fake could anyone reccommend any specific product i can buy that's good how easy are they to use thank you oh what if i only want my legs tanned thanks bunches it is far more uncomfortable for you than the salon staff they have seen hundreds if not thousands of people in the britches or nothing at all they think nothing of it kinda like your doctor i would stay away from self tanners in stores esh those things are just icky i say just go in and get an air brush tan find a salon that does not have the spray on tan by machine like the mystic tan i work at a tanning salon and we get people that come in to us on a daily basis to fix there spray on tan from the automatic machine the machines can't tell if you are getting blotchy or orange they can't make sure it is even or too thin air brush spray tans are amazing the only air brush spray tan solution we have found to work the absolute best is by 'california tan' so if you call around ask what brand they use 'breeze' is a good solution as well at the salon i work at our spray on tan is just a one time spray last weeks no one looks orange or funky you look like you have a sun kissed bronzed tan even if you are pale as a marshmallow it gradually fades away and you look the same as before not spots or funky tan lines you want to find a salon that takes the time to ask you what you want and are looking for they should be professional and not seem 'rushed' it is worth the money if it is done right it is not something you want to do a whole lot if you are looking for a year round tan try the tanning beds which only go through the first layers of your skin rather than all with the suns rays before you go in and have it done you will want to shave and exfolite the night before put lotion on the night before no deoderant the day of you will not want to use any lotion body sprays or deoderant they can react with the chemicles in the spray solution and turn you green the salon staff should give you a special lotion or barrell cream to put on your feet and hands to keep them from getting darker than the rest of your body it won't turn your hair colores if you dye it so don't worry you will want to wear dark loose fitting clothing you wont be able to shower for hours some tanning salons do have leg tanners or you can just use a chair and put your legs in a tanning bed we have many pregnate women do this have fun Pubic hair Sunlight Mattress Social rule Upholstery Human skin color Strap-on dildo Color Breastfeeding Hair Leather Tattoo Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dairy Diving suit Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Phoebe Buffay's songs Massage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Poker jargon Comanche Fire fighting Undergarment Physical attractiveness Textile manufacturing Milton H.
