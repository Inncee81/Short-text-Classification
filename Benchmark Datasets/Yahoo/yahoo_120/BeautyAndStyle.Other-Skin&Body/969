i swim a lot and yesterday i noticed my face was really dry so i tryed putting the face lotion i have clean and clear morning glow and it burned so i tryed some nivea stuff my mom had and it burned too the only thing that doesn't burn is aloe but it doesn't moisturize very well i don't want to put any regular lotion on my face either because my face has been breaking out a lot lately and i think that would probably just make it worse does anyone have any suggestions on a product i should try make sure to use products that are unscented and have a label that says dermatologist recommended my aunt is a dermatologist and she usually tells people that have dry irritated skin to use purpose moisturizer it is a brand of face products so choose the moisturizer for sensitive skin it is very gentle and won't irritate your skin i have used it before after getting sunburned and it feels great on my skin you can find it in any drug store like walgreen or cvs or eckerds aloe vera is also very good for your skin but i would recommend going to a health food store and buying natural aloe vera gel it will really heal your skin fast Aloe Psoriasis Eczema Acne Sunburn Tattoo Shaving Scar Malignant melanoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tofu Sunscreen Skin Shampoo Dandruff Body piercing Dietary fiber Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Onion Ultraviolet Upholstery Medical prescription CVS/pharmacy Houseplant Wound healing phases Hemp Zinc Herpes simplex virus Scabies Vitamin D Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cleanser Sunlight Personal lubricant Avenue Q Hypoglycemia Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Walgreens Scarification Bulk vending Theory of conduct Stomach cancer Saki Manicure Food preservation Multiple chemical sensitivity Mattress Social rule Cosmetics Irritable bowel syndrome Urticaria Animal testing Massage Laser hair removal Explosive material Dairy Mosquito Hamster Lupus erythematosus Michael Jackson Motion picture rating system Tocopherol Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Gelatin Hemorrhoid Baldness treatments Hydrogen peroxide Glycerin Piccolo Junior Saga Textile manufacturing Essential oil Shaggy dog story Keratosis pilaris Diving suit The Amber Spyglass Neighbours Sampling (music) Otitis externa Trans fat Atkins Nutritional Approach Diving Comet Great Teacher Onizuka Chronic fatigue syndrome Est__e Lauder Inc.
