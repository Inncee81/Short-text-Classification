nair on face just kinda curious ive used nair on my body before chest and arms and legs since i dont like hair i hate shaving every morning so i was curious if you can use nair on your face or any other remover thanks thier nothing wrong with straight guys who dont like hair if girls can shave their hari i dont see why guys cant i seem to recall that there is a version of nair that is for use on facial hair you might check with a pharmacist they know a lot about over the counter stuff in addition to prescription meds i think the kind that you use on your legs body wherever might be a little strong for facial skin you could try it on a small spot on your face to see how your skin reacts if it doesn't harm your skin then i don't see any reason you couldn't use it Hair Shaving Depilation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pubic hair Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Beard Skin Puberty Medicine Baldness Skinhead Blood on the Tracks Waxing Razor Acne Haircut Professional wrestling attacks Hypertrichosis Side Characters (Xenosaga) Physical attractiveness Piccolo Junior Saga Equine conformation Diving Bonus Stage Nair Dragon Booster W.I.T.C.H.
