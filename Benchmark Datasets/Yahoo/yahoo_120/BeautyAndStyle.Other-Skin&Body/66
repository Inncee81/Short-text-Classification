what are some ways i can keep calm when i go get my lip piercing i am going to get my lip pierced soon once i stop being worried and i really love this one piercing place and i really comfortable there but i dotn wanna move my mouth or it will mess up what are some ways cause i usally freak out because i worry bout if it is going to hurt or not another thing is the guy that does the piercings is cute and i can not keep my cool around him but he is the only person i trust i need ways to keep calm help no i'm doing it cause i wwant it for myself well they put clamps on which personally i thought was the most painful part so you won't be able to move your lip even if you try or at least i couldn't as someone else mentioned tell the guy you're nervous i'm sure he's used to nerves so he'll know what to do when i went in for my snakebites i was really nervous but once i got in there the people in the shop were talking to me and really helped ease my nerves the guy who pierced me happened to also be very cute and i jokingly told him that and he was like if do good i'll give you a hug at the end and i jumped right in the chair and didn't move a muscle haha anyways there's my experience as far as the pain don't worry about it it's just a quick pinch then it's over i got snakebites and the second hole hurt a lot worse than the first one but if you're only getting one than you have nothing to worry about xx good luck Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story 1957 World Series The Inside Blood on the Tracks Kodocha EastEnders Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Social rule Knots Landing The Contender (television series) The Amber Spyglass Marilyn Monroe The Ashlee Simpson Show Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Stuttering Garfield Theory of conduct Ed, Edd n Eddy Le Malade imaginaire Pain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Ken Chu Buddy Guy God Emperor of Dune Massage Negima Body piercing Fruits Basket Equine conformation Futurama (TV series - season 3) True Crime: Streets of LA Anxiety Traumatic brain injury Simpson Tide Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Franklin Pierce The Death Gate Cycle Jon Secada Nine Inch Nails Teen Girl Squad The Fairly OddParents Aerial (dance move) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Action potential Friends Cliff Richard Skateboarding trick Brian Close The Smoking Room Reservoir Dogs Characters of Naruto Autonomic nervous system Babe Ruth Futurama (TV series - season 5) Tenshinhan The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy The Lovely Bones Pitaten Shit The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Professional wrestling holds One Tree Hill (TV series) Indian Oil Cup 2005 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Prostate cancer One Piece minor characters Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Oral sex 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Tongue piercing Naruto jutsu Xiaolin Showdown Masturbation Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Local anesthesia Transactional analysis Orgasm Theodicy Characters in Neon Genesis Evangelion Chess strategy and tactics Pok__mon Live!
