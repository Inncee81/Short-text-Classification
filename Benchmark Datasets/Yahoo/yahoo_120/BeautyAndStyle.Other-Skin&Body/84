i have a brown line on my thumb i have a brown line on my thumb it doesn't hurt its on the nail itself not underneath the nail as when i cut my thumb nail you can see it its the colour of a light mole i suppose pretty similar to a mole on my arm anyway its not moving or thickening and my other nails are fine the nail isn't deforming it still looks like my other thumb but with a brown line the skin colour of my areas around the nail is the same as other areas i have had it for a long long time i am in my early teens please help me i have read some things on the internet and some people say that they have lost half of their nail but im not sure if they have the same thing as i do i really don't want to loose my thumb don't bother answering if you're just going to say rude things about me you won't lose your thumb you've probably just bumped it somewhere i suggest buffering it lightly then putting a polish on it eventually it will grow out good luck Nail (anatomy) Nine Inch Nails Knife Manicure Milton H.
