what is your beauty regimen i'm starting university this fall and i want beautiful skin a fresh start what is your beauty regimen first drink lots of water when your body is even slightly hydrated the first place it takes water from is the outer layer of skin this can make the difference between having glowing skin and dull skin i drink at least cups a day and i notice if i go a day without drinking much water my skin looks noticeably drier if you work out you will need more i have always used the clinique step system and it works great not too harsh and it can be customized to your skin type however you don't necessarily have to buy the clinique system per se just remember three steps cleanse exfoliate tone moisturize always start with a mild facial cleanser clinique or try cetaphil which cleanses without irritation or dryness next use an exfoliating toner like clinique clarifying lotion or try neutrogena pore refinining toner follow with an oil free gentle moisturizer that is formulated for your skin type if your skin is oily try a light gel moisturizer most importantly listen to your skin i usually do three steps in morning and evening however if my skin seems dry in the morning i will skip the toner and just cleanse and moisturize or if my skin is oily i will just cleanse and tone you get the idea try different products and methods and see what works best for you be gentle limit the harsh scrubs to once a week and use sunblock if you must scrub use a soft cloth and gently buff skin to remove makeup and dead skin that can dull the only exception is if you have acne that is more than just a few pimples once in a while i get acne sometimes still its hormones but if acne is more severe you may have to try something stronger to treat it otherwise it always pays to be kind to your skin sorry to go on so long hope this helps Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tofu Fecal incontinence Rosacea Shampoo Soap Wood Cosmetics Urinary incontinence Skin Moisturizer Shaving Manicure Tattoo Weathering Dry cleaning Sunscreen Radiation therapy Eczema Androgen insensitivity syndrome Explosive material Upholstery Dialysis Hemp Sunburn Rice Sento Knife Ultraviolet Aloe Cancer Testosterone Diaper Cheese Body piercing Puberty Urticaria Dietary fiber Breast cancer Scar Massage Coffee Brewery Fasting Smoke-screen Dairy Scarification Herpes simplex virus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hamster Hypoglycemia Menstrual cup Glycerin Chocolate Social rule Hiking Mouth ulcer Champagne (beverage) Portland cement Embalming Milk Onion Dehydration Antiseptic Prostate cancer Bong Sulfuric acid Keratosis pilaris Polyethylene terephthalate Weather lore Human skin color Smegma Polycystic ovary syndrome Personal lubricant Antiretroviral drug Hydrogen peroxide 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Customs and etiquette of Japan Mummy Otitis externa Clothing Scabies Keloid First aid Baldness treatments Tenjiku shogi
