i have really small breasts help i'm going into grade and i'm really flat i don't even wear a bra or a training bra i feel as thought this is my fault i'm still young to get push up bra's and all that stuff but i want my chest to look bigger and my chest is as flat as a boy's chest i don't know what to do thanks for everyone's help i think you are fine i know some girls my age that almost have no chest it really does not matter that much to us guys i mean yeah we like breasts but that is far from the only thing you should not feel bad about yourself i bet you look pretty please do not try to compare yourself to other girls i as well as other guys do not like it when a girl does that you should just relax and feel good about who and what you are if it is really bothering you you could always use toilet paper to pad one of the bras you have just do not over do it and make sure it looks natural i don't think you should worry about it in my opinion i do not think it is a big deal and it does not change the fact that you are a woman and a cute one at that i am willing to bet you will begin to get some before to long they may never be very big but that's ok most girls that do look really good don't have big breasts at all Brassiere Undergarment Caprice Bourret Equine conformation Ranma __ characters Breastfeeding The Fairly OddParents Breast Urinary incontinence Poker jargon Germaine Greer The Ashlee Simpson Show Breast cancer The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Kyle Broflovski Humphrey Bogart Madonna (entertainer) Sin City Teen Girl Squad Milton H.
