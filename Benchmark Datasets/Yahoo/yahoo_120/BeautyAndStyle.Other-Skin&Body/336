piercing problem i just got my ear pierced about days ago and since i've had it done it keeps either bleeding or having alot of puss coming out of it i have piercings and this is the first time this has ever happened when i got it pierced it bled alot too but the piercer said that happens all the time should i be worried should i get it checked out if this keeps happening where abouts is the piercing certain cartilidge piercings can do that for example my snug and conch have both been problematic my conch would randomly start bleeding and was continuously kicking out a lot of lymph its not really something to be worried about just baby it for a while however a trip to your piercer maybe a good idea just to make sure do salt soaks twice a day dont use anything else such as tea tree oil as these can slow the healing down hope it gets better Body piercing Earring Ear piercing instrument Ayyavazhi mythology Navel piercing Traumatic brain injury Nipple piercing Piccolo Junior Saga Yarrow Tongue piercing Social rule Naruto jutsu Characters of Naruto Stomach cancer Breastfeeding Chocolate 1957 World Series Prince Albert piercing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Childbirth What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
