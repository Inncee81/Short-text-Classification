hey i need your help i have recently gotten my belly button pierced it is healing fine i just have one small problem i tan in a tanning bed which causes my skin to become somewhat dry my skin around my piercing is beginning to look like it could peel i clean it often but my question is is there any product that i can put on my piercing to moisturize the area without interferring with the healing process such as vaseline aloe gel nonscented lotion or neosporin don't use vaseline or petroleum based products this traps bacteria and creates a breeding ground for infection use straight up vitamin e gel get it from the health food store aloe is fine too and clean your piercing with bactine or betadyne no alcohol or peroxide and avoid liquid soaps because they contain more glycerine which can be drying for the skin good luck stay healthy Aloe Body piercing Psoriasis Shaving Glycerin Acne Eczema Halitosis Tofu Hemp Skin Fecal incontinence Hydrogen peroxide Hamster Manicure Food preservation Stomach cancer Antiseptic Tattoo Sunburn Biodiesel Fancy rat Wound healing phases Dry cleaning Sunlight Vitamin D Soap Tocopherol Zinc Herpes simplex virus Earring Personal lubricant Cheese Shampoo Milk Nitroglycerin Anthrax Escherichia coli O157:H7 Gelatin E number Scar Vermicompost Domestic rabbit Vitamin Gout Ultraviolet Dandruff Nipple piercing Food Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Veganism Dairy Potato Pneumonia Knife Ethanol Nutrition Urinary incontinence Tlingit Anal sex Guinea pig Polyethylene terephthalate Homeopathy Benzoyl peroxide Acetic acid Dietary fiber Breastfeeding Otitis externa Fire extinguisher Fluoride therapy Peanut Hand washing Cancer Chocolate Menstrual cup Date Palm Bedbug Bacon Disinfection Prostate cancer Traumatic brain injury Folic acid Swimming Crohn's disease Cirrhosis Polymerase chain reaction Vinegar Lactobacillus acidophilus Foodborne illness Riboflavin Coffee Water Diseases of the honeybee Scabies Comfrey
