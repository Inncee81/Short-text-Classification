should i pop my whiteheads or just leave them alone and they'll go away on their own also would you recommend proactiv for somebody with sensitive skin combination skin type does proactiv work for all acne i am thinking of trying it i did try it once but not even for a month i don't think i was seeeing results i don't think i was using it long enough typically how long should you wait to see results from what ive read and been told you should pop whiteheads but rather than just using dirty fingers its recommended that you pop them either following a thorough washing of your hands or with a sterilized needle like a sewing needle you can easily sterilize a needle by placing it in hot soapy water the purpose of sterilizing needles or your hands is so that once you break the skin additional bacteria doesnt get caught in that area dont forget to wash your face x daily ive personally tried proactiv and yeah it works but is costly and somewhat time consuming theres steps to the process proactiv is perfect for sensitive skin but again id check out some of the over the counter sensitive skin treatments from clearasil or the like if it wasnt working at all for you in weeks after consistent use it probably wont work hope this helps Psoriasis Acne Tattoo Textile manufacturing Intravenous therapy Menstrual cup Body piercing Ultraviolet Agar plate Wound Skin Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gramophone record Pneumonia Dialysis Atomic Kitten Escherichia coli O157:H7 Sterilization (microbiology) Acupuncture Sewing machine CPU cache Knife Tuberculosis treatment Bacteria Sewage treatment Disinfection Swimming Urticaria Hand washing Soap Wine making Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Bone marrow transplant Hygiene Group A streptococcal infection Surveillance Scar Hepatitis C She Loves You Suture XML Houseplant Fecal incontinence AIDS Breast cancer Earring Billboard Hot 100 Social rule Polymerase chain reaction Chlorpromazine Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hay fever Insulin Naval mine Nail (anatomy) Embedded system Methamphetamine Mantoux test Debugging Jessica Simpson Allergy Dairy Cleanser Puberty Hamster Hard water Female genital cutting Jennifer Lopez Oscilloscope Hair Aerial (dance move) Upholstery Polycystic ovary syndrome Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Herpes simplex virus Asepsis Clothing Blood donation Information Technology Infrastructure Library Violin Ives Manufacturing Company Halitosis Customs and etiquette of Japan Humphrey Bogart Cholera Kayak Dyslexia Torpedo Ebola Capercaillie Jon Secada Foodborne illness Tooth Mosquito Tofu Play piercing
