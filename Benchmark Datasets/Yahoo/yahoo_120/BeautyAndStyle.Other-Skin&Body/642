people with cartlidge piercings i got the cartlidge of my ear pierced about a year ago but it is still swollen and sore i don't have or time to see a doctor so i really need your help what is wrong and what can i do to stop it next question i used to have my nose pierced with a needle i let it grow back when i lost my gold nose ring is it safe to re pierce over scar tissue i had my upper ear pierced in highschool and when i thought it was healed i quit cleaning it as i should have and it became infected with pussy stuff and a hard bump in the back part of my problem was that i stopped cleaning it but it was also because my ear had been pierced with a gun at claires not with a needle by a professional which makes cartilidge piercings more prone to infection and swelling because the gun can shatter the cartilidge rather than only pierce it also because it was done at claires i had a post in it and not a ring here's what i did i took out the post and immediately put in a surgical steel ring that was a thin gage the post was collecting the puss and stuff behind the backing and the backing was also putting pressure on the bump not good then i was religous about cleaning my ear a couple times a day i would take the ring out clean the spot really well with antibacterial soap put a small dab of neosporin on both sides of my ear washed the ring real well and put it back in then slid the ring back and forth in the piercing a few times and left it alone not touching at all til i cleaned it again sometimes i put iodine on it after washing and let it sit for a few seconds then washed it again and so on it was months before my ear fully healed but it was not that hard of a routine and i saved the piercing but as one of the other answers said maybe you have an allergy to metal make sure it's a surgical steel ring bar the next piercing i made sure i had it done with a needle and ring right off the bat and cleaned it as long as he told me i was supposed to clean it and i had no problems or pain at all i hope you heal well Earring Tattoo Ear piercing instrument Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Violin Professional wrestling holds Acne Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Penis Textile manufacturing Prince Albert piercing Skin Suture Medicine Sin City First aid The Inside Drill bit Nipple piercing Stomach cancer Menstrual cup Wound Hip fracture Condom Methamphetamine Babe Ruth Equine conformation Diving Scarification Dialysis Keloid Sento Radiation therapy Volleyball Knife The Empty Child Tongue piercing Shaggy dog story Tuberculosis Breastfeeding Hepatitis C Antiseptic Carpal tunnel syndrome Social rule Skateboarding trick Urinary incontinence Allergy Knots Landing Ebola Massage Eddie Guerrero Otitis externa Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Mosquito Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Play piercing Mattress The Contender (television series) Prostate cancer Neighbours Upholstery Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Herpes simplex virus Piccolo Junior Saga Humphrey Bogart Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Professional wrestling match types Time Out of Mind 2000 Australian Grand Prix Phimosis Coeliac disease Group A streptococcal infection Barbell (piercing) Naruto jutsu Domestic rabbit Body modification Professional wrestling attacks Adjustable gastric band Ric Flair Childbirth Chronic fatigue syndrome YuYu Hakusho Jala neti Otitis media Vegeta Tenshinhan Strap-on dildo Fecal incontinence
