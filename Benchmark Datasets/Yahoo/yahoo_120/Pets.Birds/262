food for keet with deformed beak actually kiichou his name means precious when he was a small baby got his beak injured somehow or another to the point that his top beak section points down instead of curving and his bottom beak section is unusually small his beak is also very weak he can eat regular bird food but thats pretty much it he cant even open a sunflower seed i open one or two for him everynow and then any ideas on what kinds of fruits and other foods thats would be easy for him to eat it cant be too hard or too soft it also cant make him work to get it like nuts and it must be small or break into small peices long lists would be appericated and please dont try an educate me about parakeets because i have been a tamer and breeder for years now and also his beak will always be this way because he is a year old and it grows that way now btw hes tame enough to hop on my finger and whatnot but i cant take him out of the cage yet anyones help would be most appericiated x i am surprised that you would expect a parakeet to be able to open a sunflower seed even with a normal beak most of my parakeets in over years of owning them have beaks too small to open a sunflower seed anyway i have had a couple of birds who've had injured beaks like what you describe and they seem to do well on the spray millet i have over birds right now so i also like to cook up a large bag of success rice brown or white minutes in the microwave remove the bag of rice and allow it to drain and while its draining throw about one cup of frozen mixed veggies into the still hot water to defrost once the veggies are defrosted drain the water and mix in the drained rice sometimes the green beans are a bit too large for my smaller birds so i cut those up a little more while they are still frozen anyway all my fids feathered kids seem to like the mix finches to cockatoos and i know they are getting a good vitamin and carb combination too if you only have a few birds you might also try cooking up some frozen mixed veggies into some birdy bread using the different flavors of jiffy mix cake or muffin mixes that way you can use regular cupcake or tiny muffin pans and freeze what you can't use right away when its time to defrost another one just pull it from your freezer pop it in the microwave for about seconds and viola soft edibles hope this helps you little fellow out some and reserve lots of special kisses for the special needs fids Tofu Bread Hamster Food Domesticated turkey Breakfast Cuisine of the Philippines Cuisine of Denmark Bong Japanese cuisine Ice cream Chicken Rice Cuisine of Malaysia Muffin Fancy rat In-N-Out Burger Acorn Refrigerator Brewery Food preservation Potato Sushi Kosher foods Hamburger The Legend of Zelda series enemies Common bean Dim sum Watermelon Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME MRE Peanut Pizza Curry Piccolo Junior Saga French cuisine Bengali cuisine Jewish cuisine Seed Hot dog Date Palm Kakapo RuneScape skills Cuisine of the Southern United States Kitchen Roman eating and drinking Cheese Poker jargon Pine Tlingit Apple Domestic rabbit Egg (food) Fast bowling Flour Shotgun Vegetarianism Chili con carne Drill bit Cereal Hemp Pet skunk Quinoa Bagel Slow cooker Vinegar Canary Pancake Maize Capercaillie Tea Fruit McDonald's Microwave oven Ramen Pysanka Soul food Bladderwort Vegetarian cuisine Prostate cancer Veganism Textile manufacturing Chinese cuisine Soy milk Fecal incontinence One Piece minor characters Organic food Equine conformation
