blue swedish and khaki campbell ducks i just got a blue swedish and a khaki campbell duck i know how to take care of them but i was wondering what they are like does anyone know how they are in personality in such are they mean or nice do they lay eggs alot and how do you tell if they are boys or girls i do not have pictures yet they are just babies i guess the blue swedish turns that dusty gray with a white bib the khaki is brown and i think it supposed to stay brown i think in any duck species you can tell by their tail feathers if their tail feathers curl up it's a boy if not it's a girl do you have pictures of your ducks i've never heard or seen either breeds before Dog Platypus AFI 100 Years series Capercaillie Chicken Duck Seabird Egg (food) Monster Rancher monsters Minor Harry Potter Beasts Bird Mallard Beret Pysanka Musk Duck American Idol Season Four songs Tufted Duck Peafowl Horse The Beach Boys Species Emu Camouflage Gray Wolf Northern Pintail One-hit wonder Ostrich Egg (biology) Domesticated turkey Dobermann Looney Tunes: Back In Action Yoshi Swan The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Muscovy Duck Budgerigar Sea Scouts (BSA) Jon Secada Blue Adelie Penguin Cockatiel Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life Redhead (duck) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cat coat genetics Harry Nilsson Care Bears Academy Award for Best Picture Fancy rat Humphrey Bogart Frankie Vaughan Hamster Who Framed Roger Rabbit Paul Is Dead Conker's Bad Fur Day Anatidae Iris (anatomy) Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Academy Award for Best Art Direction Arctic Skua Red-tailed Hawk Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Singapore Police Force Situation comedy The Jazz Singer Pomarine Skua Peregrine Falcon Academy Award for Animated Short Film Sega Saturn Keeshond The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Donald Duck Jeans Scrooge McDuck One Piece minor characters Postpartum depression Kiwi Tiny Toon Adventures Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year Spider Cliff Richard Birthday Blue-tailed Bee-eater Royal Highland Fusiliers Bluethroat Spitz Ranma __ characters Polychrotidae Yellow World Series Color Mosquito Tony Award for Best Musical Banjo-Kazooie Brian Wilson Laysan Duck Nova Scotia Duck-Tolling Retriever Rainbow Bee-eater
