can a bird and a rodent become friends i have a cockatiel and a few hamsters and i was wondering if i could introduce the the cockatiel puts her wings up when she's on their cage but is that just her being tough or is she saying come near me and i'll kill you what do you think depends on your birds temperament i personally would not introduce them i had a cockatiel with a mean attitude and i had no idea that a bite from such a small bird could hurt so much but if you do introduce them be careful that your hamsters eyes don't get ripped out they're very delicate creatures and it probably wouldn't be in your hamsters or birds best interest good luck Hamster Cockatiel Pet Piccolo Junior Saga Social rule Bird Theory of conduct Animal testing Galaxy Angel Pet skunk Kim Possible Johnny Cage John Cage Doom enemies Chinchilla Ferret Characters of Megatokyo Bat The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Timon and Pumbaa Chicken Wood carving Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Cat Tenshinhan Kender The Shining (film) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Falconry Seabird Stoat Sub-Zero Monster Rancher monsters Alignment (role-playing games) Mid-levels W.I.T.C.H.
