what do you feed a baby bird i found a bay bird on my porch yesterday it has feather and all and i think it broke it's wings trying to fly i've been feeding it bread soaked in milk it won't eat much of the bread but drinks the milk i just tried feeding it worms but it won't eat it dose anybody know what i should feed it and what i should do about it's broken wing don't give it milk birds do not have the right enzymes for dairy products go to petco or petsmart and buy a bag of powdered bird formula something like this http www petco com product kaytee exact hand feeding formula for all baby birds aspx yes the formula is meant for parrots but it will work for wild birds too follow the instructions on the bag and everything will be fine everything you feed it must be in liquid form baby birds don't eat whole worms and they don't swallow them whole either bread and worms and anything not liquid will not work if you don't have time to buy the formula yet boil a few eggs but leave the yolk slightly soft get rid of the whites and mash up the yolks the yolk must be soft if you have dog kibble add some water to it put it in the microwave and cut it up into tiny pieces mix it up with the yolks the food should be mostly yolk just a little bit of the kibble you must feed your formula warm but not hot you can burn a baby bird's throat very easily basically put your finger in the mixture before you feed it it should be warm but not hot that is the safest way to tell if your bird can eat it the mixture will be a thick liquid if you have a chopstick or something similarily shaped a straw you can use it to scoop a tiny gob of food onto an end and feed it that way or if you buy the bird formula it should come with a needle less syringe that can also be used don't force feed the bird if it is not hungry as a precaution i dont know if its already too late but baby birds require feeding a lot sometimes more than twice an hour you need to get the right food and formula what i described as soon as you can because milk and bread and worms will starve it to death good luck Tofu Kosher foods Chicken Breastfeeding Dairy Bread Brewery Egg (food) Soy milk Jewish cuisine Breakfast Cuisine of Denmark Tea Cantonese cuisine Coffee Textile manufacturing Customs and etiquette of Japan Japanese cuisine Milk Japanese tea ceremony Ice cream Chocolate Vegetarianism Baby bottle RuneScape quests German cuisine Bengali cuisine Dairy product Pizza Sea-Monkey Seabird Bong Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Carburetor Snake 613 mitzvot Idli Healthy eating Casting Bird Fried chicken Beer Hot dog Leather Mayonnaise Salmon Paint Kakapo Hedgehog Tempera Korean cuisine Capercaillie Dim sum Roman eating and drinking Plastic Domesticated turkey Soup Date Palm Platypus Caffeine Ant Fecal incontinence Mosquito Yoghurt Egg (biology) Shark Intravenous therapy Foie gras Spider Cajun cuisine Dog Mattress Ayyavazhi religious practices Livestock Carbon dioxide Basic English Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Cochineal Cheese Food Cocaine Bird migration Pottery Ammonia Falconry Chinese cuisine Cookie Rice pudding Chopsticks Omega-3 fatty acid Soft drink Infant formula
