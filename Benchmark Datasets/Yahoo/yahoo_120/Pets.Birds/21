first time bird owner here any tips for handling a lovebird through some confusion i somehow ended up with a parrot rather than a ferret which i originally wanted my mom's co worker gave him to me we were too scared to offend her so my mom said we'd give him a week before we returned him this is only day one i've read up on some general care for lovebirds i do plan on reading more i don't want him to be bored or anything so i'm attempting to pick him up interact with him more but everytime i open the cage i get freaked out because of his beak any tips i know i'm sort of expecting him to bite me how hard is it gonna hurt he's only months so he's pretty young every time i try to get near enough to pick him up he moves farther away i guess he's still adjusting it may hurt a little bit but it shouldn't slice the skin nor hurt the bone like some of the larger parrots can do they can nip pretty hard if they are scared but usually a warning nip doesn't hurt too much if he does bite don't pull back nor cry you have grab his beak between your thumb and pointer fringer's knuckle and say no firmly if he is hand fed he should adjust quickly but it if it is a lovebird that was mostly just decoration you may or may not be able to handle him in a week there are lot pf people that own lovebirds and say they make great pets but it is only if they are hand fed offer millet when you put your hand in the cage if you have millet hanging in the cage take it out he will be more likely to go to your hand for it if he can't already get it in his cage move slowly and talk to him in a calm voice parrots are hard to keep if you aren't interested but it sounds like you are doing everything just fine just be patient with him and eventually you will see his true personality Shaggy dog story Theory of conduct Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aerial (dance move) Pet skunk Dog training The Birds (film) Electrophysiology Ferret Kodocha EastEnders Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Guinea pig Wheel of Fortune RuneScape quests Sin City The Inside The Legend of Zelda series enemies StarCraft: Uprising Equine conformation Chicken Drill bit Kim Possible Tenshinhan Hamster Domestic rabbit Knife Lovebird Salad Fingers Skateboarding trick Kakapo Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Time Out of Mind Kender Mealy Parrot The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie African Grey Parrot Ron and Fez Cat Eric Cartman Chopsticks Milton H.
