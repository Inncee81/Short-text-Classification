what kind of bird is this description below it has black and white feathers like a dominecker chicken it has a featherless white face with a small red comb and a small bit or red under the beak on the neck the ones i have seen may all be females it has a longer body than a chicken and does not look like a chicken of these just came up into my yard i live in the country they are just birds so i don't care to chase them off if they belong to neighbors they will surely return on their own later anyway my first thought was that they are turkeys of some kind but the last turkey i saw was more decorated about the face and head and had a larger body oh yes the only sound i heard one make sounded something like a squeeky barn door with a very loud rusty hinge not sure how much that helps but no the sound was more like old squeeky bed springs when you bounce around on them tipki flora you are right they are guinea points in a few hours thanks to all who answered here is a better idea at first i thought it might be a turken but now i think it may be a guinea fowl check out the google image http images google com imgres imgurl http www maguirefarm com images guineamomkeets dayold jpg imgrefurl http www maguirefarm com g guineafowlfirst htm h w sz hl en start sig k vetjmnna rui kwcuw tbnid qicdfbci bmsam tbnh tbnw ei k y rue lpwqjgh m dw prev images fq dguinea bhen gbv d svnum d hl den Chicken Capercaillie Bird HyperText Transfer Protocol Shotgun Guinea pig The Legend of Zelda series enemies Domesticated turkey Cheetah Hamster Tyrannosaurus rex Linked list Pysanka Wild Turkey Roswell UFO incident Cat Feather The Birds (film) Milton H.
