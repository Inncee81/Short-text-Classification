nervous cockatiel i have two cockatiels on gray which i s months old i got him wks ago and and a month lutino cockatiel i got a week ago every since i put them outside in different cages the lutino is always running around and flapping its wings in the cage like its trying to get out and my gray is chirping at it and i guess trying to talk i don't know what sex my lutino is because its too young but what should i do im trying to get them tamest birds out of them if i put them together in a cage will it be harder or will it be the same thing any tips on taming my birds every time i get my gray cockatiel it flies from my finger and hurts himself and he just recently recoverd from wing damage and i don't want anything to happen to it any hints firstly you have to give them time to get used to their new surroundings that means just leaving them alone for anywhere from several days to several weeks it sounds like you might be rushing things a bit by trying to train them before they are comfortable in their new home by trying to interact with them too soon you may be scaring them for now just leave them alone except for feeding waterring and cage cleaning go in once or twice a day and spend some time gently talking to them in a soiothing voice so that they see you are not going to harm them after they get calmed down and used to your presence then start giving them treats through the bars if they don't take the treat from your hand then take the treat away you want them to see that you are the only source of treats once they are readily accepting treats try opening the cage and offerring treats let the bird come to you don't force your hand into the cage when they finally accept treats with open cage door then you can present your finger saying step up after awhile the bird will step up on command patience is the key bird training takes alot of time one question why did you put your cages outside the outside environment changes with weather time of day traffoc noises and even wild birds taking the cages inside will provide a more stable environment and help the birds to calm down who knows you might even have a hawk crow blue jay or other bird flying around outside which your bird is terrified at seeing Hamster Social rule Salad Fingers Falconry John Cage Dog training RuneScape quests Cockatiel Mealy Parrot Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an G-Man (Half-Life) Ferret The Birds (film) Domestic rabbit Guinea pig Milton H.
