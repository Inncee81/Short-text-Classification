baby birds my yr old entergetic beagle found a nest in between chairs today not knowing if there was any birds inside we left him alone he came back with a baby in his mouth we alerted him to drop and we picked up the bird with gloves back into the nest we moved the chairs out of the yard and around the house was this the right thing to do i would say they are only a couple of weeks old we hope the mother bird can find them you need to put the nest back as close as possible to where it originally was or the parents will not be able to find it you did the right thing by putting the bird back in the nest is there a way you can keep the dog away from the nest until the babies leave it block off the chairs somehow so he will not disturb them again they should not be there too long most passerines perching birds fledge leave the nest at about weeks of age if the bird was mostly feathered it should be leaving the nest soon keep in mind the babies will leave the nest before they can fly they will hop around and the parents will feed them you might want to keep your dog clear of that area until they move on as the baby birds will be vulnerable and easy for you dog to catch until they learn to fly Kakapo Bird Albatross Capercaillie Seabird Falconry Bird migration Peafowl Passerine Bird ringing Dog training Rainbow Bee-eater Brolga RuneScape quests White-throated Dipper Dinosaur Platypus Hamster Ivory-billed Woodpecker Professional wrestling aerial techniques AFI 100 Years series Aerial (dance move) Nile crocodile Condor Piccolo Junior Saga Western Gull Richard Rahl Carrion Crow House Martin Dog The Inside The Family from One End Street Friends Jam (TV series) Barn Swallow Chicken Prairie Falcon Infantilism Rook (bird) Bird flight Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Black-footed Albatross Big Bird Breastfeeding Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Mario Gal__pagos Islands Archaeopteryx Piratic Flycatcher Scissor-tailed Flycatcher Brown-headed Cowbird European Nightjar Bird of prey Prenatal diagnosis African Fish Eagle Island restoration Milton H.
