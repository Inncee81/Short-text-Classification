what should i look for if i add a female cockatoo to my home with a male african grey currently i own a male timneh african grey he is attatched to my fiance and typically isn't interested in me for more than the occassional kiss so i'm concidering adding a second bird to the home and have a love for the triton sulfur crested cockatoos i don't really have a preference for either male or female but i don't know how the male timneh would react to different sexes i know with dogs its best to add a female to a home with a male dogs simply for the alpha dominance stuff but i'm not certain with birds the timneh is years old and somewhat skiddish but seems to tolerate birds okay outside of the home if i were to bring a female in would he lean towards her as a mate even if she's a different species i owned a male parakeet and a female cockatiel once and he chose her as a mate and became aggressive towards the rest of us or would he be more likely to be aggressive towards another male brought into the house i'm looking to get a hand raised baby first thing to consider is the fact that most greys not raised with other species of birds don't like the different species of course each bird within a species is his or her own persoanality too my congo grey doesn't like my umbrella cockatoo's in part i suspect because they are much larger and more active than are greys even threating to the greys when wings are spread open and flapping the tag timneh will not be attracted sexually to the triton however male birds during hormonal times do become very agressive so with that said and my years of experience living with and learning about a varity of avain species i suggest you get a female they are sweeter too the only way to sex a bird is either surgery not done often any more or dna which can be done by collecting a drop of blood from the nail during nail trims and sending to labs that do this for which i have but can't find right now duh do a google or yahoo search for labs that do dna sexing for avain species not are are created equel or have an avian vet or the breeder do it for you Bird Sexual attraction Sex Dog Hamster Gray Wolf Ferret Cockatiel Sexual selection Sexual dimorphism Elephant Ostrich Prostate cancer Gay slang Kakapo Platypus Cockatoo Sexual reproduction Estrus cycle Mountain Gorilla Jurassic Park Guinea pig Non-human animal sexuality Brain Puberty Orgasm Baldness Zoophilia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Animal communication Kim Possible Spider Transsexuality Jean-Luc Picard Human sexual behavior Sexual differentiation DNA Dinosaur Transgender Chicken Parrot Intersexuality Pet Infantilism Heteronormativity Sexual orientation Nile crocodile Peafowl Pet skunk The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Artificial selection Biology and sexual orientation Cat Mosquito Sex assignment Sexual intercourse Gender Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Irreducible complexity Vulcan (Star Trek) The Invisibles Poker jargon Penis Humphrey Bogart Breast H5N1 Lion Sadism and masochism Hermaphrodite Dragons (Pern) Baboon Parthenogenesis Asexuality Dilbert Pedophilia Avian influenza Tarantula Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Condor Red Phalarope Tuatara Gender identity Resident Evil: Apocalypse Rape Giant Panda Sexual identity Gerald Durrell Bondage (BDSM) Bottlenose Dolphin Borg
