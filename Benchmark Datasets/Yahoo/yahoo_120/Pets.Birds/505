does a chicken have to be broody before it sits on eggs i have chickens and i was wondering if i could put a few furtile eggs in there nest box and see if they will sit on them but i thought they would have to go broody first please help first of all make sure that your hens are broody breeds some chickens will never have chicks because it was breed out of them go to this website it is a chart that tells you all about the breeds of chickens http www ithaca edu staff jhenderson chooks chooks html then if you find that your chickens will go broody remember that the hen goes broody because of a hormonal change so when she goes broody depends on her body which will be different for each and every hen even if they are the same breed and age a good way to determine when a hen will go broody is to look at her stomach if she has lost most of her feathers down there then she will soon be going broody this is so that she can keep her eggs warmer because they will be in contact with her skin instead of all the feathers the body supplies the heat and her feathers hold it in also remember that hens that will not go broody also will lose their stomach feathers before you stick some eggs under your hen make sure that she is broody first if you do it the other way around the hen will most likely not take the eggs you will know when this happens your hen will fluff up and screech at you when you come to collect her eggs she will also stay on the nest night and day she will get of off the nest for about an hour each day to eat and go to the bathroom when she gets like this she is broody and ready for the fertile eggs if she isn t acting like this she isn t broody and she will not take the eggs what to do with the eggs fertile eggs should be kept around degrees if they are kept in degree temp or under the egg will die if they are kept at degrees the chick will start to develop and die later on because it hasn t been turned humidity went wrong or something else happened so make sure that the eggs are kept at the right temp also remember that fertility rates drop to basically nothing if the eggs are older then days what to do if the hen accepts the eggs give them to her and wait days for the chicks to hatch make sure other hens can t lay their eggs when the broody hen is you do not want her sitting on two many eggs make sure that she isn t sitting on to large of a nest if you wish to incubate keep eggs at degrees turn them three times a day until day after day do not turn them any longer keep the humidity constant at good luck Capercaillie Emu Kakapo Albatross Egg (food) Bird Seabird Condor Cock (chicken) Leatherback Sea Turtle Domesticated turkey Osprey Factory farming Kodocha Platypus Snake Peregrine Falcon Species Anopheles RuneScape economy Tawny Frogmouth The chicken or the egg Thermoregulation Theory of conduct Bird migration Mallard Bobwhite Quail Malleefowl Dinosaur Nile crocodile Salmon Rhea (bird) House Sparrow World Wide Web American Robin Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bee American Alligator Livestock Friends Aerial (dance move) Archery The Shining (film) Mattress The Power of One Brolga Musk Duck Balut Boom Town (Doctor Who) Minor Harry Potter Beasts Mercury Atlas 6 Cochin (chicken) Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Easter Island Mound-builders Laysan Albatross Omega-3 fatty acid Goldfish Life in the Freezer Agriculture The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Inside Zerg Emperor Penguin Endometrium Falconry Cantonese cuisine U.S. Acres MRE God Emperor of Dune Pink Pigeon Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Extreme Programming The Amber Spyglass African Fish Eagle Flea Prairie Falcon Coconut crab Sea turtle Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Honeybee Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Clownfish Fertility awareness Cuisine of the Philippines Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Veganism Poker jargon Cat
