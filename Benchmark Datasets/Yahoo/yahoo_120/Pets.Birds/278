new parakeets mating the started mating about two days ago they only do it when i am in bed at night and they are so hard to train because they both get mood swings i was wondering about how long it takes them to lay the eggs and some facts about parakeet babies also i would like to know what are the chances she will lay fertile eggs oh wow yeah my birds did the same thing ok this is going to be alot of info my parakeets only mated when i wasnt around or in the morning or late at night once they do this the female will lay an egg in about days and if more are going to be laid they will be laid about every other day and yes the female will have mood swings after all the eggs have been laid it will take about days for the eggs to hatch if they are fertile assuming they have mated if they are not the female will not be sitting on them the chances she lays fertile eggs are pretty good if they have mated if u are planning to breed them it is best to have a nest box wood is the best but cardboard can be used as a substitute after the eggs have hatched try not to disturb the female or she may reject the eggs once the babies are old enough to be handled try and socialize them as much as u can then ur babies will be excellent birds and its fun to see what colors they get some problems are egg binding this is when the egg in the female is too soft and cannot be pushed out give them cuttle bones to prevent this lettuce is good for females also and some pet stores have some special food for nesting females with extra nutrients if the female however does get egg bound u can soak her butt in warm water to help if this does not help get to a vet immediately or it could be fatal to the bird i will have a web page for u too lok at Chicken Kakapo Bird Platypus Leatherback Sea Turtle Ostrich Hamster Aphid Emu Seabird Capercaillie Dog Mattress Guinea pig Queen bee Pet skunk Tick Breastfeeding Nile crocodile Clownfish Fancy rat American lobster Salmon Octopus Albatross Spider Dinosaur Tuatara Musk Duck Species Bobwhite Quail Sexual reproduction Dragons (Pern) American Alligator Budgerigar Tarantula Minor Harry Potter Beasts Anopheles Flea Earthworm Beetle Polychrotidae Milk Cat Penguin American Robin Jute Coconut crab Bagworm moth In vitro fertilisation Gypsy moth Falconry Shark Kiwi Brolga Hedgehog Vegetarianism Ascariasis Hemp The chicken or the egg Osprey Giant Panda Red imported fire ant Jon Secada Tofu Kodocha Goldfish Infertility Great Bustard Cockroach Gerald Durrell Condor Grunion 2000 Australian Grand Prix Malleefowl Eggerland series Comanche Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Mallard Domestic rabbit Dairy Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Hera Bee Rose-ringed Parakeet Fibonacci number Bird migration House Mouse Paper wasp
