how much does diameter affect contact lens size i'm trying to buy contacts cheaper online here because the price of buying them from my doctor is getting crazy the size where it says diamater is while the ones online are only available in but all the other measurments and prescriptions add up will this be a big problem or could i still wear them the doctor wrote you a prescription for a specific diameter because it does matter what the diameter is if you change the diameter by increasing it and having the other parameters like base curve the same you are actually changing the fit of the lens increasing diameter will create a looser fitting lens and this could cause issues with the fit causing discomfort and problems with visual acuity an improper fitting lens can actually cause damage to your cornea even though everything feels fine this is why contact lenses need to be fit and monitored by an eye doctor the prescription your eye doctor wrote was for the exact same contact lenses you were fit with online contact lens dealers will actually verify the prescription with your eye doctor so even if you did get away with ordering contact lenses with a different diameter you would probably be wasting your money because it is likely they will not fit properly if you want to order contact lenses online then you will need to find the exact same contact lenses your prescription was written for hope this helps a bit Contact lens Eye Eyeglass prescription Keratoconus Eyepiece Glasses Binoculars Optometry LASIK Nuclear weapon design Medical prescription Digital photography Intraocular lens Cornea Equine conformation Gas metal arc welding Microeconomics Publicly funded medicine Diabetic retinopathy Rabies Pharmaceutical company Screw Internal ballistics Fecal incontinence Contract Dictionary Illegal drug trade Telescope Autostereogram Parallax Laser Tire Loudspeaker Psoriasis Methamphetamine Prolactinoma Tocopherol Dark matter Food and Drug Administration Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gravitational lens Drill bit Snellen chart Amblyopia Phishing Anamorphic widescreen Curve fitting Genetic algorithm Depth of field Inflation Sun RFID Hipparchus (astronomer) Movie projector Modified Newtonian dynamics Photorefractive keratectomy Aberration in optical systems Bicycle The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Eye contact M16 (rifle) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Car handling Sunglasses Allergy Supply and demand Big Bang Autism Action potential Electrophysiology Explosive material Astigmatism United States dollar Refractive surgery Hat Gramophone record Growth hormone treatment Billiards Aperture Color Pi Isaac Newton's early life and achievements Reflecting telescope Extrasolar planet Canadian and American health care systems compared General relativity Prostate cancer Overclocking Torpedo Health insurance Star Wars: Galaxies Cartridge (firearms) Strategic management Price equation
