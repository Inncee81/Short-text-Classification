how long should it take to get used to new glasses i just got new glasses days ago after not wearing glasses for years my right eye lense is times stronger than the left so it's a big difference for me is it normal for things to not look as clear when you have each eye so different it feels like it was easier all these years without glasses i have farsightedness in one eye and nearsightedness in the other eye and i do notice that things are not quite as clear as they should be like i lost a little bit of depth perception since both eyes need to be close to the same prescription for everything to look right i can tell that my lenses are projected at different distances the image is placed farther from my nearsighted eye and close to my farsighted eye if you are like me you'll probably find that you have a dominant eye that you will be using more and that's not because you have lazy eye or anything it will probably be the eye that is less hyperopic or if you have two nearsighted eyes it could be either and you will surely get used to it with time if at the end of two weeks you don't feel that everything is right go back to the person who prescribed you the glasses to see if you need to make any adjustments with the prescriptions or if there is anything else you can do Myopia Glasses Eyeglass prescription Stereoscopy Autostereogram Eye Strabismus Amblyopia View camera Parallax Anaglyph image Binocular vision Photographic lens Social rule Macro photography Presbyopia Stereopsis Eyepiece Depth of field Microscope Sunglasses Characters in the Smurfs Binoculars Cinematography Lens (optics) IMAX Shen Gong Wu Diplopia Diabetic retinopathy Aberration in optical systems Time Out of Mind Red dot sight Medical prescription Hall & Oates Camera Drill bit Perspective projection distortion Intraocular lens Single-lens reflex camera Astronomy on Mars Nystagmus Lucid dreaming Pinhole camera Equine conformation Australian English Textile manufacturing Extrasolar planet Dimension Fecal incontinence Anamorphic widescreen Binocular rivalry Theory of conduct Psoriasis Trilobite Telescope History of telescopes Depth perception Eye contact Keratoconus Movie projector Max Martin The Ashlee Simpson Show Cinerama Jon Secada Dyslexia Time Enlarger Glass Falsifiability Philosophy of perception Milton H.
