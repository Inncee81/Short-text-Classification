my eye doctor wouldn't let me get contacts before glasses is that common practice i had my first eye exam yesterday and the doctor insisted i had to have glasses before contacts so i went ahead and ordered glasses however i am almost positive i will want contacts and i feel like i just wasted on glasses i will hardly wear in the future was he right do i need to adjust to glasses before i can get contacts he told me i could come back in a few weeks after having glasses if i wanted to get contacts fitted does that literally mean weeks or do i have to wait a certain amount of time i don't have my exact prescription in front of me but my left eye is astigmatic and my right is not and only needs very slight correction and i need the correction for distance the glasses i ordered are only for powers of or if that helps thanks everyone first of all it is not bull your doctor may have had a very good reason for putting you in glasses first if you have a high prescription and have never worn glasses or contacts before he may need to change the prescription depending on how well you adjust to it also when you wear contacts you have to have glasses to wear when you can't wear your contacts contrarily to popular belief you can not wear contacts all the time you have to give your eyes a rest as far as going back for the fitting give yourself at least two weeks to adjust to your new glasses once you feel comfortable with the prescription go back for the contact lens fitting hope this helped Eyeglass prescription Glasses Lens (optics) Eyepiece Aberration in optical systems Contact lens Eye View camera Presbyopia Myopia Intraocular lens Binoculars Keratoconus Car handling Marching band Equine conformation Dog agility Theory of conduct Medical prescription Japanese tea ceremony Electrophysiology LASIK Motorcycle Optometry Lighting Tire Prostate cancer Rei Ayanami Bicycle Daylight saving time Photographic lens Stage lighting Weight training Gas metal arc welding Parallax Fecal incontinence Ocean's Twelve Bicycle lighting Naval mine Headlight Carburetor Publication of Darwin's theory Strategic management Archery Menstrual cup Transformer Japanese toilet The Ashlee Simpson Show President (game) Enlarger Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Solar cell Astigmatism Aikido Circuit design Rum Sailing Wind turbine Hal Trosky Beetle in an Anthill Charles Darwin's education Internal ballistics Telescope Isaac Newton's early life and achievements The Amazing Race The Contender (television series) Snooker Spacecraft propulsion Volleyball English grammar The Shining (film) Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Jumpstart 3rd Grade John Sheridan (Babylon 5) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Publicly funded medicine Table saw Incandescent light bulb Jeopardy!
