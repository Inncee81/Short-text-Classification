difference btw mba and masters in business i am currently doing my bachelors in hospitality and tourism and thinking about doing my masters as soon as i graduate can someone tell me what the most important difference between mba and masters in business other than the huge diff in fees hehe thx the mba is a practitioner degree providing a general and broad based education in business for those leaning toward careers in management the ma is an academic degree providing a specialized education in business for those interested in research higher education and the academic study of business my ma required far more research than the mba and the mba covered far more areas of business function management accounting finance strategy etc reality is that you'd have to compare the curriculum of each as what is an mba at one school may well be the ma bus at another and vice versa someone once told me the difference is that the mba does business and the ma thinks about it not so sure that's entirely true but it's close add note in some circles the mba is considered a first professional degree and is therefor below an ma in other circles the mba is considered a terminal degree even though a dba exists and is therefor higher than an ma real world all other things being equal in business the mba is the preferred credential in academia teaching in college the ma more coursework in a specific subject instead of the general nature of the mba would be preferred but a phd would be preferred over both Master of Business Administration Graduate school Master's degree Doctor of Philosophy Chinese University of Hong Kong MIT Sloan School of Management Education in Portugal Academia Education in the United States Baruch College Cass Business School, London College Physician Washington University in St. Louis Ross School of Business Software engineering University of Notre Dame City and Guilds of London Institute Babson College Athabasca University Nurse Higher education No Child Left Behind Act Medical school Doctorate Saint Joseph's University Kingston University Far Eastern University Professor Education in Germany Education in Hong Kong Georgetown University University of Phoenix Indian Institutes of Management Education in Sweden Bologna process Chiropractic Librarian University of Santo Tomas Education in the Republic of Ireland Lawyer Law school Bachelor of Arts British degree abbreviations University of Houston Associate's degree Stern School of Business Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Baldwin-Wallace College Lowry Mays College of Business University of Central Florida Open University Education in Finland Australian Qualifications Framework S.C.
