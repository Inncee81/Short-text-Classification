i want to be a vet but i am not sure how to start off anyone out there could give me advice on how to get my goal acomplished how much school do i need what type of college classes thanks to all that will answer basics first you want to attend a good four year college or university while it's not required that you earn a degree more than of vet school students do earn an undergraduate degree so that's the norm anyway you can really major in anything you like but the majority of folks major in biology with the next largest group coming from chemistry and physics followed by a variety of majors history humanities etc the point with your major is to demonstrate that you have the ability to learn advanced topics in some subject and excel at it while in college you'll take a variety of courses that are pre requisites for getting into vet school including semesters of general biology semesters of general chemistry semesters of organic chemistry semesters of physics vet schools are a little unusual in that some have additional requirements that vary from school to school for instance some want you to have business classes good idea in my opinion communications classes stats classes good idea nutrition classes and others but you'll learn about those while you're in college through your school's health pre professional committee or student organization after undergrad vet school takes an additional four years this past year about of graduates went on to specialty training which takes additional time but that's optional of course anyway figure on eight years after high school generally other advice get out and volunteer now getting into vet school is extremely competitive so you need that volunteer time in veterinary practices if possible get some experience at several kinds of offices small animal large animal exotic specialty aspca style clinics etc the admissions committees will want to know that you know enough via experience about the reality of veterinary medicine that you won't get part way into it and decide you don't like it also when you get to college find out who is on your school's health pre professional committee responsible for evaluating applicants for vet school from your college take their classes if possible and at least get their advice along the way good luck Physician Juris Doctor Education in the United States Medical school Veterinary medicine Cornell University Dentistry Veterinarian Education in Portugal Education in Germany Education in Australia Physical therapy Education in Taiwan Science Chinese University of Hong Kong Pharmacist Doctorate Georgetown University College admissions Nurse Trinity College, Dublin Law school Stuyvesant High School University of Central Florida GED Lawyer Massachusetts Institute of Technology American University Education in Hong Kong Education Master's degree University of Michigan Seneca College University of Maryland Baltimore County Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology University of Bristol Hampshire College University of Connecticut College University of Edinburgh Community college Quizbowl Health science Simon Fraser University Grade (education) Dublin City University Software engineering Far Eastern University Reed College Advanced Placement Program University of Pennsylvania United States Air Force Academy Florida State University General practitioner High school The Citadel (Military College) SAT Virginia Commonwealth University Australian Qualifications Framework Heidelberg College Hunter College High School Tulane University Students' union University of Alabama IB Diploma Programme Bologna process Yale University Education in Malaysia UCAS Paralegal Charles William Eliot Martial art Middle Tennessee State University Air Education and Training Command Temple University Oregon State University City and Guilds of London Institute __cole Polytechnique Johns Hopkins University Physics Psychology Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Student loan Barrister Education in Japan Apprenticeship The College of New Jersey
