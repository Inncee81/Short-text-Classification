where can i find schools offering master degrees in event planning i would like to obtain a masters degree in event management and am unable to locate a program besides george washington university i live in nyc though the program could be online or in the classroom i am not looking for a certificate program but an actual masters degree any relevant advice would be appreciated thanks i would be skeptic if i found one for the following reason event planning is a profesional domain while a master's degree is an academic orientation academics try to solve issues related to a field a masters thesis answer a question based on two assumptions using an academic aka peer reviewed methodology engineers try to solve specific issues related to specific settings e g solutions to expand the lifespan of x types of bridge submitted to y factors while social sciences try to explain social trends and phenomenon and linguists details how the structure of language are affecting cultures and groups of people as for event planning it seems more of a professional orientation marketing booking scheduling promoting the event are part of the equation and sucessful people are more enclined to have lots of experience instead of asnwering though questions if you want a masters degree related to event planning the best bet would be to enroll in a mba and focus your projects and research on certain aspects of event planning good luck Graduate school Software engineering Master's degree Education in Portugal Academia Sexual orientation Chinese University of Hong Kong Strategic management History of science Psychology GED Intelligent design Mathematics Extreme Programming Master of Business Administration Economics Massachusetts Institute of Technology A New Kind of Science Franz Boas The Skeptical Environmentalist College University of Central Florida Science Anthropology Philosophy Education in the People's Republic of China Columbia University Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of language Juris Doctor Washington University in St. Louis Education in Germany Education in Austria Model (economics) Cooperative education Expert system Supernatural No Child Left Behind Act Systems engineering Education in Hong Kong Philosophy of mathematics Cultural relativism Biology and sexual orientation Physics Professor Computer science Creation-evolution controversy Physical therapy Prices of production Political science Logic Pennsylvania State University University of Maryland Baltimore County Parapsychology Epistemology Asperger syndrome Northeastern University, Boston Intelligence quotient Purdue University Quizbowl Microsoft Max Weber Education Librarian Pseudoscience Doctorate Postmodernism Medical school Falsifiability Many-worlds interpretation Religion Ross School of Business Duke University Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Intelligent design movement Computer Stevens Institute of Technology Homeopathy Social sciences Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in Malaysia Linguistics Futures Studies University of Maryland, College Park Experiential education
