what are good college towns i'm getting into something fairly general and right now i live in nebraska so i'm just looking to get away to a good college in a nice town someplace where the downtown is right next door campus is nice looking maybe a good music concert scene i've been eyeing chicago but i haven't looked too much into it i know there's more to it than all of this but i'm only a junior so figured i'd get some ideas from every angle with no rush thanks i've been on dozens of campuses if you're looking for a mid sized college and you're willing to go out of state consider ohio university not ohio state university ohio university in athens oh athens is not a large town it's only about people when college is in session and the college is only about people but it pretty much is what you describe for a town and a college that small there is always something going on and the music scene is pretty good even though they're a good distance away there is always somebody going to columbus or cleveland so if you need a big city fix it's always available on a weekend also ou has a lot of very strong academic programs such as journalism engineering music psychology osteopathic medicine and on and on it sounds like the perfect fit for you Ohio Ohio State University State university Ohio University Ohio Wesleyan University Midwestern United States Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Columbus, Ohio College Cleveland, Ohio University of Minnesota Case Western Reserve University Oklahoma State University - Stillwater Pennsylvania State University Tulane University Georgia Institute of Technology Osteopathy Carnegie Mellon University Cleveland State University Cornell University Arizona State University University of Toronto University of Houston Lincoln, Nebraska Theory of conduct Northwestern University Michigan State University University of Southern California University of California, Los Angeles Alpha Epsilon Pi University of North Dakota Delaware, Ohio Education in the United States University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign University of Connecticut Duke University Medical school University of Michigan Miami University The Catholic University of America Florida Institute of Technology University of Pennsylvania Far Eastern University University of Rochester Chinese University of Hong Kong Johns Hopkins University Chesapeake and Ohio Railway University of New England, Maine Memorial University of Newfoundland University of Tennessee Baylor University University of Alabama College football University of Edinburgh DeVry University University of Southampton 2000 Australian Grand Prix American University Cincinnati, Ohio College radio Trinity College, Dublin Purdue University Youngstown, Ohio Texas A&M University University of Nevada, Reno Columbia University Akron, Ohio Buildings of Iowa State University Alternative medicine Toledo, Ohio University of Louisville University of Nebraska-Lincoln The Waterboys University of Cincinnati Interstate 80 University at Albany Lansing, Michigan Vanderbilt University North Carolina State University Phi Kappa Tau Academia Imperial College London College town Big Ten Conference The College of New Jersey Marshall University V8 Smith College Wright State University The Beach Boys University of Akron Auburn, Alabama Dublin City University Clemson University University of California, Irvine University of Central Florida Quizbowl Weill Cornell Medical College
