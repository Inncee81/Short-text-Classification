full time grad school vs full time work and online classes i am accepted to non local grad school for fall the school provides distance learning and traditional study if i want to paticipate in the class then i need to leave my job and move to the other city but this will allow me graduate in one yr my other option is to work full time and take online classes my employer does provide tuition reimbursement for full time employees but it doesn't pay until two yrs after i complete the class if i choose this option i will need to spend yrs or more to graduate i wonder which option is better did anyone complete their grad school online while employed full time how does that like i hear it is not easy is that true also do i really miss a lot if i am not sitting in the classroom its all according to your circumstances do what feels right for you i know a girl who did online classes and worked full time and she said it was easy and she has no debts from it however i went to the other way and took traditional classes i feel you gain a lot of people skills and can enjoy having professors there to help whenever you want its awesome to communicate with other students who are as smart as you and who are going through the same things as you it enriches your life for sure so either way is good its up to your circumstances and what you believe is the better choice for you Education in the United States Student loan Homeschooling Community college College admissions Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in the People's Republic of China Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Education in Portugal Affirmative action Education in Australia Education in Hong Kong Rice University Saved by the Bell GED No Child Left Behind Act Education in Romania Nurse Lawyer Unemployment Academia Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Economic inequality Professor Pitaten RuneScape Unemployment benefit Princeton University Japanese tea ceremony Avenue Q Franklin W.
