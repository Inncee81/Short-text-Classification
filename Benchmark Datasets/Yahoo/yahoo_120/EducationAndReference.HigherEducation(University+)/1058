otis college dangerous to attend in los angeles california i noticed that otis college in los angeles ca is very close to lax la airport is there any chance that a plane could accidently hit otis and how far is it from lax i had to laugh when i read your question because i am a faculty member at loyola marymount university which is very near otis and i spent three years living south of otis which was about two or three blocks closer to the airport than the school is if it makes you feel any better the runway patterns are such that the planes don't go directly overhead they take off from the south going west over the ocean before turning around at a much higher altitude they land about mile south and while they presumably could veer off course i've never known it to happen the small planes take off and land from santa monica airport and over the years i've heard of several of those crashing into homes in that area but lax only deals with larger planes and in my years in l a i've never heard of this happening the only unpleasant things i can tell you about is that when i lived in the apartment near the airport there was noise and a smell of jet fuel fumes at some times of day when the wind sent them in the wrong direction the buildings were wel soundproofed though so it wasn't a problem inside just when i went out Westchester, Los Angeles, California September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Los Angeles International Airport Southern California Los Angeles, California Los Angeles County, California Airport Interstate 405 (California) West Los Angeles (region) Fixed-wing aircraft Loyola Marymount University Air traffic control Airport (film) United Airlines Flight 93 Kai Tak Airport USS Twining (DD-540) Palmdale, California San Francisco International Airport 2005 Pacific hurricane season Greater Los Angeles Area Beverly Hills, California Santa Monica, California Space Shuttle program B-47 Stratojet Long Beach Municipal Airport Concorde Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Friends Air France Flight 358 Frank Gehry Transportation of Los Angeles Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Tenerife disaster Air safety Accidents and incidents in aviation California State Route 2 John F.
