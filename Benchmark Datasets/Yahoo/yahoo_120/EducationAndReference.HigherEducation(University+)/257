help with my college acceptance essay please hi this is just from the common application what i need to know is on the common app it states that there is a word minimum but no maximum was stated do you think that just under words is okay most people do around or so i've heard but i'm having a hard time reducing it any more than i already have it was about a significant occurrence in my life and i used a lot of imagery any tips on reducing it if you do think it will be a problem is an essay supposed to have something directed towards the university reader for example are you supposed to throw in at the end something like it is for these reasons that i feel i would contribute to your university just as much as your university would benefit me or do you just leave it with an insightful comment about whatever you wrote your essay on thank you so much the best college essays stand out from the crowd make it something that if you were sorting through a hundred essays you would want to read do this by making the first sentence catchy taking a personal experience and connecting it to why you would contribute to the university you're applying to the more specific the better for example perhaps if you're applying to an education school you could write about a moment in which you realized you had really helped someone and that's when you decided to be a teacher words is fine i wouldn't go over remember the admissions people will be tired and looking for a crisp clean essay proofread it carefully and ask others to read it make sure above all it is not a repeat of your resume good luck GED Social rule College admissions Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus SAT Theory of conduct Ethics Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Marshall McLuhan Scientology beliefs and practices Bernard Williams Alexander Technique Debugging Aikido Philosophical skepticism Car handling Annuity The nature of God in Western theology Avenue Q Professor Walter J.
