colleges at once im about to enter my freshmen year of college this fall at the university of south alabama in mobile and i was wondering if it woul be possible for me to take hours a week max full time student thier and take some online courses so i could finish school in to years is this possible thanks im not asking my advisor because she is a dumb ass seriously thanks btw im already planning to take summer classes and which puts me graduating in my major is criminal justice and minor is philosophy when i was at the univ of alabama i knew several students who attended ua full time but also took a class or two at shelton state if you really want to take a big load you can get away with it for the first couple of years because the level classes aren't so hard however when you get to take level classes they become more involved and you'll probably need to slow down a bit however i know from ua that you could enroll for up to hours in a semester if you did that you could still conceivably graduate in years if you go year round also the more hours you take from one university the cheaper it gets if you want to enroll at another university check the stars guide i assume that is still around for alabama students that way you can make sure the classes you take there will transfer back to usa and you can try spring hill i think that is the community college down there online classes tend to cost more alabama jr college is about per hour i believe Education in the United States The Citadel (Military College) Graduate school University of Southern California University of Alabama Education in Australia University of Michigan Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Romania Juris Doctor Education in Germany Georgetown University Academic term Cornell University Education in Portugal Tulane University Yale University Auburn University Carnegie Mellon University Middle Tennessee State University Virginia Military Institute University of Central Florida Student University of Tennessee Community college Spring Hill College Hunter College High School Brown University Princeton University Education in Austria Duke University Georgia Institute of Technology Florida State University Northeastern University, Boston Pennsylvania State University Texas A&M University Boston College Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Professor University of Alabama in Huntsville University of Maryland, College Park Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Auburn, Alabama High school University of Houston Education in Taiwan Western Kentucky University Affirmative action Gwinnett University Center Columbia University Education in Hong Kong North Carolina State University California Polytechnic State University Savannah College of Art and Design Jesuit College Preparatory School Angela Davis United States Air Force Academy Harvard University University of Texas at San Antonio Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Brigham Young University American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Walt Disney World College Program Montgomery Blair High School United States Army Kwantlen University College Purdue University New York University Medical school University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee College of William and Mary Education in India Emory University Williams College Bob Jones University University of Arizona Smith College College admissions University at Albany Ohio Wesleyan University Louisiana State University Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Higher education in Japan Emerson College Queen's University Associate's degree College University of Pennsylvania Franklin W.
