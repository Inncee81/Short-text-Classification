are college grads better than people with just high school diploma's i am having a difficult time at work because of this the girl i work with has a bachelors and i haven't finished school she doesn't take anything i say seriously and she talks down to me like i'm an idiot i have noticed that she gravitates towards people who are college educated which is the rest of our office i have ten fold more experience in my industry than she does but somehow she feels that because she went through college and only has two years experience whereas i have she is somehow above me unfortunately there will be people in this world who will use whatever excuses to feel superior over others the problem can be resolved by not letting it get to you just because she has a degree doesn't mean that she's any smarter than you just academically more educated you're giving her permission to make you feel bad by letting her snobbery get to you the next time she talks down to you simply say could you please not talk to me like that it's insulting and i don't appreciate it oftentimes people don't realize their poor behavior unless someone points it out or if she does then you're calling her on it and showing that education doesn't matter when it comes to standing up for yourself don't let your education make you feel inferior go ahead and befriend those college graduate colleagues it's not like they sit around and talk about calculus formulas they learned in upper division math soon they'll realize what a nice cool person you are and the diploma differences will be forgotten btw i have a very good friend who didn't go to college it didn't bother him he is a founder of a mega large internet company he also is one of the most grounded and humble people i know people who hang their self esteem on education are surely the ones who have low ones Theory of conduct Graduate school Education in the United States Avenue Q Electrophysiology College Social rule Poker jargon High school Juris Doctor Teacher Friends SAT Education Medical school Saved by the Bell Education in Portugal Teen Girl Squad The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Milton H.
