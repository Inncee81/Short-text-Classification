what is your weekly college assignment workload like i'm about to start college in a month and i would like to know what i can expect i know that each college and university varies in their workload but generally i think they should be similar how many assignments do you get for each class and what is their difficulty level how much time do they take to complete what type of assignments do you get weekly quizzes projects etc are midterms and finals difficult how many classes do you take per term and how many hours a week do you spend on studying what would be your best advice to someone starting college thanks well it all depends on the type of classes you are taking as a freshman your workload is extremely different than that of junior's freshman typically take core classes the basics that everyone has to take like english and us history and college algebra and what not so the workload in terms of content shouldn't be too difficult but it might be a bit difficult simply because you aren't used to college life yet with math classes you typically have homework after every class although most college math teachers don't take up the homework it is just meant for practice so you will do well on tests and quizes and i recommend doing the homework trust me you'll wish you had when finals roll around you also tend to have a quiz every week or every other week in english classes your homework tends to be more of the read a short story variety or simple writing assignments with major papers due every so often i never found english to be that difficult altough it can get time consuming writing a major literary analysis over a short story you read in class takes at least a few hours science classes such as biology or physics or chemistry don't usually have many homework assignments you just need to spend plenty of time studying your notes what i like to do for those classes is the night before a class i re read my notes from the last class paying particular attention to things i found difficult to understand during lecture science classes are not good classes to cram for exams study a little each night along the way works so much better than studying all night for an exam typically normal exams aren't too hard but midterms and finals tend to be cummulative so they can be killer so start studying early and if your teacher gives out a study guide do it a full time schedule is considered credit hours usually credit hour classes most people take more than usually or hours a week you spend studying depends on you teachers often tell you how many hours you need for their class when they go over the syllabus but i found that i only need about half the time they recommend they tend to say you need hour of studying for every credit hour of class or hours per credit hour if it is a math or science course i wouldn't worry about it too much if i were you you adjust pretty quickly the trick is to figure out how you study best and how to utilize your time wisely don't waste hours studying one way if it doesn't work for you if you like to use flash cards then use them if just re reading your notes works for you then do that if you like to re work all the math problems for the unit then do that find the ways that work for you and only use those and don't forget to find time to have fun college isn't all about studying you know so enjoy it oh and don't forget that your teachers are there if you need help professors are very willing to help their students out if you find that you are doing poorly in a class don't give up maybe your professor can help you they are often very willing to help students if the student is willing to ask for help most schools have good tutor centers also so if you find you need a little extra help see if your school has a learning center tutor center or something like that check bulletin boards in the hallways and ask your professors usually there are good tutors to be found oh and to give you some perspective if you find your freshman workload is a bit much this fall i will be a junior in a nursing program starting the 'upper division' courses this means no more pre req sciences like anatomy i'll be in actual nursing classes with clinicals we have these things called care plans that we have to do for our patients before clinicals and you have one night to write them and they take hours to write i am taking credit hours and i should expect to study at least hours a week and that's if i'm a slacker i should expect to get if i am lucky hours of sleep a night nursing school is one of the hardest academics out there probably medical school is the only thing harder and many would argue it isn't as hard since they have years and we condense it in to and i will be spending nearly all of my time studying or in class it is extremely difficult time consuming and stressful yay i can't wait so good luck to you enjoy freshman year of college don't let my whining about the fall scare you i really enjoy college and despite all the hard work i think i'll enjoy more or less last two years after all i wanted to be a nurse so i chose to suffer through nursing school Physician Grade
