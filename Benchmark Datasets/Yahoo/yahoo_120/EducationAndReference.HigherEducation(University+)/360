can anyone give me breakdown of what it takes to become a christan psychologist please answer i would like to go to eu evangel university the only thing i know about it is it takes like years to become a psychologist i need to know how many credits i need and how many hours i need to take a semester how many semesters are there in college how many hour i need to know everything how much do you think it will cost to go to evangel all together what classes do i need to take note i asked my parents all this and they didnt know much what do you think would be cheaper living in a dorm or an apartment also give me the breakdown on what i need like do i need to get my phd or masters or what thanks okay most of the questions you have about what classes to take will be answered at college you'll have an adviser or guidance counselor to help you classes differ from place to place but expect to take basics like english some math biology history a basic computer class and literature then you'll take a ton of psychology classes such as abnormal psych child psych developmental psych etc i'm not sure what the christian part will entail the average course load is hours a semester you need at least to stay full time and most will only let you take up to the average class is hours so expect to take around classes a semester dorm and apartment living are almost the same cost in most places it just depends on what you prefer some schools require you stay in a dorm for your first year dorms are good because you usually don't have to drive to class apartments are good if you like to cook and want a kitchen you will need at bare minimum your masters but i imagine it'd be more realistic to get your phd to stand a good chance in the job market i'm a psychology major and i'm planning to go to medical school but if that doesn't work out i'll be getting a phd it takes a little longer but it'll look better on job resumes hope this helps Graduate school Education in Germany Education in Romania Education in the United States Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Juris Doctor Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Taiwan The Sims 2: University Freed-Hardeman University Chinese University of Hong Kong Extreme Programming Intelligent design movement Education in Australia SAT Psychology Social psychology Chiropractic Princeton University Claremont McKenna College Advanced Placement Program University of Massachusetts Amherst University of Central Florida Georgetown University Economic inequality Doctorate Rochester Institute of Technology Master's degree Hunter College High School Reed College Stuyvesant High School Education in Hong Kong North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Grade (education) Narcissism Social rule Coming of Age (TNG episode) Education in Portugal Bristol Grammar School Kwantlen University College Florida Institute of Technology Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Hopkins School Pitzer College Divorce Sexual orientation Carl Jung Soul Psychotherapy Intelligent design Abortion debate Prostate cancer Student loan University of Santo Tomas Great Teacher Onizuka Altruism Steve Jobs Physician Academic term University of Tennessee at Chattanooga Northfield Mount Hermon Theory of conduct Economics Microeconomics Secondary education in the United States Life insurance Rutgers University Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) University of Scranton Duke University Harvey Mudd College Education reform California Baptist University Tulane University American University Theodicy College of the Southwest Hamilton College Middle Tennessee State University Georgia Institute of Technology Franklin W.
