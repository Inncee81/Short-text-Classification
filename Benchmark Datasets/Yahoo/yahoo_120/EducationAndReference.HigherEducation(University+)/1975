will they forget about me i'm starting college soon and i'm staying at a community college for one year to start off and save money then i'm transferring to a nearby university but my friends are so excited to get away and live in a dorm and everything and they tell me that we will see each other all the time and i will visit them and they will always be home and i'm happy that they are excited they tell me that when i transfer to go to a school to get a dorm but personally i don't want a dorm but anyway i'm just scared that my friends will just go off to college and forget about me i want them to have their own experience of college and make lots of new friends i'm just worried that i won't see them for a long time or ever again i'm starting college too i'm going out of state and no one else that i know is going to my college and i only know of a few that are even going out of state i would recommend a dorm when you transfer just because everything that will be happening will be centered around the college and the further you are from campus the further you are from the actual college life but back to your friends if you are willing to make the effort and they are willing to make the effort there is no reason why you couldn't see each other on a fairly regular basis one of my best friends is going to college across country and we are already trying to make plans to see each other over christmas break and we are going to keep in touch and try to talk as often as we did at home sure it won't be the same but as long as everyone is willing to make the effort then there should be no problem Avenue Q Social rule Saved by the Bell Trinity College (Connecticut) Franklin W.
