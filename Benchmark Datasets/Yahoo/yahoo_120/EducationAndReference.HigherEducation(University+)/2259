what courses should i take in college and for what major i really want to go to college i just can't decide on what career path to take i have thought about this a lot and i always come back to accounting business or engineering i am afraid i won't do well in engineering but maybe a challenge would be a good thing i think accounting would get boring after awhile since i am taking some classes in highschool but maybe it would be good to go into something that i know a little bit about and with business i'm afraid that that is going to be to broad of choice and it won't help me very much i want to go for something that i should be able to get a job in when i graduate i mean that is the point of going to college and i would like something that i will be able to help support a family with the income please help me chose a path to follow don't worry you don't have to make this decision instantly just put something down on the application and when you get to college you will be taking mostly general ed classes anyway so you will have plenty of time to decide what you want to do given the choices you mention though make sure that the math you take is sufficiently tough so that you could choose one of those things when you do decide if you just take the easiest math class you are eligible for you may not get into engineering accounting or business if that ends up being what you want to do you need to know that undeclared is the most common major among college freshmen so you are by no means alone in being unsure of what you want to do Mathematics Education in Romania The Apprentice 2 Theory of conduct Richard Feynman Worcester Polytechnic Institute California Polytechnic State University Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Social rule Education in the United States Cooper Union Requirements analysis Grade (education) U.S. Electoral College Time Out of Mind Sheepshead University of Massachusetts Amherst Ra (board game) Unreal UCAS MapleStory Predestination Double the Fist Virginia Military Institute Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Theodicy Decision making Dog agility The Lovely Bones University of Michigan Complexity classes P and NP Government of France The Sims 2: University CPU cache Physician Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Massachusetts Institute of Technology American and British English differences 2000 Australian Grand Prix Community college Georgetown University Seneca College Education in Portugal French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Piccolo Junior Saga Poker jargon Expert system Hunter College High School United States Air Force Academy Graduate school Central processing unit Procrastination Reverse mathematics Elections in the United States Quizbowl Goodness and value theory Pennsylvania State University Great Teacher Onizuka Master's degree Computer numbering formats Florida Institute of Technology The Adventures of Pete & Pete Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban GED Team Fortress Classic Merrimack College The Beach Boys Secondary education in the United States Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Lyceum of the Philippines 1957 World Series Secondary education in France W.
