gre preparation who has taken the gre i'm looking at the preparation guides online and it looks intimidating i'm doing well at uni right now but it looks like grad school is a different animal thoughts grad school is a different animal but it really has nothing to do with your performance on the gre like most standardized tests it just gives a very surficial idea to graduate acceptance and fellowship committees about your abilities as a student it's important to keep in mind that it's just one ingredient out of many e g gpa extra curricular participation work experience etc in the overrall formula that is used to determine whether or not to admit fund you if you are strong in other areas than your gre score won't need to be perfect i guess i'm saying to study for it but don't stress too much over it in my experience graduate school is more political than it is fair students with little or no people communication skills and who relied on their smarts alone for undergraduate success often get frustrated at this fact if you really want to prepare yourself for graduate school then take this advice go to the website of the graduate school s that you might want to attend spend some time looking into the different professors' research interests often found on their websites and contact those that you might be interested to have as your advisor introduce yourself ask them about any interesting upcoming research opportunities and offer your resume my experience is that doing this will leap frog you to the front of the pack based off of your expressed interest alone and requirements for admission including gre scores will become almost trivial Graduate school Education in the United States College admissions Graduate Record Examination Intelligence quotient Law school Education in the People's Republic of China Law School Admissions Test SAT GED Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Juris Doctor Physician Medical school Homeschooling Trinity College, Dublin Education in Portugal Grade (education) Quizbowl Carnegie Mellon University Education in Hong Kong University of Michigan Cornell University Scientific method United States Naval Academy Education Paralegal Lawyer Education in Japan Stanford University Tai Chi Chuan Test (student assessment) Education in Sweden University of Bristol Education in Germany Veterinary medicine The Citadel (Military College) Doctor of Philosophy Student loan Animal testing University of Central Florida University of Hong Kong No Child Left Behind Act ELO rating system Standardized testing University of Connecticut Barbara McClintock Theory of multiple intelligences Robert Oppenheimer Autism Massachusetts Institute of Technology College and university rankings Scholarship Rice University Higher education in Japan Professor X Stevens Institute of Technology Education in Singapore Education in Taiwan Teach the Controversy Georgia Institute of Technology Alexander Technique Japanese tea ceremony Physical therapy Psychology Martin J.
