question about taking classes at a community college i'm in a regular year university but i'm staying home this semester for health reasons i plan to return to my university in january but i feel strange being out of school i'd like to take some classes this fall at a community college near me but i'm not sure how to go about doing it what would i enroll as at the community college a 'transfer student' but then i don't want to do that because i plan to go back to my own school do cc's generally allow people to take classes only half the year and then leave i'm so confused no no no you can't be a transfer student if you transfer you'll have to reapply to your home university that's not necessary instead contact your academic advisor at your home university tell her you want to take a few classes at the cc and tell her which ones ask if it is permissable for you to take classes at another institution it usually is with permission and ask her how to go about getting those credits to transfer to your home school once you are ready to return most cc's will allow you to take any number of classes without enrolling as a full time student via their continuing education programs don't enroll as a transfer just take classes once you discuss this with your home college call the continuing ed office at the cc and talk to them it shouldn't be a problem if you have health issues and are taking time off from your home university carefully think about if and how many classes you take your health needs to come first and if that means you take no classes or just one or two then that's fine Education in the United States Tulane University Gwinnett University Center Academic term Education in Germany Columbia University American University University of Central Florida University of Houston Seneca College Graduate school Virginia Commonwealth University Associate's degree GED Kwantlen University College Western Kentucky University Education in Portugal High school Professor University of Tennessee Ohio Wesleyan University University of Maryland, College Park Juris Doctor Physician University of New England, Maine University of Toronto Education in Taiwan Cooperative education Northeastern University, Boston University of Southern California Miami Dade College Education in Austria Georgetown University North Carolina State University Dallas Baptist University University of Alabama Education in Romania University of Michigan Purdue University College Middle Tennessee State University Salt Lake Community College Bologna process Brown University University of North Dakota University at Albany Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Emerson College Pennsylvania State University Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania Master's degree Franklin W.
