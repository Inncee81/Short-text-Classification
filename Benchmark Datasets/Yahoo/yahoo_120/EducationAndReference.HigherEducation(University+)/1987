i am a year old soon to be college boy i am special needs social and emotional issues and my parents are helping to find me the right help and assistance but the colleges all they have looked at so far don't offer they help which i need i did well in high school because they provided me in classes that were in a non mainstreamed special ed environment i also had extra assitance and support less workload at a slower or easier pace for me my parents have been looking at several colleges and i we cannot find the right college for me it seems that colleges do not really care or at least care far less than they do when i was in high school i am so overwhelmed and i don't know what to do how can i go to college like this the legal requirements for colleges are different than they are at the high school level which leads to the resources being pumped into different areas in high school since everyone in the u s is expected to get a high school education the requirement is that the school has to help the student to succeed in college since college is considered a privilege and not everyone either gets in or finishes the requirement is that students with disabilities should have equal access to the university and its services once the student has been given the tools for access it then becomes up to the student to be able to succeed having said that most colleges have disability support services you don't say where you live but it would be my strong suggestion that you stay reasonably close to home so that if there should be a crisis your family can get there to support you quickly i've had out of state students with severe social and emotional abilities in class and since we only see them in class it is very hard for them to get the level of support that they need without the backup of their families nearby i don't know if you or your parents have done so but make sure that when you look at colleges that you talk directly to the director of their disability support services unit i can't speak for these people overall but as an administrator i worked closely with the director at my university last year and i have a lot of confidence in her knowledge and professionalism even if they cannot in good conscience tell you that their school is right for you they should be able to give you some leads to find a place which would work it is obvious from the quality of your email that whatever your problems they are not mental so you should be able to find a school which works for you i can give one suggestion which given your location may or may not be useful i have a relative with high functioning autism who is currently in a program at uc santa barbara which seems to be working very well good luck Education in the United States Autism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in the People's Republic of China GED Affirmative action Autism rights movement Social work Mental retardation Graduate school Windows 2000 Homeschooling Windows XP College Controversies in autism Nurse Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education in Portugal Special education Education in Taiwan Mach kernel Unemployment Divorce Software engineering Culture of the United States Hikikomori Barbara Boxer No Child Left Behind Act Education Abortion in the United States Down syndrome Requirements analysis Charter school Intelligence quotient Transsexuality Fathers' rights Boston Public Economy of the United States Seneca College Password Medicine Learning disability John Edwards Publicly funded medicine Education in Hong Kong Social rule Health care in the United States Separation of church and state Education in Singapore Economic inequality Librarian Windows Vista York University Inflation Education in Austria Computer Otterbein College Juris Doctor AmigaOS Plame affair Open access Scholarship Second language acquisition Theory of conduct High school Enterprise content management Capitalism Community college Education in India Mental illness Abortion debate Involuntary commitment Intelligent design movement Gifted Centrelink Charles William Eliot Education in Australia SAT University of Idaho Independence Party (Iceland) Martial art The Citadel (Military College) Visual Basic Pretty Good Privacy Political correctness College admissions Chinese University of Hong Kong IBM PC compatible Education in Germany Cheating in Counter-Strike Air Education and Training Command Students' union
