what would graduating class imply now this is confusing to explain but when a college says that students must rank in the top of their graduating class this is for a honors program at a school would this mean as of the end of your junior year you must be in top or when you graduate as a senior sigh thank you the reason why it makes me wonder is because i would be applying to this school either this fall or winter so they would only be able to see up to st semester senior year stuff anyway hmmm interesting i've heard this so many times and never considered that it could change in between i would assume that it means at the time you graduate but in this case you are talking about applying to a program i would assume that it means that you are in the top at the time that you apply whether it is during your junior year when you apply to the college or whether it is after graduation when you already plan to attend the college after all acceptance into an honors program is usually considered separately from acceptance into the college itself the easiest way to find out is to contact the coordinator of the honors program directly another thought is that they may be willing to give you some leeway say that they do want it by the end of your junior year but that at that point you rank in the top of your class if you contact them they may be able to give you until the end of your senior year to move up to the mark and prove your committment and ability to do the work Education in the United States Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Taiwan The Citadel (Military College) Professor Starfleet ranks and insignia University of Central Florida Grade (education) University of Houston Tulane University Columbia University Education in Australia Education in Germany Princeton University Student Texas A&M University High school University of Pennsylvania Education in Romania Lynbrook High School University of Tennessee Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Hunter College High School Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps College Franklin W.
