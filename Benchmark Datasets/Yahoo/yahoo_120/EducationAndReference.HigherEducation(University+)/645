high school junior vs senior year if i didnt do much in junior year can i make it up in senior year ok so i didnt do much in junior year i have the good grades but i didnt reall get involved in many activities except history honors society and one ap classes and two college now classes but i failed the ap test which is litearlly my teachers fault and idk if college now class really matters so im just wondering im taking ap classes and joining academies and probably college now classes after school so will the colleges look at that at all i mean i know junior year is the most imporatnt but how much do they weigh your senior if you do much more then im thinking of joining academies and ap classes ok so its not too late right i mean the colleges would still care about what i do in my senior year and not neglect it right because ive been hearing that its too late that i should just slack off in senior year and i feel really guilty for not doing much in my junior year senior year is very important in fact i was told it was way more important than junior year i definitely recommend you take the college classes and join as many clubs as possible but don't over do it if you take too many classes and can't keep up with them it's just as bad as not taking them in the first place good luck yes senior year is very crucial if you make bad grades in your senior your it will reflect badly on you i didn't do all that great in th grade but in th i really got my butt on gear taking ap classes and joining clubs i got a scholarship for it and everything Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Education in the United States Hunter College High School Yearbook Grade (education) Education in Taiwan High school Miami-Dade County Public Schools Hopkins School College Middle school The Citadel (Military College) Lynbrook High School Sydney Grammar School Community college Education in Japan GED Advanced Placement Program Secondary education in the United States Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Pitaten Eton College College admissions Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Albany Academy National Certificate of Educational Achievement Albany High School, Georgia Social rule Student Education in Hong Kong Phillips Exeter Academy SAT Columbia University Independent school (UK) Theory of conduct The Chemical Brothers Secondary education The College of New Jersey Dr. Michael M.
