does a kansas college degree look credible for jobs in other states i am planning on attending kansas state university and getting my degree in veterinary medicine i want to get it here mostly because it is cheaper to attend this school as i am a resident of kansas but i do not want to stay in kansas after receiving my degree what i would like to know is if a degree from a school in kansas will look credible to future employers in other states people often think those of us in kansas aren't the brightest given the choice of picking a vet from kansas or one from new york city i'm picking the one from kansas it's a joke don't flame me honestly it doesn't make all that much difference unless you're talking about the difference between an ivy and a tier everything in the middle is considered about equal you either have a dvm or you don't and few people ever will really care where you went to school Education in the United States State university Veterinary medicine Kansas State University University of Pennsylvania New York State College of Veterinary Medicine Juris Doctor Cornell University Education in Australia Overland Park, Kansas Education in Germany College University of Kansas Columbia University Midwestern United States Health insurance Ivy League Culture of the United States Manhattan, Kansas Education in Portugal Social rule University of Edinburgh Richard M.
