how to write simulation programme for flat plate solar evaporator basically you are going to have to come up with an equation for the solar energy hitting the evaporator an equation for the sensible heat of the medium you are evaporating and an equation for the energy of vaporization at each temperature and pressure put these together add in a little work to cover the movement of the sun during the day and the effects of ambient temperature and you have yourself a solar evaporator program Explosive material Solar power Evaporation Boiling point Water vapor Ocean thermal energy conversion Sun Water Solar system Heat Temperature Brewery Hydrogen Spacecraft propulsion Helium Solar sail Carburetor Earth's atmosphere Global climate model Steam engine Evaporative cooling Plasma (physics) Venus Water (molecule) Solar wind Corona Black hole Climate change Solar cell Earth Solar variation Vacuum Thermoregulation Phase change heat pump Origin of life Xenon Air conditioning Stellar evolution Hawking radiation Humidity Global warming Greenhouse effect Desert Phase (matter) Distillation Jet engine Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite Mars Mars Exploration Rover Solar thermal energy Casting Wind chill Big Bang Specific heat capacity Vacuum tube Mercury (planet) Moon Desalination Comet Stirling engine Atmospheric circulation Structure of the Earth Autonomous building Energy Planetary orbit Terraforming Solar panel Environmental concerns with electricity generation Impact crater Dyson sphere Hydrogeology Movie projector STS-87 Black body Saturn Solar collector Tide Renewable energy Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Swamp cooler Volcano Heat capacity Turbojet General relativity Timeline of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and random processes Transformer Magnetohydrodynamics Project Orion Superconductivity Alcohol fuel Autoclave Sunlight Plutonium Hyperthermia Meteorology Relative humidity Thin-film deposition Snowball Earth Black hole thermodynamics
