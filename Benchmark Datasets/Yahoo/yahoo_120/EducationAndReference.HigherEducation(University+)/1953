what do you think about the university of cambridge i reallllllllllllllllly want to go to college in another country specifically in london and the only college ive heard of is the university of cambridge i know i wont get into oxford i wanted to know how the school is what kind of grades you need to get in and how the people and the school work is like right know my gpa is and im going to eleventh grade what do i need to do are there better collegess in london do i even have a chance if you are sure you will not get into oxford then you should be aware that cambridge has the same standard in either case the work is intense and hard for example i would have to research a question by reading quite a lot of books and journal articles and then write a word essay which i would have to discuss in a tutorial that happens twice a week and i also have lectures to attend nonetheless you do manage to have fun in between the work and the people are generally quite nice well in my experience of oxford at least i don't know about cambridge a high school diploma and sats will not be enough as the education system in the uk specialises earlier than the us system a uk student will generally have a deeper knowledge in a subject but across fewer subjects i e the or subjects they have chosen for a levels pre uni qualification in the uk you also apply for a specific subject and focus on that subject at university rather than take course outside of your major you would need to take a few aps or complete a year at college to compensate for this as well as increasing your gpa is around a b right this is certainly the case with oxbridge imperial college london and the university of london colleges eg the london school of economics university college london king's college etc the london institutions' standards are lower than that of oxford and cambridge but are still very competitive that being said admission standards do vary by university and degree subject and you may find some less prestigious universities that won't require aps however they will may not be worth the effort and hassle of moving over here College Grade (education) Graduate school Education in Australia SAT Master's degree High school Education in Portugal A-level Medical school Education in the United States Education in Hong Kong University of Cambridge Law school GED College admissions Oxbridge rivalry Lawyer National Certificate of Educational Achievement UCAS Education in the People's Republic of China Trinity College, Dublin Education in Romania Education in Germany Test (student assessment) University Affirmative action Physician Academia Education Education in France Advanced Placement Program Education in Sweden Quizbowl Education in Japan City and Guilds of London Institute Institute of technology Professor Bachelor of Laws Education in the Republic of Ireland Academic degree Culture of the United States Education in Malaysia Education in Finland Education in Taiwan United States Academic Decathlon Education in England Bumiputra Middle Tennessee State University University college Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology ELO rating system Secondary education in Japan Boston College Yale University Standardized testing University of Melbourne University of Central Florida Doctorate University of Michigan Secondary education in France Education in Singapore Education in Canada Physical therapy Barrister University of California, San Diego Augustus De Morgan Harvard College Doctor of Philosophy Game theory Caulfield Grammar School Numerus clausus King's College London Bernard Williams Johns Hopkins University Tripartite System The Skeptical Environmentalist American and British English differences Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus No Child Left Behind Act Australian Qualifications Framework Hunter College High School Community college University of London Rudolf Steiner Law of the People's Republic of China University of Pennsylvania Microeconomics Extreme Programming Education in Austria Baccalaur__at
