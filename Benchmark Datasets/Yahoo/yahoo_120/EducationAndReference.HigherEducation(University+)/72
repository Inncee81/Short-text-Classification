what do u think of miami international university of art design i am thinking of either going to savannah college of art and design or miami international university of art and design i visited both but i just don't really know the quality of miami international university or if its just a good school or not i am a graphic design student by the way have u been there graduated are u going there and just what do u think of it scad is an expensive school i think better possibly for graduate work in design than for undergrad the art institutes are a mixed bag also often quite expensive for the education you get but at least this one is accredited by a legitimate agency if you are serious about graphic design look at virginia commonwealth north carolina state university as two excellent southern schools for this area of study the ringling school of art and design has some respected faculty in their program so you might look at it too any school that doesn't brag about its faculty and their qualifications and particular expertise is suspect it means the program and the classes within it can change dramatically because faculty come and go and their ability and experience as teachers and their commitment to teaching are a mixed bag some may be incredible others not you'll never know from one class to the next and one year to the next if you are serious about graphic design look for a school which has specific courses in typography and in history of graphic design the good ones will have both of these spend your money wisely and be suspicious of hype and slick marketing campaigns ask many questions before you make a commitment if you can make contact with any art directors in the region as their opinions about good programs good luck Graduate school Savannah College of Art and Design Education in the United States York University Education in Portugal Education in the People's Republic of China Juris Doctor Education in Australia Ryerson University University of North Carolina at Charlotte High school Master's degree Medical school Academic degree Architect University of Notre Dame North Carolina State University Professor Master of Business Administration Regent University Florida International University College of Law Johns Hopkins University Advanced Placement Program University at Albany Florida State University University of North Texas Teacher Education in Germany Heidelberg College University of Toronto Pennsylvania State University Academia Columbia University College and university rankings Associate's degree University of Virginia Institute for Christian Studies Bilkent University City and Guilds of London Institute Virginia Commonwealth University Chinese University of Hong Kong Indiana State University Intelligent design movement Physician Otterbein College Experiential education Lyceum of the Philippines University of Michigan Christian Brothers University Seneca College Oregon State University Far Eastern University Saint Joseph's University State university Emerson College Secondary education in the United States Brigham Young University Miami University Open University (Netherlands) Virginia Military Institute University of Maryland, College Park University of Maryland Baltimore County Stevens Institute of Technology New College of California University of Pennsylvania Northeastern University, Boston University of Houston Cornell University Washington University in St. Louis National Certificate of Educational Achievement Medical University of South Carolina Queensland University of Technology Miami Dade College University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Harvard University University of Connecticut University of Szeged University of Arizona Cass Business School, London Middle East Technical University Marylhurst University IB Diploma Programme Brown University Indiana University Bloomington Education in Singapore Charles William Eliot Istanbul Technical University
