what can you do with a degree in any social science i often tell people i am interested in the social sciences and they tell me that a lot of the degrees are not concrete enough like political science to lead to a job what are some concrete social sciences degrees that could lead to a steady job hey thats a great question which racked my brain when i was in college i too loved history political sciene and yeah basically the social sciences but yes with these degrees you will find yourself explaining selling yourself at length to employers when you graduate so i took up an economics degree the study of economics is based in social science but with real world application its not as concrete as accounting or finance but it will allow you to at least interview for almost every position it sounds like you enjoy politics current events and basically talking about the world we live in today economics classes will allow you to do this as you probably know so much of government is economic policy while they will also equip you with practical means of backing up beliefs and ideas with concrete numbers if you do take economics classes make sure that along the way you learn excel speaking from experience here excel is the bloodline of most steady jobs out of college whether we like it or not i cant stress this enough of course dont forget to pursue your passions as well do a dual major if love poli science classes this is your main shot in life to diversify yourself and you dont want to be and kicking yourself for not finding out what it would be like to work on a political campaign or becoming a history teacher create options for yourself i hope this helps either way good luck Education in the People's Republic of China Education Psychology Science Education in the United States Software engineering GED Education in Japan Sociology Avenue Q Labor theory of value Economic inequality Political science Church of Christ, Scientist Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Social psychology Education in Germany Anti-intellectualism College Anthroposophy Sociocultural evolution Social research A Course In Miracles Ideology Political economy Inflation Public policy California Polytechnic State University Education in Portugal Liberalism Extreme Programming Noam Chomsky Independence Party (Iceland) Georgetown University Smith College Ethics Aikido Government of France Voter turnout Mathematics New Deal Unemployment Massachusetts Institute of Technology Jacob Neusner Philosophy of mathematics Objectivist philosophy Scientology beliefs and practices Microeconomics Antonio Gramsci Philosophy of science Economy of the United States Anarchism and capitalism Strategic management William Stanley Jevons Franklin W.
