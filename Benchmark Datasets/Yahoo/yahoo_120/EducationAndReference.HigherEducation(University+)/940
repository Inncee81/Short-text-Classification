i am new in australia can any one share their experience hi i am a international student in sydney i don't know much about aussie can any one tell me more thank g'day ok robocop this answer is several paragraphs long so you are not quite right i used to be an international student in australia from south east asia b'cos my country's high school qualification is not deemed equivalent to austrlaian's high school i had to do a foundation studies year sort of a 'pre uni' course to prepare you to study in uni level however even after done a year foundation studies in australia which is like australian high school system all of us me and my fellow foundation studies graduates still got the shock when we get to our first week of the first year at uni before uni start the international students will need to attend an orientation and enrolment week this event is specially designed for newly arrived international students to make them feel welcome the students is then enrolled to the classes of their course then assisted to make the timetable once that done students will then be taken for campus tours to give them info abt how to access services and assistance available to international students this will include the tour to the library where the librarian will inform you how to research information from books or online database info also there are some helps either in library or some other student services section to help for writing papers assignments in some unis these activities are conducted by the senior international students so all the information are relevant to the newbies as well since they also experienced the same thing when they came to the uni for the first time therefore it is very crucial to come for the orientation week in most cases university staffs informed me that international students who miss the orientation enrolment week usually struggle to cope the first week of study usually called an orientation week there are no formal teaching just lecturers and tutors introduce themselves and giving out handouts with lecture topics to cover every week what homework to do before the tutorial and what book to read and to buy this is when some int students struggle like me english wasn't even a nd language in my home country so to hear the lecturers lecturing on and we have to simultaneously read what he wrote and write it down is extremely challenging if you do think that you will have problem with this then i suggest you to buy a voice recorder of some sort it used to be a walkman in my days to record the lecture and re hear them again later to add things to your initial note the lecturers will never mind that you are recording them the system also encourage you to study find out and try things yourself if after doing things yourself you stuck then you can come to the tutors and lecturers and ask them directly in most cases they will put a note on when to come to see them for a consultation at no extra charge lol yes there will be some time needed for adjustment and there's no way you can prepare until you come for the first week in uni in my first month in uni i used to complained that i need hrs a day not however after awhile you will adjust to the new system with your fellow first year students including the aussies my advise are these please come early if possible nothing worse than starting the classes in uni and you are still struggling finding accommodations learning where to shop for your daily groceries buying furnitures etc when you had a bad late start it usually carried on seek advise further help from the teaching staff asap if you think that you are struggling with a topic or will be late to submit an assignment quite alot of students leave it until it was too late you'll get no sympathy from the lecturers if your reason is because i don't know the topic very well australians are very open relax easy going and willing to help whenever wanted this means that if you are willing to mix together with anyone you will have no problem in getting friends from australian and international students however some international students do prefer to stick with their own fellow countrymen and this makes the australian students feel that they are not wanted and tend to stay away from international students eventually so please do mix around hope this helps hope i can share my experience to you e mail me at mikegun at studentfirst com au if you have more questions abt study in australia good luck and welcome to australia GED Education in the People's Republic of China
