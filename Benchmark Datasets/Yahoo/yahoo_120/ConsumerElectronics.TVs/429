need an rca expert tv please please click on my icon and go back to my last question about my tv i can't find the paperwork and strange things are happening maybe you can help i've worked at cable company before and thought i knew all the secrets but i don't and neither did this guy i don't have a special cable box just plain cable nothing new has happened to make this happen someone said my tv must be possessed and i'm beginning to wonder lol thanks your sap secondary audio program is turned on i know this since in your other message you state that it only plays spanish on some channels that would be the channels that actually have a spanish sap on the other channels where no sap exists the audio is in english on the other channels where an sap signal exists but that channel carries no sap audio the audio seems muted because there is nothing there to hear if you gave us the model number of the rca tv it might be possible to find a manual online i liked the answer that said look for a reset or defaults setting it might be possible to unplug the tv for a day or more and achieve this also but that depends on how they saved the settings and that means you cannot use the tv in the meantime look for an audio button or sap button on the remote you probably already did go into the setup menu and look for audio selections and see if there is an sap setting or a mono versus stereo setting in there set it to stereo if it is a stereo tv that is usually main audio since sap is mono IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DVD Xbox Jack plug Bluetooth SCART Gramophone record Ethernet Modem Mouse (computing) AmigaOS Remote control Television AES/EBU Stereophonic sound Embedded system Quadraphonic Compact disc Microphone Digital audio broadcasting MP3 HD Radio Multitrack recording The Pet Sounds Sessions GSM services Synthesizer Telegraphy Musical Instrument Digital Interface Laserdisc Password Hello world program Compact audio cassette TRS connector XERF American Broadcasting Company Subcarrier Macromedia Flash Digital television Screenshot Surround sound Radio NTSC ITU-T Oscilloscope Mixing console S/PDIF Photography Apple IIGS High fidelity Nintendo GameCube Floppy disk Advanced Audio Coding I Want to Hold Your Hand Binaural recording Roswell UFO incident ITunes Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Phreaking Dolby Laboratories Danger Hiptop Teletext 8 mm video format Visual Basic .NET AppleScript Java programming language 8-track cartridge DIN connector Set-top box Pirate decryption NBC Loudspeaker Media in Canada Sega CD Amstrad CPC Walkman Fischer Random Chess VHS MPEG-2 Microsoft Windows Vision mixer Stereoscopy Enigma machine High-definition television SAP R/3 RS-232 Audiophile Freeview Satellite radio Satellite television Planet of the Daleks
