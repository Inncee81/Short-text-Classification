panasonic or samsung plasma i need help choosing between two plasmas and i need to choose fast its between a samsung plasma contrast ratio watt speakers and the rest of the specs include the basic inputs and outputs that you would expect from any plasma the other one is a panasonic plasma contast ratio watt speakers and again it also has the usual input outputs as one would expect ok now here is something the panasonic includes that the samsung does not yet i dont know if this is a feature that should make me want to forget about the samsung its a p digital remastering processor is that good which one would you pick the are both available at sams club incase you want to compare for yourself online thanks i forgot to mention they both are p resoloution but whats the panasonic saying about the p digital remastering processor that it includes thats where i got confused i have been struggling with this same question the samsungs you are looking at ' and ' series currently have the best picture ratings ever per cnet's reviews for plasma sets allow more picture adjustments and tweaking and are typically a bit less expensive the panasonics ' u and ' u series are not far behind in picture quality and are said to run a bit cooler implying energy savings and potential better longevity historically panasonic is a more reliable brand name but samsung has made great recent strides in this area given the nature of plasma technology it's one of the few things i would buy an extended warranty for the difference between the k and k contrast ratio specs is essentially meaningless in the real world i don't personally think the ability to accept p signals is a big deal any source that can produce p such as a ps or an hd dvd player can also output p which is the native resolution of both of these sets note that this is not the same as being able to display at p what you are getting is the opportunity to let the tv rather than the source device do the downconversion which may or may not give a better quality result i am currently leaning towards the panasonic mostly for the anti reflective screen on the u model there are a couple of minor picture issues with the samsung also probably nothing you would notice but they are documented at the avs forum in the link below but honestly i don't think you can go wrong either way good luck Loudspeaker High-definition television Sound Blaster MP3 Television Digital photography Oscilloscope Analog-to-digital converter Plasma (physics) Central processing unit Blu-ray Disc DVD Laserdisc Home cinema Vorbis MPEG-2 Digital circuit Decibel Windows Vista MSX DualDisc Leica Transformer NTSC Microeconomics Liquid crystal display television Audiophile CPU cache Xbox IPod Plasma display Gramophone record Nintendo Revolution Windows XP Embedded system Liquid crystal display Apple Macintosh PlayStation Portable Laptop Light-emitting diode Holography Law of value Fusion power Inflation Panasonic Laser DV Nuclear fusion Samsung Stereoscopy Atari 8-bit family Game Boy Radeon Anamorphic widescreen Binoculars Computer Tungsten Handheld Digital cinema ATI Technologies Computer display H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Bicycle lighting Gross domestic product Movie projector Electric motor Palm OS Video codec CPU design PostScript Software engineering Cold fusion Fuel injection S__CAM 1080p Musical Instrument Digital Interface Hard disk X Window System Atari ST Super Nintendo Entertainment System Welding Electrophysiology Cheating in Counter-Strike Programmable logic controller ZX Spectrum Camcorder Pentium 4 Hardware random number generator Sinclair ZX81 Floppy disk Incandescent light bulb Modem SCART IBM PC compatible OpenDocument
