does any one have the hdtv sony bravia kdl v need opinions i just bought a sony bravia last week and connected it to my ps i got the blu ray and the picture quality is really bad it looks extremely grainy on some scenes specially when there is a black background i have checked all settings and connected my tv in many different ways and get same results for the people who own this tv is this normal is this the actual image quality of the tv or do you think my tv has some sort of malfunction would appreciate some feedback i'm more concerned about the dvd discs or the games you're using i get the feeling you haven't actually tried anything other than low definition games or dvds the real test is with a blu ray dvd of a recent movie in hd like spiderman that's a good choice that dvd will let you know if there's something wrong with your dvd player or the tv set next if you have hd channels in your home try those channels and see if the tv is bad that will divide and conquer the problem because if your hd station looks grainy then the tv has to be at fault and not your dvd player DVD Laserdisc Television Widescreen PlayStation Portable MP3 Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Blu-ray Disc Theory of conduct Digital rights management Movie projector Computer and video games Copy protection Software testing Warez Final Fantasy IX Prostate cancer Super Nintendo Entertainment System Video Anamorphic widescreen Sony Nintendo Revolution Nintendo GameCube McFly Audiophile Oscilloscope Family Guy High fidelity Video game controversy PlayStation 3 Monty Python and the Holy Grail MPEG-2 Poker jargon Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ROM image I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue DualDisc Color MAME Resident Evil 2 Motion picture rating system Extreme Programming Nintendo Video CD Videotape Videocassette recorder Sky Digital Gramophone record Pornography Camcorder H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Cinematography Sony Pictures Entertainment Wheel of Fortune SCART Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Handheld game console Compact disc Sega Dreamcast Delta Goodrem Karaoke Home Box Office Xbox Digital cinema MMORPG Digital television Xbox 360 Gran Turismo (game) Unemployment Resident Evil: Apocalypse Final Fantasy VII DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Sony Computer Entertainment Floppy disk Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Stomach cancer Beatmania IIDX Resident Evil Goodness and value theory Spider-Man Mystery Science Theater 3000 NTSC Final Fantasy XI Modchip Late Night with Conan O'Brien TiVo Volleyball Infantilism Super Video CD MiniDisc Betting (poker) Cheating in Counter-Strike Fahrenheit 9/11
