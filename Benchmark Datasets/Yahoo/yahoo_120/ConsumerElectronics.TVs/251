hdtv how do i get rid of black bars on the top of my movies i like my movies wide screen i just got a wide screen hdtv while the tv is amazing and i got it for a steal i am disappointed that i still have the black bars on the top of my screen a why does it streach wide screen movies and leave the black bars when it can just chop them off b the only fix i've found is zoom which lowers the quality is there a better c i am told that it has something to do with being and and being so that even though the movie is wide screen the tv does not know this because it is native the question will a near hd or up convert dvd player do what i am trying to do for hdtv widescreen the dvd being played has to be by widescreen format as others have indicated some movies are the theatrical dimensions which is not by the dvd player has to be set to output in widescreen this is usually in the menu of the dvd player if available and the connection from the dvd player has to support widescreen which composite video ntsc yellow connectors might not so you may have to have a dvd player and a tv with either component connections matching between both red green and blue connections between the output of the dvd player and the input of the tv or monitor or hdmi connections between both yes an upconverting dvd player will probably make it look better but again you will possibly or likely have to play with the settings to get it to look right just make sure to avoid full screen non widescreen by aspect dvd discs you might also want to get the lg blue ray hd dvd player combination so you can play the new high defintion formats assuming this has not cost you so much already that you cannot spend another or so you're lucky i don't have money for hd myself but enjoy that others can appreciate the technology Television Laserdisc DVD High-definition television Widescreen Anamorphic widescreen SCART Aspect ratio (image) Xbox Sega Dreamcast Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Video NTSC Oscilloscope Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Blu-ray Disc Digital Visual Interface Computer display standard Letterbox S__CAM Nintendo GameCube Atari 8-bit family YUV 1080p Pan and scan Pixel PlayStation Portable Warez Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind PlayStation 3 Home cinema Karaoke Windows Vista Nintendo Revolution IMac Gamut Camcorder Video codec IPod Babylon 5 Compact disc Amstrad CPC Commodore 64 Digital television ATSC Video CD Game Boy EIA-708 Composite video Mouse (computing) Nintendo DS Stereoscopy Computer display VHS High-Definition Multimedia Interface Beatmania IIDX Color Graphics Adapter The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Digital photography Enterprise content management Digital video AmigaOS MPEG-2 PlayStation 2 Poker jargon Screenshot Laptop Color Desktop computer High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME DVD player Resident Evil: Apocalypse Computer and video games Console game Dolby Laboratories System/34 Telecine Machinima Apple II family Sega Saturn Digital rights management PowerBook G4 HD DVD Movie projector Regional lockout Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Cinerama The Criterion Collection IMAX Videocassette recorder
