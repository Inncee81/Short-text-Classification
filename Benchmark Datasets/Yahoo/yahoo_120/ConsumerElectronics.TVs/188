sharp lcd tv fuzzy picture with cable channels i just purchased aquos lc d u this lcd tv with regular cable channels the picture is really fuzzy straight out of the box is there anyway to tweak the picture so it is not so fuzzy with the channels well remember the fuzzy channels are going to disappear on february but these new tvs must be able to recieve the old signals until they disappear you might adjust the sharpness control down it's located in the video menu also if it has a noise reduction feature turn it on but don't expect miracles you have a high definition tv and that unit is converting the low definition signal into a usable signal for the hd circuitry in other words they take the picture apart and reassemble it into a signal that mimics the hd signal they call that line doubling so each line is written twice on the screen and that really makes the flaws in the low definition picture stand out when you get an hd picture on your tv set you will really appreciate the difference it is amazing try your dvd on it that is a major improvement right there Oscilloscope Television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting SCART Atari 8-bit family PlayStation Portable Stereoscopy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Laserdisc DVD Fuzzy logic Mouse (computing) Loudspeaker NTSC Bluetooth Digital television RS-232 IMac Transformer Liquid crystal display Digital photography Original Amiga chipset TGV Plasma display Federal Standard 1037C S__CAM Universal Serial Bus Modem Decibel Teletext Digital circuit Home Box Office Operational amplifier Cable television Nintendo Entertainment System Electrophysiology Musical Instrument Digital Interface Widescreen MPEG-2 Light-emitting diode Freeview TV-FM DX Gameking Macrovision Amstrad CPC Aliasing Liquid crystal display television Antenna (radio) Electronics Remote control Railway signalling 8 mm video format VHS Diode Coaxial cable H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Audiophile Cray-1 Compact disc ATSC Drill bit TFT LCD High fidelity Super Nintendo Entertainment System Wind turbine Dynamic random access memory The Walt Disney Company MTV2 Windows XP Macromedia Flash Satellite television TiVo Textile manufacturing Analog signal Nintendo GameCube Analog-to-digital converter Camcorder A Course In Miracles ZX Spectrum Composite video Audio data compression IBM PC compatible Movie projector Telegraphy Cathode ray tube Digital-to-analog converter Computer IPod IEEE 802.11 Dolby Laboratories Karaoke Danger Hiptop Dimmer Sound recording Interlace Balanced audio
