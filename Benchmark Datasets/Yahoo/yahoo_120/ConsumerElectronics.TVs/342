what is wrong with my tv member since april total points level points earned this week best answer glddstgpsy s why is the sound so soft on my tv why is the sound so soft on my tv i have a philips hdtv i bought last year its flat screen and has wonderful picture and color my problem is that when i watch a movie on either my sony dvd player or my playstation the sound is so soft i have to increase my tv's volume to around out of when i watch tv on a directv dvr receiver the volume is plenty loud at i have the playstation connected by an hdmi cable and i have the dvd player connected by the three color cords white red yellow when i want to watch something on either player i change the input to either hdmi or av what could be the cause of this difference in volume i think its ridiculous to have to increase the tv volume in order to watch a movie and actually hear what's going on does anyone have any ideas what is going wrong yes i have to turn the volume way up when i watch a dvd but with the tv it is at a reasonable level not sure about the ps but for dvd players i can answer this dts and dolby digital are the audio formats used on dvd and they have a very high dynamic range dynamic range is a measure of the difference between the loudest and softest sounds that a source can produce without losing any sound quality you may have noticed that while watching movies the volume goes up during action fight chase scenes this is the dynamic range in action they intentionally make the usual dialogue etc quieter than the action scenes so that the action is emphasized on my panasonic surround sound htib i normally set the volume to db range is from to db as that is the highest it goes before the subwoofer level is turned down and it is also the volume where the dialogue is at a comfortable level and the action blares having said that i will mention that on most players it is possible to disable and sometimes adjust the amount of dynamic range allowed by adjusting a setting in the setup menu called appropriately enough dynamic range compression turning this on will make all parts of the movie be at the same sound level to me this makes the movie sound bland but it is quite useful when other people are sleeping as it stops you from having to manually adjust the volume during the action scenes so that it doesn't wake them up also i am not sure why you are using the composite video yellow input for the dvd as it is really killing your picture quality i would be using progressive scan through the component video input if the tv and dvd player both have the ports and support it if they don't have component ports i would at least use the s video connection High-definition television PlayStation Portable Loudspeaker PlayStation 3 Nintendo GameCube Movie projector Dolby Digital Xbox Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Dolby Laboratories Audio level compression PlayStation 2 Warez Xbox 360 DualDisc Widescreen MPEG-2 IPod Sound Blaster Oscilloscope Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Gramophone record Super Nintendo Entertainment System Audiophile ZX Spectrum NTSC Digital Theatre System Digital video recorder H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Resident Evil (video game) Sony Vorbis Video codec Film Compact audio cassette Videotape Subwoofer Digital photography Original Amiga chipset Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Cyberspace TiVo Microsoft Video Camcorder Violin High-Definition Multimedia Interface Amstrad CPC Digital rights management Super Audio CD Computer and video games Mouse (computing) 24 (television) Windows Vista Timpani Copy protection Bubble Bobble Anamorphic widescreen High fidelity Audio data compression Audio commentary (DVD) S-VHS Headphones Nintendo Revolution Cheating in Counter-Strike Digital cinema Atari 8-bit family Enterprise content management Stereoscopy Super Video CD Game Boy Video CD DVD-Audio Mattress Sega Dreamcast Electronic organ Gradius Cable television Microeconomics Circuit design Digital television Volleyball Carburetor System/34 Videocassette recorder Metal Gear Solid
