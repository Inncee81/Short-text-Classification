what really happened to my flat screen tv that after a loud thunder it wont turn back on i know it should be taken to a repair shop but i wud like to know what's messed up a fuse power supply etc in simple english thank you for those that answereed my prior q's regarding same matter thunder isn't the problem it's the lightning very high current surge that creates emp electro magnetic pulse a principle of electric current is the magnetic field it creates and rapidly changing magnetic fields induce currents in other electrical devices that can produce very large voltage spikes large voltage spikes can easly ruin transistor circuits this is why the old soviet union used tubes instead of transistors in many of their warfare devices airplanes tanks they are less likely to get damaged by a nuclear bomb another source of very high emp direct hits by lightning are extremely damaging but induced voltages by nearby hits are also bad news for electronics recommendations to get a new tv are probably your only reasonable solution lightning arrestors bleed off high voltage on antenna connections and may help in the future and ups un interruptable power supplies clean up voltage spikes both should be used you can't always be around when lightning occurs but you can try to isolate the tv from the impact of a nearby lightning strike as for a direct hit consider a lightning arrestor rod on your roof it bleeds off current to a nearby cloud with high potential and does it before the lightning actually jumps between ground and the cloud check out the links for more information Transformer Circuit design Radiation hardening Diode Spark gap Electric motor Capacitor Vacuum tube Oscilloscope Transistor Tesla coil Lightning Directed-energy weapon Nuclear explosion Digital circuit High-voltage direct current High-voltage hazards Electricity Volt Naval mine Battery (electricity) Fluorescent lamp Circuit breaker MOSFET Fusion power Overhead powerline Electrophysiology Welding Magnet Operational amplifier Impedance matching Resistor Galileo spacecraft Overvoltage Voltage source Cathode ray tube Computer Decibel Electronic amplifier Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Transmitter Solar power Linear particle accelerator Fuse (electrical) Lightning safety Radio Cavity magnetron Magnetic core memory Central processing unit Current source Electronics Switched-mode power supply Liquid crystal display Electric shock Light-emitting diode Spacecraft propulsion Ground (electricity) Alternating current Relay CMOS Field effect transistor Loudspeaker Voltage regulator Action potential Current (electricity) Fusor Solar cell Electric power transmission Terran (StarCraft) Electronic power supply Radar RS-232 Microphone Particle accelerator Energy development Semiconductor device Wind turbine Hall effect Voltmeter Gas metal arc welding Static inverter plant 2003 North America blackout Bipolar junction transistor Cyclotron Geomagnetic storm Earthing system Nuclear weapon design Seismic retrofit Electrical network Combine (Half-Life 2) Renewable energy Plasma (physics) Electricity meter Ohm's law
