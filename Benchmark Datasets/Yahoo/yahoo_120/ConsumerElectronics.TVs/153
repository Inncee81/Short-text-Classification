does this television exist could this be a scam i believe a scam is trying to suck my mom in i would like to know if this television even exsist one of the prizes she may posibly have won is a flat screen toshiba television they claim i entered on a specific date my mom enters me into contest because of some rules which i know coinside with little details in the law about ownership of land that everyone ignores i do not qualify but my mom does so if you have any other details about those keep adding them xd i am checking on the television because it does not appear to exist when i search for it so i thought i'd ask out of curiosity i also wonder if flat panel and flat screen are the same as with monitors i cannot say whether the contest is legitimate or not but the television in question is almost certainly not a plasma lcd or other flat panel television but rather a traditional crt television with a flat screen rather than a rounded or convex screen Liquid crystal display Plasma display Television IMac Gamut Screensaver Liquid crystal display television Oscilloscope Game show Laptop Computer display The Price Is Right Poker jargon Interlace Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Hollywood Squares Organic light-emitting diode Winning Streak Family Feud Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Advance fee fraud TFT LCD Phishing Confidence trick Democracy State Tic-Tac-Dough $ale of the Century Drug test Pyramid (game show) RuneScape cheats Wheel of Fortune Reality television Magnet EMac Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Chess The Joker's Wild Aperture grille American Idol Windows XP Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Card Sharks Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
