how do i find out who provides cable to my area i'm moving across the country and trying to set up an appointment to have cable installed but i've tried a whole bunch of cable companies and none provide service to the area shouldn't there be a list or something a kind of roundabout way to find out would be to use yahoo tv it lets you set up a personalized list of tv channel schedules for your area enter your new address and it should show you the list of tv service providers in the area then you can do a web search among the choices to get their phone number most areas have only a single choice for cable provider i'd be surprised if your choice was anything but comcast Password Bluetooth Cable television Wi-Fi Comcast Yahoo!
