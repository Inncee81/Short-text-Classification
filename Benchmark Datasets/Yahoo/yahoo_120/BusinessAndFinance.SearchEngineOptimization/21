why do you think the redemption rate is so much higher for online coupons versus sunday paper coupons and would you use coolsavings com to print coupons for your regular purchases such as groceries magazines music beauty supplies etc the rate will be higher for online coupons because people search these items out however total usage is still higher with newspaper coupons because it cheap advertising we easily save per month on groceries and household items we only use coupons for items we regularly buy unless it is a full price coupon which makes it free while we use coupons for all of our shopping we rarely use online coupons including coolsavings com because the newspaper coupons are much more valuable for example why use a cent coupon online when the newspaper has a cent coupon for the same item here's my best advice invest in sunday newspapers and clip out the coupons for the coupons you use most often go to ebay where you can purchase extras at a very reasonable price in our household we focus on high dollar items like coffee milk juice and hard cheeses we usually pay no more than for coupons including shipping a first class stamp and envelopes the coupons we don t use are resold to neighbors or co workers which recoups our ebay costs here's a direct link to the listings http health beauty listings ebay com coupons w qq trksidzm qqsacatz qqsocmdzlistingitemlist if you go online here's a couple web sites we do frequent for product news trials recipes and occasionally a coupon http www pg com en us products index jhtml http www kraftfoods com kf e email Bond Electronic commerce Wal-Mart Amazon.com Direct marketing Am730 Inflation Neopets Philatelic investment Price discrimination Zero coupon bond Supermarket Bulk vending Postage stamps and postal history of the United States Charles Ponzi Treasury security America Online Gross domestic product Sing Tao Daily Tesco Insurance Sears Holdings Corporation Digital photography Newspaper Google Microeconomics Spyware Advertising Mutual fund Overclocking MMORPG Something Awful Forums Internet fraud Mail fraud Gmail Open access Web traffic Credit derivative Retailer Milk Deflation (economics) Search engine optimization Sales promotion Online marketing Surveillance Privatization Yahoo!
