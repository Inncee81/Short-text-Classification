questions about the xbox do you really use the hard drive for anything if you don't plan on playing games over xbox live if you don't have high speed internet is it just there for game saves or does it have another purpose how long is the cord on the wired controller i very rarely play games on xbox live but i think my would be useless without it's hard drive you need it for saves and to play original xbox games btw no you don't need a high speed connection to play original games you can download the update from xbox com and burn it to a cd the cord on the controller is about feet but if you get the premium or elite which is what i suggest they come with a wireless controller Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 Xbox Live Modchip Computer and video games Halo: Combat Evolved Halo (video game series) Game controller Universal Serial Bus Halo 2 Mouse (computing) Rare (video game company) Console wars IGN PlayStation 2 Nintendo The Sims 2 Nintendo GameCube LAN party Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Pump It Up Game programmer Counter-Strike Need for Speed Damn Small Linux Action Replay Verizon Wireless ITunes PlayStation Portable Project Gotham Racing 2 Steam (content delivery) Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Super Nintendo Entertainment System Bluetooth Toe Jam & Earl Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 Sega Dreamcast Electronic Arts Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX Bungie Studios Windows XP Arcade cabinet Volleyball The Sims IPod Sega Video game music Broadband Internet access Shadowrun Microsoft Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Revolution Software MAME Microsoft Game Studios Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Game Boy Advance Floppy disk Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne Karaoke Ninja Gaiden Sega Saturn Resident Evil (video game) GoldenEye Redundant array of independent disks Softball Beatmania IIDX America's Army Domestic AC power plugs and sockets GoldenEye 007 Internet Star Wars: Battlefront II Shadow the Hedgehog WiMAX Violin OutRun 2 Sonic Mega Collection Plus Neverwinter Nights Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield Dance Dance Revolution Tony Hawk's American Wasteland Internet service provider Nintendo Entertainment System Warez Table tennis Internet slang PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay Machinima Operation Flashpoint True Crime: Streets of LA Spy Hunter Pinball Star Wars: Galaxies Sonic Adventure Video game console Modem Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven Intellivision
