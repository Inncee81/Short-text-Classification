best place to snipe in call of duy in multiplayer what is the best place to be a scout i love sniping people down but can you tell me some good places there is a path somewhere in the forest its along the side so go towards the right and the path will lead to a trail going up the side of a mountain you can snipe people from there but you will probably be shot back at so make sure you keep going higher and higher until you see a cave once you get to the place you can jump on top of the big rocks jump onto the cave and there will be another trail that leads you to a ramp way up in the sky which is like a loop just stand on top of it and noone can shoot you from there it's also smart to throw time bombs down at people but make sure they are set for longer then seconds or they will blow up in the air Dog agility Volleyball Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling throws Long Path Mario Kart 64 Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Aerial (dance move) Syphon Filter Quake III Arena Descent (computer game) GoldenEye 007 Turok 2: Seeds of Evil Super Mario Bros.
