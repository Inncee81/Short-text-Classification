product photography lets say a highly reflective object what type of lighting do you prefer defussed bounced key backlight fill light flash on off camera watts and distance if you want more want to know just angles etc example can be a cell phone lcd screen all contributions really apprieciated some awesome answers guys this is my area of expertise jewelry generally speaking highly diffused light is better for reflective materials there are exceptions however managing reflections often winds up mattering more than the quality of the light thus jewelry is typically shot in some sort of tent to make a uniform usually white reflection on the metallic surface it is vital to carefully control the angle at which light is hitting the reflective surface for your cell phone lcd if the light is hitting at a direct angle the light source may be reflected on the surface of the screen obscuring the display an oblique angle will help alleviate this issue even if you are using hard light so you could shoot your cell phone with highly diffused light but in this case high tech electronics i'd probably look at a hard light creating sharply delineated shadows but with the source hitting the screen on a very acute angle and thus not reflecting back into your lens much Liquid crystal display Digital photography Solar cell Photography Stereoscopy Color Solar power Lighting Movie projector Digital camera Light-emitting diode Ray tracing Rendering (computer graphics) Diamond View camera Gamut Cathode ray tube Projection screen Organic light-emitting diode Canon T90 Polarization Welding Bicycle lighting 3D computer graphics Television Transistor Nuclear explosion Oscilloscope Eyepiece Cassini-Huygens Plasma display Lightsaber Laser Mirror Items in the Metroid series Lens (optics) Vacuum Casting Single-lens reflex camera Camera Diamond cut Wood Vacuum tube Cinematography Leica Impressionism Red-eye effect Digital single-lens reflex cameras Eye Contax Black hole Reflection (physics) Iris (anatomy) Anamorphic widescreen Knife Mouse (computing) Diffraction Sewage treatment Gas metal arc welding Parallax Stage lighting Film Liquid crystal display television Liquid crystal Microscope Terminal ballistics Microphone Nuclear weapon design Cinerama Transformer Volleyball Diamond simulant Drawing Renewable energy Light Silver Panoramic photography Galileo spacecraft Gas tungsten arc welding Handheld game console Cannabis cultivation Wallpaper group Bloodstain pattern analysis TFT LCD Depth of field Surveillance Solar panel Optical coating Photographic lens Traditional animation Holography Geographic information system Optical fiber Piezoelectricity Parabola Membrane potential Speed of light
