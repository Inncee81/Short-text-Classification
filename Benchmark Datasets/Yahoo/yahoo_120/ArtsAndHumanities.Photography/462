how do i clean up old photographs for scanning and printing b w and colour personally i don't clean them too much i don't want to damage anything if they have a good hard surface i wipe them with a soft woven cotton cloth read undershirt mostly i scan them at high resolution like dpi and clean them in photoshop elements see http www flickr com photos samfeinstein for an example where i was afraid to clean a photo too much with the creases and folds there were tears in the emulsion and i was afraid that any cleaning would lift up little corners and break away parts of the picture there was so much wrong with this picture that i just left some degree of aging there as we all knew the age of the picture it's kind of a special effect in its own right here's another one that i put up for this question and my family this is an example of what happens when you don't rinse out the fixer adequately but it's also an example of a picture that i was afraid to clean very much at all you clean it in post processing http www flickr com photos samfeinstein antoni as far as compressed air be careful first of all turn the photo upside down when you blow on it second be aware of possible chemical reactions with some of them i can't tell you which ones but i have seen cases where compressed air interacted with photos and left water spots on the photo i have a can of dust blaster right here and it's not air it says tetrafluoroethane use quick little bursts and not a steady stream so it will be less likely to condense and pool on the photo Textile manufacturing Image scanner Diving Digital photography Ice core Nuclear explosion Mattress Drill bit Carbon dioxide Brewery Floppy disk World Wide Web Cathode ray tube Gramophone record Internal ballistics Butterfly Photographic film Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Movie projector Explosive material Nuclear fallout Nuclear weapon design Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Social rule Paper Aerial (dance move) HyperText Transfer Protocol Dry cleaning Haloalkane Helium Pixel Stereoscopy JPEG Equine conformation Textile manufacturing terminology Tagged Image File Format Hard disk London Bong Laserdisc Hard water Knife Car washing techniques Universal Century Technology Dishwasher Carburetor PNG Hat Mouse (computing) Uniform Resource Locator Japanese tea ceremony X-ray Solar power High-definition television Water Furnace Radiation therapy Warez Air pollution Glossary of firefighting equipment Professional wrestling slang Cold fusion Fast bowling Professional wrestling holds Strap-on dildo H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Geographic information system Pebble bed reactor Wok Thermal power station Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Drowning Bob and George Sento Flickr Photo sharing Gamma ray burst Snooker Roswell UFO incident Tank Eye Seismic retrofit Upholstery Theory of conduct Tire Hydrochloric acid Vacuum cleaner Collecting fossils Plastic Digital image editing Autopsy 2005 Kashmir earthquake Flax Car handling Sutro Tower Weaving Bridge Cloud
