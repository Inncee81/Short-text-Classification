photoshop i use photoshop to edit my pictures and sometimes the edges are cut off when i print a x picture at a one hour photo sometimes important stuff may be cut off like text how can i prevent from losing part of the picture thank you for your help i would think the store kiosks etc are going to accept and interpret any dpi that you give them crop to the size you want and save the file before you go to the store see this brief tutorial http www flickr com photos samfeinstein try this with one or two prints using different sizes and see how it works out you can probably preview the print before you actually print and pay for it so you can bail out if it's not going to work then you should ask someone in the store how to size your prints to get them the way you want hopefully you will find someone who knows what they are talking about many people ask why their prints do not match their original images why are the heads cut off when i get prints made from my pictures this is a common problem with the typical point and shoot camera the standard sensors in point and shoot digital cameras create an image with an aspect ratio of this means that one side measures units in length and the other measures units in length this would be perfect if the print was going to be x or some multiple of that like x a less obvious size would be x or x flickr actually offers this print size if you select more options you will see an option called xd where d is the odd size and it will fit the proportion of your original image if you want to get a decent print from another processor where you only have standard sizes to choose from you will have to compose to allow for some loss of your image study my example as you read along this picture is just a snapshot that was taken without much regard for composition it is just a typical grab shot at a family party you will see that there are key elements at the extreme top of the frame and at the extreme bottom of the frame with this perfect comosition if we want a common size print made we will have to choose between losing some of the top of the subject's head or most of the interesting cake that is the focus of her attention or some of each i drew lines and shaded out portions of the photo to match the proportions of the most common prints the x and x are labeled and the black line is the x crop line which is not labeled this is just how it works if you want to have the entire subject from the top of her head to the bottom of the cake in the final print you would have to allow for some loss at the top and or the bottom when you take the picture in the first place if you usually get x prints you will have to allow the most extra coverage in your shot x would require somewhat less extra coverage and x would require almost no extra at all many of the newer point and shoot digital cameras allow you to choose your proportions or aspect ratio if you select it is easy to see that you can get an exact print of your original image at a x size a x would loose some off of the horizontal aspect similar to the example above but a x would loose some off of the vertical aspect if you had a similar composition on a image which is typical of most digital slr's and mm film by the way this would mean you could get rid of the black space to the left of the main subject as long as you anticipate this image loss that will occur when you have your prints made the final result will be a picture that pleases you plan ahead i left this picture in the original size just so it can also be used as a sample of a mp image
