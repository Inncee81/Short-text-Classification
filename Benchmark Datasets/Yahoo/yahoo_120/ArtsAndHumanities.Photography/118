how can i increase the resolution of a picture without resize it i want my picture have dpi but donot change it size when adjust in photoshop it change its size and it is not meet the requirement in my homework can you have me most of the other answers miss the relationship of print size to pixel image size and resolution when you go to the image size dialog in photoshop look at the pixel dimensions of the top box which is width let's just say it is pixels look at the resolution towards the bottom and see what it is in pixels per inch lets say it's pixels that means your print will be inches wide get it image size divided by resolution print size okay so you need dpi dots per inch which is for printers but for here lets say that it is the same as resolution change the to the will also change and the inches will stay the same that's what photoshop does by default not what you want and easy to fix now just change the width top box back to the print size will change but the image size will be back to the original size that's what you want in review so just remember to look at the image size maybe jot it down then change the resolution then go back and change the image size back to its original size the description of this is longer than actually doing it resampling does not happen since the image size is the same so it does not matter if the box is checked when you uncheck the box the pixel dimensions on top are locked by photoshop so you simply change the resolution to and your done simpler yes but you may not understand the relationship as well at first and not all programs may have this feature i would use this method once you understand what you are doing Pixel Dots per inch Mouse (computing) Digital photography Raster graphics Image scanner Digital image editing Autostereogram PNG 2D computer graphics QuickDraw Atari 8-bit family Stereoscopy Anamorphic widescreen TrueType Typeface Digital camera PostScript Original Amiga chipset Rendering (computer graphics) Stairway PlayStation Portable Aspect ratio (image) Halftone Computer printer Photography View camera Collision detection Light-emitting diode High-definition television Mac OS X Color Graphics Adapter GIMP Pixelation Adobe Photoshop Common Unix Printing System Hash table Windows Vista Portable Document Format Mandelbrot set Drill bit Paper size Bluetooth Palm OS Plasma display ZX Spectrum Pixel art WYSIWYG Windows Presentation Foundation Image file formats Windows XP Movie projector Opera (web browser) Anti-aliasing Manifold Radeon Mattress Moir__ pattern Video Inkjet printer Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Something Awful Forums Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Tagged Image File Format Intellivision Canal lock IPod Game Boy Floppy disk Hello world program United States dollar Intelligent design Xbox 360 Textile manufacturing Computed tomography Liquid crystal display ASCII art Danger Hiptop Killian documents Sega Saturn C programming language Drawing Vector graphics Map Traditional animation AmigaOS GIF Television Trademark Graphics ImageWriter MOS Technology VIC-II Web design Chair Java programming language
