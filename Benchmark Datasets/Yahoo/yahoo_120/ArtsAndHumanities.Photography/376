request for honesty jeez this is ridiculous someone asked a question in another section about the camera used on a tv show called side order of life okay at over points i don't care about frickin' points but the best answer so far says that the camera is a nikon dslr of some kind and it might be a nikon d xs all i'm sayin' is that the star of the show spends half of her time in the darkroom and her camera has a huge honkin' meter on the top with a large letter f on it there is another answer that identifies the camera as a nikon f photomic if you care about truth on yahoo and not leading an innocent asker down the wrong path please go to http answers yahoo com question index qid aalkoo r w pa aptqd bwhthf uebyaqxtv wcolovacn uzjkoofewqgourlmarx rt h kl xyasqr lhr qqaa paid voted and vote for the answer that names a camera that would produce images on film thus explaining all the time spent in the darkroom not to mention it's the correct answer let's put it this way do you think a photographer could tell the difference between this wrong answer http www bhphotovideo com c product reg nikon d xs slr digital camera html and this right answer http www bhphotovideo com c product use nikon f photomic tn camera html yeah it's pm and it's till degrees it was still at pm well vote for antoni on principle if you want but don't let the asker think that the camera is a d xs is all i'm sayin' and actually the question just says what camera is used on lifetime's 'side order of life ' nowhere does the asker suggest that she is actually using the camera if she is chances are the meter is broken anyhow unless there is some kind of battery upgrade steven you've missed the point it's not as if i said your name is stephen when it's really stephen it's as if i said your name is alexander when it's really steven the answer getting the most votes is patently wrong and i just don't think that photographers should stand for that it's not a matter of opinion or speculation as to whether the most iconic camera in the modern era has been modified to accept roll film where did that come from it's just a matter of aw who really cares anyhow i can stand it when i write a word individually researched answer and someone with a different opinion is chosen the best answer even by the asker but i can't stand when the answer is so far wrong and the asker will go out and buy a camera when she could get a used camera and be a proper poser koko if at first you don't succeed flickr a little harder joyfulpaints i hear ya this is probably the biggest reason i don't visit the dental section very often you can compose a detailed response suited particularly for a person's question and thenyou never hear any feedback fromthem at all i know that i have given answers there that would literally change a person's life and they don't have the courtesy to choose a best answer i hate to leave a question up for vote without choosing a best answer although sometimes i will do that if the question was for fun and games rather than for gaining information sometimes i just can't choose one over the other so i let the voters decide brian that's sort of my point i know that you take what you get as far as answers go yahoo would like it if we would use that sources box to post a link to our citation but almost nobody ever does and it doesn't make any difference if we do anyhow the dental section is so full of know it all know nothings who have their own opinion about things they have zero clue about that i almost feel dragged down by mixing my answer among their wrong wrong wrong answers it's like a friend of mine who said that he'd never run for public office because if he lost to the other people who were running he'd have to shoot himself and he's not ready to die teef i appreciate your honesty it might just be ten points worth of honesty good has triumphed over evil and the correct answer has been chosen now i can finally sleep at night thanks everyone i needed the points well dr sam the honest answer is drawing ahead on points maybe there is hope after all oh and whilst we are on the subject of honesty i posted this to get the two points all the best as always Digital photography Theory of conduct Photography Digital single-lens reflex cameras Nikon Corporation Avenue Q Social rule Plame affair Philosophy of language Leica Abortion debate Whose Line Is It Anyway?
