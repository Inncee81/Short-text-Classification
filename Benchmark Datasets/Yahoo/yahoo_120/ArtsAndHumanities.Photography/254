advice on erasing unwanted objects w photoshop elements i removed two people and really want some pointers because after i remove with clone stamp some of the places look unnatural before http i photobucket com albums y wendy picture jpg after http i photobucket com albums y wendy picture jpg oh yeah what laws are there about human subjects like those of people you don't know that you accidentally photograph do they have to sign releases or something like that can they sue if the photo ends up online like say webshots good shot of the owl either way you seem to have cloned the area of cactus in the background with a bit too much duplication it's not bad but could use a little more variety zoom in on that part of the picture and work in a few more different cactus features from the right to do this you need to restart your clone at several different spots try to place cloned objects at different levels vertically then the original as for legalities i am not a legal expert but i believe you're not really in trouble unless you are making money from the photo but obviously it's not a good idea to post recognizable images of people without their permission with a shot like this the people are a bit distant and blurred so there shouldn't be a problem it does improve this image to unclutter the background though JPEG Goatse.cx Digital photography Stereoscopy Google HyperCard Spyware Theory of conduct Drill bit Oasis (band) Nintendo Entertainment System Windows Vista Depth of field Drawing Visual Basic Expanded Universe (Star Wars) PlayStation 2 Road-rule enforcement camera Suede (band) Surveillance MAME BitTorrent Minesweeper (computer game) PNG Human cloning ASCII art Ol' Dirty Bastard Late Night with Conan O'Brien Adobe Photoshop Star Wars: Battlefront II Public domain Warez Independent Media Center The Beach Boys First-person shooter IPod Contract Internet phenomenon View camera The Strokes Cloning Bon Jovi Leica Eyeglass prescription Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Super Mario Bros.
