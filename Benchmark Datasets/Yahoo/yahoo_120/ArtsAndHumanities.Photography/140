to make the image the client owns it if the fotog does it off their on back they own the work two people were photoed on a boat then sold a print who owns the copyright i answered unless the people signed a model realease then the image can not be sold as theres no rights to sell dont really make sence i know but thats the gust isnt it a hobbiest rubished me said there is a copyright the fotog owns it then said he aint a laywer and dont ask things on answers as people dont know what they are talking about now im ready to be humbled here was i wrong is it right for some fool to rubish me then admit they dont know what they are talking about yeah yeah tell me to calm down thats cool but really whats your angle on the walk up shots rights many thanks in advance that first answer is an example of stupidity and talking about something they know nothing off the next two are great answers many thanks guys bizhead shame your guessing and your right the guy is a tosser thanks heaps pbi yes it is my second langauge so im sorry about that as far as not using this forum cause i have only been using this langauge for a few years and my english isnt great why dont you be more positive and say great you share your knowledge here even though its extremely difficult for you some times what are you kkk you heard of race relations peace love and goodwill to all man not depending on there latin chinesse or english if you ever venture overseas be grateful people tolerate you not speaking their langauge you say im confusing have you read your answer the answer is in dr sams answer in one sentence a thanks doug you put it how i wanted to my understanding english not as good as yours you proberly smarter than me also is exactly how you put it the details you give are exactly what i believe and have worked with in many countries thanks alot doug first of all you weren't wrong however there are exceptions to the rule about the people on the boat which some fine art photographers get away with citing fair use in lawsuits a good example would be the photography of diane arbus in particular her candid shots of people on the street however fair use should be used with extreme caution as it is really subject to interpretation and local right to privacy laws may trump this particular law however in the case of this being a commercial photo shoot where the image is used for monetary gain then like you said if a model release was not signed you are in a world of trouble in terms of who owns the photo and whom can profit from it so anyhow in terms of us copyright law as well as japanese copyright law the country of which i am currently residing in who owns the copyright is based upon the terms of the contract or in some cases whomever it is that you employed under lets take for example the fsa photographers of the 's and in particular the photographer dorothea lange if you go to the library of congress you can actually get a real print of one of the most famous photos ever taken migrant mother all of this is done without consent of the estate of dorothea lange why well part of working for the fsa in terms of the employment contract was that the photographer relinquishes all rights to any photos they take while employed under the federal governments farms securities administration so basically the federal government can do whatever it chooses with the image even going so far as to charge a meer for an original print of a dorothea lange photograph at least that is what i was charged way back when and it is a real silver gelatin print of course there are other ways a photographer can relinquish ownership of their photographs one can relinquish their right to a photograph by simply stating in the terms of the job contract that they relinquish all ownership of the image some clients will personally ask for this but rarely should this ever be done unless you have taken serious thought as to the potential value of the image weighed against the immediate economic benefeit of relinquishing your rights Public domain Copyright Photography Copyright law of the United Kingdom Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Intellectual
