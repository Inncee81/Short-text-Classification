is there any way of telling whether someone got a picture off the internet or had it taken professionally theres a picture on and i want to be able to tell if it has come off something like yahoo images ir if its a real picture of someone is there any way i dont have the picture its still on the internet i'm not certain there is a way to tell there is another photographer in my town who shot wedding video for years adan then three years ago decided she was a still photographer she has these amazing display portraits in her studio window and walls but noting larger than x s and x s i always felt that was odd since i display up to x framed i do it because it helps sell the wall portraits then i started viewing her work on her web site she posts everything and unfortunately she should not there are huge dark shadows on most of her work and she is clearly not comfortable posing families i'm pretty certain she bought stock photography to get started i personally think it is underhanded to advertise them as her work but no one but another photographer will notice the difference in her display and actual work so no i don't know that there is another way other than knowing that a professional really knows lighting and posing and amateurs usu sally don't even if they call themselves professional Digital photography Stereoscopy Child pornography Single-lens reflex camera Graphics Panoramic photography Technicolor Pornography Computer animation Digital camera Film Goatse.cx Digital single-lens reflex cameras Paramount Pictures Surveillance Photograph Cinerama Cinematography Felice Beato Photojournalism The Internet Movie Database Stock photography Anamorphic widescreen Topps Marilyn Monroe Richard Avedon The Ashlee Simpson Show Art Jennifer Lopez Edward S.
