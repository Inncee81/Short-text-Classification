must all questions be about photography in this section or can they be about things of general interest to photographers photographers obviously have their own point of view pun intended on many subjects and we encourage them to express that through photography why not other things there are things that can be said about other areas of life that will definitely be shaded by the filter that you select we can say things like that last sentence in a way that only another photographer would appreciate we expect to get questions about technique for our equipment including cameras lenses printers and software we expect to get questions asking for critique selling photography paying photographers finding photographers buying equipment or software we accept questions asking if someone is cute even though that has nothing to do with photography maybe it's okay if we say the person is interested in becoming a model even though we know that's not usually the case where do we draw the line yahoo expects us to police ourselves and report abuse to yahoo staff the first line in the community guidelines says yahoo answers is an online community in which participants ask and answer questions on a wide range of topics from the serious to the delightfully trivial if someone has a delightfully trivial question that only makes sense to another photographer would they post it in jokes and riddles or hobbies and crafts or here yahoo says that discussions belong in yahoo groups but we have learned a way around that over here should we stop creating discussions and leave this a cold and impersonal alcove of advice only in my other section i have my own way of dealing with questions that are not interesting to me i don't answer them i don't even read them it works for me and it might work for you in case you have never actually read the community guidelines it takes minutes http answers yahoo com info community guidelines php obviously this is a rhetorical question but any answers are wonderful yahoo calls this a community and then says not to have discussions or chat in this community i think we are finding a way to devlop a sense of community on our own how can the members of a community not know about each other or not want to know even more that's not much of a community is it david as you know i've develped my own little library of resources for those repetitive and boring questions i decided that many people come here with a specific question in mind and it's all that they can do to figure out how to post that question let alone search for identical questions that were already answered in fact i think i have enough in dentistry to publish a book or author a complete website the thing is i got so border with that i pretty much never go there any more cameras is getting that way and you can tell how much time i have on my hands by which questions i answer continued cont i often skip the easy best camera questions and spend time on the ones that i can learn something by answering or genuinely help someone else advance i just don't want this section to become boring to me also and yet there's something about this environment that i find more attractive than photog forums where we often find arguments and egos clashing christy i would not encourage commercial activity at all but i wish more of the active members knew more about each other or had a way to see their work mojo i find that this is a nice comfortable section most of the time i also find that i watch questions that i want to come back to so i can reconsider and add to my original answer or question others must be doing this as i find that we are actually discussing things back and forth instead of just taking a hit and run approach continued cont i guess we'll find out if there is any limit to how many details yahoo will let us add to our questions terisu i am so glad that i discovered this section i hope that cameras remains the place where people who apparently want the absolute best camera in the world but have a budget will go this section is buried under one more layer of sections so it's harder to find good i think you'll see me spend some of my points asking stupid or stimulating questions more often i'll try to rival antoni for ridiculousness or interestingness as flickr calls it antoni you've only been around for a month now but i am so glad that you discovered this section you sure perked things up in a hurry and you bring a very high level of experience with you that we will all benefit from i hope you have enough mastery of my language to know when i am being sarcastic with you by now too i may give you a thumb up where you don't appreciate it if you don't thanks dr except for christy you got some big guns to answer this trisu mojo ma ace all stars with alot of great stuff to give to this forum ok my favourite is whats the best camera or how do i get my photos to look like this a shot of anne geddes babies the constant questions about photoshop where people try to use a computer to do what a pro does with light and makes in the camera i have asked some humourous questions and been really disapointed how humourless people are here ok for me its the people who say i dont know what im talking about but ill rubish others and say what i want anyway oh and the racist rubish about my english if i make an effort to learn english why dont some native speakers my biggest peeve is the photoshopers who tell people to do things on the computer instead of learning photographic skiils oh and that fool we both
