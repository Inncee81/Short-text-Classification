how many megapixels i just got a polaroid caa s digital video camera it says mp stills but i can go into options and select resolution the options are m m and m is that megapixels or what if so does that mean it can take mp stills thanks those are settings that only take effect when you're shooting still images and yes those are megapixel settings not megabytes your camera has a megapixel sensor this is its native actual resolution the m option is interpolated fake meaning that the camera still captures the mp image but then digitally upsizes it internally so that it equals the dimensions that a mp pic would normally have same goes for the m setting except your images get downsized in the camera saves card space but the result would be virtually useless except for emailing pics to other people interpolation decreases image quality moreso when it's performed in camera such as yours than when doing it in a good image editing application for the best possible still image quality from this type of camera keep it at its native mp resolution hope that doesn't confuse you Digital photography Digital camera Pixel Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital video Motion capture Digital cinema Image file formats Video Stereoscopy Floppy disk Camcorder Anamorphic widescreen Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Medium format Digital image editing Mouse (computing) Camera phone Nintendo GameCube Bullet time High-definition television Image scanner Camera Konica Minolta Digital cinematography DV Computer graphics Leica NTSC Computer vision Surveillance Machine vision Raw image format IPod Hard disk Secure Digital card Digital Visual Interface Computer-generated imagery Windows Vista DVD Bluetooth Widescreen Instant camera 2D computer graphics Color temperature 3D computer graphics View camera Traditional animation Cinematography Movie projector RGB color model Aspect ratio (image) Game controller AmigaOS Shader Nikon D70 8 mm video format Adobe Photoshop IPAQ Patricia Ford Road-rule enforcement camera Holography Internet fraud Professional video camera Television Deinterlacing Digital camera back Gamut Oscilloscope Computer Movie camera PDP-11 E-mail Embedded system Digital-to-analog converter Panoramic photography Sound recording Tungsten Handheld Memory card PIC microcontroller Image processing Game Boy Screenshot Rendering (computer graphics) Moir__ pattern Xbox 360 Sensor Chroma subsampling Blue screen of death Warez Frame rate Computer wallpaper Virtual memory Photojournalism
