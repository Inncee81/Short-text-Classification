my pictures came out with a yellowish tint i've got a decent digital camera mega pixels but for some reason a couple photos i took came out looking yellowish the photos are really nice but totally ruined by the ugly yellow tint i don't understand why because other pictures i took in the same area with the same amount of lighting don't look like that i have a fujifilm fine pix a camera i was indoors in a cafeteria at an elementary school the cafeteria has large windows that go from the floor almost to the ceiling the windows were behind me when i took the photo that came out yellowish would that cause an issue it was relatively sunny summer day everything white in the photo looks yellow there is a man wearing a white shirt but it looks light yellow everyone's teeth the whites of our eyes etc all look yellow the camera probably saw the parts of the photo lit by sunlight as 'white' and set the white balance for daylight which would make the parts of the photos lit by any tungsten light yellowish you can change the white balance or just do a color correction to make the shirts white again here are a couple tutorials on color correction to help you do that http graphicssoft about com od photoshoptutorialscolorcor photoshop color correction tutorials for correcting color and tone htm http www computer darkroom com tutorials tutorial htm Color temperature Light-emitting diode Digital photography PNG Pixel Digital image editing RGB color model Photography Sunglasses Stereoscopy Blue Grace Cossington Smith Color theory Raw image format Enlarger Rendering (computer graphics) Adobe Photoshop Color Camera Gamut Bryce Warez NTSC Sun Color blindness Sunlight ImageMagick Technicolor Digital camera Photographic film Grayscale Daylight saving time Anamorphic widescreen Television Sundial Contact lens Black-and-white Apollo 8 IPod Digital cinema Camouflage Light Computer printer Wi-Fi Liquid crystal display GIMP Computer animation Glasses Surveillance Color space High-definition television Goatse.cx Columbine High School massacre Drawing Anaglyph image Zone system Black Diamond Black Mesa Research Facility Autostereogram Oscilloscope Solar power ATI Technologies Primary color Super 8 mm film Photograph Diamond enhancement Digital camera back 2D computer graphics Filter (photography) Pixel art Volleyball Cliff Richard Collectibles in Bionicle Charge-coupled device Dither Computer vision Albedo JPEG Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Cloud Tungsten Handheld Red Digital Digital cinematography Raster graphics GIF Domain Name System High dynamic range imaging Uniform Resource Locator Chrysoberyl White Glass View camera Darkroom Spyware Eye Leica
