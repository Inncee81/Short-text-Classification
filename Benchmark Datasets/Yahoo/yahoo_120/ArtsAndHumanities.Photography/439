peel apart polaroid film cameras i really want one of these old cameras where you have to pull the film out and peel it apart to devlope it i have done a lot of research on them and know where to buy the film etc but i just wanted some opinions on which is the best one to buy any ideas anyone so i've been looking around i've seen that the 'swinger' polaroid camera is going really cheaply i assume that's not a good buy i love those old style poloroid cameras too and have several if you want to go super high quality and price is no object the best bet is a large format camera such as a hasselblad with a polaroid back i believe such equipment is still available from top photo equip dealers such as b h and adorama my favorites are the old folding land camera series made in the ' s and ' s these are easy to find at thrift stores used camera shops and ebay there were many models all of which take good photos but the best was the which was a professional version with a high quality lens and manual shutter those are pretty rare and run several hundred dollars these days but you can pick up a good model or series land camera for as little as a if you look around Digital photography Photography View camera Camera Leica Photographic film Camcorder Konica Minolta Contax Instant camera Digital camera Movie projector Stereoscopy Panavision Canon T90 Panoramic photography Poker jargon Amateur astronomy Anamorphic widescreen Bulk vending Large format Binoculars UK Singles Chart Laserdisc Enlarger SX-70 Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Internet fraud Holga camera Floppy disk Rangefinder camera Let's Make a Deal Canon EOS Photographic lens Photograph Apollo 15 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Best Buy IMAX Draw poker Nikon FM2 Supply and demand Capital accumulation Twin-lens reflex camera Widescreen Digital cinematography Automatic number plate recognition Shutter speed The Price Is Right Digital camera back Oscilloscope Paintball Gramophone record Betting (poker) Macro photography Canon EF lens mount Retailer Instant film Dodge Charger Apollo 11 Sailor Moon Surveillance Cinematography Memento (film) Shopping Videocassette recorder Nikon Corporation Movie theater DVD The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Point and shoot camera Grey market Television Schneider Kreuznach 8 mm video format Street photography Depth of field Slide rule Wayne Corporation Advanced Photo System 35 mm film RGB color model Inflation Dot-com Cinerama 70 mm film Canon T70 Film recorder IPod Poker 110 film David Hockney Gamma ray burst Yugo Nikon FE2 Television program Machinima Traditional animation
