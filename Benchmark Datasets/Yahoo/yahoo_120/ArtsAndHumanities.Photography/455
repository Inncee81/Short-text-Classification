optimal focal lenght on a zoom lens ok im still on this photography and lens sharing info forum buzz thing so please all contribrute so a zoom lens not a prime lets say a mm at what focal lenght will the lens be sharpest mm mm or mm if you know give a reason if you dont cool give a number and a theory or just a number my thanks is points to all one luck person will be chosen if its a tie then best theory explaination gets the big ten ive been told the answer but it could be wrong its got to do with the distance between the elements in the lens evan you are a genius wow thanks so much you are so valuable and your answers are dont know the words great is a little understated thanks there is no set answer to this resolution is commonly measured in mtf modulation transfer function a lens's peak mtf values will vary between different aperture settings and these values may peak at different focal lengths in a zoom lens for the purposes of this answer we will use the simplified imatest results from www photozone de which provides independent testing of slr lenses it is worthy of note that this testing uses aps c sensors so we will only talk about center resolution for now if we included border or extreme border it will only serve to increase the variability of the data and further illustrate my point example using the canon ef f l non is we can see that when shooting wide open the lens will achieve peak mtf at the short end mm with a value of lw ph however the peak mtf for the lens overall is at f at mm with a value of lw ph now if we compare this lens's little brother the f l non is we will find that overall peak mtf is at mm f interestingly this lens drops slightly in mtf at the mid range at and then picks up again at the long end this lens also peaks in sharpness at the short end when shooting wide open despite this variability there are a few general guides zooms are typically but not always softest at their long ends ultra wide angle zooms are often softest at their widest extreme standard zooms usually perform best in mtf around the mm mark of course lenses tend to peak in sharpness in mid aperture often around f ranges and then diffraction causes these values to begin to fall off somewhere around f or higher so to answer your example i can say that it is very likely that your hypothetical mm lens won't be sharpest at mm at any aperture whether it peaks at the short end or in the middle will depend on what the lens design wizards decided to prioritize in that particular model it will probably hit peak mtf around f the peak sharpness for wide open aperture shooting may differ from the overall peak mtf as well View camera Photographic lens Leica Eyepiece Aperture F-number Depth of field Contax Diffraction Canon EF lens mount Photography Aberration in optical systems Cinematography Panoramic photography Antenna (radio) Digital camera Gravity Digital single-lens reflex cameras Anamorphic widescreen Headlight Reflecting telescope Canon T90 Clementine mission Nikon Corporation Angular resolution Normal distribution Single-lens reflex camera Synthetic aperture radar Laser DVD Knife Terminal ballistics Unicode IMAX Confocal laser scanning microscopy Hash table Optical fiber Nuclear weapon design Digital camera back History of telescopes Lighting C programming language Scientific method Explosive material Value system Perl Stage lighting Schneider Kreuznach Astronomical seeing Chinese language Pinhole camera Vowel Compiler optimization Extreme Programming Parallax Intelligence quotient Car handling Fast bowling Fuel injection Second language acquisition Eye Dog agility Floppy disk Internal ballistics Street photography Observational astronomy Modem Stereoscopy Trigonometric function Radar Sonar Film speed Canon FD Drill bit Grade (education) Ray tracing Microscope Human height Fisheye lens Camcorder Central processing unit Quizbowl Point and shoot camera Database
