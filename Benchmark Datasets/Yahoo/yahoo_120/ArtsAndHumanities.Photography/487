does anyone know a photographer by the name will sterling i believe he lives around the memphis tn area but i'm not sure hi awb i met the will sterling once it was a few weekends ago i was walking to the corner market for a loaf of bread when i had to pass by a neighborhood church i was somewhat acquainted with the structure as it was always mentioned in the newspaper s community section known as the loft folks would gather there on thursday evenings for poetry readings however this day happened to be a saturday afternoon and a pair of gentlemen greeted me as i walked by they invited me in to sample an hour of their presentation ok i went inside and found myself to be a prospective new recruit for their brand of religion most of the pews were filled with hooded monks chanting a haunting rhythm there were others who like me were wearing their regular denims the service began like most others that church goers would be familiar with a grand master of ceremonies led the group through some songs and gave a sermon near the end of the hour it was time for their ritual of laying on of the hands some of the parishioners would come forward and ask for prayers for their ailments or for a sick grand mum who fell down in the tub all the hooded dudes whose faces could not readily be seen would all place a hand on the person and their combined energies were presumed to have a strength and expedite a solution to the problem ok now there was another new guy in the pews who was watching eagerly i recognized will sterling from a wanted poster viewed earlier at the post office when he saw a chance he approached the ring of conspirators and described how he was always moving around and never able to settle down the hooded goons closed in upon him all to make a physical connection the master of ceremonies began a prayer a dogmatic mix of logic and pure hocus pocus i immediately saw the effects of the procedure as the tension went out of will sterling s body when the beseeching was near an end the master asked are the brothers ready a suspenseful few moments passed until he almost shouted now on that cue the brothers began to pummel their hapless victim continually delivering blows over head and to the solar plexus until will sterling was down on the floor getting stomped after another minute the grand pooh bah decided the treatment administered was sufficient to induce a relaxing calm that would assuage the shaky leg syndrome of will sterling for a long long time i can t say for certain if will sterling got the comeuppance he deserved as i had a loaf of bread to buy and some other errands to do that day i hope for you awb that you do find a sense of closure to this difficult episode of life and be sure to put on your best sympathy face if anyone ever asks about will sterling Prayer Eastern Orthodox Church Shaggy dog story Mass (liturgy) Funeral of Pope John Paul II Meat Loaf Eucharist Roman Catholic Church Tridentine Mass Baptism Professional wrestling attacks Funeral Professional wrestling aerial techniques Glossary of partner dance terms Columbine High School massacre Canonical hours About a Boy Religious Society of Friends Scientology beliefs and practices Royal Assent Jewish bereavement Escape from New York Baptist The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Professional wrestling holds RuneScape quests Apollo 8 Social rule The Inside Novus Ordo Missae Philipp Melanchthon Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Rule of St Benedict Battle of Jutland Charles Darwin's views on religion Plame affair John Wycliffe Saturday Night Live Fasting Abortion debate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Aerial (dance move) Son Goku (Dragon Ball) Sydney Riot of 1879 Humphrey Bogart Hypoglycemia 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Poker jargon Japanese tea ceremony Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Community of Christ A Course In Miracles Sharon Tate Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Sant Thakar Singh Sumo Academia Westminster School Swingout Vespers Insomnia Boxing Tenshinhan YuYu Hakusho Church of Christ, Scientist Fort Ashby, West Virginia Surveillance Conspiracy (TNG episode) Reiki Mojave people Professional wrestling slang Hypnosis Hulk Hogan Donald Neilson Jewish services John Wesley Massage Atheism Men in Black Iglesia ni Cristo Rose (Doctor Who) Texas Revolution Past teachings of Prem Rawat Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina First English Civil War Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban National Football League Muslim ibn Aqeel I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Abbey Easter Neuro-linguistic programming
