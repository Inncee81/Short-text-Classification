do you like this idea no it's not another picture what started out as a simple photo in support of an answer turned into a rather interesting discussion http answers yahoo com question index ylt andtsiyhkuezpxaqlpqcnrdsy ix qid aaxpxhf is that something we might continue here community guidelines say don't use yahoo answers as a soapbox to vent your frustrations rant or otherwise violate the question and answer format if you prefer to have discussions or chat with others please use one of yahoo 's other community services such as yahoo groups so i'm not sure how well they would receive this kind of activity i mean technically this would be a discussion and a forum might be better would you like to share photos for critique and pointers or is that too much like work for those of you who do this for a living i know how that can be and that's why i am over here so much and rarely visit the dental section any more but what do you think yes antoni i am noticing that the section is settling out in strata with like minds seeking their own level it might be nice to serve as a resource to newbies but yahoo isn't paying anyone a dime to run this service for them so i say that we can turn it to our own benefit i am sure that there are existing forums probably hundreds of them on the internet that cater to exactly this sort of thing but in a way it would be amusing to hold these discussions right out here in public view and see what kind of response someone who doesn't have a clue ha often that's me might have to say i hardly feel any guilt at all when i don't tell someone how to put just one color in a black and white photo antoni one of my recent replies to a request for critique was to say my mother taught me that if i can't say something nice about someone don't say anything at all there were already or answers above me that laid it out and said that the snapshots pretty much sucked so i wasn't being cruel i thought about deleting my answer after the fact but for some reason i didn't i mean i think i know enough to have an appreciation for what i don't know but you can't start at the very beginning with everyone who asks if their picture is any good if i think someone has a good eye but needs to improve their technical skills i used to tell them so but from now on i think i will refer them to you for your judgement on that topic i like the idea critiqueing could work if it was 'here is what i tried to convey ' or it was something like a lighting problem all accompanied by an image or images s keep it to an ask answer format it wouldn't be work for me the images i take to earn a living are different than those i do for myself those are the ones that i would be interested in it would be a change from teen somethings who can't formulate a question can't write it and sorry almost started ranting nothing ventured i'm up for it vance Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Internet troll Have I Got News For You Microeconomics Philosophy of language Milton H.
