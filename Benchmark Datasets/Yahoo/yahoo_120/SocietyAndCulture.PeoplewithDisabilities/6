my twin sister my twin sister and i were four months premie i was developed all the way but she does not have a right arm and most of the time can't walk and has to use a wheelchair when we are in public people stare at her and i can't stand it anymore what should i do amanda i do know how you feel because i go out in a motorized wheelchair with a brace on my neck and an oxygen tank just as you walk beside your sister my husband walks beside me some ignorant people stare so hard that they actually turn around to stare as i go past them this is the first year i don't notice it much but it used to make me furious i guess i finally reached the point where those types don't bother me any more but i know you can't just tell yourself not to let it bother you you feel what you feel for some years when i couldn't stand it i had to do something i did different things on different days depending upon my mood sometimes i'd be serious other times i'd be silly for my age when i was feeling serious i would say something like didn't your mother ever teach you it's rude to stare at people or haven't you ever seen a wheelchair before or i would ask them if they needed eye drops more often i'd be silly but the point still got across i would ask some people if they would like my autograph too i would say i know i'm prettier than you but don't be jealous sometimes my husband would put his head next to mine we'd both say cheese as if getting our picture taken there were other things too depending on the day i'm usually a very friendly happy person but the rudeness of some of these adults drove me nuts i guess it was hard enough trying to accept that i was in the wheelchair that these people pushed me beyond tolerance for some years normally i am a dignified woman with class but that's how angry they made me it never bothered me when children stared they are naturally curious haven't yet been taught not to stare some little ones would ask me what my wheelchair was others would ask their parents why i was in one i was pleased to hear that almost of the parents gave a good answer what really made me furious was when total strangers would walk up to me and say things like what's wrong with you with a straight face i would say do you know me they would look a bit surprised say no then i'd say i didn't think so then they got the point would apologize i guess it took me a few years to get it out of my system but now i barely notice it it makes my husband angrier now maybe because i'm not reacting to them except for the people who take my picture they actually do that on a fairly regular basis anyway i'm glad you your sister have each other there are different ways you can handle it try not to be bothered if little children stare because they don't know any better also try to be understanding if elderly people stare or say certain things within reason i knew that to them it was a shock to see someone as young as i am in a wheelchair for the most part they are feeling compassion don't realize they may be speaking out of place i just usually smile back politely and i would guess that you your sister are a lot younger than i am however everyone between little children elderly people most certainly should know it's rude to stare and just because they may not see people in wheelchairs that often doesn't excuse their rude behavior i know that i live in a big city and not a day passes that i don't see at least one or more persons who use wheelchairs what about talking to your sister to see how she feels and have you told her how it makes you feel that might help you two might come up with some ideas as to how to handle the people who stare maybe eventually you will stop noticing it so much but be patient with yourself i know some people tell you not to let it bother you but you can't force yourself to feel a certain way it is a process that you will go through where the end result will hopefully be that it won't bother you but you're not at that point yet and that's ok the best of luck to you your sister Milton H.
