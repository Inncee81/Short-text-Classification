lewis hamilton is a spoilt brat i used to like the guy but i think there is an arrogant idiot behind the little act he puts on to the camara he started the trouble on saturday when he ignored team orders he then went on to tell ron dennis to go f king swivel you just do not talk to your boss who has been in the industry that long to go swivel lets hope alonso can kick his backside this season if anyone does not deserve it its hamilton purley on the basis of his sh t attitude they were both in the wrong however it was alonso that caused the racing problem of not giving the time for hamilton to have a good lap or counter his attempt at one lets hope above any other rubbish that goes on that they can race and do it on the track not by use of stupid attitude on both sides let the best mcclaren before we get into the facts of better cars vs driving skill driver win if it comes down to who is the bigger brat between the two then that is a tricky question and one you seem to have nicely missed most off alonso's gripes like his thoughts of coming in as driver and being told it was an equal playing field ooof that must of hurt especially when it was proved hamilton was at least as fast etc etc at the end of the day to be the best there has to be an element of arrogance and they most certainly both have that not as posed just hamilton Fernando Alonso Kimi R__ikk__nen Team McLaren 2000 Australian Grand Prix 24 Hours of Le Mans Jenson Button 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Michael Schumacher Ayrton Senna 2003 United States Grand Prix Giancarlo Fisichella History of Formula One Renault F1 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix New York Giants Indianapolis 500 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain 2004 San Marino Grand Prix Jordan Grand Prix 2005 Formula One season Scuderia Ferrari 2005 Canadian Grand Prix 2005 French Grand Prix 2005 Australian Grand Prix Jacques Villeneuve 2005 United States Grand Prix Ernie Irvan 2005 Bahrain Grand Prix Nigel Mansell English cricket team Juan Pablo Montoya Aerial (dance move) Future of Formula One Super Bowl XIII Major League Baseball television contracts Tiago Monteiro Formula One regulations 2005 British Grand Prix New England Patriots Brian Close Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Chip Ganassi Racing Saved by the Bell Jarno Trulli Totally Spies!
