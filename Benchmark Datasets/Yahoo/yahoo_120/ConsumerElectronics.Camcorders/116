canon digital camcorder mini dvd question i bought a canon digital dvd camcorder but the mini dvds dont work on my computer i checked the website and no cd came with the camcorder and my computer says the mini dvd is a blank cd what should i do i checked the site and it said there was a finalization process for these mini dvds what is that process ok i tried that but the only option is to initialize the disc and that option doesnt work that must mean that it is already finalized but it still doesnt work on mi computer when you record make sure that you finalize the mini dvd it is an option in the camera's menu if the dvd is not finalized only the camera that recorded it can read it that means no more recording on that disc but it also means that other players can read it if you want to see what the shots look like before you final ize you can either play back in the camera's viewer or hook the camera's video out to a tv input DVD Camcorder Digital video High-definition television Digital photography VHS Videotape Compact disc 8 mm video format Digital cinema IPod Videocassette recorder DV Screenshot Copy protection Digital camera Laserdisc Apple Computer SCART S__CAM DVD-RAM Film Wheel of Fortune Floppy disk Professional video camera CD recorder Xbox 360 Charge-coupled device JVC PlayStation Portable Secure Digital card Sampling frequency CD-ROM Camera Digital rights management Anamorphic widescreen Independent film MiniDisc Closed-circuit television RCA S-VHS PlayStation 2 Atari 8-bit family Betacam Oscilloscope Compact audio cassette Computer animation Movie projector Halting problem Digital Mac mini Pornography Warez Video CD Gramophone record Bluetooth Television Walkman Enterprise content management Archos Karaoke Ripping Computer Digital8 DVD recorder Nintendo Revolution Stereoscopy Desktop computer Universal Serial Bus MP3 Digital cinematography And All That Could Have Been Analog-to-digital converter Single (music) Digital audio player The Ultimate Matrix Collection ITunes Back to the Future Prolog Aspect ratio (image) Audio commentary (DVD) CD-R Traditional animation Covert listening device PlayStation 3 Technicolor NTSC High fidelity Betting (poker) Super Audio CD Macrovision IBM 1620 Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting DVD player Video DVD-Audio
