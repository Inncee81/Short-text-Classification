how do videographers shoot and edit video footages on the same day i myself is a videographer considering that you have to capture all tapes from all cameras to get the different angles what if you used say dv camcorders to capture all tapes from all cameras would be something like hrs the most if you have a tape full of video footage greetings i can't speak for the professionals whom do the same day edit sde but i can understand how it can be done i'm referring to wedding videographers but you might be referring to a one hour event there are different ways of doing them for the wedding videographer first have a fast laptop second have some of the recording already uploaded in the nle like the audio from the father for talk over etc as well as the entryway of the location of the wedding etc etc third take mental notes of what part of what tape you need to capture better yet capture with an attached hard drive and computer will be much faster than real time understand that most sde's don't have and hour of video from what i have seen they are more along the lines of to five minutes long and you need to catalog in your mind what to have in the sde and where they are contained on what camcorder tapes most sde are shown a hour or hours later at the beginning of the reception it varies depending on what part of the country you are in to what goes in seattle is not the same as what goes in new jersey or regarding an event like a concert i would think the easiest way to take care of a sde would be to do it real time if the camcorders are all liked together you can capture the video in real time that would be the easy way the second way would be to upload the tapes and seat the video in a nle and do a edit from there seems to me that once you had all the video together and they are at the same timeframe you could edit rather quickly and render the video out to dvd or whatever format you wanted please keep in mind that i'm not an expert see links below to some who are hope that helps Digital video 8 mm video format VHS DV Music video Digital photography Warez Videocassette recorder Digital cinematography Digital8 Digital cinema Videotape DVD Machinima Sound recording Digital camera Betacam High-definition television Screenshot Disc jockey HDV Live Aid Video S-VHS FireWire Saturday Night Live Professional video camera Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Commodore 64 Bohemian Rhapsody Windows Vista Floppy disk 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Compact audio cassette MP3 JVC Closed-circuit television Photography Motion capture Surveillance Stereoscopy The Ashlee Simpson Show The Menagerie Glen Jacobs Reel-to-reel audio tape recording The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) Sant Thakar Singh Back to the Future Compact disc Traditional animation Magnetic tape Audio tape length and thickness Girls Aloud XDCAM Enterprise content management IPod Windows XP Xbox 360 Computer bus WNEP-TV Film DVCPRO P2 Xbox Family Guy Amstrad CPC Photojournalism Hard disk Linear video editing Betamax RCA U.S. television news Bret Hart Muhammad al-Durrah Universal Serial Bus PlayStation 3 Mixtape Alias (TV series) Secure Digital card Not The Nine O'Clock News Escape from New York Video game music S__CAM Multitrack recording DVD-RAM Telecine Oasis (band) Guns N' Roses Apple Computer NTSC Archos Electronic journalism ITunes Music Store Mac OS X Television MiniDisc
