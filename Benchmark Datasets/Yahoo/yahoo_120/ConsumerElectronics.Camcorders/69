why are almost all divx movies mb no matter the length or quality i have downloaded minute shows and hour movies and they were both dvd quality and both mb i am just wondering how and why divx is like mp you can compress video as much as you like most people the reason they make a divx is because they want it to fit on a cd r so they make it mb or just below if it was bigger you'd put in on a dvd and then you wouldn't need to make a divx in the first place DivX Warez DVD Digital rights management XviD Video codec GamePark DIVX Theora Laserdisc PlayStation Portable DVD player Streaming media Machinima QuickTime Sega Dreamcast Video CD Widescreen Ripping Nero Digital Format war Videocassette recorder Live Aid High-definition television Vaporware MPlayer PlayStation 2 Anamorphic widescreen Broken (movie) Telecine AVI Video MP3 Camcorder Strap-on dildo Blu-ray Disc Xbox Media Center Direct-to-video Betacam Karaoke The Criterion Collection Oasis (band) Data compression Computer and video games The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film) Reefer Madness Motion picture rating system Once Upon a Time in America Movie projector H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Censorship in Australia Film Ogg Fahrenheit 9/11 David Quantick Transformers: The Movie Phantasmagoria (game) Superman III Penny Arcade (comic) Intolerance (film) Mystery Science Theater 3000 Chicago (band) Peter Gabriel Vowel Anime Sesame Street VHS Tapwave Zodiac Babylon 5 DV Stewie Griffin Married... with Children 8 mm video format Digital cinema GP2X The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series) Digital photography Revision3 Studios Dubbing (filmmaking) Pok__mon (anime) Dune (film) This Is Spinal Tap Return of the Ewok Punisher Lossless data compression The Internet Movie Database FFmpeg Dolby Digital Beastie Boys The Emancipation of Mimi Dream Theater ITunes Music Store Digimon VideoLAN The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series) Television movie Gorillaz Terminator 2: Judgment Day
