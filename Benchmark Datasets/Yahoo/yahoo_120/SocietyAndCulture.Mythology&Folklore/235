can anyone tell me the name of this demon he was all black blacker then black even his eyes were even black he crawled around kind of like spiderman but he had sharp clawlike hands fingers and feet can anyone tell me the name of some demons who fit that description or give me a link to a demon dictionary that has names and pics thanks im so i dont think it could be a childish misconception of a cartoon character i was not sleeping when i saw this i was wide awake and one of those heads will be in the middle of its back for what you described was not a single demon but a demon that is made up of several demons this may have been a one time visit but if by chance it was not you will see two other heads also it was not a paranormal creature but a creature from the supernatural realm so be very care full and look around the room you are in and stay away from all moving objects it name is confusion and if i were you i would not try to talk to it and i would keep a little distance between us if you have any more question i can be reached at marks mypacks net and if you decide not to listen and talk to it anyway i am sure that almost immediately you will have another story to tell us Phoebe Halliwell Ghost Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) The Life and Times of Juniper Lee RuneScape quests Doom enemies Demon YuYu Hakusho Sesshomaru Eye Out-of-body experience BloodRayne Magic (paranormal) Milton H.
