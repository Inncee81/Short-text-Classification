how do you use a triangle of manifestation at first you trace a circle around yourself in which you are going to stand or sit you imagine this circle of being part of a protective sphere that surrounds you as you progress in your magical evolution you will expand the characteristics of this protective sphere consequently your power in dealing with spirits will increase especially when you are going to use the commanding power of divine consciousness in front of your circle you have your table or altar the altar is nothing but an individual switchboard that serves as a structural link to the specific realms or energies which you intend to explore or use in the practice that you are going to do your altar of course has to be a structural representation of the aligning of the four elements within yourself and an expression of the structure of the divine name therefore your altar will have utensils that represent the four elements these utensils should be arranged in a way that reflects their aligning you set your table up as follows draw a circle on the table you may use a cord and lay out a circle with the cord inside the circle you trace an equilateral triangle this is your triangle of manifestation leave enough space between the triangle and the circumference of the circle for the utensils of the four elements put one or two altar candles inside the triangle two candles especially are of use to control and see the energies that you are going to connect with inside the circle but outside the triangle you put the utensils that represent the four elements put the elemental triangle with the candle to the upper right put the elemental pentagon with the cup of water or wine to the upper left put the elemental square with the incense and dagger if you like to the lower left finally you put the elemental pentagram with the crystal or dish with earth to the lower right you can use this basic circle for many other types of work in each case this setup will represent your oneness with the divine your next step is the charging of your outer realm with the energies that you are going to use you do so by first charging the circle that surrounds you while imagining this sphere that surrounds you you know that this sphere is protection then you take your power rod or dagger and trace the circle on the altar you may do the tracing with your index finger that points toward the periphery of the circle while you trace the circle you project energy into it it builds up like a sphere of which the material circle that you have traced is the equator next you trace the triangle in the center of the circle as you trace the triangle with your finger or power rod or dagger you visualize strongly that energy flows into the lines of the triangle light the two altar candles proceed to light the candle that represents the fire element project fire energy into the elemental triangle of fire imagine the elemental triangle being a gate to the cosmic realms of fire draw the red fire energy from the universe while you inhale and project it into the elemental triangle of fire while you exhale proceed with the charging of the elemental pentagon of water with the blue energy of the water element charge water energy into the pentagon until you feel that this is enough proceed the same way with the air element and with the earth element after you have finished with charging the four elemental talismans you proceed to imagine their energies flowing into the triangle in the center of your altar mainly into the area between the two candles at first your work may not appear to you as perfect as you would have expected be assured that with practice your methods of drawing and projecting energies will gain in intensity and power Pentagram
