should i be mad okay so a good friend of mine and i are both pregnant i'm due next month and she still has until december well ive told her what i'm planning to name my son for months now even before she found out she was having a boy too well she called me on saturday and asked if she could use my son's first name i picked out for her kids middle name at first i'm yeah ok i guess but now i'm like whats gives find your own name and im a little ticked off should i be this pissed am i just overreacting oh btw i didn't go off on her or anything i dont know if my question came off like that i havent even talked to her since that day but just thinking about it got me annoyed and thank you to all who are actually answering the question and to the other that just want to talk crap enjoy your two points and i would never end a friendship over something this petty something similar happened to me when i was pregnant with my first son i was just sure he was going to be a girl because we wanted a boy so badly so i had the name alaina faith picked out i told my sister in law as well as anyone else who would listen well i had a boy and months later she and my brother had a little girl named elaina grace and sis in law claimed that she just thought up the name my husband was deployed at the time and i had an infant son so i was extremely emotional then i was mainly hurt but still a little upset as my husband and i were planning for more children and would have still liked to use the name if we have a daughter anyway my point is at least your friend had the decency to ask you about it first plus you have the advantage of your son being born before her's so everyone will know she copied you you also have the advantage of your child starting school year before her's besides that there are still months for her to change her mind maybe you can keep suggesting names to her until something else sticks so to answer your questions no you should not be pissed well okay maybe a little and you're not overreacting because you haven't confronted your friend about it overreacting would be if you knocked her over the head because of it best of luck EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story Friends Pitaten Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Alois Hitler She Loves You Little Britain Teen Girl Squad One Tree Hill (TV series) Married... with Children Humphrey Bogart Ed, Edd n Eddy The Lovely Bones Theory of conduct Sharon Tate Eddie Guerrero Milton H.
