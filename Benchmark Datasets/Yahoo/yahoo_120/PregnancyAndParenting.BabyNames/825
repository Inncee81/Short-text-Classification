please explain this naming thing i'm not trying to be snarky but to understand what is the deal with everyone wanting to have 'unique' spellings of names what's wrong with spelling the name marie why does it have to be maree or marrii or mahrhee i can understand an unusual spelling if it comes from another culture to which you or the baby's other parent belongs but not just for the sake of being different honestly i knew a fellow named kaare say it like cory and i just don't get it further i see so many questions here from people who hate their names and i wonder why parents are so keen on this whole 'different' thing baby will be different just because of who he she is all these parents trying to come up with unique names are failing to think of this does it fit a year old does it fit a year old does it fit a year old does it look good on paper ie will it stand out on a job application does it look sound professional to quote an answer from another these parents are dooming thier kids with this whackado names they come up with think of the teasing the looks your child will get the constant needing to pronounce the name give your kid a messed up middle name if you insist on being unique but leave the first name alone let it be something decent understandable normal something that when they get in to school they won't get made fun of something that when they get in to the work force an employer will look at them and say yeah strong name i bet they are a strong person not strange name bet they are a strange person Social rule Hangul Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Kyle Broflovski Infantilism EastEnders The Fairly OddParents Friends Jon Secada American and British English differences She Loves You Sydney Riot of 1879 Milton H.
