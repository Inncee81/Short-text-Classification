is this a cool idea for baby's rooms i asked this yesterday but i'm looking for more answers well i had tripets two boys and one girl three weeks ago and right now they are all in one room in a few weeks we're going to move our girl tallon into her own room and let the boy's merrick and chandler share i thought it would be really cool to do a really girly theme so my mom made a purple comforter i can't remember what it's called i'm a little brain dead thing for her crib and we have pink sheets but i wanted to paint the walls light pink with clouds and little jets going in between clocks real clocks with the times the actual times from some of the major fashion capitols of the world with the city's name by them and for pictures i have some swatches and patterns and other sewing things framed the boy's room is panted like under water themed the walls are blue and then there's sand colored with seaweed and shells and things at the bottom and there's fish the ceiling has like the bottom of a boat and then more blue with lighter blue to make it look like the sun is shining on it and some of the fish and things come off the wall they are velcrow ed on so a fashion design themed room and an under water room yay or neigh wrong category i know their room is connected by a door so we can prop it open and they can hear each other and what not i have raised two children a boy and a girl my son is i have been around a lot of people who designed their own children's rooms but let me tell you that your idea is one that you should patent or whatever that is the most creative and interesting idea or ideas i have ever heard if i were a child growing up in a room like that i wouldn't ever want to leave my room because it would be the best and neatest place to be kudos to you and your wonderful creative mind i m extremely impressed yes yes yes The Shining (film) W.
