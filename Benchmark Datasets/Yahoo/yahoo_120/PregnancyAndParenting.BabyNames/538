what do you think of the name emilyn its growing on me i think i like it spelled emilen better though because emilyn has emily in it so it looks like a typo with the 'n' just curious your thoughts any other names your crazy about i think it's pretty i prefer the emilyn spelling over emilen only because when i see emilen i can't help but see the name emile like emeel and then an n after it but hey that's just me we had also considered emilyn but ended up even though it's so popular choosing emily because i've always loved the name but emilyn is a very nice variation which lends a bit more uniqueness over emily while still sounding classy if i could name my daughter over i would use the name helen i think it's a beautiful classic name that definitely isn't overused Negima Thinks ...
