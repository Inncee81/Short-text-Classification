peripancreatic lymph nodes i undergone a total gastrectomy because of gastric cancer and the pathology report said that surgical margins are free and lymph nodes are free except peripancreatic lymph nodes were infected and showed metastasis is that mean that i could have other infected lymph nodes and need chemo or radiotherapy if you were told that you had two lymph nodes that were still cancerous or showed evidence of being cancerous then you still have cancer present these lymph nodes are not infected but are metastasis from your previous gastric cancer you may have other metastasis elsewhere that are too small to show up yet and are not causing you any symptoms your liver would be the most likely location for metastasis but your pancreas is another potential area of concern if you want to be proactive in your treatment of these lymph nodes then you should push your oncologist for an immediate pet scan to let you and him know if and where the original cancer has spread a pet scan should show any cancer larger than about one quarter inch in size if you are still tired from your previous fight with cancer and you are not having any symptoms right now then you can do nothing and wait until you are having significant symptoms if i were you i'd get evaluated very soon and also get a second opinion at a major cancer center so you will know all your various treatment options good luck to you Cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breast cancer Lung cancer Metastasis Radiation therapy Hodgkin's lymphoma Thyroid cancer Endometrial cancer Ovarian cancer Esophageal cancer Cervical cancer Renal cell carcinoma Staging (pathology) Oncology Cancer of the larynx Breast Leukemia Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Testicular cancer Wilms' tumor Chronic fatigue syndrome TNM Medicine Chemotherapy Brain tumor Hypoglycemia Hematological malignancy Bubonic plague Soft tissue sarcoma Krukenberg tumor Appendicitis Gastrointestinal stromal tumor Osteosarcoma Cirrhosis Penile cancer Vitamin C Syphilis Pancreatic cancer Chronic lymphocytic leukemia Scrofula Cytomegalovirus Medical analysis of circumcision Positron emission tomography Peptic ulcer Lymph node AIDS Infectious mononucleosis Helicobacter pylori Aspartame Darryl Strawberry Folic acid Radiosurgery Group A streptococcal infection Eczema Toxoplasmosis Sleeping sickness Erysipelas Diarrhea Chlorpromazine Gastroesophageal reflux disease Monkeypox Chancroid Obesity Parkinson's disease T helper cell Stroke Oral cancer Psoriasis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Ewing's sarcoma Radiation poisoning Multiple myeloma Crohn's disease Terri Schiavo Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Apoptosis Trazodone Zollinger-Ellison syndrome First aid Action potential Acute pancreatitis Turner syndrome Sarcoidosis Ataxia telangiectasia Meningitis Diclofenac Multiple sclerosis
