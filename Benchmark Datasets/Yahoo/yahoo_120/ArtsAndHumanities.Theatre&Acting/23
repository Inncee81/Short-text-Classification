new acting job dilemma ok this is quite similar to my last question but it's an updated version so this question is more specific the story i have a backstage job at the moment touring with a show with a really good company i have just got an xmas acting job with another company the contracts overlap by days i have asked the new job to move rehearsal dates etc but there's no way the update i have had a proper chat with my current employers the options are finish the contract with them they are quite a good company and its touring theatres not schools and lose out on months xmas work and possibly be asked back next year to do a job in a skin costume i e dressed as an animal onstage or write a letter to my current employer terminating the contract leave my job days early to start my first acting job touring schools which is months long then definitely not be asked back by my current employer next year and possibly be stuck for work i'm very torn ultimately it comes down to what you see yourself doing in years time would you prefer to be acting or working backstage if you're passionate about both it sounds as though you have quite a bit of experience with backstage work and could benefit from some acting experience it may be worth taking that financial risk and cutting your teeth as a performer however if you aren't completely passionate about a performance career i'd suggest to you to keep developing your skills backstage and build your reputation as a reliable and commmitted crew member for your own peace of mind whatever your decision i'd keep everything above board and let your employers know your intentions from the outset although they may not be entirely happy with your decision your honesty and credibility will not have been tarnished directors and companies talk to each other all the time so a reputation is something to really think about regarding working in schools this is a great place to learn one's craft as the response is immediate you can't fool schoolchildren into being entertained and you'll be able to adjust your performance accordingly each time if you choose this route it may not be something you want to do for too long but it will be a demanding but rewarding experience remember whether your working in front or behind the backdrop if you were in it for the paycheck or the security you'd be better off working in a bank good luck King Crimson Saturday Night Live Whose Line Is It Anyway?
