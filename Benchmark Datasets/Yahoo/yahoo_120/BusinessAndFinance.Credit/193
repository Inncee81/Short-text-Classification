will they still try to repo a charged off vehicle spoke to triad today and they said since the loan went over days it was charged off mind you i have been trying to make arrangements anyway they said that in fl you can't reinstate a loan after repo or charge off the only thing you can do is pay in full not an option for me so will they still be trying to repo or will it become a collection matter i can work out with some collection agency and is that even true about fl law help let me further expand here i am not trying to get a free vehicle my husband has cancer and we have been hanging on by a thread i am not trying to get a free car i just want to know if i have any legal ramifications to try to save the car at this point they purposely gave me the run around all last week and this week knowing that as of the car would charge off i am just trying to figure out if there is anything i can do or anyone i can work with to try to resolve the matter without having to pay the balance in full so please if you are going to give me answers like you are not going to get a free car then don't bother answering my husband is dying i need to be able to get him to chemo and radiaiton and i want and have wanted to try to resolve this matter anyone with legal advice would be appreciated i e would chapter help or is it even too late for that their first answer to you is right but that doesn't mean that they couldn't have rewritten the loan next they can and will try to repo the car if you don't want to lose it then keep it in a garage or parked in front of another car in your drive way repo men cannot break the law any law while trying to repo the property you might want to try and refinance the loan you have through a different lender you might need to get someone to cosign the loan but it s better then the alterative btw if they repo the car and get less then the loan s principle you re going to be stuck with the difference also many times these kinds of loans are sold and those people will come after the car sell it and then they will sue you for the difference if you cannot refinance try to sell it approach the lender with a cash offer to close the loan for the amount you got and then get it in writing that the account was moved from write off to paid off for x amount Mortgage Student loan Life insurance EastEnders Annuity Tax Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Corporation Bank Bond Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) GNU General Public License Estoppel Monetary policy Poker jargon Plame affair Donald Trump Usury Craps Credit card Philosophy of language Islamic economics Stock Copyleft Rosa Parks Theodicy Deflation (economics) Theory of conduct Polyamory MacGuffin Interest Annual percentage rate Predatory lending Capitalism Trust (Law) USA Automobile Time Out of Mind Call centre Gettysburg Address Economy of Russia Divorce Real estate broker Primerica Financial Services Money Wheel of Fortune Citigroup Intellectual property Law of value Short selling Debt Repurchase agreement Property (ownership right) Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Finance Auto insurance MAME Supply and demand Abortion debate Schabir Shaik Trial Government National Mortgage Association Temasek Holdings Security (finance) Debt consolidation Title insurance Rational pricing 613 mitzvot Repo Man Slander and libel Marilyn Monroe Education in the United States Gold standard True Crime: Streets of LA The Joker's Wild Socrates Bicycle lighting Tire Bank of China (Hong Kong) Alex Ferguson Credit score Coercion Civil rights Financial markets Capital accumulation Surveillance Audi Extreme Programming Marriage
