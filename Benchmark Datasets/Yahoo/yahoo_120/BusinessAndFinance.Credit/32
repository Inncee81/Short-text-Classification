how long before a paid debit is removed from my credit report i owed a property management company money another story regarding security deposits and companies ripping us off but it was reported on my experian credit report but all collections were done in house with this property management company i have since paid the debt week ago because i want to move from the house i am in now and into an apartment building they said the property management company i owed the money to everything is done electronicly now and my account experian should be cleared in days but in the letter they gave me says up to days what is your experience will it be days or days and can i call experian directly and fax proof of the debt being paid in hopes it will expidite the clearing of my credit report because no apartment will rent to me until this account shows being paid and or cleared hope for but expect calling or writing experian will probably not do much good by the time you get the dispute in with proof they will probably have already received the update from the management company however since you have a letter from the management company that says it is cleared you should be able to give a copy of the letter to any place you are looking at to show it is cleared Credit card Internet fraud Money Mortgage Credit score Debt Insurance Debt consolidation Experian Surveillance Bank Interest Credit repair Annuity Bank fraud Government debt Personal finance Security (finance) Short selling Finance Taxation in the United States Cheque Derivative (finance) Temasek Holdings United Kingdom corporation tax Child support Accountancy Social Security (United States) Warren Buffett Gold standard Construction Estoppel Vista Way Accounting methods Credit card fraud Financial services TransUnion Payroll Tom DeLay SCO-Linux controversies Tax Windows XP Economy of Russia NorthBridge Apartment Complex Article One of the United States Constitution Electronic money Credit rating agency Chatham Square Contract Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Double-entry book-keeping Capital accumulation EFTPOS FairTax Microeconomics Student loan Toll road Social Security debate (United States) Automated Clearing House Debt levels and flows Financial audit Gold as an investment Joseph Smith, Jr. Mutual fund Anarchism and capitalism History of the Jews in England The Commons Stock Donald Trump Scrip Downing Street memo Mail Monetary policy Fiat money Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Law of value Citigroup Leasehold estate Great Depression Lloyd's of London Property tax Margin (finance) Cyprus dispute Walt Disney World College Program Money supply Hyperinflation Assignment (law) Gross domestic product Ocean's Twelve Corporate governance Financial markets Auction Charles Ponzi United States Department of the Treasury American individualist anarchism Enterprise content management Intellectual property
