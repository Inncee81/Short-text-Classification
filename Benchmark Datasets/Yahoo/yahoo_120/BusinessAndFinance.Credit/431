debt collector coming to home when i was younger i made some stupid mistakes that i am paying for now long story short i had a judgement against me for a credit card and they ended up levying my bank account of dollars and the debt was since then i have received no notification from the collector today however a man came to my house asking for me he approached my brother and said that he was with the court house and from about feet away he showed my brother some badge my mom came out to talk to this person and asked him what this was in reference to he said this was about a judgement that was against me and that i never showed to court and that he wanted to talk to me about that my mom asked him if he was a marshall and to show some identification well magically he didn't have any badge or business cards on him who is this person and in the state of california can debbt collectors come to your home please only serious answers and i'm aware this is what i get so spare any lectures tx he wasn't there to serve me anything he said it was in reference to something that has been served to me before in that i didnt show up to court which why should that matter i was already in default thus they were able to levy my account ps the first time i was served it wasnt even to me it was to my brothers girlfriend who i once worked with they served them to her since she said she knew me but i didnt work for the company any longer it sounds to me like a collector trying to scare you into getting the additional money owed since they already filed a judgement and levied your bank account chances are they will not sue you again for the remaining amount if you don't have a bank account of course they are unable to levy you again if you do have an employer they cannot have your wages garnished unless the original judgement says to do so often times when its a bank account levy it cannot be an either or situation meaning they cannot levy your account or garnish wages next time you see this person tell him to stay away from you or you will scream its illegal to be harassed at your home or work if he comes close to you scream i'm pretty certain he will run Credit card Contract Taxation in the United States Bank Schabir Shaik Trial Monetary policy Child support Mortgage Plame affair Legal tender Apple Computer Personal finance Deflation (economics) Shaggy dog story Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Bank fraud Student loan Wyatt Earp Enron Corporation Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Tax Social Security (United States) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Article One of the United States Constitution United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Minimum wage Debt Corporation Money Trust (Law) USA Identity theft Hyperinflation Fred Phelps Blackjack Password Satchel Paige Government debt Charles Ponzi Tom DeLay Great Depression EastEnders Divorce Paula Jones Insolvency Wheel of Fortune Economy of the United States Payroll Economy of Russia Bretton Woods system Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Wal-Mart Identity document Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Small business Cardcaptor Sakura Derivative (finance) SCO-Linux controversies Bond Social rule Citigroup Time Out of Mind Roe v.
