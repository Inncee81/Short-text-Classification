how much effort does it take for credit card companies to do a transfer what does it take for them to do the actual transfer from one credit card to the next they want to add an extra charge of of the debt that i owe to transfer over this is nonsense i really don't think pushing a few buttons on their computers requires such an extra charge please explain the actual process if you really know zero effort what buttons need to be pushed the cashier does all the work the credit card company doesn't push a single button the cash register is where all the buttons are pushed after that it is all electronic and no humans are involved once the credit card is scanned the terminal knows the number and the account for it the cashier enters the price and that amount is automatically added to your balance due anything like sales tax is handled at the terminal this is why you can make a charge at am and have it go through in just a few minutes the only limit to the time of the transaction is how fast the internet connection is i like to do electronic banking on bank of america's website when i use my debt card the transaction and change in my balance is immediate i check it at an atm or at home and the charge has gone through and the balance shows that charge and is current i also pay my bills on line including my credit card bills i set up an account and address for the company that i want to pay a bill to and bank of america handles the rest i enter the amount to pay select a date to pay it on and the payment is made in most cases it is an electronic payment but if necessary bank of america will print and mail a check to make that payment once the cashier is finished with pushing the buttons on the cash register and the card is scanned in before you can reach for the pin to sign the receipt the transaction is complete it was done all by computers and the credit card company expends no effort at all this is why credit cards are such bad deals they are charging you for the privilege of having an open unsecured loan that you can access at any time if i transfer money from my bank to my credit card it doesn't cost me anything if you transfer money from your visa to your mastercard then both companies want to get a piece of that action so a transaction fee is charged deal with a bank and save the charges Debit card Internet fraud EFTPOS Mortgage Credit card fraud Bank fraud Monetary policy Mergers and acquisitions Advance fee fraud Security (finance) Electronic money United States Postal Service Money supply E-mail spam Citigroup Surveillance Insurance FairTax Password Poker jargon Euro SmartRider Smart card Money Betting (poker) Mutual fund Student loan Microeconomics Islamic banking Chip and PIN Bond Primerica Financial Services E-mail Annuity Windows XP Deflation (economics) Interest Gold standard Corporation Legal tender Filling station The Amazing Race Electronic toll collection Floppy disk Economy of Russia Schabir Shaik Trial MasterCard Financial audit Social Security (United States) British national identity card Computer Corporate finance Derivative (finance) Identity theft Bretton Woods system Gross domestic product Auto insurance Credit score Micropayment Article One of the United States Constitution Skype 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Mail America Online Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act CPU design Bank of America Postage stamp MetroCard Inflation Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Accounting methods Nintendo GameCube RFID Best Buy Electronic commerce Electricity meter Public domain Economy of India VISA (credit card) Wachovia Short selling Argos (retailer) Domain Name System
