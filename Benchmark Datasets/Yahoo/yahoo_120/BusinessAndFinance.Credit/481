i just paid off credit cards do i leave them open or close them immediately to help my credit score i wouldn't be putting anything on them i was just told it can help your credit score to keep them open for a while and not put anything on them i just wanted to make sure this was good advice because i hear so much about people closing their accounts everybody's telling you to leave them open i'm going to tell you why you should leave them open this is what makes up your credit score payment history total debt vs avaiable credit length of time establishing credit types of credit established inquiries and new accounts ok now when you close an account it immediately affects whatever active payment history you have will be shortened it also shortens the average age of accounts if these accounts have been opened for a while and then to close them would give the appearance later on that credit has been established more recently than it has closing accounts also disrupts the mixture of revolving vs installment accounts you can't load up on one type of account an example of a balanced mixture of credit is revolving credit cards line of credit and installment student furniture appliance car boat motorcycle mortage accounts and more importantly closing accounts decreases the amount of avialble credit vs the amount of debt that you have making it look like you owe more than you're capable of borrowing if you have in debt from other accounts beside credit cards and you close the credit card accounts you don't have that available credit to offset the total debt you owe the best suggestion would be to keep the accounts open and make small purchases month or so that can be paid off every month to show activity this way the balance stays low if not at and the card continues to report positive activity every month Student loan Bank Mortgage Monetary policy Debt Schabir Shaik Trial Credit history Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Government debt Deflation (economics) Bretton Woods system Interest Internet fraud Betting (poker) Gold standard Short selling Surveillance Finance Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Personal finance United Kingdom corporation tax Baccarat Double-entry book-keeping Poker jargon Economy of Russia Money Mutual fund Microeconomics Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Debt levels and flows Supply and demand Arbitrage Euro Measures of national income and output Great Depression Credit card fraud Insurance Social Security (United States) Primerica Financial Services FairTax Octopus card Identity theft Money supply Tax Economy of the United States Islamic banking Bank fraud The Amazing Race Cheque Hyperinflation Annuity Collateralized debt obligation SmartRider Economy of Pakistan EFTPOS Taxation in the United States Economy of the Philippines Derivative (finance) Electrophysiology Citigroup Accounting methods Equine conformation Futures contract Inflation Plame affair Elevator Corporate finance Arthur Laffer Pension Economy of Bolivia Security (finance) History of the United States (1918-1945) Debt consolidation Estoppel U.S. public debt Smart card $ale of the Century Wind power Refinancing Economy of El Salvador George W.
