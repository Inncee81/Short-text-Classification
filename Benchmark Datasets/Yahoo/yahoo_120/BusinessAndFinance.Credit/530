help do i have to pay it back i left my company in may ' in july ' i was notified of a overpayment they are sending me bills monthly wanting payment and they want me to sign a promosiary note for repayment all of this is in texas do i have to pay them back what would be the conquences of not paying them back and what should i do heres the thing i didn't know i was overpaid at all i assumed since i had just received a paycheck that there wasn't any overpayment to speak of at one time i was slightly overpaid but i went a month w no paycheck to make up the difference this was in january this year since then i have been working and receiving paychecks regularly i called payroll and listened to their side of it but didn't understand a thing they were speaking of i just don't see how it could go to collections since i never agreed to repay the debt nor did i sign anything for some type of services rendered ex a phone bill can anyone explain how and why it could go to collections also i quit this job to persue my career as an rn which i'm in school full time for right now so other than my partner's income i don't have an income to speak of to be honest i don't know how i'm overpaid that much either the thing is i was a flight attendant we were always paid a little backwards to begin with when i spoke w payroll she informed me that the majority of overpayments after leaving the company was w flight attendants in january when i fell overpaid the one i knew about i had fell sick in december and didn't have any sick time but was paid nonetheless at the time i knew i was overpaid and took all steps to redeem that debt as paid but now i haven't a clue how they are coming up with the number that they are all these additional comments are in response to some answers that i have received thanks everyone what ever you do i wouldn't sign any promissory note then you are legally on the hook sit it out and if they plan to sue you if they are they will have to make a demand and they can't go to small claims with a lawyer if you think that you earned it or can come up with a defense you can go to court you can prevail in court if they have a promissory note you have no chance of course in texas i am not if sure you have any legal rights unless it is a criminal act they can't do anything except sue you they can send you letters and make calls to you most likley they will turn it over to a collection agency if you get a collection letter make sure you dispute it right away it will get collection people off your back good luck Estoppel Social Security (United States) Bond Payroll FairTax Debt Karl Rove Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tom DeLay Microeconomics Rick Santorum Mortgage United Kingdom corporation tax George W.
