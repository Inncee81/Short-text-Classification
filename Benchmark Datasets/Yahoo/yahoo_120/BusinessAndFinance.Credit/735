improve semi bad credit situation my dad was in the hospital last year and almost died i was with him for about days during this time i missed approx payments on all my loans car loan personal loans credit cards and a wheeler loan once i returned home i quickly returned everything to normal or so i thought now over a year later i have all of the above paid off except for my car but i got denied for a loan the other day when i went to trade my car in i got several letters and they all said the same thing past or present delinquincies now this was just missed payments that were corrected before any went to collections whats the deal here if they are paid off to elaborate all debt but my car payment is paid off completely i was days past due on accounts but only one of the car remain with a balance ok second i dont use credit repair companies and already know they are a scam you can accomplish the same plus more on your own sometimes you can request to have contact information to the person who makes the loan decisions for the organization it's tedious and they may ask you to show documentation from the businesses whose loans you paid in full if you can prove the circumstances and how you continued to pay the loans off that should tell them something there are no guarantees however if they decide to loan you the money you can insist on a decent interest rate you shouldn't be punished when you followed through contact the credit bureaus for a recent credit report you should do this anyway as you have been turned down in the past for a loan the report is free to you hope this helps Student loan Mortgage Credit card Bank fraud Credit score Debt Credit repair Bank Islamic banking Money Deflation (economics) Bond Personal finance United Kingdom corporation tax Marshall Plan Interest Government debt Life insurance Primerica Financial Services Economy of the United States Predatory lending Social Security (United States) Estoppel Internet fraud Finance 401(k) Child support Bretton Woods system Debt consolidation Great Depression Corporate finance Corporation Monetary policy Collateralized debt obligation Microeconomics Economy of Russia Usury Security (finance) Hillary Rodham Clinton Financial services Economy of Chile Government National Mortgage Association Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Economy of Pakistan Economy of El Salvador Article One of the United States Constitution Citigroup Mail fraud Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Money supply Derivative (finance) Poker jargon Short selling Tertiary education fees in Australia Babylonian law Credit history Mergers and acquisitions Letter of credit Unemployment Contract Mensal__o scandal Scientology beliefs and practices School of Salamanca Donald Trump Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Corporate governance Tax protester History of the United States (1918-1945) Debt levels and flows Islamic economics Credit derivative The Amazing Race Call centre Plame affair Charles Ponzi Economy of India Small business Legal tender Confidence trick Social Credit Mortgage-backed security Municipal bond Health insurance Charles I of England 2005 United States Grand Prix Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Economy of Africa Credit union Tennessee State Constitution
