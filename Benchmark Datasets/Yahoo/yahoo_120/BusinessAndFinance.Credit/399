what exactly is an unsecured line of credit an unsecured line of credit means the creditor does not have an item serving as collateral aka security for the loan for example a mortgage lender will have a deed of trust or other form of lien against the borrower's home an auto lender will have a lien against the title of the car these forms of security will give the lender the right to take the secured item house or car if the loan is not paid also these forms of security prevent the borrower from selling the secured item until the loan is paid off typically the unpaid balance of the loan will be repaid to the lender through an escrow account if the secured item is sold prior to repayment of the loan when the loan is unsecured the lender has none of these items so they have nothing to automatically take if the borrower doesn't repay if the borrower declares bankruptcy usually the secured lender eventually will be paid or obtain the secured item the unsecured lender only shares in the division of the bankrupt estate which usually results in a small fraction if any of the loan being repaid as a result unsecured loans are riskier for lenders and they usually charge much higher interest rates or insist on a much higher credit rating for the borrower Bond Debt Predatory lending Interest Insurance Government debt Debt consolidation Finance Credit card Short selling Stock Islamic banking Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Title insurance Bankruptcy in the United States Real estate broker Government National Mortgage Association Financial markets Microcredit Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Mortgage-backed security Lender of last resort Usury Corporation Foreclosure Security (finance) Credit score Central bank Annual percentage rate Great Depression Arbitrage Interest rate Subsidy Repurchase agreement Taxation in the United States Payday loan Savings and Loan crisis Islamic economics Monetary policy Savings and loan association Debt levels and flows Donald Trump Concurrent estate Money Mobile home Economy of Russia Annuity Securitization Fractional-reserve banking Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code Credit history Bankruptcy 401(k) Life insurance Money supply Collateralized debt obligation Tertiary education fees in Australia Developing countries' debt Primerica Financial Services Babylonian law Allodial title Inflation Gold standard Consumer finance Deficit Economy of Pakistan Social Security (United States) Capital accumulation Stamp duty Business cycle Economy of India Refinancing Mutual fund Derivative (finance) U.S. public debt Universal Studios Article One of the United States Constitution Asian financial crisis George W.
