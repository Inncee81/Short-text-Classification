how far will a bank negotiate to avoid writing off a credit card debt my mother's friend owes on a credit card and the bank has been charging her percent interest eventually she just refused to pay after months of threats the bank relented and offered her a five year plan to pay off the debt at six percent interest she says that will simply be paying back the bank its percent in the total accrued so far over a longer time plus she can hardly afford the monthly payments her debt is more than years old and she's payed back so far more than twice what she borrowed on the card she offered the bank percent to call the account settled but they scoffed she wonders given that they did finally quit threatening her and made her an offer are they likely to soften further if she holds her ground and prepares for bankruptcy would the bank be likely to accept a counter offer from her of their five year plan on a lesser total amount how much would the bank get if they wrote off the account and sold the debt the bank can't sell the debt they eat it and claim it on their corporate irs tax return as lost income from an uncollected debt and your friend will receive a parallel filing notice in the mail from the irs of this new income to her that she will have to pay taxes on in the year that occurs and the irs will not cut her a deal anywhere close to what the bank will don't let that happen if she's collectible in the eyes of the bank high income producer they will not be easy to deal with if she appears uncollectible for the whole amount the typical industry offer is about of the total in a lump sum their monthly payback offer is generous and certainly better than what the irs will do after she receives the lost debt income statement in summary i suggest she work out a slow payment plan with the bank or maybe a relative or friend to help her come up with of the debt total and make an offer in compromise good luck tell her in the future don't use credit cards to buy things you couldn't otherwise afford ever Credit card Bond FairTax Mortgage Bank Debt Taxation in the United States United Kingdom corporation tax Social Security (United States) Life insurance Deflation (economics) U.S. public debt Money Annuity Interest Student loan Bretton Woods system Insurance Personal finance Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Microeconomics 401(k) Economy of Russia Mutual fund Flat tax Hyperinflation Capital accumulation Schabir Shaik Trial Inflation Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Short selling Variable universal life insurance Security (finance) Mergers and acquisitions Derivative (finance) Financial services Tom DeLay Tax Estoppel Baccarat Donald Trump History of the United States (1918-1945) Capitalism Legal tender Government debt Wal-Mart Article One of the United States Constitution Social Credit Primerica Financial Services Social Security debate (United States) Temasek Holdings Monetary policy Tax protester Corporation Corporate finance Bank fraud Child support Income trust Citigroup Kent Hovind Finance Octopus card Arthur Laffer Islamic banking Economy of the United States Treasury security Enron Corporation Tariff Retirement plan Knots Landing Trust (Law) USA Gold standard Municipal bond Progressive tax Measures of national income and output Health insurance Collateralized debt obligation Public transport Advance fee fraud GNU General Public License Credit card fraud Betting (poker) Illegal drug trade George W.
