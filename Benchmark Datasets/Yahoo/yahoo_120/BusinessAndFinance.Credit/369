a quick little credit card question if i had dollars on a card and i spend all of it in the first month lol do i have to pay all that back even if the card makes you pay the minimum each month or do i just pay the minimum you can just pay the minimum but if you have maxed the card out there is the possibility that the interest changes may be more then the minimum payment which would put you into over limit fees anytime you exceed of your credit limit in any given month your credit score gets dinged pay as much as you have to so your balance will be below of your credit limit Credit card Minimum wage Student loan Baccarat Bank Taxation in the United States Credit score Credit history Octopus card Social Security (United States) Betting (poker) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Salary cap Wal-Mart Citigroup Legal tender Poker jargon Graduate school Weimar Republic Bretton Woods system Slot machine Insurance Debt Virgin Mobile Public transport Futures contract Internet fraud Debit card Government National Mortgage Association Mortgage Refinancing Keynesian economics Bond Social Security debate (United States) Interest Schabir Shaik Trial Smart card Luas Athenian democracy E-ZPass Variable universal life insurance Food Stamp Program Money Corporate finance Economy of Russia Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Short selling London Congestion Charge Personal finance Driver's license Contract bridge Predatory lending Caddy EFTPOS Member of the European Parliament United States Postal Service Neopets FairTax Currency Debt consolidation Education in Germany Education in the United States Gold standard Arbitrage Government debt Arthur Laffer Micropayment History of the United States (1918-1945) Municipal bond Jeopardy!
