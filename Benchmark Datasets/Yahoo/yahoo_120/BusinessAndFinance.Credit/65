if i cancel my credit card interest is ridiculous will my interest charges stop also you sound you got yourself in the trap so many have gotten in in the past the best thing to do is to absolutely stop using your credit card for any purchases at all i don't know how much you owe but the credit card companies want to keep you hooked on and dependent on them for as long as they possibly can we ran up a disastrously high credit card bill in the late s and somehow managed to pay it off and then cut up the card but it took a lot of self discipline on our part our son in college did the same thing in the mid s and did the same thing as long as you have a balance they will continue to charge you exorbitant rates of interest so you cannot solve the problem by simply cancelling your account there are many legitimate and some not so legit organizations which will help you manage control and limit your debt but many of them will only help you if your debt is at least in today's world you seemingly cannot avoid having at least one credit card but you have to learn to not use it unless absolutely necessary we currently have several credit cards but it doesn't matter what the rate of interest is as we pay the amount owed in full each month and never use them to get cash advances a cash advance incurs interest even if you pay it off in full in days time one or two of the cards we have allow us days to pay with no interest due if regular payments are made on a timely basis and the entire amount is paid by the end of the period a couple cards we have actually allow a longer period of tme to pay without incurring interest these are potentially dangerous to use if you do not have a lot of self discipline in that a lot can happen in a longer period of time and if you miss or are late making one payment you are suddenly liable for interest payment from day one Credit card Debt Student loan Insurance Mortgage United Kingdom corporation tax Bank Microeconomics Deflation (economics) Mutual fund Annuity Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus FairTax Credit score Life insurance Keynesian economics Personal finance Internet fraud Money U.S. public debt Bond Monetary policy Gold standard Bretton Woods system Government debt PE ratio Bank fraud Predatory lending Octopus card Surveillance Hyperinflation Corporate finance Taxation in the United States Islamic banking Debit card Cheque Food Stamp Program Social Security (United States) Arthur Laffer Security (finance) EFTPOS Auto insurance The Amazing Race Yield curve Primerica Financial Services Health insurance Ponzi scheme Economy of Russia Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Short selling Professional wrestling slang Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Credit derivative Mergers and acquisitions Debt consolidation Ashton-Tate Treasury security Credit card fraud Inflation Universal life insurance Variable universal life insurance Deficit spending Baccarat Abortion debate Schabir Shaik Trial Accounting methods Salary cap Athenian democracy Wheel of Fortune Collateralized debt obligation Public transport Article One of the United States Constitution Free trade Financial services Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Child support Philosophy of language Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Dividend Individual Savings Account Betting (poker) Liability Micropayment United States Postal Service International Computers Ltd Futures contract Plame affair Public-key cryptography Drug test Wachovia Corporation
