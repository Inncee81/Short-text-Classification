credit card issuer cancel my card due to inactivity of the card use will this impacts my credit score i got notification from credit card issuer that my credit card was canceled due to inactivity i have not use the card for more than a year i would like to know if this cacelation will have impact on my credit score thanks the notation that it is closed by the credit granter will not drop your scores but it could be considered as a negative by a credit underwriter in general as far as it being closed it could have be a negative since you would be losing the credit limit that was being reported which could drive up your overall utilization if you do not want the account you might call and request that they show it on your reports as being closed by you if you want the account contact them and request that it be re opened they may or may not change the reporting status or re open it but either way it would be worth it to try if you re open it use it at least once every to months for a small purchase and pay in full when you get the statement so you would not be paying interest Credit card Bond Financial services Credit score Mortgage Municipal bond Insurance Debit card Estoppel Money HSBC Octopus card Student loan Citigroup Plame affair Credit card fraud Debt FairTax Stored-value card Futures contract Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Mortgage-backed security Personal finance Hyperinflation Life insurance Cheque Electronic money Annuity United Kingdom corporation tax Bank fraud Traveler's cheque Short selling Credit history Enron Corporation Driver's license The Amazing Race Bank Identity theft Deflation (economics) Internet fraud Social Security (United States) Texas hold 'em Gmail Betting (poker) Phone sex Indian nationality law Derivative Frequent flyer program Open Directory Project EFTPOS George W.
