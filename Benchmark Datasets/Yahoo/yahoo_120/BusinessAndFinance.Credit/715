in the past i haven't had perfect credit but have paid off alot of the debt why is my score not changing how long does it take for my credit score to go up i have paid off alot of the debt that was on my credit report plus have maintained a checking acct for years with no bad checks i have gotten loans with a cosigner and have never been late once on a payment my credit score has not gone up even after paying off some of that debt i had in the past why is this and shouldn't it go up immediately after paying i am unable to get a loan because of that low score it doesnt happen immediately and it depends on when the creditor reports it to the credit bureau if they only report once a month it will take a while also the length of time since the delinquencies affects the score if you just paid it off your rate may not change i've paid off all my bad debt and if i apply for credit it still will suggest past delinquencies are affecting my score and its been a few years if you have any credit cards left try increasing the credit limits you have with them and keep doing what you're doing maybe try to save aggressively so you won't need that loan and make sure that the delinquency has actually been reported once i paid off the collection agency and found out i had to call the actual creditor and tell them it was paid so they would report it Student loan Credit score Credit card Debt Mortgage Bond Deflation (economics) Interest Social Security (United States) Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Bank Credit history Annuity Debt levels and flows Monetary policy 401(k) Security (finance) Child support Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economy of Russia Economy of the United States Estoppel Microcredit Money Primerica Financial Services Hyperinflation Taxation in the United States Social Credit Corporation Money supply Donald Trump Cheque Unemployment benefit Inflation Bretton Woods system History of the United States (1918-1945) Islamic banking United Kingdom corporation tax Developing countries' debt Credit derivative Credit union Debt bondage Debt consolidation Pump It Up Life insurance Savings and loan association Economy of Argentina Credit default swap Deficit spending Social Security debate (United States) Corporate governance Capitalism Predatory lending Double-entry book-keeping Credit rating agency Schabir Shaik Trial Great Depression Collateralized debt obligation Personal finance Slot machine Municipal bond Gold standard Tom DeLay Refinancing Divorce Article One of the United States Constitution Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code Short selling Bank fraud Legal tender Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Plame affair History of post-Soviet Russia Derivative (finance) Economy of El Salvador Microeconomics Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Bolivia Poker jargon Betting (poker) Fiat money Capital accumulation Union shop Federal Reserve Octopus card Corporate finance High-yield debt Economy of Ghana Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Identity theft Public transport Payday loan Tertiary education fees in Australia
