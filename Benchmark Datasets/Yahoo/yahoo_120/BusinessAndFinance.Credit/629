updating incorrect income amount on a credit report so i recently got married and my wife mention to me that she only has one credit card with an limit and has been turned down for cards with a higher limit she makes a year has decent investments owns a k house and obviously pays cash for everything i took interest and because eventually we will buy something jointly and her score will effect the joint score so we ordered a credit report yes there was a years old debt that was listed as unpaid but as she has the reciepts and all to i'm working on getting that amended but i noticed that in income level it said she only makes which is a level she has not been at in years my first thought was that this gets updated when you generate new credit and such but she refinanced her house years ago so if that is something that doesn't update what possibly could so my question is how do you go about updating what the credit bureau thinks one makes thanks it all depends on what she fills out when she is applying for a credit card they will ask for an annual household income if it doesnt update its not a big deal credit is not based on income its based on payment history the problem is not the income its clearly the k in unpaid debt that is reporting once you clean that up time will heal all wounds Credit card Personal finance Credit score Debt Student loan Interest Taxation in the United States Social Security (United States) United Kingdom corporation tax Citigroup FairTax Bank fraud Tax Life insurance Mortgage Gross domestic product Surplus value Annuity Monetary policy Collateralized debt obligation Dividend Derivative (finance) Measures of national income and output Bond Debt consolidation Keynesian economics Labour economics Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Money Government debt Insurance Deflation (economics) Mergers and acquisitions Refinancing 401(k) Security (finance) Slot machine Flat tax Labor theory of value Betting (poker) Surveillance Primerica Financial Services Internet fraud Monopoly (game) Income trust Marshall Plan Productive and unproductive labour Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Minimum wage Microeconomics Corporate finance Schabir Shaik Trial Great Depression Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Municipal bond Inflation Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Donald Trump GunBound Octopus card Blackjack Capitalism Compensation of employees Economy of the United States Appeal Capital accumulation Child support Debt levels and flows High-yield debt Corporation President (game) Economic inequality Economy of Africa Kyoto Protocol Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act U.S. public debt Money supply Political subdivisions of New York State Supply and demand Food Stamp Program Finance Credit derivative Arthur Laffer Intellectual property Short selling Tax protester Cooperative Lottery CPU cache Unemployment benefit National Football League Social Credit PE ratio Gold standard Fixed income
