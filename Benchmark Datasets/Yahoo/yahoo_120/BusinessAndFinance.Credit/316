will this increase my credit score if i am added to my grandmother's jcpenny card that that is in good standing as a joint user will this increase my score i need a point increase in my score to get a home loan my goal is november i've already raised my score points this year i just need that next boost please help in short there isn't much you can do in such a short period of time to bring your score up to where you want it a couple of points though first do not get involved with your grandmothers jc penny card the best thing to do is keep your credit independent of another person unless you are married no joint accounts some people might also suggest getting another credit card this is a bad idea for a couple of reasons first just applying for the card will trigger a credit check on the part of the credit card company which will bring your score down a few points then if you don't actually get the card it stays down second if you get the card it could take a few weeks to get the card and many companies will not start reporting your score until you have a balance this could take a few months the fact that you have a revolving credit line with a balance no matter how small could potentially bring the score down the best thing you can do is tend to any bad debts you have on your account and pay down a few other debts even this though may not increase it enough by november it just depends on what is on your report you could also try a different lender some lenders require a minimum score to get the good rates which is what i assume you are trying to do but there are others that aren't as concerned about this the disadvantage here is that the rates are usually quite higher a score as low at is good enough for some lenders anything lower and you shouldn't even bother trying to buy a home here's what i suggest contact a broker and have them find a lender that will work with your current circumstances tell them you want a year arm adjustable rate mortgage this will get you the best rate for your score once you get the home your credit score will shoot up quite quickly months because mortgages score really well keep paying on time and after two years refinance on a year fixed this will not only secure you a lower rate but your equity earned through principal and appreciation would be enough that you could potentially walk away with cash in your pocket at closing in short lower payments and cash in your pocket such a sweet deal Student loan Bond Finance Insurance Bank Debt Predatory lending Credit score Monetary policy Deflation (economics) FairTax Personal finance Life insurance Microeconomics Interest Corporate finance Betting (poker) Poker jargon Mutual fund Primerica Financial Services Bretton Woods system Short selling Inflation Octopus card Gold standard Mortgage-backed security Debt consolidation Annuity Federal National Mortgage Association Mergers and acquisitions Security (finance) Capital accumulation Unemployment Collateralized debt obligation Economy of Russia Flat tax United Kingdom corporation tax Social Security (United States) Islamic banking Credit history Great Depression Debt levels and flows Social Security debate (United States) Arbitrage Schabir Shaik Trial Supply and demand Derivative (finance) Extreme Programming Temasek Holdings Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health insurance Gross domestic product Stock Yield curve Privatization Free trade Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Economic inequality Margin (finance) Economy of the United States Bank fraud Arthur Laffer Money Microcredit Economy of Chile 401(k) Electrophysiology Surveillance Real estate broker Ford Motor Company Double-entry book-keeping Money supply Refinancing Minimum wage Corporate governance GunBound Annual percentage rate Financial audit Internet fraud Donald Trump Rational pricing Plame affair Futures contract Divorce Ra (board game) Marshall Plan Economy of Pakistan
