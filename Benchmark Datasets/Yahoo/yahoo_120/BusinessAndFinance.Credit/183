how do credit cards work i want to know how a credit cards work i'm only years old but i just want to know how they work and i want to know how a debit cards work too hello roxy credit cards can be useful if you know how to play the game basically once you get a job and want to buy something on credit you fill out your st application use a cheat sheet with your info handy so all applications will show the same info the company extending you credit will want to see at least a month employment history at the same workplace etc so the st place you apply at is a fun clothing store and they give you a credit limit you might think wow time to shop sorry you need to buy items a max of and pay them off when the bill comes in no minimum payments of because if you don't pay off the full amount due you will be charged interest sometimes you do the math now your cool clothing is costing you more than you would have paid if you had just bought it with cash so now you're thinking you don't want to have credit cards and pay interest the key is to pay off the entire balance due every month if you do that they can't charge you interest and you get the benefit of building your credit the adult world revolves around your credit score you can't get a car or an apartment without a good one your credit score is based upon your payment history and the amount of money various creditors are willing to extend to you ok so you want to build your credit history properly after months of buying items from the fun clothing store and paying them off each month you call the fun clothing store and ask for a credit line increase you want available credit instead of they look at your payment history and usually grant your request anxious to charge you for interest which you will not be paying because you pay off your purchases each month in full so things are going well but you'd like to buy other things from other stores you need a big name credit card like a visa or mastercard you apply to them listing the fun clothing store as a creditor they check your payment history and now you've got a credit card that can be used virtually anywhere after months you ask for an increase in your credit limit and so on eventually creditors will send you offers on lesser interest rates and bonus incentives to use their card or when you want your st car you can wait until they offer interest oac on approved credit extended only to those with stellar credit reports now that you have a stellar credit history you can toss any credit offers that charge a yearly fee or a higher rate debit cards just take the money directly out of your bank account as if you were paying by cash this doesn't help you build your good credit report and there are often fees associated with each transaction ewww i hope i explained that well enough have a great day susan Octopus card Debit card Internet fraud Life insurance Mortgage Annuity Insurance EFTPOS Bond Auto insurance Student loan Surveillance Personal finance Debt Slot machine Credit card fraud Taxation in the United States Monetary policy MMORPG Tax Citigroup Primerica Financial Services Food Stamp Program Wal-Mart Islamic banking Poker jargon Electronic commerce Neopets Electronic money $ale of the Century FairTax Wheel of Fortune Corporation 401(k) Best Buy Arbitrage Bank fraud Social Security (United States) Double-entry book-keeping Money supply United Kingdom corporation tax Financial audit MetroCard Interest Filling station Stock Gold standard Mergers and acquisitions Gross domestic product Cheque Deflation (economics) Schabir Shaik Trial Craps Smart card Capitalism Toll road Economy of Russia Legal tender Betting (poker) Minimum wage Inflation Bretton Woods system MapleStory Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Oyster card Great Depression Online shop Social Credit United States Postal Service Advance fee fraud Identity theft Salary cap Corporate finance RFID Sears Holdings Corporation Estoppel Virgin Mobile Blackjack Immigration to the United States Variable universal life insurance Accountancy Driver's license Capital accumulation Enron Corporation Security (finance) Financial services Flat tax Anarchism and capitalism
