did boa send me the wrong card i applied for a boa visa platinum plus card and i've received it in the mail after many complicated issues just to get it approved however it doesn't say visa platinum plus the letter that came with it calls it a preferred visa the card is white with a red and blue bank of america 'flag' logo covering most of it and says bank of america in blue letters across the top it's a visa but is this the same visa platinum plus card that i applied for i don't see anything plus anywhere on the letter or card itself and it's not gray like the one online the background image is the same for whatever crazy reason what is this card exactly i remember reading something a while back in some of the boa fine print on the website or something that there is a rate for preferred card members and one for plus cardmembers with of course the plus seemingly getting the much better apr rates and such did i apply for a plus card and get bumped down to a preferred for some reason the credit analyst who approved it over the phone gave me a credit limit on it i've had a gold card for about years now which has a credit limit and zero balance recently paid off but the card was of course utilized very well and paid a lot over the time thus the increases since it started as a card i'm still wanting to try to consolidate the boa gold card credit line hopefully into this new one to get rid of that annual fee with the gold the analyst didn't want to give me much of a limit on the new card seemingly grudging that i already had the cl on the gold and planned to combine them at some point is this preferred visa a good card to have or just one of those average joe general credit cards with crappy rates promo apr through february closing statement the fine print states after the promo margin of percentage points this currently results in a corresponding apr i was approved over the phone directly by a credit analyst for a visa platinum plus and it looks like they've sent me a preferred plus seems to get better rates preferred seems to get crappy rates oh yeah and just so that it doesn't look like i'm getting another card just for getting it i am changing the gold card because of a annual fee that i'm sick of and don't want to call each year to get waived i would suggest a visit to your local boa office they should be able to answer all of your questions Credit card Plame affair Citigroup Octopus card Surveillance Internet fraud VISA (credit card) H-1B visa Microeconomics The Amazing Race Life insurance United States Postal Service Inflation Virgin Mobile Visa (document) Yu-Gi-Oh!
