i turned my mom in for fraud now i'm nervous what do i do maybe a year ago she order some credit cards in my name signed my signature maxed them out and wouldn't paid them back she ruined my credit so last night i sent the companies an email letting them know that i didn't do it and i wanted them investigated on who opened those accounts and i knew she did it their investigating it right now and it hit me that's a major crime and she did it but that's my mom and i love her i don't want her in jail can i get them to stop the investigation if not will they seriously put her in jail i hope so what kind of deadbeat steals from her own daughter and ruins her credit this will take you years to clear up quite honestly anyone who does this is a horrible person but it takes an especially awful one to do it to a loved one you should not feel bad she is an adult and did this to her own daughter please do not feel guilty you are the victim it is not your responsibility to clean up your mom's mess seriously it will take you years to clear this up and your credit will probably be messed up for a long long time you will be paying higher interest rates possibly getting turned down for jobs etc that being said it is very unlikely that she will go to jail even if they bother to book her which is extremely unlikely she will be out as soon as she is booked and stands before a judge to declare her guilt or innocence just so you know you need to file a police report if you expect this to be cleared up the companies are not going to release these debts on your word and they don't have investigators that do any leg work dave ramsey has very very harsh words for folks that would do this to a family member i tried not to use them above good luck Knots Landing Plame affair Internet fraud Theory of conduct Credit card Advance fee fraud 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Schabir Shaik Trial One Tree Hill (TV series) Leo Frank The Inside Charmed 2000 Australian Grand Prix 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Punisher Henry Lee Lucas Pitaten Time Out of Mind Shaggy dog story Capital punishment Ocean's Twelve Cindy Sheehan Neighbours Ashton-Tate Miscarriage of justice Sin City Sharon Tate Karl Rove Plame affair timeline Charles Ponzi Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Poker jargon Days of our Lives Investigations since the Fiji coup of 2000 Kurt Cobain Jonathan Wild Anti-Defamation League Collateral (film) Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Martha Stewart Wyatt Earp Jack Thompson James Hanratty Murder Phishing Tenshinhan Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) British national identity card Schapelle Corby Enron Corporation Bond Will & Grace Major League Baseball television contracts Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Trailer Park Boys Blonde on Blonde Volkert van der Graaf E-mail spam Saruman Dial M for Murder Yoko Ono Charles Manson Highway 61 Revisited Law & Order Phoebe Halliwell Delta Goodrem History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Presumption of innocence Timeline of the Enron scandal Futurama (TV series - season 5) Socrates The Death Gate Cycle Ethel and Julius Rosenberg Jon Secada Fraud Infantilism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Eddie Guerrero Rent (musical) Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty Blood on the Tracks Columbine High School massacre Fair Game (Scientology) Timeline of hacker history Rape Hip hop rivalries Sabra and Shatila massacre Diana Ross
