question about debt reduction credit counselors please read i'm about in debt currently my rating is somewhere between depending on the credit firm my question is that is it better to pay it all back now or make payments to my creditors not credit cards more like hospital bills payday loans old acocunts over a six month period which or what will help my rating rise quicker i'd like to get it by the spring is that possible i may follow up this depending on the answers thanks if the accounts in question your hospital bills payday loans and old accounts are in collection or charge off status it doesn't matter how you settle your debt you can either pay each bill in full or you can attempt to settle the accounts for less than what you owe either way paying off the negative accounts will not raise your score the only way to raise your score is to pay down your current debt to less than of what you can borrow and make on time payments having said that you can always negotiate to pay less than what you owe if it's signifigantly less than the original amount they might ask for it in a lump sum as oopposed to putting you on a payment plan so be prepared for that if they do say that they will accept less make sure you have them put it in writing then send your money and ask for a letter or a receipt stating that the balance is hang on to this for your records you might need to make a copy of that and send it to the credit bureaus in order to have them update the status of your accounts the accounts will not be removed until it's been years from the date of last delinquency but they can still update it to say paid collection or paid charge off i don't know if it's possible for your score to get into the s by spring but in order to raise your score here's my advice make on time payments with your current accounts it makes up of your score reduce your debt pay off or pay down some credit cards if you are carrying a large balance on them that will help apply for credit only as needed inquiries lower your score so only have people pull your report if you absolutely need it pulling your own report does not hurt your score i hope this helps you Credit card Mortgage Student loan Credit score Debt Bond Government debt Annuity Deflation (economics) United Kingdom corporation tax FairTax Social Security (United States) Taxation in the United States Bank Gold standard Bank fraud Article One of the United States Constitution Money Schabir Shaik Trial Bretton Woods system Euro Insurance U.S. public debt Predatory lending Primerica Financial Services Security (finance) Cheque History of the United States (1918-1945) Economy of Russia Economy of India Tom DeLay Monetary policy Internet fraud Child support Estoppel Microeconomics Legal tender 401(k) Debt levels and flows Islamic banking Economy of Chile Tax Derivative (finance) Economy of Pakistan Corporate finance Mutual fund Credit history Plame affair Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Corporation Social Credit Personal finance Mensal__o scandal Social Security debate (United States) Inflation Betting (poker) United States Postal Service Economy of the United States Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Money supply Payday loan Octopus card Short selling Ponzi scheme Marshall Plan Food Stamp Program Municipal bond Great Depression Arthur Laffer Debt consolidation Health insurance Advance fee fraud Timeline of the Enron scandal Deficit spending Developing countries' debt Financial services Air America-Gloria Wise loan controversy Usury Minimum wage EastEnders Refinancing Financial audit Divorce Kyoto Protocol Flat tax Arbitrage Unemployment Fiat money Federal Reserve Salary cap Mergers and acquisitions Economy of Romania
