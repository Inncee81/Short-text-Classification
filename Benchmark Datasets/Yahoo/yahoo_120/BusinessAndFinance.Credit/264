is this is a good move for me i applied for a credit card today with my bank they approved me with a spending limit of i'm going to use it basically as my debit instead just switch over funds when the montly payment come in and spot the interst percent due to student credit card anyways when my max limit reaches about say i want to buy a car completely on credit giving my taurus as a down payment then giving some cash and then rest on credit completely pay for it avoiding the high monthly payments and high interest rate then pay off my credit card at percent what do you think the only problem with what you are going to do is that you will exceed of your credit limit and this will cause your score to take a hit if this is not a concern then you should be fine auto finance is what i do for a living Bank Insurance Social Security (United States) Bond Toll road Mortgage Internet fraud Money Credit score FairTax Finance Inflation Taxation in the United States Bank fraud Debt Wachovia Citigroup Electronic money Monetary policy Financial services Bretton Woods system Cheque Auto insurance Public transport Education in the United States Surveillance U.S. public debt Economy of the United States SmartRider Corporate finance Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Life insurance Graduate school Primerica Financial Services Kyoto Protocol Collateralized debt obligation Interest Great Depression Annuity Article One of the United States Constitution Filling station Government debt History of the United States (1918-1945) United Kingdom corporation tax Campaign finance reform Gross domestic product United Overseas Bank Legal tender Capital accumulation Smart card Keynesian economics Grand Theft Auto (game) RFID Food Stamp Program Mergers and acquisitions Gold standard Mutual fund Islamic banking Economy of Africa Security (finance) Unemployment Schabir Shaik Trial Dividend Interac Social Credit Education in the People's Republic of China Derivative (finance) Child support Double-entry book-keeping Cerritos, California Predatory lending Slot machine Federal Reserve Deflation (economics) Credit history Credit card fraud History of post-Soviet Russia Dave Ramsey London Congestion Charge Octopus card National Insurance Deficit spending Tertiary education fees in Australia Oyster card Commodity markets Tax VISA (credit card) Payday loan International Monetary Fund Bank of America
