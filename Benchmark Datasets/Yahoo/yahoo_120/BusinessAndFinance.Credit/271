i am repairing my own credit but i need some pointers i have taken off the two adverse reports on my credit report however in l i had about different cards at that time i had closed all my accounts this looks bad how do i reverse that do i need to get all these credit card accounts off my report any ideas on how to establish credit now you should be able to remove items that are over years old if the date of closure predates today by seven years you can ask for the items to be removed and they should be make sure you explain that the closed accounts are hurting your credit scores i dont think they really are but if you say so positive entries are technically allowed indefinitely so you need to stress the negative effects of the accounts establish credit with a couple of credit cards try orchard bank or capital one you might be able to get a card that is not secured do not make the mistake many people make they charge an amount and pay it off every month that's not what creditors want to see they want to see you handle a balance over time so pay the account every month on time and pay more than the minimum due naturally make sure you pay everything else on time as well it took time to mess up your credit it takes time to fix it hang in there Credit card Bond United Kingdom corporation tax Financial audit Student loan Mutual fund Mortgage Bank Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Deflation (economics) Credit score Taxation in the United States Double-entry book-keeping Derivative (finance) Bretton Woods system Octopus card Social Security (United States) Personal finance Debt Credit history Blackjack Credit repair Interest Surveillance Commodity markets Internet fraud Debit card Poker jargon Betting (poker) Short selling Futures contract Arbitrage Schabir Shaik Trial Annuity Phishing Consensus decision-making Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Microeconomics Cheque Debt levels and flows Economy of Russia Bank fraud Corporation Identity theft Health insurance Capital accumulation Food Stamp Program Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind FairTax Wal-Mart Plame affair Wealth Contract bridge Estoppel Enron Corporation Money supply SmartRider Life insurance Gold standard Mainframe computer Money Islamic banking Certificate of deposit Citigroup Tom DeLay Article One of the United States Constitution Baccarat Euro Gold as an investment Corporate governance Solar variation Israeli West Bank barrier Accountancy Windows XP Graduate school Micropayment HSBC Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories National Football League National Insurance London Congestion Charge Education in the People's Republic of China Credit card fraud Video poker Trust (Law) USA Sears Holdings Corporation Cricket Unemployment Social Security debate (United States) Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Automatic teller machine Neopets E-ZPass 401(k) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Income statement Electricity meter RuneScape Economic inequality
