what should i ask for when settling a debt i recently received my annual bonus from work and i want to pay off one of my credit cards what should i ask to be reported on my credit record that will help improve my credit rating i have numerous missed payments and had gone over my limit since i could no longer pay my old debts but i want to start fresh and work on being responsible building good credit instead of being haunted by my college mistakes ok first let me add to the fact that i have not taken out a new line of credit in over years i haven't charged anything to my cards in the last months and my goal is to put the past behind me in the most favorable light so that i can get debt free and when i need credit to buy a car or house i can do so with out rates that leave me a slave to my creditors and if we can leave out bible references that would be great thanks just pay your bills things will work out Credit card Bond Credit score Debt Student loan Social Security (United States) Economy of Russia United Kingdom corporation tax Interest Bretton Woods system Money Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Annuity Economy of the United States Mortgage Personal finance Life insurance Government debt Deflation (economics) Credit history Monetary policy Tom DeLay Social Credit Insurance Corporation Ford Motor Company Unemployment Security (finance) Capitalism Microeconomics Credit derivative Great Depression Estoppel Article One of the United States Constitution Schabir Shaik Trial FairTax Economy of Pakistan Donald Trump Capital accumulation Auto insurance London Congestion Charge Debt consolidation Public transport Monopoly (game) Credit repair Islamic banking Athenian democracy Best Buy Minimum wage Primerica Financial Services Galactic Civilizations Wal-Mart Bank Babylonian law Slot machine Gross domestic product Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game History of the United States (1789-1849) Prostitution in Germany Fractional-reserve banking Collateralized debt obligation Internet fraud Cheque EastEnders Tax Salary cap Finance Anarchism and capitalism Credit default swap Taxation in the United States Insolvency Toll road Gold standard Wheel of Fortune Hillary Rodham Clinton Marcus Licinius Crassus History of the English Bible Credit card fraud Debt levels and flows Poker jargon Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Treasury security Economy of Bolivia Bankruptcy Heather Wilson History of the United States (1918-1945) Tennessee State Constitution Corporate finance Filling station National Football League History of the Jews in England Argentine debt restructuring Arthur Laffer Economy of Chile Prostitution Taxation in the Republic of Ireland America Online Financial services
