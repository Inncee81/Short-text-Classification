is fico partially to determine if you are a good customer aside from creditworthiness i have a suspicion that fico scores were designed not only to determine creditworthiness but to determine if you are a good customer that the credit card company will make money on in my example i have a history of opening cards using them once and cancelling them i do this to get off something or frequent flyer miles or other freebies my credit report is the size of a small novel a lot of times i do it to the same credit card company more than once however in the past decade i have never had a late payment or adverse report my credit report is the size of a russian novel but everything is clean my debt ratios are low because of this my credit score will probably never be above the mid s which isn't bad enough to make me stop my behavior but it pisses me off that i'm being dinged for stuff that has nothing to do with creditworhiness one factor is length of credit that is the longer you have credit lines open the better it looks for your score once you close a card out it no longer becomes a factor in your length of credit history so if you open a card use it once and close it you will have a very short credit age that is in scoring you are being treated like people who have only had an account open for a couple of months rather than a couple of decades it has nothing to do with if you are making them money or not if these cards do not have an anuual fee then there is no harm in keeping them open if you use them and just pay them off every month you still are not paying any extra in terms of interest or fees and it would help your score even more the mid 's are good and you are in a pretty good position to get the top rates available from the myfico com site here are the breakdowns in percentage of the population for each score to Credit score Credit card Insurance Mortgage Bank Student loan Credit history Yield curve Mutual fund Bond Poker jargon Arbitrage United Kingdom corporation tax Blackjack Predatory lending Internet fraud Deflation (economics) Microeconomics Futures contract Economy of Russia Short selling Credit rating agency Credit card fraud Life insurance Divorce FairTax Monetary policy Financial services Social Security (United States) PE ratio Currency EFTPOS Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Betting (poker) Corporate finance Floppy disk Micropayment Annuity Credit repair America Online Inflation Bretton Woods system Capital accumulation Interest Islamic banking Taxation in the United States Sea level rise Neopets Citigroup Gold standard Gambling Primerica Financial Services Frequent flyer program Social Security debate (United States) Prisoner's dilemma Derivative (finance) Economy of Pakistan Government debt Dog agility Personal finance Intelligence quotient Schabir Shaik Trial Normal distribution Public good Loyalty program Public-key cryptography Contract bridge Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Unemployment Estoppel Auto insurance Extreme Programming Famine Wal-Mart Norway national football team Phishing Tesco Gross domestic product Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code Dorama Capitalism Credit default swap Fast bowling United Airlines Gas metal arc welding History of the United States (1918-1945) Public transport Euro BC Rail Supply and demand Cable television Baseball Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Northwest Airlines
