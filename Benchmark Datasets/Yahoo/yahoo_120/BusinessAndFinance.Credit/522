refiance a car my husband and i bought a minivan yrs ago we were going thru a hard time at that point in our lives but we needed a bigger car our interest rate is like when i look at the statements it says we still owe around does it make sense to refinance yrs into the car i love my minvan and we i really hate how much interst we are paying our credit has definatley gotten better over the last yrs so i need some real advice on what to do thanks the biggest reason not to refi is that the majority of what you pay on the first part of the loan is interest meaning you are just now starting to pay off the car if you refinance you will spend the next or years paying interest until you start paying the principal again nisha is right suck it up and just keep making the payments get a loan amortization schedule if you want to know more bankrate com Mortgage Collateralized mortgage obligation Government National Mortgage Association Student loan Bond Interest Money Annual percentage rate Islamic banking Deflation (economics) United Kingdom corporation tax Mortgage-backed security Credit card Amortization (business) Debt Microeconomics Primerica Financial Services Municipal bond Hyperinflation Refinancing Annuity Bank Government debt Life insurance Estoppel Capital accumulation Great Depression Credit score Monetary policy Dividend Gold standard Economy of Pakistan Personal finance Schabir Shaik Trial Mutual fund Savings and loan association Islamic economics Stock Knots Landing History of the United States (1918-1945) Predatory lending Interest rate Bretton Woods system EastEnders Ludlow massacre Surplus value Gross domestic product Debt consolidation Usury Economy of the United States Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Short selling Auto insurance Derivative (finance) Taxation in the United States 401(k) Marshall Plan Asian financial crisis Finance Anarchism and capitalism Social Security (United States) Summa Theologiae Collateralized debt obligation FairTax Capitalism Social Credit Security (finance) Leasing Measures of national income and output Economy of Russia Money supply Donald Trump Women's Tennis Association Credit derivative Real estate bubble Lend-Lease Assignment (law) MLB on FOX Salary cap Corporation High-yield debt Compensation of employees U.S. public debt Developing countries' debt Campaign finance reform Microcredit Grand Theft Auto (game) Tariff Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Reparations for slavery Craps Ocean's Twelve Commodity markets Treasury security Education in Germany Inflation Consumer finance Contract
