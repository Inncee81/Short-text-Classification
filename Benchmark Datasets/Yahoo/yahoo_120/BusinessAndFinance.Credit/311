join parent's credit card get their credit score i heard if i join say my dad's credit card i get his credit score and his credit limit how exactly does this work and once i get his score and credit limit that becomes my current score and i can build on that this is how it works when you open a line of credit you get what is called a trade line on your credit report you can have good trade lines and bad trade lines the credit bureaus look at the number of trades lines payment history and balances and they give you a score if you pay your bills on time and you don't have high balances you will have a better score than someone who maxes out their credit cards and pays late all the time if you dad adds you as an authorized signer on his credit card you will get a trade line on your credit report you will not get his score because he probably has many trade lines that make up his score and you will only have one there is a benefit to him doing this for you though it will help you to establish credit sometimes if you don't have any credit banks won't give you loans or you won't be able to get a credit card etc this is a good way to give your credit a boost Credit score Credit card Interest Student loan Credit history Gold standard Credit union Contract bridge Bond United Kingdom corporation tax Deflation (economics) Money Bretton Woods system Bank fraud Bank Monetary policy Citigroup Betting (poker) Poker jargon Debt consolidation New York Knicks HSBC Mortgage Gross domestic product Ra (board game) History of the United States (1918-1945) Legal tender Hearts (game) Article One of the United States Constitution Octopus card Food Stamp Program Baccarat Economy of Chile Draw poker Great Depression Collateralized debt obligation Buffalo Bills Debit card Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Detroit Tigers Bank of China (Hong Kong) Sheepshead National Insurance Government debt Primerica Financial Services Surveillance Minimum wage Debt Micropayment Refinancing Identity theft Social Credit Craps Fiat money Social Security (United States) Corporate finance Security (finance) Credit card fraud Super Bowl XXVII Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME History of the United States (1789-1849) Double-entry book-keeping Kyoto Protocol Short selling Dominoes Smart card Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 Marshall Plan Internet fraud Grade (education) Personal finance Cribbage Donald Trump Anarchist economics Commodity markets Cheque New York Giants The Football League Irish Life and Permanent London Congestion Charge Child support Slot machine Dad's Army Derivative (finance) Wachovia Topps Payday loan Journey (band) Monday Night Football Annuity Piquet Health insurance Balance of trade Economy of the United States Cleveland Browns Billboard Hot 100 Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Stud poker Economic history of Spain
