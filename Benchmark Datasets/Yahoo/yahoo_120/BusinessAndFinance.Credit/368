should payday loan stores be made illegal in all states only july the state of oregon passed laws forcing these payday loan companies to treat customers fairly and not charge outrageous interest of or more most of the stores left the state should the rest of the nation shut down these folks for being legalized loan sharks or is it up to the borrower to decide where they want to get money from these companies are predatory in practice by charging such exorbatant rates they claim that they need such overcharges to sustain there business due to the amount of default loans which they sustain however for people with bad credit in an emergency between paydays who live paycheck to paycheck and who have no alternative to get a short term loan these companies can be there only hope for help yet sadly depite the intentions of their customers most end up getting in even worse financial difficulties when the time to pay up is due so in my estimation it's a no win for both sides if we shut them down the solution i'm not sure ideas better regulation and control of the fees and on the customer end allowing loans only periodically and having an out situation available to those that default Predatory lending Usury Insurance Payday loan Student loan Mortgage Citigroup Credit card Islamic banking Interest United Kingdom corporation tax Short selling Deflation (economics) Islamic economics Microcredit Wal-Mart Health insurance Social Security (United States) Corporation Money Mutual fund 401(k) Life insurance Primerica Financial Services Annuity Savings and Loan crisis Monetary policy Gold standard Security (finance) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Capitalism Bretton Woods system Government debt Savings and loan association Capital accumulation Interest rate Corporate finance Bond Education in the United States Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act Health care in the United States Fractional-reserve banking Stock Monopoly Contract E-mail spam Finance Tennessee State Constitution Privatization Federal Reserve Derivative (finance) History of the United States (1918-1945) Education in the People's Republic of China Unemployment Annual percentage rate Economy of Russia Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002) Asian financial crisis Arbitrage Economy of the United States Microeconomics Babylonian law Cooperative Real estate broker Lloyd's of London Repurchase agreement Financial markets Government National Mortgage Association Common criticisms of Microsoft Taxation in the United States Trust (Law) USA Money supply Developing countries' debt Ponzi scheme Bank fraud Airbus Consumer finance Conspiracy Leasing Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Yield curve ACORN Natural monopoly Apple Computer Investment bank April 2005 in Canada FairTax Small business Top-up fees Mergers and acquisitions Economic history of the United States Copyleft Credit union
