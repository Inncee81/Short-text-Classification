thoughts on betman i've been known to bad mouth betman i admit that i even started a conspiracy theory that the nba's stern sent betman to destroy the nhl in the s however as things currently stand we have the following example nfl has serious player conduct issues with pacman jones and michael vick leading regular news headlines not just the sports ex mlb has a steroid pumped up head about to blow past hank aaron in the record books and likely bonds will be admitted to alcatraz prior to cooperstown ex nba has a ref admittedly on the take for gambling problems 'nuf said about that the biggest off season nhl issue was a bachelor party gone askew in minnesota compared to a previous football boat cruise in that state this sounds like nothing does this change anyone's mind on how betman is doing any thoughts are welcome personal conduct in two cases the commissioner had nothing to do with it now with mlb selig knew it was going on and didn't care because the hrs were bringing fans in although i think it really gets under people's skin that bonds has more gold gloves then aaron with the nfl goodell is starting his second year as commish and inherited the problems he is taking care of them as well now bettman has done nothing special to prevent these types of things from happening in the nhl instead he has been accused of sabatoging sales of teams come on this is the commish over a player or ref this is the head himself i'm refering to the penguins and predators and the basically blacklisting basille i'm not saying that i care i already said hey a commish has that right for the simple fact that he represents the owners the owners pick who gets to buy the team thing is the preds ended up being bought for less then basillie was offering 2004-05 NHL lockout Major League Baseball National Football League Salary cap Barry Bonds Playoff Major League Baseball television contracts National Hockey League Los Angeles Clippers 1957 World Series Wayne Gretzky Los Angeles Kings Michael Vick Carolina Panthers Mario Lemieux Boston Bruins Bud Selig World Series Minnesota Vikings St. Louis Rams EA Sports New York Giants National Basketball Association Dallas Cowboys New York Jets Toronto Raptors Michael Jordan San Antonio Spurs Pete Rose Boston Red Sox Atlanta Braves Draft (sports) Kansas City Chiefs Orlando Magic Las Vegas metropolitan area Gary Bettman Detroit Red Wings Major professional sports league Arizona State University National Hockey League All-Star Game Pittsburgh Penguins American Football League February 2005 in sports Major League Baseball All-Star Game Oakland Raiders Home run Jacksonville Jaguars Memphis Grizzlies Washington Redskins Madden NFL 1994 baseball strike Cleveland Browns Montr__al Expos November 2004 in sports New York Knicks Chicago Cubs October 2005 in sports 1992-93 NHL season San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl XXVII Washington Nationals NBA Finals Reserve clause Baltimore Ravens Oakland Athletics September 2005 in sports New York Yankees Negro league baseball July 2004 in sports Super Bowl XXIV Monday Night Football Florida State University MLB on FOX Chicago White Sox University of Iowa June 2004 in sports Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 2005 NFL season Terrell Owens Indianapolis 500 Ty Cobb Oakland Seals Super Bowl Exhibition game Time Out of Mind New Orleans Saints
