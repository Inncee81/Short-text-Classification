philadelphia flyers playoff contenders seems like they are to me now sure last year they sucked but that's last year they did a really good job in the off season i think they'll be a playoff contender do you they sure will make the playoffs you can't ignore what homer has done to change the team around i think they will make it into the playoffs easily however i dont think they are going to be a high seed it all depends how well the new players adapt with each others playing style i think their chemistry will be good now i dont think they will make it to the finals they still have areas to improve on but you still have to remember that they are in a rebuilding process its still going to be amazing how well they will bounce back from their worst season in franchise history though and the person who said the flyers have to contend with the isles and the devils is a moron both teams had a terrible offseason also by saying they rebuilt the team the wrong way through trades and not by prospects is wrong most of the players aquired through these trades are still very young and not to mention a very good prospect was aquired with ryan parent also you can't forget they have claude giroux and steve downie moving up fast through the system who will be huge players for the team with all that being said the next few years will be exciting to watch the flyers and they will be playoff contenders for years to come Philadelphia Flyers Los Angeles Kings Qu__bec Nordiques Orlando Magic New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Chicago Bulls Pittsburgh Steelers New England Patriots Utah Jazz St. Louis Rams New Jersey Nets Toronto Raptors Los Angeles Clippers Pittsburgh Penguins Detroit Red Wings Oakland Athletics World Series Seattle Mariners Cleveland Browns St. Louis Blues (hockey) National Hockey League rivalries Houston Rockets New Jersey Devils Vancouver Canucks Playoff Minnesota Timberwolves Florida Marlins Miami Dolphins Phoenix Suns Ottawa Senators Boston Bruins Washington Capitals San Francisco Giants New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets San Francisco 49ers Chicago Blackhawks 2002-03 NHL season Edmonton Oilers Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim San Antonio Spurs National Football League National Basketball Association Montreal Canadiens Florida Panthers Buffalo Sabres Toronto Maple Leafs Cleveland Indians Los Angeles Dodgers Chicago Cubs Baltimore Ravens Atlanta Flames Calgary Flames 1957 World Series Tampa Bay Lightning Steve Nash Boston Red Sox Carolina Panthers Canterbury Bulldogs Philadelphia Phillies Toronto Blue Jays Cleveland Cavaliers Atlanta Hawks Buffalo Bills Chicago White Sox New York Yankees Montr__al Expos Sammy Sosa Blazers/Cowboys (WHA) Super Bowl XXVII New York Mets San Jose Sharks New York Americans Arizona Diamondbacks Minnesota Vikings Leicester City F.C.
