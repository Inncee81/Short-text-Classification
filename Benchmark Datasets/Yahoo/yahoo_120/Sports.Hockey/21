a comparison of hockey eras here's why hockey is one of the best sports could wayne gretzky excel today would alexander ovechkin be the dominant goal scorer he is if he played alongside howie morenz how about the red wings' production line if steve yzerman was the center woul dit still be well productive the gist of my question is this how would stars and legends have performed in different eras of the nhl yes it is nearly impossible to make comparisons like that or is it we can dream can't we well snoop i don't think many of today's players could have played in the original six league there were ahl and senior teams better than at least half the nhl teams we have today and let's not forget in those days they wore less equipment than they do today i think half the europeans in the league would pack their bags and go home after a shift against any of the great lines of the s s and s put today's equipment on jacques plante and his gaa drops a full half goal do you really think jagr would line up against richard lach and blake without his helmet and visor not more than once would hasek face bobby hull's or bernie geoffrion's slapshot without a mask not a chance look at the numbers the entire nhl had players in those years today there are over players in the big league that means expanding from then to now in one swoop each team would get genuine big leaguers and come to think of it that's pretty close to what there is good players per team granted there are some players today that could have played in the original six league but not many no sir not many at all Los Angeles Kings Hart Memorial Trophy Washington Capitals Art Ross Memorial Trophy Ice hockey Boston Bruins 2004-05 NHL lockout Wayne Gretzky 1992-93 NHL season Buffalo Sabres St. Louis Blues (hockey) National Hockey League Bernie Geoffrion Chicago Blackhawks Mario Lemieux New York Rangers Steve Yzerman Pittsburgh Penguins Jarom__r J__gr World Hockey Association NHL series Toronto Maple Leafs Philadelphia Flyers Phoenix Coyotes Alexander Ovechkin Calgary Flames Bobby Hull 1987-88 NHL season Edmonton Oilers Baseball Gordie Howe Stanley Cup Goaltender Mighty Ducks of Anaheim Goal (ice hockey) Ontario Hockey League Phil Esposito Sidney Crosby Brett Hull New York Islanders Tampa Bay Lightning 2003-04 NHL season Norway national football team 1959-60 NHL season Jacques Plante Carolina Hurricanes Vancouver Canucks Maurice Richard Mark Messier Winnipeg Jets Jari Kurri Vezina Trophy Captain (ice hockey) Lady Byng Memorial Trophy Hartford Whalers Ottawa Senators Playoff 50 goals in 50 games Playoff format Calder Memorial Trophy 2002-03 NHL season Michael Jordan National Football League Raymond Bourque 1985-86 NHL season Dominik Ha__ek Springfield Falcons Conn Smythe Trophy Blazers/Cowboys (WHA) New York Giants 1983 NHL Entry Draft The Mighty Ducks (movies) Mike Bossy San Francisco 49ers Alex Ferguson NHL Entry Draft NBA Finals Pavel Datsyuk Rugby league Bobby Orr Roller hockey Cam Neely Springfield Indians American football 2005-06 NHL season Miracle on Ice Don Cherry (hockey) Pittsburgh Steelers Western Canada Hockey League American Hockey League
