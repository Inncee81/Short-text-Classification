does anyone know who k eptok is in sidney crosby's gatorade commercial i have reason to believe that k eptok could be lemieux gretzky or saku koivu lemieux or gretzky possibly because he had always looked up to them as a kid it may also be lemieux because it looks a lot like him and lemieux has been helping sidney in the nhl koivu because he does wear the number on his jersey for the montreal canadiens koivu was also one of crosby's favorite players as a kid people also believe that k eptok could translate into keep talking which could suggest that he may symbolize ovechkin who was crosby's matchup in their rookie seasons some people also believe that it could be kasparaitis because he did attempt to intimidate crosby in his first year it may also be kovalchuk who also attempted to intimidate crosby i know the commercial you're talking about the one where everyone throws there sticks into the middle during a game of street hockey he isn't actually anyone he may represent someone else i was always thinking of ovechkin but the russian guy was tall and scary but around the time of the commercial it was ovechkin who was considered crosby's biggest rival for the calder and there was debate over who was better so my answer is technically its no one but symbolically it might be ovechkin Mario Lemieux Montreal Canadiens Sidney Crosby Alexander Ovechkin Pittsburgh Penguins Wayne Gretzky Saku Koivu Los Angeles Kings New York Rangers National Hockey League Washington Capitals 2004-05 NHL lockout Art Ross Memorial Trophy 1992-93 NHL season Edmonton Oilers Toronto Maple Leafs Maurice Richard Chicago Blackhawks 50 goals in 50 games Carolina Hurricanes NHL Entry Draft 1987-88 NHL season Boston Bruins Conn Smythe Trophy Calder Memorial Trophy 1988-89 NHL season 1985-86 NHL season Stanley Cup Hart Memorial Trophy Guy Lafleur Philadelphia Flyers Detroit Red Wings New York Giants Ottawa Senators Mats N__slund New Jersey Devils New York Islanders Buffalo Sabres Calgary Flames Overtime (ice hockey) 2003-04 NHL season Jarom__r J__gr Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy Peter ____astn__ National Hockey League All-Star Game 2004 World Cup of Hockey Captain (ice hockey) Trevor Linden Atlanta Thrashers San Jose Sharks NHL Plus/Minus Award Qu__bec Nordiques Jim Dowd (hockey player) National Hockey League rivalries Goal (ice hockey) Quebec Major Junior Hockey League Gordie Howe Steve Yzerman Western Canada Hockey League Hamilton Tigers Yao Ming Hockey Night in Canada October 2005 in sports 1924-25 NHL season Cam Neely Miracle on Ice Gilbert Perreault Newsy Lalonde Patrick Roy St. Louis Blues (hockey) Doug Gilmour Violence in ice hockey 1987 Canada Cup Ice hockey Colorado Avalanche Lady Byng Memorial Trophy Bernie Geoffrion Bobby Orr NHL series Cleveland Browns Florida Panthers New York Yankees Poker jargon Ed Belfour Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Joe Nieuwendyk Hockey Hall of Fame Super Bowl XXV Jari Kurri Dany Heatley National Basketball Association 1983 NHL Entry Draft World Hockey Association Pierre Dagenais
