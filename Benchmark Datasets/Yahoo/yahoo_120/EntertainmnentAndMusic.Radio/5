does anyone know the codeword of the day for radio disney today thanks radio disney codeword being very familiar with radio promotions the whole point of a word artist code song of the day contest is to keep people listening for as long as possible so the actual time will vary from day to day or the point would be lost so to speak that's their goal to keep you listening so the word artist code song won't be advertised in advance although some stations will tease with an approximate time be sure to listen tomorrow between when billy bob will announce the word artist code song of the day you'll just have to keep listening which is what they want you to do important for another contestant to give you the info would potentially hurt them in the contest so take with a grain of salt and be very careful of any answers given here that would seem to actually answer your question accurately i have seen fake false and misleading answers on these contests posted here there might be a nice guy or two who will answer honestly but then again good luck a guy named duh I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Jeopardy!
