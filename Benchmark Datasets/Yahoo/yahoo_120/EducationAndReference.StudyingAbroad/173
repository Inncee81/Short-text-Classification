male au pair im a guy and i want to au pair abroad after college or part i have heard mixed answers most places say yes but im curious as to if guys can aupair part does anyone have any companies they suggest or places they think would be cool i was thinking probably paris france part logically there is absolutely no reason why a guy couldn't aupair in reality many societies would automatically view with suspicion a man's desire to spend his every moment with small children i'm not quite sure why male grade school teachers aren't subjected to such thinking so much or perhaps they are maybe that's why you find more male teachers in high school i know its unfair and unjustified but sometimes it just is what it is part you certainly need to go some place where you can speak the language fluently extremely fluent i'm sure you would be expected to speak to the children in their own native language as if it were your own as well as teaching them some english at the same time and its conceivable that your language ability would need to be such that you could comfortably handle routine doctor visits or an emergency of any kind situations where you definitely wouldn't want to be struggling with the language at all lastly and with a back reference to part perhaps a society with less stereotyped and less biased thinking than our own a society that actually trusts men this may be less about finding the right society and more about finding the right family good luck to you Teaching English as a Foreign Language Education in South Korea American and British English differences College Foreign language Contemporary culture of South Korea Graduate school Multilingual Constitution of Ireland English language Ethnic issues in Japan Kim Jong-il Professor Hanja Seok, Prince of Korea Chinese character Pitaten Education in Portugal Demographics of Japan BoA BASIC programming language Esperanto Tone (linguistics) Finnish language MapleStory Irish language Great Teacher Onizuka Korean language Engrish Homemaker Writing system Football World Cup 2002 Quebec French Japan Self-Defense Forces Language education Hawaii Ranma __ characters History of Korea (1900___1950) M__ori language Brian Jones (musician) Constitution Languages of the European Union Jeonju Education in the People's Republic of China German language Hillary Rodham Clinton Gyeongju Hong Kong English Sea of Japan naming dispute Rosa Parks Yasukuni Shrine High school Names of Korea Names given to the Spanish language Education in the United States Culture of the United States Culture Iloilo City Gender-neutral language Cantonese (linguistics) Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction Filipino American Secondary education in Japan Prolog Nichiren Shoshu British English Hebrew language Moe Berg Chinese written language Magical DoReMi Avenue Q Korea Angel Amish Education in Taiwan French people Non-native pronunciations of English Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Chinese language Buddhism Translation Chinese University of Hong Kong Classical Chinese Ashoka Languages of Hong Kong Yayoi Language Separation of church and state Auslan Inuit language Religion in Japan Bilingual education UN Security Council Resolution 242 Names of God in Judaism Vowel Phoneme Heber C.
