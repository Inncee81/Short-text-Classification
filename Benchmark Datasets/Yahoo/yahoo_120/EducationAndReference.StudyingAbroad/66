what's your advice to a us student studying abroad in ireland i will be studying at the university of limmerick this coming spring i was wondering what type of advice anyone had about study abroad or ireland in general good advice would be apreciated good for you for studying abroad it's been ten years now since i spent my junior year in england and it's still among the most amazing experiences of my life some things i wish i'd known before i went find out as much as you can about the u of limerick before you go the english uni system is quite different from american colleges don't know if irish unis are comparable my entire grade for the year was based on one final exam all papers homework etc was entirely optional lots of rote learning and memorization as opposed to my home school's emphasis on deep thinking and creativity took a lot of self discipline and if you happen to be someone who stinks at tests well tough noogies to you just a totally different idea over there of what learning and teaching are all about i'm not saying these things will be true at limerick but i think i had no idea that a learning institution could be so fundamentally different make travel and learning new things your top priorities while there i'm all for studying hard but you can also do that here at home study abroad is a once in a lifetime chance be willing to forgo some of the school stuff for opportunities to grow culturally before i left someone gave me this great advice try not to let money stop you from doing things while over there do however let it stop you from buying things while there navigating limited funds while overseas can be tricky but this advice really helped me keep my priorities straight did i really want to spend my cash on eating out or did i want to save it for some opportunity that i would never have at home and when the occasional chance to splurge came along say those front row seats to the royal shakespeare theatre i gave myself rare permission to use my credit card knowing i would rather work a bit harder later to pay it off than to have missed out on something that special live like a native as much as possible some study abroad programs allow you to cushion yourself in pretty amazing ways from the culture you're actually there to experience special american classes host families guided tours these can keep you away from the very things to came to see hang out with irish people as much as you can refuse to eat at mcdonald's and pizza hut strike out on your own for travel and be willing to get lost a little embrace the chance to be as irish as you can for a short time invest in a quality guidebook or two for every country you plan to visit i am a huge fan of rick steves who teaches smart travel skills as opposed to simply telling you which sites to visit his website www ricksteves com is a wealth of useful information he also teaches you how to be a smart open minded traveller as opposed to an ugly american tourist check him out lonely planet is good too know that culture shock is normal expect that it will happen do some web searches for culture shock symptoms and be prepared for it to manifest itself in ways you may not anticipate it gets easier come back to the u s as a wiser person i think that one of the neatest parts of studying abroad is returning home america will seem both very familiar and totally strange after you've been away relish the chance to re examine that which you've always considered the norm your own personal status quo have a great time bon voyage GED Literature Graduate school Education in Romania Japanese literature C.
