people to people student ambassador program i've been invited and i was wondering how much you trip was did you like it how you raised the money was it worth it and what did you pack and where you went also what was the meeting like and what questions did they ask i went to australia and new zealand in back then i think it was about once you get there the only thing you'll pay for is your gifts you want to buy i raised money by asking people around the community to donate and i also had a fundraising dinner we invited everyone we knew and put it in the paper we made ham potatoes green beans pie junk like that we made quite a bit with that it was completely worth it the best experience of my life i would do it all over again in a heartbeat if i could what you pack all depends on where you're going and the climate i know i had to bring fairly warm clothes because in new zealand at night it got pretty chilly the meetings were fine it was a great time to start to get to know the people you're going to travel with they just ask you general ice breaking questions to try to get to know you better good luck New York University School of Medicine New York University McGill University New York-Presbyterian Hospital University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine McGill University Health Centre Medicine Stroke Hospital Antonio Damasio Physical therapy Colin McLeod McGill (Montreal Metro) Florida State University Wilder Penfield University of Coimbra Primidone Traumatic brain injury Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons Migraine Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeir__o Preto Epilepsy Stern School of Business Psychiatry Neurology Combat stress reaction Multiple sclerosis Virus Persistent vegetative state Children's hospital Chiropractic Modern Iranian scientists and engineers Viktor Frankl Anti-psychiatry Roger Bannister Adult attention-deficit disorder Texas Medical Center Vigabatrin National Institutes of Health Pennsylvania Hospital University of Szeged The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Autism Victor Horsley New York University College of Arts and Science Stevens Institute of Technology Tourette syndrome Terri Schiavo Tisch School of the Arts John Wilson McConnell William E.
