if yahoo split yahoo answers into two systems which one would you use the first system would be a knowledge board with no points system voting or ratings just an honest opportunity to share information and exchange ideas the second system would be relatively the same thing it is now a place where you can go to play and win points and kill time if you could sit down with the executive in charge of ya serving as the voice of the community and give him your list of improvements to the system things that are either needed to help it survive or that would make it better for everyone what would you put on that list yahoo has made it clear that they think the only way they can get people to participate on this system is by use of the points system would the removal of the point system encourage you to use ya more or make you want to give it up altogether if one of yahoo s competitors had a similar system in place would you jump ship to see if they could do it better or would you remain loyal to yahoo regardless a part of me wants to say it would be the points free system i get annoyed reading answers that give no information at all some of which even explicitly state that the purpose of posting is to get two points the points do not carry any real world value rendering them silly in many ways and i suspect the seriousness of the answers would increase without the points system in place despite all this though i would probably give more time to the points providing environment as silly as the points are i have to admit that there are times i answer a few more questions specifically to earn more points moreover i was excited to reach level and i actually did a bit of a dance in my rolling swivel chair when i saw that i had reached top contributor status i still have no idea how that is determined and reading y a's explanation provided almost negative value in terms of guidance but that is another issue for another day though i was alone in my office and therefore allowed no witnesses in the end i enjoy the variety of responses that come through here and the points system however silly encourages more people to contribute in more ways i would visit both but i suspect i would spend the bulk of my answering and answer reading time on the points based system as for the loyalty issue i would probably check out a competitor's system but i like it here and i doubt i would abandon this system Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Scientology beliefs and practices CPU cache United States House of Representatives United States Postal Service Expert system Strategic management Internet troll Democracy Microeconomics Plame affair Poker jargon Single Transferable Vote Modem Quantum computer Dog agility G__del's incompleteness theorem Cultural Revolution Capitalism Socrates Surveillance Religious Society of Friends Logic Central processing unit Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change GED Guns, Germs, and Steel Meaning of life CPU design Donald Rumsfeld Flat tax Reach for the Top Contract bridge Extreme Programming United States Senate Phase-shift keying Theory of conduct Corporate governance Wealth Information Services Procurement Library Playoff Global Positioning System ELO rating system $ale of the Century Kasparov versus The World Franz Boas Economics Education in the United States Domain Name System Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Baseball Google Lincoln-Douglas Debate Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe The Internet Movie Database Open Directory Project Objective-C RISC Aerial (dance move) Wheel of Fortune Margaret Thatcher Quizbowl Past teachings of Prem Rawat Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Capital punishment Redundant array of independent disks Nuclear proliferation Search engine optimization Teach the Controversy Cheating in Counter-Strike Theodicy No Child Left Behind Act B3ta Minimum wage Unlawful combatant Probation officer Public domain George W.
