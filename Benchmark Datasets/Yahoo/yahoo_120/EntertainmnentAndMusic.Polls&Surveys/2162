what should i do ahhhhhhhh ok so my gf wants to get breast and i dont want her to cuz shes only and of course i allready know with whos money i do have the money but i was saving it for a house cuz im not all about loans and i dont really think she needs them and yea i know what some ppl are gonna say hey man what dude doesn't want his girl to have bigger boobs but its not like that i wiould be willing to throw down bets on the point that she will defintely regret doing it and if she has them done shes also gonna lose her job cuz she allready used up all her days off but i cant just seem to get it through her head thats shes totally hot just the way she is i mean im ' and weigh lbs yea i know bmi says overweight blah blah so if anyone should be thinking more about there body it should be me and truthfully im running out of nice ways to tell her to shut the f ck up i realize its her choice and hers only but theres much better ways for her to spend money like getting our own place why do you have to pay for it she is your girlfriend not your wife ok so lets say you pay for them and for some weird reasons destiny makes you part different ways she will make some other man happy with something you paid because it is not like if you break up you can ask for those back i don't want to be mean but hey if she wants them she has to pay for it Little Britain Craps Avenue Q Jon Secada Hey Arnold!
