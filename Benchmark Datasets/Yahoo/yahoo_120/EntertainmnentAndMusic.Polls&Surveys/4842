do you have a quiet place that you enjoy going for me there is big parks that is located just across my house and i enjoy bringing my backpack along and sit quietly reading my book listening to radio silent reflection and pause a moment to watch the greenery or people jogging its really nice that is wonderful i don't have any place to go that is quiet sometimes i go to the park but of course it is very loud from the children playing but i still like to go there and sit on a swigging chair near the river anywhere near the water is fine with me Shaggy dog story Hiking The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe John Cage Apollo 11 Gramophone record Kerikeri Love and Theft Treehouse of Horror V Ocean's Twelve Avenue Q All Quiet on the Western Front Richard Rahl WNNX (FM) Roxette Backpacking (wilderness) Louis Armstrong Milton H.
