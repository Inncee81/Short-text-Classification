why is it that i ask all the cows here a question and only felines answer is it the milk factor http answers yahoo com question index ylt auatukynryp vkj xts vvsy ix qid aajcohf here is the only true and complete explanation you failed to ask a mooooving question and cows will not answer anything that does not mooove them cows have herd mentality they won't stray far from the herd for safety reasons most cows are dumber than sticks and thats why you can't teach them to do tricks they will only moooove when the herd mooooves and of course if you asked them a question if you wrote it they cannot read it they have to have heard it if they have not heard it then they will not answer it now this is where the felines come in cats are usually very very independent and they are smart they learn very early that they can depend on their paws what their paws tell them they are sensitive to their paws tell them to pay attention to there nose and everyone knows that a cat loves milk and their nose tells them that when cows are involved so is milk and when milk is involved they are so eager to lap it up that sometimes they will even get their paws into it they read everything they can to find out all the nuese they can and if in in fact you listen for the mews it would not be news to you that all the answers to questions asked of cows will be read by felines because the felines read between the lines and since they are so smart they know instantly that by reading between the lines there is milk involved and it would be natural for them to try to milk as much as they can from the situation so come on if you ask a cow a question a cat is going to answer it its as simple as that so next time you ask a cow a question make it a moooving question oh and ask it in arabic cats hate camels milk Dairy Cat Joke Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Little Britain Plame affair Livestock Expert system Shaggy dog story Philosophy of language Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Cattle Kevin and Kell Russian joke Milk Scientology beliefs and practices Tobacco smoking John Titor Garfield Extreme Programming Felis sapiens Radio Yerevan Elephant GED Philosophical skepticism Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Seinfeld CPU cache Palindrome Cro Border Collie Homer Simpson Western Sahara Guns, Germs, and Steel Weather lore God Emperor of Dune Azumanga Daioh Scientific method Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Cryptanalysis Singlish Dyslexia Avenue Q Breath of Fire III Rent (musical) Bullfighting Sahara Taboo food and drink 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Strategic management The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Recurring South Park characters Past teachings of Prem Rawat Crossword Discordianism James Hanratty SmartAsk Ayyavazhi mythology Dairy cattle Meaning of life Toilet humour Theory of conduct English grammar Team Rocket The nature of God in Western theology Monty Hall problem Married... with Children Gray Wolf Game show Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Kashrut Breastfeeding Simone Weil Social psychology Ren and Stimpy Sexual orientation John Frusciante Milton H.
