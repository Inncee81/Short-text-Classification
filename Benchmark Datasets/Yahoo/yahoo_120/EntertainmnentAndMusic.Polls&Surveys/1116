to people who are for the death penalty how do you think convicted people should be killed and why is that the best way if a person is convicted of a horrible crime that would cause the jury or judge to sentence him or her to death i seriously feel that the person should be executed by however the victim or the victim's family choose hanging needle hanging electric chair shooting squad etc that in my mind would be the best way to carry out the death sentence furthermore if a victim or victim's family does not believe in the death sentence then the criminal should not be sentenced to one i feel that when a person commits such a horrible crime he does not value his own life and would actually benefit from being sentenced to death the easy way out i feel that it would be much horrible to live in a prison for the rest of your life being raped or tortured by other inmates undergo psychological testing testing for different products so they don't test on animals lol and submitting to whatever painful medical testing that needs to be done or they can come work for my boss that's punishment enough too Capital punishment Capital punishment in the United States Murder Hanging Life imprisonment Rape Torture Miscarriage of justice Crime in Australia Mumia Abu-Jamal Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution Capital punishment in the United Kingdom Karla Homolka Lethal injection Hanged, drawn and quartered Electric chair Judicial system of Iran Beltway sniper attacks Lynching in the United States Execution by firing squad Charles Manson Jury trial Execution (legal) Jury Prison Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Salvatore Riina Three strikes law Great Purge Death by a thousand cuts Harold Shipman Decapitation Arguments for and against drug prohibition Myra Hindley Dennis Rader Prison reform The Holocaust Theory of conduct Lee Boyd Malvo Crucifixion Suicide John Allen Muhammad Erich Priebke Capital punishment in New Zealand Hi-Fi Murders Marc Dutroux Prisons in the United States Ian Brady Rainey Bethea Joker (comics) Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Treason Mandatory sentencing Richard Ramirez Pardon European Convention on Human Rights Ethel and Julius Rosenberg Double jeopardy Extradition Appeal Adolf Eichmann Lynndie England Guillotine Uses of torture in recent times Atkins v.
