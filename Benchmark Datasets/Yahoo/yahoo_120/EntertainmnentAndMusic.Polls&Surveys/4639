what are the advantages of being a guy what's with all the peeing my husband handed this to me right before he went missing the guys' rules at last a guy has taken the time to write this all down finally the guys' side of the story i must admit it's pretty good we always hear the rules from the female side now here are the rules from the male side these are our rules please note these are all numbered on purpose men are not mind readers learn to work the toilet seat you're a big girl if it's up put it down we need it up you need it down you don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down sunday sports it's like the full moon or the changing of the tides let it be shopping is not a sport and no we are never going to think of it that way crying is blackmail ask for what you want let us be clear on this one subtle hints do not work strong hints do not work obvious hints do not work just say it yes and no are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it that's what we do sympathy is what your girlfriends are for a headache that lasts for months is a problem see a doctor anything we said months ago is inadmissible in an argument in fact all comments become null and void after days if you won't dress like the victoria 's secret girls don't expect us to act like soap opera guys if you think you're fat you probably are don't ask us if something we said can be interpreted two ways and one of them makes you sad or angry then we meant the other one you can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done not both if you already know best how to do it just do it yourself whenever possible please say whatever you have to say during commercials christopher columbus did not need directions and neither do we all men see in only colors like windows default settings peach for example is a fruit not a color pumpkin is also a fruit we have no idea what mauve is if it itches it will be scratched we do that if we ask what is wrong and you say nothing we will act like nothing's wrong we know you are lying but it is just not worth the hassle besides we know you will bring it up again later if you ask a question you don't want an answer to expect an answer you don't want to hear when we have to go somewhere absolutely anything you wear is fine really don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball the shotgun formation or golf you have enough clothes you have too many shoes i am in shape round is a shape thank you for reading this yes i know i have to sleep on the couch tonight but did you know men really don't mind that it's like camping any questions mr bean Theory of conduct Social rule Friends Avenue Q Contract Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Big Brother UK series 6 Theodicy The Contender (television series) Ed, Edd n Eddy Days of our Lives Little Britain Phoebe Buffay's songs Ontological argument EastEnders The nature of God in Western theology Scientology beliefs and practices Paul Is Dead Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kurt Cobain Socrates Slow Train Coming Major League Baseball television contracts Joke Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Discordianism Philosophy of language American Pie (song) Vegeta CPU cache Jennifer Lopez The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Causality Mojave people Condom The Amber Spyglass Originalism Le Malade imaginaire Babe Ruth Hollywood Squares Sydney Riot of 1879 Time Out of Mind Augustus De Morgan Quizbowl God Emperor of Dune FoxTrot Logic Downing Street memo English grammar House of Leaves Have I Got News For You Kasparov versus The World Homestar Runner Goodness and value theory Piccolo Junior Saga W.I.T.C.H.
