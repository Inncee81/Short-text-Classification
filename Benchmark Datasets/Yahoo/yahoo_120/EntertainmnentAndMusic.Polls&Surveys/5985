which do you prefer would you rather marry for love or have your marriage arranged i was told that arranged marriages seem to last longer plus my father just told me that he and my mother had an arranged marriage he also made a comment that he would like very much for me to go through the same thing why i don't know he just says they are better and last longer my parents have been together for years and they have children do you agree with them or can i still fight for my right to marry whom ever i choose my mom was arranged with my dad as well just because they last a long time doesn't mean they're happy in the marriage my mom is the most miserable woman i know who is married she gave birth to kids as well had miscarriages not counted in the my dad always raises hell and i just wish they would divorce she's scared of being shunned upon by society and her parents and he just doesn't want to be alone even though he treats us all badly so i've decided to marry for love someday i have him all picked out already and i hope he can make me happy it might be a while until i get married but i wouldn't want an arranged marriage i'd like to marry for love i want to know love in a marriage even if it comes more than once than to marry a person i might never grow to love the heart cannot be bossed around Humphrey Bogart Divorce Marriage Friends The Fairly OddParents Laura Schlessinger EastEnders Knots Landing Recurring South Park characters Incarnations of Immortality Phoebe Buffay's songs Kodocha Grandview, U.S.A.
