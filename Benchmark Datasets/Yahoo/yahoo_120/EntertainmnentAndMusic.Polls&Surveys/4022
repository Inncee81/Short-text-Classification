how often do you clean out your contacts list do you prefer to have a few well known to you contacts or anyone who asks a clever question or agrees with your viewpoint thanks i never cleaned my contacts list but the only people i would keep in it is the people who i add as my contact or the people who add me as their fan or contact because either way i like to help them when they ask a question and i'll know when they asked one because i'll have an e mail e mailed to me saying that they asked a question in a type of forum but i also prefer people who understand what i'm going through like if i ask a question and they tell me the same exact thing that i'm feeling and if they understand what i'm going through they're good enough to be my friend because i like my contacts to understand my personality and be proud of it Sexual orientation Social rule Goodness and value theory Religious Society of Friends God Emperor of Dune Expert system Mojave people Subud Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Internet fraud Current teachings of Prem Rawat Justification (theology) Ethics Internet troll Internet forum Social psychology Nicomachean Ethics Abduction Phenomenon Theory of conduct Past teachings of Prem Rawat American Psycho Sydney Riot of 1879 Hearing impairment Socrates U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Domain Name System Infantilism Singapore gay equality movement Polyamory National Kidney Foundation Singapore FAQ Beetle in an Anthill Independent Media Center Gmail AOL Instant Messenger English verbs Rent (musical) Asperger syndrome Syphon Filter Meaning of life Drama Infant baptism Joni Madraiwiwi Arianne Rei Ayanami Hacker A Course In Miracles Justice (TNG episode) Myers-Briggs Type Indicator The nature of God in Western theology English grammar Aesthetic Realism Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Contract Fan fiction Engineering Microeconomics Social software C.
