do you think this is rude my mom just hung up a letter from my cousin in the entrance of the apartment for people to see the letter was very personal especially when my cousin is suicidal i am so pissed right now i don't know how the hell i am going to calm myself down what a bad example i am refresh my body mahmoud i don't get what you are talking about take a bath thank you that makes me feel better haha well i did take it down already but she said to throw it away if i take it down which i am not going to so i don't care for some reason your mother is angry about the letter and wants to teach you a lesson but according to many books written by renowned psychologists this is wrong whenever you chastise someone it should always be in private chastising someone in public is humiliating and invalidating it makes the person feel violated private things should be kept private p s i googled up nasty people to find the author and some other titles caught my eye like for example how to deal with parents who are angry troubled afraid or just plain crazy by elaine mcewan the how to easily handle difficult people handbook everything problem people don't want you to know by murray oxman there are many books out there reading is a great way to get information and to learn reading takes you out of the limits of the classroom anyways good luck i hope you and your mother can make up Social rule Spanking Pitaten Kender Great Teacher Onizuka Sant Thakar Singh Avenue Q The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Infantilism Beavis and Butt-head Diving Grief Kodocha Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Sauna Aesthetic Realism A Series of Unfortunate Events Education in the United States Love Hina main characters George Costanza Scientology beliefs and practices Alexander Technique Shit Euphemism Humphrey Bogart Kyle Broflovski Asperger syndrome Milton H.
