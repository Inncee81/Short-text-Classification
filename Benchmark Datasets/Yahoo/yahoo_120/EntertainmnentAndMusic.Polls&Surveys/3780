of course every ones entitled to their own opinion but i sometimes see a question and only some people have a thumbs down but noone has a thumb up to me its better when someone gives a thumbs up for an okay answer or even no rating at all vs a thumbs down for an okay answer i mean i understand sometimes you get answers that arent exactly what you are looking for but a thumbs down for someones opinion i mean they did answer the question its kinda like bambis mom said if you aint got nothing nice to say dont say anything at all have u sever seen this if i dont like an answer or really dont agree i wont give a thumbs down just cause its not how i answered i only give thumbs down when someone is being very rude or is totally off subject and i do pass out thumbs up like theyre gonna expire what do u think thanks in advance for your opinion hey hitman you butterfly killer its not nice to change your answer i may talk alot indeed buy at least im not all paranoid and change my answer i agree if someone has the courtesy to answer a question with their opinion at least they took the time to answer it thumbs down are exactly for rude obscene or vulgar answers the people that thumbs down are more than likely jealous ones that envy someones answer because it's better than theirs Theory of conduct Internet troll John Kerr Singlish Opinion poll Sinfest OutKast GED Gottfried Leibniz Assassination Russian joke Originalism Expert system The finger The Marshall Mathers LP The Young Ones (TV series) Atomic Kitten The nature of God in Western theology Alan Campbell (pastor) Jeopardy!
