do you ever notice that when it rains the air has that weird kind of fresh scented smell i ve always wondered about that and also sometimes when there s a storm we haven t had a storm for like years the outside view appears yellow like an illusion that the sun is out water droplets in the air carry scents well so the smell of rain anywhere is a combination of many things water molecules carry scents from such things as oils released from plants other chemicals and even spores from tiny bacteria called actinomycetes the spores are only released with a good rain usually after a drought the desert has this condition after a storm when raindrops are in the air most light is either reflected off of the drops or goes right through them if the light enters at certain angles the light enters the drop is reflected inside and then exits the drop entering and exiting the drop the colors are separated umm it's kinda rainbow i don't exactly know but i think the refraction of light by the raindrops caused it Rainbow Rain Cloud Water Water (molecule) Color Speed of light Sulfur Fire fighting Polarization Carnivorous plant Solar power Refraction Water purification Exploration of Mars Carburetor Alkane Air pollution Light Bong Opportunity rover Carbon dioxide Lightning Olfaction Sewage treatment Natural gas Photosynthesis Optical phenomenon Water vapor Bloodstain pattern analysis Ozone Soap bubble Ecology Orchidaceae Vacuum Ultraviolet Honey Acetic acid Flower Fossil fuel power plant Stoma Perfume Jet engine Radar Thunderstorm Rose Ethylene Headlight Sun Climate of the United Kingdom Staining (biology) Pikmin Pok__mon Abilities Autonomous building Sonar Energy development Weather lore Virus Sense Desert Diamond Signal transduction Luminiferous aether Paint Soil life Nuclear explosion Chlorophyta Biological warfare Zerg John Dalton Glasses Odor Diamond simulant Hydrogen sulfide Angel One (TNG episode) 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Tropical cyclone DNA Mosquito Renewable energy Reflection (physics) Motility Monochromator Total internal reflection Diseases of the honeybee Titan (moon) Erosion Explosive material Super Metroid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anchor Faster-than-light Microeconomics Phase (matter) Tetrapod AFI 100 Years series Animal communication Airport Refractive index
