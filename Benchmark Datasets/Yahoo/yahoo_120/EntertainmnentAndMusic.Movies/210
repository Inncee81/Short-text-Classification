horror movies hasent the theme been done death dead children haunt something until there body is found im sick n tired of being sick n tired of these type of movies the ring the grudge dark water american haunting darkness the haunting gothika i could not agree more that is what hollywood does they just keep rehashing the same tired bull shit over and over and over because it worked once or twice for them that is just overkill that is the reason why the films being made these days will never be remembered like the films of the past because the mainstream shoves this crap down peoples throats and makes people sick of them i have this friend who owns a music movie store and he buys and sells used cds and dvds and when you look through the dvd's all you ever find is more recent films like the grudge the ring gothica the hills have eyes remakes the resident evil films and even the saw films and i mean it is not just a copy here and there it will be like ten copies of each my friend actually has to turn sellers away because he has too many copies of the same films however you rarely ever see a classic film there it is always new films that is why i stick to the classics there is more variety to be found among classic films and better films too Horror film The Grudge The Ring Contemporary culture of South Korea Little Shop of Horrors Zombie Sunset Boulevard (1950 film) Ghost Hammer Film Productions Resident Evil (film) Dark Castle Entertainment Motion picture rating system Therion (band) Kelly Clarkson Dawn of the Dead (2004 film) Steven Spielberg House on Haunted Hill Doctor Who missing episodes Kill Bill RKO Pictures Stanley Kubrick The Monkees Rave Master Vincent Price Sin City The Marshall Mathers LP Film Ju-on Who Framed Roger Rabbit Joy Division (band) H.P.
