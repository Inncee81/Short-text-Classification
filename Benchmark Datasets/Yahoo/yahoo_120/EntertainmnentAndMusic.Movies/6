can someone please explain the scene in die hard with a vengence with the fountain and the two jugs of water this was a funny scene for me because they worked it out really quick yet i was still scratching my head even when they hurriedly explained it after some thought though i think it goes like this problem they must use a gallon and a gallon jug to put exactly gallons of water on the bomb's scale to disarm it solution first they fill the gallon jug and pour it into the gallon jug this leaves gallons in the gallon jug they empty the gallon jug and pour in the gallons from the gallon jug there is now exactly gallon of space in the gallon jug they refill the gallon jug to the top and then pour out into the gallon jug until the gallon jug is full this will have removed exactly gallon from the gallon jug leaving them with gallons in the gallon jug it's not explained that well in the film as i dont think they show the first stage Fire extinguisher Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Mountain Dew Grog Marine aquarium Milk Keg Fossil fuel power plant Little Brown Jug Hansel und Gretel Coffee Toilet paper Yerba mate Panama Canal Locks Casting USS Yorktown (CV-5) Hard water IAR 80 Brewery Grace Cossington Smith Glossary of climbing terms Soap bubble Concrete RuneScape quests The Tracey Ullman Show shorts The Open Championship Textile manufacturing Wine making Biodiesel Memorial Stadium, Clemson Flush toilet Muslim ibn Aqeel Datalore (TNG episode) Music genre Harmonica Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Volume Dundas Square E85 Rock (music) Little Brown Jug (football) Homebrewing Glossary of wildland fire terms Douglas Skyrocket The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Fountain pen Beatmania IIDX Glossary of firefighting terms Gravity Panama Canal Dark energy Psychedelic music Porosity Goldfish Gilding Vinegar Paramount Canada's Wonderland Kyrgyzstan Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Top Fuel Pottery Twelve O'Clock High Rebreather Battle of the Bulge This Is Spinal Tap The Doctor Dances Robot Master Fujian tea ceremony Gallon USS Wake Island (CVE-65) Thermal depolymerization New Coke Wheat beer Hydrogen economy The Vile Village Walt Disney World Railroad Houseplant Blood Short Sunderland Philosophy of space and time Extreme Programming Fire Sprinkler Blood Simple Three Mile Island Firefighter The Abyss Health measures during the construction of the Panama Canal Slide rule Pansy Fountain The Crystal Palace English unit Autonomous building Barton Springs Menstrual cup Pirates of the Caribbean USS Thresher (SS-200) Tilapia Bathing
