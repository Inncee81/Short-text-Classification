anyone seen the movie wild orchid and did they like it or dislike it its got mickey rourke in it the one with mickey rourke and carr otis where they actually had real sex i've seen it and have a copy of it it was very erotic to me mickey rourke played an excellent memorable character while i wasn't happy with otis' acting the character she played was intriguing to me because her character goes from where she is a young innocent woman to nervously losing her virginity then enjoying sex and falling in love with rourke's character this film is debatable wild orchid is a steamy erotic mind game type of film that probably won't please everybody and hasn't in the past but people need to make their own judgment Mickey Rourke Wild Orchid (movie) Pornographic actor Human sexual behavior Sexual orientation Atlantis: The Lost Empire 1990 Golden Raspberry Awards Dracula Lili Leslie Cheung Anime Pornographic movie Neighbours Motion picture rating system Knots Landing Jayne Mansfield Mickey Mantle Pornography Adaptation.
