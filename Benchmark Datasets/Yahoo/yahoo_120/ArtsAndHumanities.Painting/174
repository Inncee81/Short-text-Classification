how do you make one understand a picasso i mean whenever my friends see it they'd claim their child can do better than that how do you explain the meaning behind say la guernica without putting them off i hate it when people make statements like my child could do better than if their child could do better why didn't they and made all those millions of dollars the truth is that they can't the work that picasso do is difficult to do it might be simple looking but the knowledge of the midium perspective and human anatomy has to be great to design and make work like that not counting the experience knowledge and handling of the brushes and canvas picasso was great at what he did he made about works of art through out his life time jackson pollack upon seeing his work said that picasso doesn't miss a thing the work that he did were groundbreaking during his time and nobody has done things like that before so i would study about his works and his life and than approach your friends and ask them to try and come up with new ways to look at our world and put it on canvas and they will find out if they kid can do it it is easy to copy others people ideas a lot harder to come up with something new Pablo Picasso Epistemology Science Philosophy of language Diego Vel__zquez Philosophy of mathematics Reality Piet Mondrian Stanton Macdonald-Wright Theory of conduct Guernica (painting) Cubism Art Wassily Kandinsky Aristotle Francis Bacon (painter) David Hockney Scientific method Martin Heidegger Modernism Jackson Pollock Meaning of life Art forgery David Hume Goodness and value theory Karl Popper Qualia Current teachings of Prem Rawat Drawing History of science Religion Procrastination Free will Mathematics Gertrude Stein Social psychology Extreme Programming Predestination Philosophy of science Human Alcoholics Anonymous God Dialectic Religious Society of Friends Sant Mat John Howard Yoder Hermeneutics Past teachings of Prem Rawat Cultural relativism Meaning Deconstruction Aesthetic Realism A New Kind of Science W.
