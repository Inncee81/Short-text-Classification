what's a good asking price for abstract paintings on e bay bidding starting at u s you ask a good question unfortunately there is no easy answer i'll make my most thoughtful attempt first you must make it a point as any commercial artist must do to set a value for your artwork some artists come up with an hourly amount which they feel reflects their level of expertise so if you are professionally trained you might charge hour while others devise a rate schedule based upon the size of the work but realistically there are usually other often important factors to consider when pricing your work namely how much were your artists materials supplies is there a minimum bottom amount you charge for all of your artwork what are similar pieces selling for on ebay make sure that you're not comparing piece you lucked up and created vs a similar looking piece that a master artists spent years honing his talent to create try to be fair and reasonable at all costs because unless you're an established artist full time paying the bills and feeding your kids with your skills you will have to make some sacrifices to get your art seen most importantly be sure not to let money be your sole driving factor be sensitive to the market too remember you can skin a sheep once but you can shear it for a lifetime Minimum wage Microeconomics Inflation Capitalism Labor theory of value Insurance Martial art Art Economy of Russia Law of value Labour economics Prices of production Economic inequality Welding Tax Scientology beliefs and practices Deflation (economics) Topps Gross domestic product Kitsch Mutual fund Free trade Monetary policy Digital photography Unemployment Publicly funded medicine Education in Portugal Surplus value Amway Casting Ozone depletion Common Agricultural Policy Labor-power MMORPG Magic: The Gathering Bond Education in the United States Monopoly Solar cell Gold standard Airsoft Economics The Apprentice 2 Drawing Copyleft Value added tax Loudspeaker Progressive tax Explosive material Bicycle lighting Monopoly (game) Principal-agent problem Airline Ozone hole Model (economics) Leica Mortgage Live 8 Sega Saturn Arbitrage Supply-side economics Expert system Monopsony Health insurance Bretton Woods system Productive and unproductive labour Textile manufacturing Baseball Yield curve Final Fantasy XI Welfare economics Day trading Public good Money supply Islamic banking Neopets Wal-Mart Hyperinflation Opportunity cost Knife Game show ELO rating system Corporation RISC Tariff Handloading Poker jargon Canadian and American economies compared Photography Capital accumulation Laptop Fusion power Technical analysis Graduate school
