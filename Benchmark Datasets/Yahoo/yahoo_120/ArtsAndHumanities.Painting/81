what color pallete you can use to paint a tree on a landscape i usually have a hard time painting trees or shrubs in a landscape it always turned out to be very bright green or green but does not show a realistic effect of trees or shrubs i want to paint it in a realistic or even impressionistic style i would like to know the pallete of colors i can use like yellow and black will make a green green plus blue plus black will show a color of a pine tree any answer will be greatly appreciated thanks you are not getting a realistic effect because you think all that is necessary is to find the right green color is secondary to value in realism you need to establish a light source for your trees the colors nearest the light source will be light and warm the shadows will be dark and cool bluer there is also the form and texture of the trees to think about and trees are never just green you need to work some warm colors in reds and purples in the shadows yellows and oranges in the sunlit areas Color theory Wassily Kandinsky Color Light-emitting diode Wood Piet Mondrian Grace Cossington Smith Yellow Collectibles in Bionicle Rendering (computer graphics) Christmas tree Georges-Pierre Seurat Lighting Albedo Gamut Chaos Emerald Paint Impressionism Diamond Pysanka Lightsaber Garnet Dragon Booster Albert Namatjira Drawing BNSF Railway Common bean Beret James McNeill Whistler Crayola Academic art Chao (Sonic the Hedgehog) Huangshan Mountains Items in the Metroid series Anaglyph image Discus (fish) Primary color Diamond enhancement Comanche Green Sunglasses Synaesthesia Color blindness Chromium Ammolite Netsuke Link (Legend of Zelda) Fluorescent lamp Political colour Power Rangers Color space Extraterrestrial skies CMYK color model Black body Philosophy of perception Coast Douglas-fir Characters in Bionicle Diamond simulant Blue Photography Koi Chinese art Rainbow Wave Race: Blue Storm Bryce Eye color Direct realism Venonat Computer animation R-Type Tag Logo Yoshi Mario Superstar Baseball Pigment The Legend of Zelda series enemies The Warriors Uranium Problem of universals CIE 1931 color space RGB color model Japanese art Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Colours, standards and guidons Rainbow flag Microsoft Paint Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Rose Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Gatorade Red Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch Monofloral honey Pansy Turquoise Rainbow Brite Kryptonite Pok__mon Colosseum Shadow the Hedgehog
