when using practice golf balls i just got some practice golf balls they are the hallow plastic ones with holes all over like a wiffle ball or a ping pong ball how far should i be hitting these what is the ration of distence between these and real balls how far would i need to hit one of these for it to compare to yards with a real ball you'll figure out the relation once you hit them for a while you'll know when you're hitting them solid instead of relating the practice ball distance to a real ball distance you might consider the opposite relate a real ball distance to the practice ball distance for example if you hit your pw yds with a real ball and find out you only hit a practice ball yds that's a to ratio see if that ratio holds up for all your clubs ultimately you want to maintain your yardages hitting a real golf ball doesn't matter how far you hit practice balls on a windy day you can forget about it the main purpose of those practice balls is to see your ball flight and keep your swing tuned practice balls will slice and hook draw and fade just like a real ball but exaggerated i wouldn't spend too much time hitting those practice balls just enough to keep the rust off your swing there's no substitution for the real thing Golf Golf glossary Fast bowling Caddy Golf club (equipment) Tennis Table tennis Laws of cricket Golf ball American football Swimming Billiards Glossary of American football Croquet Baseball Cricket Football (soccer) Disc golf Plastic Ben Hogan Volleyball Batting (cricket) Field hockey Baseball statistics Archery Shotgun John Daly (golfer) Olympic Club Snooker Microeconomics Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Double the Fist Softball Textile manufacturing Electrophysiology Michelle Wie Knife Eight ball Mouse (computing) Baseball Stars C-5 Galaxy Collision detection Terminal ballistics Sniper Vin Scully Circuit design Passer rating Transistor West Indian cricket team Babe Ruth Jon Secada Rathfarnham Bicycle Pinball Batting average Origins of baseball Beer Pong Satchel Paige Floorball Helicopter Rugby union positions Bullet Four square Hazeltine National Golf Club Major League Baseball television contracts Strap-on dildo Planetary orbit Piccolo Junior Saga Lucille Ball Light-emitting diode Lee Trevino USS Tunny (SS-282) Water polo Laws of the Game History of computer and video games Ultimate (sport) Anchor Magnus effect American football strategy Scale model Internal ballistics Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Mahjong Club (weapon) Solar cell Lindy Hop Swing bowling Pitcher Trigonometric function Rugby union Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Videocon Tri-Series 2005-06 Peter Shilton Hank Aaron Tee Roxette Soccer AM Rounders Rose (Doctor Who)
