work issues how to cope please read on recently ive been having some issues at work and i'm not sure how to handle them as in best course of action theres so much to say but i'll keep it to the basics of whats most important i suppose i'm fairly new so i havent much say in the matter but basically theres no proper training procedures being followed for myself and another member of the staff as dictated by policy a prerequisite for the job not just because we want to know some of my guys staff have been written up for things they by all means shouldnt have as its total crap one of my guys had his f t status pushed to p t without his consent and i dont think thats allowed i'm being held responisble for 'mistakes' on things that i was never trained properly to do that are part of my job and for which i shouldve been trained before being given the position i'm expected to do my job without being instructed on this particular companys procedre or being rushed through it wait for details i've worked in this 'field' a long time but as you well know every company's poilicies and procedures are different i havent been trained properly in their procedures yet my boss will say 'oh i told you twice' when in fact he didnt somethings he told me once in a quick run through but i wasnt trained i feel as though its making me out to be a fool and i dont care for that i'm completely competent to do my job and i keep asking for the required training courses i should have had when i started and hes saying theres no time for me to do it wait for details also i'm learning what i can from they staff thats been there but for most of them i'm either on the same level or i'm over them in position how am i supposed to resolve customer issues and help my staff if i havent been trained in how to by company procedure handle the inquirys issues i'm growing increasingly irritated with the whole situation and i am not sure what to do every time i ask to finish my training my boss tells me there isnt the time yet every other person that has the same position as me has gone through their required courses and most have been there a while so they know the job well enough wait for details sorry i don't appreciate made to look like a fool and one of my guys suggested by observation that perhaps my boss has a bit of an attitude towards women i dont know this to be fact there are other women on our staff though not many and i dont know thier input feelings on it i'm trying to take into consideration that my boss hasnt ever worked in this industry before so maybe thats why he's the way he is but i think im just making excuses also i vehemently disagree with my guys being written up for no reason they are excellent employess and always do their best for me yet i've no control over what my boss does theres more but im not getting into it i'm in conflict over this i dont know what should i do how should i handle this any suggestions adonis thank you the reason why you have been hired is bec as youve said you are in the 'field or industry' for quite some time so you wre hired bec of your competency level at some point new hires are expected to fend for themselves and have the initiative to learn the system or the ropes of the new company here your ability to adapt is really tested including your flexiblity initiative and ability to perfom tasks under pressure unfortunately dear from what ive read so far you have been focusing on your demands and complains although i agree that your boss should have trained you well you still need to have initiative in learning based on my experience it is sometimes annoying for new hires to expect attention when the old ones have work to do i think it will really work well for you to train yourself on basic compnay procedures etc bec in this day and age people will really hire a person with teammanship and flexibility maybe the best way is to put yourself in your colleague's and boss' shoes and try to see how they would perceive you if they learn of how you actually feel Scientology beliefs and practices Theory of conduct Second language acquisition Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act
