what do you think about this website in order to give my own website a better design i'm comparing some random websites and would like to know what people think about some webdesigns please take a look at this website http www ciao surveys international com and describe what you like or dislike about this design not about the company so please focus on color look feel graphics functionality etc a few random thoughts the lighter red that you use as non rollover buttons is a bit dull compared to all the bright colors that you use the orange which should be a highlight color really gets lost in the dark red that you use maybe use a darker color for contrast the body text could be a smidge bigger as a base size it would probably be hard to read for people with vision problems i'm not a huge fan of that orange bar to the right side of the page it sometimes runs into the middle section and it sometimes doesn't and it looks ackward i feel like there should be some separation between the middle column and the right one Atari 8-bit family Color Color theory Human skin color Color blindness Nintendo 64 Autostereogram Mouse (computing) Pop'n Music CPU cache Color Graphics Adapter Beatmania IIDX Yu-Gi-Oh!
