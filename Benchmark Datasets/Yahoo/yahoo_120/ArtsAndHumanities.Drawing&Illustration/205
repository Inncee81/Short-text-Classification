french impressionism what were some cultural effects of french impressionism please list as many as you can impressionism began in painting with claude monet's artwork and eventually was taken over in literature especially poetry music sculpture and in other fields of art even in film a little later because impressionism was concerned with capturing one moment in time and its philosophy affected the artist's relationship to their artwork time was no longer an objective entity following its own track but there would be a splitting of time into objective and subjective time that could now be represented in art the artist's focus was no longer to present a picture of something as it is but to render it as if frozen in time while preserving the impression of the moment thus art had become subjectified through the eye of the artist and this new perspective was to be attacked later by expressionism which was a direct effect of impressionism Art Impressionism Western art history Modernism Claude Monet Academic art Cubism Pablo Picasso Drawing Symbolism (arts) Ukiyo-e Digital art Modern art Degenerate art Photography Wassily Kandinsky Reality Graphics Kitsch Neoclassicism Art of Ancient Egypt French art of the 19th century Meaning Aesthetics Philosophy of language Prayer Harlem Renaissance Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Cinematography Korean art Art in Ancient Greece __douard Manet Dada Michel Henry Baroque Literature Surrealism Hierarchy of genres Renaissance Perspective (graphical) Social psychology Culture of China Martin Heidegger African art El Lissitzky Maurice Merleau-Ponty Pre-historic art Rococo John Singer Sargent George Moore (novelist) Diego Vel__zquez Fine art Buddhist art Deconstruction Stereoscopy Age of Enlightenment Traditional animation Drew Struzan Pierre-Auguste Renoir Japanese art Music Philosophy of mathematics Francis I of France Postmodernism Depth of field Logic Henri Cartier-Bresson Bullet time Indian art Georges-Pierre Seurat Frankfurt School Homoeroticism Chinese art Frans Hals Arthur Schopenhauer Aesthetic Realism Titian Gustave Caillebotte Abstract art Computer animation Guy Davenport Hokusai Ethics Visual arts Romanticism Dutch Golden Age Berthe Morisot Taoism Culture of Egypt Existentialism Hentai Greco-Buddhist art Philosophy of perception Translation Performance art Copyright law of the United Kingdom Princeton University
