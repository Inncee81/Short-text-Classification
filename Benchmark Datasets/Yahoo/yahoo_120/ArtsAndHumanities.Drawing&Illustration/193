a good story to illustrate i want to practice illustration and drawing and would like to do it by illustrating a story it can be any type of story try to start with very old children stories that don't have any copyright like hansel and gretel alice in wonderland etc and what i would definitely do is not look at reference from previous illustrators when i was in school they gave us stories that already existed and were printed and illustrated and we weren't allowed to look at anything any artist had done because then your work is going to be always tinted with that because in your head you are going to think about these other people that had done it before you so try to avoid that or watching movies such as alice in wonderland from walt disney or even looking at the mary blair illustrations that she did for the movie that they never actually used i hope this helps you and have a lot of fun drawing take care Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Carl Barks Alice in Wonderland (1951 film) Don Rosa Walt Disney Alice Liddell John Tenniel Peter Pan Bill Peet Hansel and Gretel Walt Disney World Resort Through the Looking-Glass The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Winnie-the-Pooh Extreme Programming Alan Moore Mickey Mouse Mervyn Peake Alice Comedies Brothers Grimm Harlan Ellison Resident Evil (film) Drawing Colleen Doran Pen name Griffin Copyright The Walt Disney Company Fantasia (film) Disney's Nine Old Men Sherlock Holmes Fairy tale Pinocchio Donald Duck Disneyland Mary Poppins Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Drew Struzan Mixtape Plagiarism Spirited Away Mickey Mouse Works The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age) Disney-MGM Studios Witches (Discworld) Hansel und Gretel Care Bears Silly Symphonies Wonderland (McFly album) Dakota Fanning Aladdin (1992 film) Photography Digimon Oswald the Lucky Rabbit William Blake Anime Comics Pogo Disney comics Novel Cheshire cat Dorama L.
