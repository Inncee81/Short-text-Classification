does anyone know how i can learn to draw really good portraits or real people i can draw cartoons okay but i am really interested in learning in learning to draw portraits and real people does anyone know a website or a book i could learn from please please let me know the title author or where i can get it thanks d perhaps you can start by using a lightbox im sure that is what they call it still you put a regular picture of anyhting on top of the box when the light shines through the picture you can put a piece of paper over that and trace the picture underneath perhaps you can just start by tracing and then once you do it a bunch of times try it on your own from memory you can also look into anatomy books maybe take a picture of yourself and study the hell out of it draw it and try to keep the proportions the same as they are in the picture i dont konw how to explain it but that is what i do i can freehand anything but i cant draw anything straight from my head i guess just refrence and repetition is best Drawing Traditional animation M.C.
