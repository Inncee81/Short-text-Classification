are you a graphic designer im doing a project in my design class and im desiging a brochure buisness card logo ect for a art gallery 'centre of modern art' coma if you have any advice or ideas that you think might come in handy please share your knowledge thankyou very much the term is corporate identity this covers the consistant look of the client's image as it is presented in varioius forms such as advertisement letterhead etc first do research on the nature of the gallery's history such as what kind of art and clientele they serve the logo and layouts should reflect this look whenever possible when it comes to the logo remember that simplicity is key a complex many faceted illustation may look pretty displayed on a wall but appears muddy or completely lost on the corner of a letterhead a rule of thumb i use for logo design is to remember that this image may appear as a one half square inch dot on a telephone book page ad it must still be crisp clear and recognizable if the image is of a seagull you don't have to show every feather you don't have to show any feathers for that matter what's the minimum number of strokes to make the image of a seagull perhaps two showing the profile of two wings in the distance see what i mean all the pieces of this identity must have a consistancy of appearance that does not meant that they all have to have the exact same layout the return address corner of an envelope does not have to look exactly like the front fold splash of a brochure or the phone book ad but they should be instantly recognizable as belonging to the same organization don't just think in terms of paper think billboards television etc Wallpaper group Enterprise content management Paper size Comics Typewriter Hangul Billboard (advertising) Apple Macintosh Graphics Logo Poker jargon CBS Piet Mondrian Extreme Programming Cangjie method Stairway Surveillance Synthesizer Diamond cut Sears Holdings Corporation Goatse.cx Stereoscopy Umlaut Plame affair Nintendo GameCube Telephone Television Computer Bluetooth HTML Mobile phone 0 (number) Tarot Flat file database Minesweeper (computer game) Atari 8-bit family Whois Direct marketing Final Fantasy Photography Dundas Square Medical prescription RuneScape quests IBM PC compatible Glossary of graph theory United States Postal Service Tire Regular polytope Pixel Buckingham Palace ITV Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Autostereogram Driver's license Fractal Symmetry Monopoly (game) Sega Saturn Yearbook Craps El Lissitzky Brand Telephone exchange Logo programming language Electronic Arts Digital Equipment Corporation Rendering (computer graphics) History of the Internet Cognitive science Apple typography Envelope Beatmania IIDX Chrysler Corporation Perl Web design Mozilla Application Suite Dog agility Best Buy Mail Wilton House Musical notation Squad Leader Joni Mitchell Japanese tea ceremony Wood carving Arabic alphabet Mouse (computing) Advertising MSN Messenger Drew Struzan RISC GSM services Geographic information system I Ching Tobacco advertising Stamp collecting
