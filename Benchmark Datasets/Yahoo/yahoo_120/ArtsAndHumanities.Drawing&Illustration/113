how to reduce the effects of textured paper and color pencil on final image hi i need to send a few illustrations to be printed these illustrations were done on textured for water color paper with colored pencils and some water color the end result is too textured you can see the paper texture very clearly in the scanned image can you suggest a way to reduce the texture and make the surfaces more uniform without blurring the drawings it could be on photoshop or other software packages that you know and love thanks adi try live trace in illustrator if you have flash it also has a trace function if you choose a high number of segments and colors it will look pretty good and sharp because you are converting it to a vector image choosing a low number of colors can look pretty cool also illustrator is a big more complex but the image export in flash isn't that great but it's fine if you export as a png Drawing Traditional animation Rendering (computer graphics) Adobe Photoshop Graphic design Laser engraving PNG Wood Graphics Shader Bryce Digital image editing Drew Struzan Computer graphics JPEG Stereoscopy Etching Photography Digital photography Pottery Computer animation Surrealist techniques Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Nextoons: the Nicktoons Film Festival Explosive material Tofu Aliasing United States dollar CPU cache Adobe Illustrator Fire extinguisher Sega Saturn ImageMagick Lighting Oscilloscope Nintendo 64 Xbox 360 Ebook Printed circuit board Inkjet printer GIMP 3D computer graphics PlayStation Portable Tattoo Pencil Normal mapping Macromedia Flash Endgame Printmaking Vector graphics ASCII art Pixelation Nintendo Entertainment System Inkscape Igneous rock Typewriter GIF Dither Konica Minolta USB flash drive Diamond cut Pixel Vector (spatial) Compiler optimization Nintendo GameCube CMYK color model ATI Technologies Enlarger Sudoku POV-Ray Xbox One-time pad Automatic number plate recognition Portable Document Format Scalable Vector Graphics Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Commodore 64 Pastel Graphics processing unit Racetrack (game) Central processing unit Opportunity rover Color printing Game Boy Advance Vector graphics editor Paint Plastic Fiberglass Paper Enterprise content management Trademark Gross domestic product M__bius transformation Symmetry
