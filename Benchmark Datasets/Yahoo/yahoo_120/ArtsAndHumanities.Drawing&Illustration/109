is this a good drawing on microsoft paint i'm and female and hoping for a career in graphic design or art and decided to do this in my free time i didn't use a tablet to draw it just a plain old mouse and a copy of microsoft paint took me about an hour in total is it any good comments or ratings would be good thanks http www youtube com watch v kdbtohrnjs i don't know squat about computer aided drawing cause i'm in fine arts but it looks pretty dang good to me the only thing i might change is to speed up the sequences from one color over lay to the next because it seemed a teensy bit slow i felt like i was waiting too long for something to happen other than that the actual drawing of the car was excellent make sure you bring a dvd copy of this to put into your portfolio in case you apply at any art or design schools also if you do do this make sure you change the handwritten type to something more professional looking good luck i think you have a bright future ahead of you IBM PC compatible CPU cache Original Amiga chipset Theory of conduct ATI Technologies Poker jargon Digital art Apple Computer Ebook Mouse (computing) Ashton-Tate PlayStation 2 Time Out of Mind Computer animation Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Ra (board game) Windows XP Computer chess Intellectual property Screenshot Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Microsoft Windows Social rule Graphics TRS-80 Color Computer History of Microsoft Windows Photography Domain Name System 2000 Australian Grand Prix NVIDIA Microsoft Paint Logo programming language JPEG Tablet PC Graphic design Wassily Kandinsky Jumpstart 3rd Grade 2D computer graphics Nintendo Wallpaper group Endgame Computer virus Web crawler Art The Star Wars Holiday Special Ben Johnson (athlete) World Wide Web Traditional animation Atari 8-bit family Xbox Traffic light Computer The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Milton H.
