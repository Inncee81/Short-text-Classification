how do i draw a sunset on a lake i want to draw a sunset on a lake and i am having trouble drawing it i dont really know how to draw a lake it just seems like blue water because i dont know how to draw waves and ripples im not a very good drawer so i would like some tips on drawing lakes and sunsets thanks okay say you're using colored pencils not sure what you're using but for sake of an answer always start with your sky the very top of your page would be basic sky blue as you get lower start coloring very lightly to fade out the blue to white then add yellow very faintly to blend from blue to yellow then add whatever color you want your sunset to be orange red purple pink etc you can include the sun just sinking if you like by using very bright yellow don't draw a circle just a nice bright glow stop a little below the mid line of the page in a straight line across the page like someone just cut across the page and it's suddenly white the rest of the way down now you're ready for your lake take a blue pencil same color as the top of your sky and draw the water line across where your sky stopped fade out at the middle or wherever your sun is glowing the brightest then fade in as you go across the page ending the same shade as you started on the opposite side use whatever colors you put in the sunset and mirror the colors in the water for instance if you have a gold colored glow for the sun make a gold colored glow in the water just beneath the sun then when that color changes to pink make the water pink around the gold glow in the water that is the sun the water then fades to blue just as your sky above faded to blue only it isn't as if you're looking at it straight but as if it were colored on a square sign facing you and then someone laid the sign at an angle on its back so it slants away from you sorry it's hard to describe without being able to show you if you then want to make the water look real add a lot more blue and deeper shadows to it at the edges you can add grass trees or other details in the foreground very bottom of your page if you like waves and ripples are hard to make look real the key is keeping your pencil moving left to right very straight not at all in a curved stroke or it will look like blue hay instead of water to make ripples leave the top of a wave white and color in the bottom part of it fading darker to blue again straight lines across is how you make it look real look at a photo if you're having trouble good luck hope this helps look at a photograph if you're still stumped Billiards Color Light-emitting diode Wassily Kandinsky Snooker Leaf Colours, standards and guidons Opportunity rover Color theory Dragon Booster Rainbow Extraterrestrial skies Polarization Sundial Color temperature Professional wrestling holds Hangul Lightsaber Power Rangers Pysanka Mario series enemies Volleyball Fast bowling Pink Floyd Diamond Boy's surface Upholstery Sunglasses Tai shogi Knife Red Shaggy dog story Paramount Pictures Photography Parallax 2000 Australian Grand Prix Rock (music) CIE 1931 color space Aerial (dance move) Skateboarding trick Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Traditional animation Yellow Grace Cossington Smith Buffalo Bills R-Type Sun Textile manufacturing Fantasmic!
