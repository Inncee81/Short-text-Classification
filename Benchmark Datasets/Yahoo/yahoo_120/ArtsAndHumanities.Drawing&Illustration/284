question about frames i'm going to give a charcoal portrait of a friend to her on her b day should i put it on a frame what kind of frame would suit a black and white drawing what colour should it be than u ur attention framed is good otherwise her nice charcoal portrait will get smudged and wrinkled matted is also good this keeps the glass and the paper separated it also gives space around the image which is more restful to the eye if you use a mat you can also use any frame color or style you like anything from black or silver metal sectional frames an inexpensive option all the way to gold leaf i pick up cheap frames in the picture section at good will all the time i discard the art and reuse the frame it's nice to find a larger frame with glass in it i have repainted refinished or releafed dozens of frames myself and the people i give them to would never know the difference i have boxes and boxes of frames i always say if you've got a frame you've got a gift Drawing Stereoscopy Pastel Japanese tea ceremony Eyeglass prescription Photography Christmas tree Digital photography Textile manufacturing Saint Nicholas Francis Bacon (painter) Starfleet ranks and insignia Gramophone record Brewery JPEG NTSC Screen-printing James McNeill Whistler Kripke semantics Abstraction Plastic Casting Yu-Gi-Oh!
