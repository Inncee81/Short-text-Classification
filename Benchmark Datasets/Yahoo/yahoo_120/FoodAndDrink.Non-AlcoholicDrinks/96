i'm trying to stay up until my bf gets off work at midnight whats the best time me to drink a cup of coffee i don't have to work in the morning that's the only reason why i'm attemting to stay up other than the fact of seeing my boyfriend try one at if you're in an earlier time zone than me and another at since you don't have to work i wouldn't worry too much about the effect of caffeine you can always try some no doz or vivarin but they tend to make me really jittery i'd probably have cups of coffee if you're very concerned about sleeping but space them apart and by the way caffeine can stay in your system for several hours so if you really want to go to bed any time soon you might want to avoid it i don't have any caffeine for at least hours before bedtime so keep that in mind just find something really entertaining to do play a game watch a great movie read a wonderful book call someone interesting and that should distract you enough if you're that tired no amount of caffeine will keep you awake but it might wake you up after you've fallen asleep have a good night Insomnia Sleep Caffeine Coffee Sleep debt Daylight saving time Social rule Philosophical skepticism Word of Wisdom Avenue Q Apollo 8 The Shining (film) Narcolepsy Energy drink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Canonical hours Breakfast Milton H.
