what dont we like about electric bikes or electric motorbikes thinking about setting up a company selling electric bikes and motorbikes for on and off road use what do you think yes there are some really cool electric bikes out there they can get almost miles range and can leave most bicyclists in the dust but so what no one is really making a living selling them i support the industry and build one for a customer every now and then there are maybe a whole ten shops in the usa making enough money to support the owner full time and they are in really big cities you need to be good at electronics retailing bicycling and business there just is not enough sales money to support that effort its is hard enough making a living owning a regular bike shop it just does not work for ebikes in the us yet for many folks europe seems to love them but it is flatter with lots of bike paths even though beta was a better video recording format it did not catch on that's business Mountain bike Utility cycling Sears Holdings Corporation Bicycle lighting Harley-Davidson Retailer Mountain biking Cycling UK Singles Chart Bicycle brake systems Honda Honda CX series Wal-Mart Electronic commerce Segregated cycle facilities Roller skating Schwinn Bicycle Company Grand Theft Auto (game) Bicycle Microsoft Tesco Beastie Boys Videocassette recorder Bulk vending London Congestion Charge Best Buy Jennifer Lopez Triathlon Marks & Spencer Epoxy Jeff Bezos Vehicular cycling Delaware, Ohio Bike lane debate Bicycle helmet Track cycling Transportation of Los Angeles Tire Amway The Chemical Brothers Privatization A-ha Credit card Dancing at Lughnasa Ballwin, Missouri Beverly Hills, California Eaton's Intellectual property Amazon.com Panasonic Publishing Toyota Prius DVD Queen (band) Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII Eugene, Oregon Spice Girls Commodore International Bank Pattaya International Computers Ltd Coffeehouse Cranford, New Jersey Nintendo DS Automobile Battery electric vehicle PolyGram Lance Armstrong ITunes Music Store Thomas B.
