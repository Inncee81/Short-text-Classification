forte brand products from performance bike i didn't realize that forte is a house brand only sold at performance bike the sales staff really push forte products but how is the quality relative to mass marketed brands all i've actually purchased was a set of tires and tubes but i want to make sure they aren't crap what do you all think of this brand it all depends on the product as is the case with most other house brands some items are complete junk others are pretty good for the price basic parts such as brake levers tires tubes clothing water bottles cages pedals etc are usually fine once you start getting to the bigger types of components that's where the big difference usually is if i'm gonna shell out the money for some new disc brakes i'd rather but a well known brand then them as i've heard some stories about the quality not being so great on the bigger components you get what you pay for there's a reason that the shimano speed cog is priced way much more then a similar forte one the teeth tend to break easier on them then they do for the high end stuff Bicycle Motorcycle Bicycle frame Mountain bike Bicycle brake systems Shimano Bicycle lighting Inflation Recumbent bicycle Cycling Racing bicycle Manual transmission Shimano Total Integration Commodity Microeconomics Disc brake Gross domestic product Plastic Drag racing Supply and demand Car handling Casting Phonograph Gramophone record Dodge Charger Mattress Electronic commerce Laserdisc Overclocking Sears Holdings Corporation CPU design Hamster Filling station Wayne Corporation Airsoft Motocross Advertising Monopoly Electric motor Diving regulator Schwinn Bicycle Company Formula One cars Illegal drug trade Bulk vending Audi Powel Crosley Jr. Service economy Mazda RX-7 Carburetor Heinkel He 100 Law of value Surplus value Commodore International Oscilloscope BMW Volkswagen Golf Equine conformation Mazda Miata Brewery AMD Fuel injection Prices of production Solar power Tractor Handloading Amiga Craps Tax Tofu Royal Enfield Balassa-Samuelson effect Professional wrestling match types Lionel Corporation Visual Basic Labor theory of value American Motors RuneScape quests Compact audio cassette Topps Natural monopoly Ashton-Tate Drill bit Audiophile Internet fraud Triathlon Neopets Gucci Black market Brand management The Apprentice 2 Ford Mustang Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Honda Citro__n 2CV Internal ballistics
