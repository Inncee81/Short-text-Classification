i have never had my eyebrows waxed at a salon before help i have some questions i know its not really a big deal but i had a few questions about it i checked a few salons websites and they all say just eyebrow waxing this is the same thing as eyebrow shaping right ware they pluck wax the eyebrows so they look good lol also about how long does it take could anybody give me a walk though of the whole procedure like from the sit down point to the point ware you go pay for it from my experience the people in the salon ask you to sit in a chair with something behind you to rest your head upon or they have a reclining chair or table they ask you what your preference is to clean up or shape ie to remove stray hairs or the dreaded unibrow or to thin your eyebrows then the stylist dips a wooden stick thinner than a popsicle stick into a vat of hot wax removes it blows on it to make sure it's not too hot and puts it on the hair to be removed next the stylist will put wax paper over the wax you will feel a lot of pressing and rubbing so that the paper sticks to all the wax and the wax sticks to the hair the stylist then pulls the paper wax and hair in one fell swoop it may hurt for just a second but it's not bad this process is repeated until all of the unwanted hair is removed after all the hair is grossly removed ie no real detail work the stylist will pluck finely remove any hairs that are too short for the wax to get that's the part that gets me the most the waxing is fine always make sure that you complain if the wax is too hot surface burns can occur if it's too hot the stylist will show you a mirror and you can ensure that you like the work before you sit up and pay since it's the eyebrows and not a mustache like mine it's not that bad you'll be glad when you're done because you will look more beautiful than you already are don't forget to tip Casting Manicure Pottery Dreadlocks Textile manufacturing Japanese tea ceremony Brewery Internal ballistics Cross-country skiing Double bass Violin Drill bit Gilding Knife Aerial (dance move) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Repouss__ and chasing Motor oil Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Baldness Milton H.
