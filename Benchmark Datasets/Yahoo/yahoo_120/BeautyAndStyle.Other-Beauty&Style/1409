girls which date outfit pics included i have date with a girl i met a few days ago we're going to the mall catch a movie and maybe eat something afterwards which outfit should i pick http farm static flickr com d bc f jpg http farm static flickr com ea c d jpg http farm static flickr com e ec f jpg help i'd say that number is a little too fancy for this particular date although it is a nice outfit for this date i'd recommend an outfit somewhat like it is middle of the road dressy this way you'll sort of fit in to whatever she decides to wear you don't want to look too over the top if she's really casual or vice versa i do like the button up tucked into jeans with a belt although if you have a different shirt i think i would recommend changing it i'm not sure why but i'm just not likin' that shirt too much sorry but above all remember that she's going to date you for you and not for the clothes you wear so just pick something you like and will be comfortable in and just go and have a good time London Shirt Undergarment Suit (clothes) Resident Evil (video game) Aerial (dance move) Skinhead Kilt Bob Jones University Butterfly Kimono Gurkha Contingent The Warriors Tennis shirt Mario Clothing Treehouse of Horror XV Jill Valentine Singapore Police Force Trousers Modern Western square dance My Life as a Teenage Robot Culture of the United States Ajax (programming) Punisher Barbie Trailer Park Boys Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Beachwear Social aspects of clothing T-shirt Dress shirt White-collar worker Black tie Leon S.
