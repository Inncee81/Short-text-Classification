at home spa ideas im having my own at home spa but sadly i need ideas help me i need to know what to do what i should eat and everything else i want to actually feel like im at a real spa so i need decoration ideas as well oh and what should i wear please help me i want to spend the whole day in days relaxing and having a great time oh and i cant go out and buy anything mostly likely can you also give me some websites that might help please i really need this break sounds way fun here are my suggestions for drinks most spas offered citrus flavored waters but not strongly flavored to make it just pick a couple of different fruits like a lemon a lime and an orange cute them into slices and put the slices in the water for a bit just before your guests arrive so that when they get there and you pour a drink for them the taste is still very fresh for food i would have some little chocolates on hand it's a spa day and women are there to relax and nothing makes us relax more than a little piece of chocolate don't have too much because women will be tempted to eat a lot of it and we don't like that either for the actual spa treatments that you will be doing there are a few simple things you can do you said that you can't really buy anything which will be tough but if you end up being able to go shopping i would recommend running to a store like wal mart and buying a french manicure kit not the fake nails just the nail polish kit it will have instructions in it and little tools to use so that you can do it to yourself you can use it on your fingernails your toenails i love them and always have one on hand it looks very neat and professional if you follow the instructions depending on how many people you will have there you may want to buy kits you'll also want some regular nail polish on hand for women who just want a solid color another great spa treatment are facials you can definitely create some of your own at home a good way to open up your pores is to get a small bowl and fill it with boiling hot water make sure that your face is completely clean no makeup on it take a dishcloth or towel and while putting your face over the bowl of hot water put the towel around your head hair so that you are just above the water and that heat can unlock your pores it's very relaxing and feels great afterwards another good at home facial scrub is a brown sugar mask if you scrub your face with it it feels so nice afterwards too but be sure to combine it with water you can also use oatmeal honey if that's more convenient or you can just go to a store like wal mart again and they sell individually packaged face masks each with a different purpose they are very cheap and you can just buy a bunch of different kinds of masks let your friends pick out whichever ones seem good to them wear comfortable clothes don't get overly dressed up it's just a comfy event provide all the slippers you can for your guests so that their feet are comfortable and if you have any massage chairs or foot massage vibrators i would recommend busting those out too play some relaxing music in the background keep the lights kind of dim or let in lot's of natural light don't over decorate too much just make the room seem as airy and light as possible and remember to have fun too because you need to enjoy yourself too best of luck Breakfast Sento Japanese tea ceremony Customs and etiquette of Japan Coffee Tea Hamster Tofu Bread Cuisine of Denmark Upholstery Wood carving Japanese cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Rum Sauna Chocolate Ramen Tattoo Social rule The Apprentice 2 Massage Professional wrestling match types Strap-on dildo Ice cream Cuisine of Brazil Textile manufacturing Microeconomics Little Britain Professional wrestling slang Fecal incontinence Japanese toilet Jewish cuisine Sears Holdings Corporation Brewery Menstrual cup Humphrey Bogart Glass Avenue Q Mattress Beer The Amazing Race Bong Yerba mate Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gatorade Theory of conduct Wine Korean cuisine Teen Girl Squad Dim sum Diving suit Sin City Tire Cat Physical attractiveness Wal-Mart Great Teacher Onizuka Plastic The Penultimate Peril In-N-Out Burger Ron and Fez Shoe Domesticated turkey Swimming pool Tooth The Inside Clothing Fancy rat Futurama (TV series - season 2) Nail (anatomy) 613 mitzvot Knife Paul Is Dead Vinegar Domestic rabbit Porridge Dragon Booster Sushi Acne McDonald's Urinary incontinence Mid-levels Surveillance Roman eating and drinking Breastfeeding Sea-Monkey Happy Tree Friends Chopsticks The Smoking Room
