school pics next week is skool pics and i don't wear makeup at all can you help me figue out a way i can put a little bit of makeup on without it being tons and tons but still have that nice sweet picture day look and without my mom looking at me like what are you wearing on your face and without with my friends saying are you wearing makeup how should i put my hair up or down i think up 'cause my hair a is a tad too short right now what should i do to my hair thanks lots d no rude comments you don't need makeup to look gorgeous for school photos there are so many beautiful people in my year who don't wear makeup and looked absolutely gorgeous in the photos i think the people without makeup looked the best but if you really want to wear it then go lightly too much is definitely not a good look and you might get in trouble your weight in foundation is definitely not a recommendation i would suggest some black mascara or colourless if you're scared of getting busted by the teachers a hint of lipgloss not too shiny or red though stick to a natural sort of colour a little foundation and a tiny bit of blush i think you should stop there but if you want some more then a tiny bit of dark brown black eyeliner is good but smudge it slightly and remove some so you dont look like you have that much on the natural look is the best dont overdo it eyeshadow is unneccessary and will overdo it if you're worried about your mum then its best to drop the blush too the main things are lipgloss and mascara foundation and eyeliner isnt really needed as for your hair the only person who can tell you is yourself what do you want to see in your photos maybe do a different hairstyle than normal but not completely different simple and sweet is the best whatever you think looks nice you do it but if you're completely stuck then just go with your normal hairstyle with an extra clip or something to give it that something extra good luck and hope this helps remember its only a school photo say cheese and smile Cosmetics Social rule Marilyn Monroe 2000 Australian Grand Prix The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Dragon Booster Theory of conduct 1957 World Series Color Empire Burlesque My Little Pony Death rock fashion Physical attractiveness Phoebe Buffay's songs Kender Hair Avenue Q Kodocha Poker jargon Homestar Runner Humphrey Bogart Totally Spies!
