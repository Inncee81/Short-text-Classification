what should i wear for the first day of school i want to look super cute yet be comfortable i prefer jeans over skirts ok this sounds just like me we'll for my if it is kind of cold where you are you should wear skinny jeans but if it is hot just wear like denim short that has holes in it and for a shirt you should wear a nice blouse like a short sleeve shirt or a tubetop with flowers on it like almost beachy looking and for shoes wear flip flops or like black flats and wear like a black head band so it can match the black flats or the flip flops and jewlery i would keep it simply not too much maybe like dangling earrings or maybe a pearl necklace stuff like that and maybe wear your hair down straighten and for makeup just keep it simply just like the jewlery like lipgloss and light eyeshadow with a blush that kinda matches your skin tone listen i hope i helped and good luck for the first day of school Skinhead Bob Jones University Heavy metal fashion Diving suit Paul Is Dead Cosmetics Death rock fashion Mario Skirt and dress Japanese tea ceremony Comanche Canadian Armed Forces Violin The Warriors Denim Jesuit College Preparatory School Shirt Aerial (dance move) Suit (clothes) Gothic Lolita Professional wrestling throws Punk fashion Poker jargon Gramophone record Emo fashion Kilt Academic dress of Oxford University Grunge music Black Jeans School uniform Dragon Booster Napoleon Dynamite Social aspects of clothing Marching band Padm__ Amidala Beachwear Undergarment Fast bowling Haircut Trousers Black tie Coat (clothing) Nakoruru (Samurai Shodown) Troll Animal Crossing Lhoba High-heeled shoe Clothing terminology Raffles Girls' School (Secondary) Stereoscopy Physical attractiveness Marilyn Monroe Happy Tree Friends Johnny Appleseed Irish dance Girls Aloud Roxette Khampti Skateboarding trick Pearl Codename: Kids Next Door Characters of Naruto Bonfires of Saint John Suplex Jean Charles de Menezes Jewellery Swimming Raffles Institution Japanese school uniform Okashina Okashi Not The Nine O'Clock News Curling Clothing Shoe Textile manufacturing terminology Professional wrestling slang Madonna (entertainer) Mattress Kimono Urban beach Skate punk Phil and Lil DeVille Nu people Court dress The McGuire Sisters Doug Sailor fuku Equine conformation Churcher's College Sly & the Family Stone Rich Mullins Beavis and Butt-head Arsenal F.C.
