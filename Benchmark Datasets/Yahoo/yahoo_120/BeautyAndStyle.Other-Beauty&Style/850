have a new look worry about going back to school last year i was know as the rocker punk girl whatever you want to call it but now i have new look it's more colorful and more scene whatever you would call my style any way i am worry about going back to school cos i don't want people to think i am poser and i don't know how my friends and other people are gonna react also nobody has seen me all summer do you have any tips for me i am and going into the grade eh if you're and going into th grade people already really have their opinions of you so a slight clothes change isn't going to make people care not care i'd say by that age you know who your real friends are already and it doesn't matter oh and if you were the rocker punk girl they shouldn't try to mess with you haha if anyone says anything that's just plain weird that they paid that much attention and posers are usually the underclassmen so you basically get to determine whos the poser or not Philosophical skepticism Poser Pitaten Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide SLC Punk!
