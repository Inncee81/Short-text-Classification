what beauty school should i go to i am thinking about going to paul mitchell's nail academy in bartlett tn i went to nail school years ago and had a really bad experience i was in the same class with the cosmotogist and learned more about their craft than my own i managed to earn hours but i really want to finish and learn more about how to do nails do you know of anybody who has went through paul mitchell nail program or even better did you go through it yourself if so is it worth the money and did they really teach you about it or did they throw you in to learn all by yourself p s i have asked the previous school to send in my hours different times and they are yet to send them they keep saying they forgot but i really don't think they want to send them in i don't owe them money what should i do cause i don't want to start all over thanks don't waste your money your township should have adult vocational education classes it costs about because you are only paying for your tools blow dryers combs etc there is no charge for the class at all it starts in sept and ends in june and is only part time so you can still hold down a job while attending they teach you the basics and what you need to pass the test i have know many of people that have paid thousands for those other schools and although they passed the test they said it was a big waste of money when you can get the same for a few hundred Education in the People's Republic of China Graduate school Education in the United States Education Education in Portugal Education in England Education in Hong Kong Education in Germany Make money fast Education in Australia Community college GED No Child Left Behind Act Education reform Humphrey Bogart Martial art Time Out of Mind Nine Inch Nails Education in Taiwan Boy Scouts of America U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Nurse God Emperor of Dune Cleveland Browns PLATO Mutual fund Extreme Programming Newcastle United F.C.
