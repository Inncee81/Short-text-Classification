do you prefer to have regular baths or showers why both a bath is very pampering but it has become a habit of mine that when i get up from my bath i followed by a shower i must shower after a bath why cos the dirt would all be afloat and when one just stand up and reached for a bathrobe the dirt would still be on the skin so i must shower immediately after a bath Sento Hyperthermia Swimming USS Wadsworth (DD-516) Bathing Fecal incontinence Nudity USS Zane (DD-337) Gay bathhouse Orde Charles Wingate Order of the Bath Changeroom Urticaria Sunlight Elephant Bathroom Finnish sauna Breastfeeding Modesty Urolagnia Bath Rugby Ayyavazhi mythology USS Remey (DD-688) Shampoo Donkey Kong 64 Eczema Toilet USS Ammen (DD-527) Towel Fountain Meteor shower Childbirth Antioch, Pisidia Sauna Nitty Gritty Dirt Band Soap Beaches of Hong Kong Elvis Presley Flowers in the Dirt Customs and etiquette of Japan Pepper spray Turkish bath Niddah Onsen Roman Britain Otitis externa Sleep Dirt Vlad III Dracula Swimsuit Spanish verbs Clothing Splash pad Cat Moe Szyslak Alaskan Bush Hydrotherapy Social rule Strip search Christ's College, Cambridge GWR FM (Bristol & Bath) USS Astoria (CA-34) MV Galaxy Comfrey Japanese toilet Teen Girl Squad Bath, Maine Karen McDougal Hammam Socrate USS Preble (DD-345) Jock itch USS Terry (DD-513) Battle of Chalons Krzeszowice Washroom River Avon, Bristol Imperial Guard (Warhammer 40,000 army) Abbey Bradford on Avon Guinness Premiership American Eskimo Dog Comanche Bengali language Cobra Commander USS Taylor (DD-468) Dirt track racing Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts Ninja Scroll Texas Revolution Bidet Mosquito Adi Shankara Homosexuality and Islam Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington Skin Chatsworth House Cosmic ray Nuclear fallout Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath
