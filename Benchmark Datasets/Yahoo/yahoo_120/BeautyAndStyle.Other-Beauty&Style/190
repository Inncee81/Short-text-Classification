i have a question about nails i have recently stopped biting my nails and i don't know how i shoudl shape them do you think rounded or squared nails look better square shaped rounded nails make your fingers appear stubbier thicker and shorter but they are also easier to do things with l a square tip will elongate your fingers and make them appear a bit thinner i think it also looks much nice as if you take good care of yourself oh and if you let your nails grow and you make them square they will look like you got them done a nail shop but instead of having fake nails your will be real and if you wear rings or bracelets a square shaped nails look much better to have to help you achieve that square look after you cut them with a clipper file them straight down to get a straight line so use a nail filer to p s do not bite your nails anymore ok it makes them very weak and it takes time for them to grow healthy and strong use a nail strengthner like sally hansen for now Nail (anatomy) Manicure Violin Drill bit Knife Screw Textile manufacturing Leaf Strap-on dildo Hair Saxophone Nail (engineering) Equine conformation Wood Upholstery Diamond Pedicure Tire Woodworking Volleyball Harmonica Chess strategy and tactics Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Clarinet Trent Reznor Snooker Blood (computer game) Nine Inch Nails RuneScape skills Milton H.
