haircut and highlights best answer pts i have really dark brown hair here is a pic of what it looks like http tinypic com view php pic fnr h i'm getting a haircut tomorrow what kind should i get and i want highlights what color should i get and can you send me a link of what color you have in mind thanks i dont think you should cut it in lenght because i seriously regret cutting my hair maybe ask your hairdresser to give you some layers that would be nice the side bangs are very nice too for the highlights i strongly advise you not to get red because it turns out like rust color after a while or if you absolutely want to get highlights there are some hair dye things that are only for virgin hair and you can use it without bleaching your hair there is less damage done so yea kk hope this helped maybe just a slightly lighter brown than what you have to make it look the most natural possible someting like this but lighter http www istockphoto com file thumbview approve istockphoto brown hair girl jpg if i were you i wouldnt to highlights because it ruins the texture of your hair but eehh its your decision Haircut Hair color Hair coloring Hair HyperText Transfer Protocol Dragon Booster Emo fashion Barbie Kimono Color Human skin color Death rock fashion Drawing Color theory Physical attractiveness W.I.T.C.H.
