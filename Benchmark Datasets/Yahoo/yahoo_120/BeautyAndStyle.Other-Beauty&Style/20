im scared to get a pedicure for the first time for some reason im afraid they might think my foot are ugly ahahahaa don't be pedi's are amazing and if you're feet are ugly which i'm sure they arent that bad they'll be beautiful afterwards if you're selfconsciences about your feet to begin with a pedi will help so much just think of all the nasty old grandma feet and smelly toes they already deal with they've seen the worst already so don't worry my best advice is just to shower and wash your feet before you go and wear shorts or capris have fun Athlete's foot Diving Social rule Milton H.
