ok i know this is going to sound like a really weird question but i want to get my nails done but i have wieirdly shaped thumb nails as they are quite wide basically i don't want to go to get them done only to be told that they don't have nails to fit as that would be really embarassing my question is do they have a wide range of sizes of nails and so this scenario is unlikely to happen hiya no that isn't likely to happen at all there are wider artificial tips available however check with the salon first before you book as they may not have them in stock other than that you could always have them sculpted on thats where they place a piece of foil on the nail build the nail from either acrylic of gel if i were you i would go with gel gel is much kinder to your own nail underneath xx Manicure Violin Bass guitar "Weird Al" Yankovic Bong Lighting Stairway Anchor Screw Double bass Milton H.
