help with tanning i am trying to build up a base tan before i go on vacation yes i know tanning is evil but with that aside i need some advise for building a base tan in a tanning bed my first question is do the lotions really help or are they just a gimmick second question is should i tan a little each day and not really see results or tan enough so that i burn a tiny bit and take a day off ok tanning is okay to do it is no worse than the sun the max u can usually go in a bed is minutes its a good ideo to do less than have of the max time depending on wut bed if u can go into a bed that has less burning rays at my salon this bed is called the ergoline aka the bronzing bed i never go in a bed without a lotion i use sunblock on the areas that are uv sensitive like my tattoos etc all lotions accelerate ur tan a lotion with a bronzer in it is great but make sure to apply in a circular motion and apply evenly also wipe ur hands with a towel after applying and before u go into the bed the best way to get tanned is to exfoliate times a week tan with an accelorator then apply plenty of moisturizer afterwards if u feel like ur getting to warm in the bed jump out and if u get pink then wait until it goes away before u go back in u really have to mainly worry about the areas that are lighter where u have tan lines once u feel like u are not getting enough increase it min at a time hope this helped Sunscreen Sunburn Manicure Upholstery Mattress Sunlight Sento Kepler's laws of planetary motion Scabies Ultraviolet Psoriasis Pubic hair Tattoo Nudism LSD Brewery Social rule Spanking Theory of conduct Eczema Trajectory Spacecraft propulsion Aloe Weight training Breastfeeding Explosive material The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Acne Houseplant Planetary orbit Hipparchus (astronomer) Dog Prostate cancer Wolfrider Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Latitude Stomach cancer Urticaria Sewage treatment Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Particle accelerator Comanche Color theory Insomnia Leather Table tennis Personal lubricant Malignant melanoma Plastic Loudspeaker Sleep Turbocharger Joseph (Hebrew Bible) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area E85 Password Time Karl Rove Apollo 8 Hydrogen peroxide Map projection Trigonometric function Equine conformation Futurama (TV series - season 5) Certified Nursing Assistant Standing wave ratio Dyspareunia Menstrual cup Kibbutz Shaving STS-59 Comet Strap-on dildo Wang Chongyang Supernova Goodness and value theory Sugarcane Treehouse of Horror V Characters in the Smurfs CPU cache Volleyball Neighbours Disc brake Philosophical skepticism Professional wrestling throws Textile manufacturing terminology Bacon Year Sundial Flea Tire Unemployment Crab louse Solar system Knife Jon Secada
