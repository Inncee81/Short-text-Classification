first day of high school help what am i supposed to expect i'm starting high school in exactly a week and i need help i'm kinda nervous can you give me some advice on how to act and what to do please don't be scared it's just school and even though you're in high school now it's still just school granted the oldest people on the campus are legal adults but that's besides the point remember being a sixth grader going into middle school and all of the eighth graders especially the boys looked so big and scary but when you became an eighth grader you realized they weren't big at all it's kind of like that more than anything be nice upperclassmen are full of themselves and they'll hate you for no other reason than you're a freshman i just graduated high school and i made a vow in sophomore year to never be rude to freshmen just beause they're freshmen then i realized that freshmen can be really obnoxious so i hated them for that instead of just for the fact that they're freshmen but here's the thing if you're nice upperclassmen are more likely to accept you if you're loud and obnoxious and do stupid stuff upperclassmen are likely to f ing hate you just be sweet and smile a lot everyone likes a cute little freshman girl that smiles a lot good luck you'll do great The Citadel (Military College) Recurring South Park characters Education in the United States 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story Rich Mullins Social rule Kim Possible Case Western Reserve University Student New Trier High School Georgia Institute of Technology Little Britain The Emancipation of Mimi Sin City Avenue Q Cliff Richard The Fairly OddParents Azumanga Daioh Garfield Humphrey Bogart Stuyvesant High School The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Blood on the Tracks Duke University Texas A&M University Corps of Cadets FoxTrot Empire Burlesque Okashina Okashi Brown University The Beach Boys Theory of conduct Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Pennsylvania State University Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Girly Urusei Yatsura Virginia Military Institute Princeton University Hall & Oates Rocko's Modern Life Ranma __ characters Ron Weasley South Park Shawn Michaels Kelly Clarkson Codename: Kids Next Door Quizbowl Characters in the Smurfs Jesuit College Preparatory School Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Phillips Exeter Academy University of Pennsylvania Ron and Fez Full Metal Panic?
