facial help i got a facial for a present and i have never gotten one before it is a deep deep pore cleaning one can you please tell me what to expect and what i should do before i go there like not wearing makeup or something thanks soo much congratulations facials are wonderful if you wear make up there they will remove it they will do a couple of different types of cleansing toning and moisturising i'd probably opt for no make up unless you have to go to work first or whatever and it's not practical to go without it at the end of the facial you may 'glow' slightly it's no cause for concern it's just that your circulation is improved in your face the effect will fade in a few minutes' time Tattoo Cleanser Blushing Skin Beard The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film) Strap-on dildo Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Eczema Dry cleaning Acne John F.
