how to get the food smell out okay so i am in a hospitality foods class in school we cook all the time but whenever we cook something with a really strong odor tacos anything with garlic or onions i end up smelling like that food for the rest of the day it is so noticeable that my teacher would ask who has food in class i can't change in the middle of the day or go home and change so i was wondering if anyone had any solutions i would rather not walk around smelling like a taco lol oh and i have tried spraying perfume but i end up smelling like food and perfume any suggestions just bring febreze and spray it on your clothes perfume just covers up the smell but febreze will completely take the smell out if you dont want to carry around a big bottle of febreze then find an empty perfume bottle and put some febreze in an empty perfume bottle Perfume Odor Olfaction Halitosis Garlic Tofu Kitchen Cantonese cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Angel One (TNG episode) Taco Flatulence Onion French fries Jennifer Lopez The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Breastfeeding RuneScape quests Hangi Jewish cuisine Bong Smells Like Teen Spirit Mountain Dew Stir frying John Peel Chile pepper The Dalek Invasion of Earth Coconut crab 21 July 2005 London bombings Japanese tea ceremony Toilet humour Deodorant RuneScape locations Taco Bell Hydrogen peroxide Guerlain Peruvian cuisine Olive oil Ammonia Cannabis cultivation Physical attractiveness Roman eating and drinking Gloom (Pok__mon) Sage Piccolo Junior Saga Water Barbecue D__ner kebab Japanese cuisine Starch Gaia Online Cuisine of Brazil Trademark American lobster Basic taste Plastic American Black Bear Propane Solvent Cheese Common cold Hamburger Fast-food restaurant Bedbug 28 Days Later Sexual attraction First Fleet Pickling Diseases of the honeybee Externality Natt__ Worcestershire sauce April Fool's Day Skunk Shoe Kurt Cobain World War Three (Doctor Who) Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Manic Street Preachers Sleeping with the Enemy (Simpsons episode) Clothing Pasta Thiol Jackass: The Movie French cuisine Asparagus Cantharellus Comanche Moonraker Beavis and Butt-head W.I.T.C.H.
