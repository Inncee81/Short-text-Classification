where exactly do you put eyeliner i always thought that you put it on that piece of skin between your eyeball and lower lashes like the part when you pull your bottom eye down but when i tried it it made my eye look so small or do you put it on the bottom of your top lidd help please everyone says it looks so good but i want to know where to put it and liquid or solid one i always apply eyeliner right on my lower lash line and then smudge lightly for the smoky texture a pure straight line often looks unnatural for the top lid i draw the line right above the lash line this will make your eyes look dramatic and even more so if you pair with mascara liquid eyeliner is very tricky i sometimes use it on my top lid mostly for evening wear i like the liner pencils best of all they are more natural looking Drawing Pottery Mascara Professional wrestling throws Water (molecule) Casting Zippo Solar cell Brewery Mattress Professional wrestling match types Wassily Kandinsky Diving suit Textile manufacturing Glossary of nautical terms Stereoscopy Pastel Sunglasses Fire fighting Double bass Indian Oil Cup 2005 Diamond Poker jargon Wood carving Billiards Box Ice cream 1957 World Series Sushi Gas metal arc welding Eye contact Canal lock Upholstery Glass Violin Tofu Great Smoky Mountains National Park Professional wrestling holds Knitting Pok__mon Abilities Portable stove R.E.M.
