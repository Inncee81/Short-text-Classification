do i have a shot at modeling i want it so bad http i photobucket com albums x summern summer jpg http i photobucket com albums x summern summer jpg i'm getting my braces off modeling is a very hard career to get yourself into they want people that look like sticks these days you are beautiful i would definitely think you have a chance just know that you are beautiful in general and because one agency doesn't think you are that doesn't mean that another one won't think the exact opposite so my advice is don't get your hopes up for any big agencies because they want twigs as models and you are beautiful dont ever think you are different and definitely do not think you are overweight or fat because you have a perfect body so do not do any crash dieting i do think you have a very good getting hired though just start small and hopefully someday you will become big best wishes Bon Jovi Jennifer Lopez Jon Secada Girls Aloud Drill bit Bad Religion Peter Shilton Obesity Recurring South Park characters Atomic Kitten The Notorious B.I.G.
