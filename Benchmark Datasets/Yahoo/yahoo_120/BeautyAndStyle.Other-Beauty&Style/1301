acrylic nails i'm thinking about getting them after i seen a friend of mine wearing them and they were so gorgeous anyway before i buy but i'm kinda worried cause' i heard about this lady who had them and when she took them off because they were glued on her real fingernail came off with it eww i wanna know how long they stay for what would happen if they just fall off and would your real nails fall off or bleed or anything horrible like that thanks you are supposed to get them filled every weeks only if you rip them off will ur real nail be damaged the proper way to remove them is to soak ur nails in acetone whitch they have a nail shops they usually will only charge a few bucks to do it too good luck Nail (anatomy) Manicure Acetone Roswell UFO incident Tire Upholstery Horseshoe The Marshall Mathers LP Professional wrestling match types Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Jon Secada Solvent Bong Megan Griffin Piccolo Junior Saga Humphrey Bogart Cyanoacrylate Inhalant Seismic retrofit Social rule EastEnders The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Emancipation of Mimi Nine Inch Nails Year of the Spider McFly 2000 Australian Grand Prix Blood (computer game) Happy Tree Friends The Inside Mattress Traumatic brain injury Time Out of Mind Poker jargon RuneScape weapons Sheryl Crow Avenue Q Cliff Richard First Battle of the Atlantic Naval mine Static Shock The Perishers Harp Hip hop collaborations Luck Socrate Salad Fingers Limp Bizkit Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Critic True Crime: Streets of LA RuneScape skills Kenny McCormick I Want to Hold Your Hand Knife Blonde on Blonde Neighbours Characters of Naruto Hydrogen peroxide Elton John Hip hop rivalries GunZ The Duel Friedrich Schleiermacher Father's Day (Doctor Who) Cruising (maritime) Sin City Callus Friends Rais massacre Paul Is Dead Gelatin 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Spidey Super Stories The Apprentice 3 1986 World Series TLC Timeline of alternative rock Pedicure Rocko's Modern Life The Ashlee Simpson Show Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Milton H.
