how do you give your self a french manicure a good one i buy the white line stickers that you lay across your nail then you paint above the sticker in white then when they dry take the sticker off i usually get white on my skin or sometimes a little seeps under the sticker so i dip a q tip in nail polish remover to take that off then when the white is completely dry i paint the whole nail in either a clear gloss or a tinted gloss if i use a tinted gloss then i wait till that dries and then cover the whole nail in a clear gloss because your nails will look shiny and chip less if you do that it takes me about an hour to do the whole process but they look like i went to a salon afterwards i've had people ask where i got them done Pedicure Glaze Vehicle registration plate Wound Label Pottery Knife Leather Upholstery Casting Chocolate Textile manufacturing Bulk vending Paint Bus stop Cosmetics Tobacco Acrylic paint Cosmetology Physical characteristics of the Buddha Gilding Poker jargon Ocean's Twelve Hair Gloss Acetone Drainage Woodworking Nitrocellulose Drill bit Bong Lake District Dialysis Common bean Diamond enhancement In-N-Out Burger Voodoo Socrate Nile crocodile Glacier Wood carving Tattoo Niddah Leaf Fecal incontinence __douard Manet Gelatin Material properties of diamond Thermal power station Shock Tanning Lacquer Graffiti Bacon Shroud of Turin Sushi Tire Triage Miniature (illuminated manuscript) Sinclair ZX81 Soldering Batik Seismic retrofit Sega Saturn Hemp Naval mine Hangul Red ochre Top-bar hive Arcade cabinet Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Eug__ne Delacroix Animal Crossing Colours, standards and guidons Blue Impressionism Gamut Burial Primer (paint) Comanche Johnny the Homicidal Maniac Saturday Night Live commercial Nine Inch Nails Bike lane debate Vulgar Latin State funeral of John F.
