l'oreal true match foundation hi i just wanted to know what people's opinion is on l'oreal true match foundation and also if anyone had a foundation they preferred to this one the next question i wanted to ask which has nothing to do with foundation is that i have a top which has a kind of hole in the back and therefore shows the bra bit where it does up i have a bra which has plastic shoulder straps that are see through and so i was wondering if anyone knew of a bra which has a see through back strap of the bra hopefully if it is made of plastic it will not be as noticeable and if anyone has any other ideas of bras i could wear with the top as i am not comfortable with not wearing a bra thankyou and sorry for not making a lot of sense i don't think the halterneck bra would work because you would still see the back of the bra where you do it up thankyou anyway for your help it isn't the straps which are a problem it is the back of the bra where you do it up which you would be able to see because the top has a hole on the back of the top which shows your back i have tried the true match foundation and found it a little too thick for my liking however i liked the powder compact it went on light and gave nice but natural looking coverage i think for the bra it would depend on what kind of opening in the back of the shirt it is have you considered a strapless bra that may work out the best Brassiere Strap-on dildo Undergarment Shirt Professional wrestling match types Mattress Theory of conduct Social aspects of clothing Snowboard Shoe Jockstrap M16 (rifle) Epistemology Avenue Q Drill bit Floppy disk Knife Glossary of ballet terms Diving suit Plastic Jumpstart 3rd Grade Germaine Greer Black hole Violin Bicycle helmet Snowboarding The Lumberjack Song Compact disc Archery Brewery Hey Jude Equine conformation Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Caprice Bourret Dragon Booster Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy Vegeta Textile manufacturing Tiger Woods Debra Marshall Okashina Okashi Motor oil Gramophone record The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Radiohead Menstrual cup Radio Yerevan Buoyancy compensator Donald Davidson (philosopher) Hamster Extreme Programming Datalore (TNG episode) Gurkha Contingent Floorball Kimono Firearm Vacuous truth NASCAR Scientific method Philosophical skepticism Internal ballistics Tenshinhan Time travel Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Tire Corset Conspiracy (TNG episode) Bong De Lorean DMC-12 Expert system Garth Brooks Casualty lifting The Legend of Zelda series enemies Casting The Ashlee Simpson Show Tyra Banks Breastfeeding Ranma __ characters Chair Professional wrestling slang EastEnders John Wycliffe Characters in the Smurfs Time Out of Mind Mary Phelps Jacob Brush Skinhead Langstroth hive Leather WrestleMania XX Volleyball Lost City (Stargate SG-1) Beauty and the Beast (1991 film) The Emancipation of Mimi W.
