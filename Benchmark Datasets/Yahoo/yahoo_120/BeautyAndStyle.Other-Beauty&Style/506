how is it looked upon when a guy uses colored contacts i was using colored contacts sometime ago just for fun to see how my look changes with a different eye color i got really mixed reactions from people forget getting to how i look but most people were shocked and gave freaked up reactions just to find that i was using colored contacts my personal opinion was it did not look totally crazy and of course i chose a color which went with my skin but i really enjoyed wearing them but i just want to know how is it looked upon in general and if its ok if a guy uses such things just be yourself if you want to wear them then wear them if you are asking for personal opinions then i would think it was unusual maybe strange i honestly don't think i have ever seen a man wear colored contacts question is do you want to be different and not affraid to be an individual answer that question for yourself and then make your decision good luck Social rule Theory of conduct The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Sub-Zero The nature of God in Western theology Tattoo Eye contact The Ashlee Simpson Show Shaggy dog story Spontaneous human combustion Plame affair Dualism (philosophy of mind) Dragons (Pern) Black Sexual orientation Dragon Booster Aesthetic Realism Sunglasses Joke The Emancipation of Mimi The Apprentice 2 Black (people) Scientology beliefs and practices Humphrey Bogart Social psychology Sharon Tate Avenue Q Phoebe Buffay's songs Good Morning, Vietnam Equal Protection Clause Autism President (game) Game show Culture shock Consensus decision-making The Amazing Race Buddy Guy Joker (comics) White (people) Meaning of life Paul Is Dead New York Giants Altruism Color Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Abduction Phenomenon Opportunity rover Subud Eye color Samuel Alito Martial art Kimi Finster Rei Ayanami Invader Zim Sulfuric acid Physical attractiveness Statistical survey Nick Berg Contact lens Little Britain Clarence Thomas I Am the Walrus Combat stress reaction 613 mitzvot Human skin color God Emperor of Dune Cosmetics The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Allergy Rich Mullins Hair color Camp Lazlo Lamanite Time Out of Mind Paul W.
