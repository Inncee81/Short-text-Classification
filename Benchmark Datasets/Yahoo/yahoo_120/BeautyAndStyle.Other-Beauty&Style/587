do most graphic design art related jobs allow visible piercings tattoos dressing creatively this may seem like a silly question but how is a person supposed to express their creative energy and abilities if they're confined to a suit and tie are most jobs casual in that field well it's hard to say that all jobs require a suit and a tie and vice versa most graphic designers freelancs or they are self employed so they dress however they want to if you are work for a company then it depends on what company you work for how big the company is and your position for example if you work for pepsi or some other huge company in nyc then it's obvious you should dress in appropriate dress pants and shirt also if you are a senior graphic designer then you obviously do not want to go to your office looking like a clown also if you work for children's books toys etc then i suppose you can be creative with your looks since the environment in that company wouldn't be the same as in a pepsi company so it all depends on a number of things i guess the creativity you lose from your looks you can add to your work Computer IPod Game programmer Social aspects of clothing Trademark The Apprentice 2 Suit (clothes) Undergarment Bob Jones University Intellectual property Mac OS X Sento Apple Macintosh Bicycle The Sims Expanded Universe (Star Wars) Jackass: The Movie Spidey Super Stories Art Margin of error Amiga American football strategy Black tie Jesuit College Preparatory School Professor Cowboy ITunes Music Store Graphic design Apple Computer Password Beavis and Butt-head Iron Man Academia Explosive material Pixar Steve Jobs Cheating in Counter-Strike Construction User Friendly Will Eisner ISO 9000 Tattoo Theory of conduct Modern Age of Comic Books Hip hop rivalries IBM Creative industries Piccolo Junior Saga SpongeBob SquarePants Management Culture of the United States Space suit Florida Central Voter File Drama Patent IBM PC compatible School uniform Extreme Programming W.
