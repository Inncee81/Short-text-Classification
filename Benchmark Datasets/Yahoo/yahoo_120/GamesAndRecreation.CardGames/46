in texas holdem nl event who do you think would win a heads up mike matusow or jamie gold me and my friend were arguing over who would win i said mike and he said gold it really depends on who gets lucky i really think that poker even texas holdem nl is more than luck despite what the experts will tell you now if they start out with the same chip count and noone gets a lucky streak and the winning depends entirely on play making as opposed to hand making i do believe that jamie gold may have a bit of an edge i despise the guy and think that he is as cocky as anything but he is less likely to lose his temper and his head edit please mike matusow is overrated another edit maverick maverick maverick gosh why do you resort to calling people names when they happen to have a dissenting opinion i happen to think mike matusow is overrated you cite instances when he won so what moneymaker won the wsop main event he sucks even scotty nguyen has won the wsop main event and he sucks more than anybody point is just because someone has won something major doesn't mean he's the greatest no limit player on the planet it's all subjective you ask people who the best player is and they will all have dissenting opinions there's just no way to make a case so jamie gold caught a lot of lucky breaks to win the wsop everyone needs to catch a lucky break now and then to win anything just because he got lucky doesn't mean he sucks i think he can play pretty well at times make mistake at other times i can't really say that he's a better player than matusow but he's irritating and if you want to win against matusow the best way to do it is to irritate him that's why i think gold would win p s i think they're both overrated to me the best texas holdem nl player is ted forrest but again that is subjective Texas hold 'em World Series of Poker World Series of Poker, 2005 Poker jargon Doyle Brunson Omaha hold 'em Stu Ungar Mike Matusow T.
