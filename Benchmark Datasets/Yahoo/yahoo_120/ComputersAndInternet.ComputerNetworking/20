virgin media adsl so slow at night i recently had an mb virgin media adsl line put in in the mornings the connection is fine speed tests show it runs at about mb however in the evening it's a complete other story i'm lucky if i register k connection on the speed test websites take forever to load etc i called them today and was advised i was still in the day connection period and things would definitely settle down after that are things likely to even out over the next few days or is this a very common problem with virgin and i'm best to get well rid they told me i wasn't bottlenecked they also claimed they couldn't test my line and that it would be bt's fault if there was a problem which i find hard to believe i don't want to pay for something if i can't use it while i can't personally comment on vm i will say that every dsl connection i've had has been crap cable modems are far superior to dsl while i was running a dsl modem i would constantly get slow speeds random interrupts and things the company would blame me for imo get a cable modem if one is available Modem Digital Subscriber Line Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Cable television Ethernet Internet service provider Integrated Services Digital Network Acorn Computers Eircom Cable modem Craps NTL Universal Serial Bus Password Power line communication Asynchronous Transfer Mode USB flash drive 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Computer hardware Broadband Slashdot subculture Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Internet Alcatel Oasis (band) Apple Computer Softmodem 2003 North America blackout MTV Telstra IBM PC compatible Extreme Programming Etisalat Telephone exchange Router Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina IP Multimedia Subsystem DOCSIS Virgin Mobile Luck IMac Prodigy (ISP) Serial port The Chemical Brothers Spyware HomePNA Parachute High-speed rail Sonic the Hedgehog Shit Null modem Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing One Tree Hill (TV series) Ravi Shastri Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Limp Bizkit Sega Dreamcast Virgin Trains Acorn Electron Telegraphy Oscilloscope EarthLink Bell Sympatico Commodore 64 Heinkel He 100 IPod Ben Johnson (athlete) Dial-up access Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Digital circuit CNN Plame affair Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Pseudorandom number generator Messerschmitt Me 262 CPU design Roswell UFO incident Hayes command set PlayStation 2 File sharing BT Group plc Television in the United States Social rule John Lennon Xbox Domain-specific programming language GSM services 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 TransUnion Hard disk Street-Legal Texas Instruments Von Neumann architecture 2005 United States Grand Prix
