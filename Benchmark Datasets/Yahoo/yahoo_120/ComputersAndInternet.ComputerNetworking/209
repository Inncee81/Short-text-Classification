university portal is not visible accessible by users on different vlan i am web developer in a company currently we developed a web portal which will be used inside the campus only intranet the problem is that users on different vlan are not able see the portal it is not accessible to them can anyone say something on this please well it appears to me you have two choices open the router up to allow the portal to be internet viewable you need to port forward port for http port for ftp port for https etc to the local portal server private address then those outside your lan can see the portal or you need to setup a vpn which will issue local lan addresses when outside users want to connect to the local network to view the intranet a vpn creates a new tunnel to your local system and the remote users become part of the local network it is more secure than an open internet connection now for the third possibility now that i see you said vlan meaning all have local addresses and not wan addressing those vlan users are indeed on the inside of the same system just on different ip's and subnets your portal host is on for instance and the other vlans are x you can change the subnet mask of your network to allow all your local addresses to communicate internally the subnet has to be big enough to allow all the addresses with all the lans just visit http www learntosubnet com for a full explanation Intranet Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Virtual private network Internet Local area network IP address HyperText Transfer Protocol Uniform Resource Locator Virtual LAN Novell NetWare AppleTalk Proxy server Ethernet Secure Shell Wi-Fi X Window System Router Subnetwork Wget Firewall (networking) Virtual Network Computing Denial-of-service attack History of the Internet Transmission Control Protocol Cisco Systems Internet Group Management Protocol Domain Name System File Transfer Protocol Internet protocol suite Web browser Jabber Wireless Application Protocol Web service Website Voice over IP Common Unix Printing System World Wide Web Internet privacy Netfilter/iptables Web portal Enterprise content management Pretty Good Privacy Data retention Password Classless Inter-Domain Routing Windows XP HTTP cookie America Online E-mail Quake Wiki Quality of service Windows Server 2003 Cisco PIX IP Multimedia Subsystem Transport Layer Security Web crawler Web application Whois Opera (web browser) Web hosting Mozilla Application Suite Broadband Internet access Wireless LAN Cross site scripting Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Squid cache Bluetooth Microsoft .NET Netscape Communications Corporation Mozilla Firefox Streaming media SAML Server Message Block I2P Port numbers GameFAQs Computer security MAC address University College London Grid computing Gmail PHP Friend-to-friend Uniform Resource Identifier Domain name Linux
