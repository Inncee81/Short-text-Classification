how do i deal with network hoggers there are three computers in this house and someone we'll call him hogger is always using one of the computers to download it can get very annoying for the rest of us who would like to surf the web or play online games sometimes we get little or no internet where as the hogger gets all of the broadband internet we have blocked him from the router however he is catching on the router we have is d link i don't understand why when the other computers download it doesn't suck up the internet like his i would like to limit his connection or block him from using downloading programs he uses ethernet and wireless we are fed up of asking him politely i would like to raise hell perhaps give him a virus or hog the internet as well please help me find a way to repay him under the advanced tab on your dlink router this is a firewall option you can use this to allow or deny trafic on certain ports if the hogger is downloading using a torent or peer to peer program try blocking traffic on ports to to his ip or mac address it wont stop the hogging all together but it will slow the hogging down for sure Denial-of-service attack Router Firewall (networking) Skype Ethernet Internet Network address translation BitTorrent Wi-Fi Computer virus Kazaa Streaming media Quality of service Voice over IP Peer-to-peer Wireless LAN Nintendo DS MAC address Differentiated services Xbox Nintendo Revolution Opera (web browser) Internet Group Management Protocol Poker jargon Internet protocol suite Netfilter/iptables Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Friend-to-friend Internet security Digital Subscriber Line Open Shortest Path First Cisco Systems Internet service provider AOL Instant Messenger Transmission Control Protocol Network switch Commodore 64 Broadband Internet access Stopping e-mail abuse PlayStation 3 ITunes Internet censorship in mainland China Mac OS X World Wide Web PowerPC Telegraphy MSN Messenger Steam (content delivery) Linux Computer and video games Email authentication Web service E-mail IPv6 Computer security Perl Wget PlayStation 2 America Online IPv4 Asynchronous Transfer Mode Proxy server Wireless access point AirPort Cisco PIX Tor (anonymity network) Malware WiMAX Spam (electronic) File Transfer Protocol Microsoft Windows Blue screen of death E-mail spam Halo: Combat Evolved Password Universal Serial Bus Macromedia Flash Musical Instrument Digital Interface Computer Internet fraud IP address Computer network Thread (computer science) Gmail HyperCard Virtual private network Data retention Routing Serial communications Diablo II: Lord of Destruction
