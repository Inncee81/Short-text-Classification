router modem question i have a router modem that stopped working today i was wondering that instead of buying an expensive one from my internet service provider couldn't i just buy a modem router from a store or does it have to be one from my isp if i can buy one from a store do i just hook it up and surf the web or do i have to set something up thank you it depends on the isp you may need a specific modem to work on their network even if you buy a generic one from the store and it works you're on your own for support the best thing to do is call your isp and ask them about it Internet service provider Differentiated services Denial-of-service attack Router Network address translation Cable modem Satellite internet Digital Subscriber Line Telegraphy Voice over IP Wi-Fi Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Password Internet Group Management Protocol Internet privacy CompuServe E-mail spam ITU-T Online service provider Spam Prevention Early Warning System ZigBee Web hosting Private branch exchange Netfilter/iptables History of the Internet America Online Communications protocol General Packet Radio Service Integrated Services Digital Network Telecom New Zealand Power line communication Cable television Peering Dial-up access Border Gateway Protocol MIPS architecture MDAC Usenet MAC address Open mail relay HomePNA X.25 Domain Name System Stopping e-mail abuse DOCSIS AppleTalk EarthLink Prodigy (ISP) Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Teletext Email authentication Cisco Systems Spam (electronic) Asynchronous Transfer Mode Tier 1 carrier Tesco Autonomous system (Internet) Netcom (USA) Time Warner Electronic Frontier Foundation Streaming media Integrated services Prestel E-mail BT Group plc IiNet Broadband Spyware Internet fraud Lag Session Initiation Protocol Cisco IOS Routing Multiprotocol Label Switching Minitel Point-to-Point Protocol Atari 8-bit family Videotex Wireless LAN Data retention PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3 GSM services Onion Routing Tor (anonymity network) Local area network Telkom Alcatel Xerox Network Services Phreaking Linux Telmex IS-IS GIF Profile
