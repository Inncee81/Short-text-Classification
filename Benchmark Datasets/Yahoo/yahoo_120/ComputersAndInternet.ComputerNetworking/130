wt happen in the ring n bus topology if of the station in unplugged do you mean token ring and the bus topologies respectively that's easy if one of the stations is unplugged then signals will not be able to pass that point it's sort of like having an impassable wreck on the interstate where nothing on either side can pass or communicate that is but one reason why the star topology is superior Token ring Ethernet Network topology Topological space Compact space Fibre Channel Bus network Adjoint functors MetroCard Complex number Computer network Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority School bus Topology London Underground Algebraic geometry Spectrum of a ring Commutative ring Algebraic topology Kolmogorov space Sheaf (mathematics) Manifold Local ring Homotopy Functor Public transport Bay Area Rapid Transit Computer bus Product topology Separation axiom FireWire Silver Line (MBTA) Scheme (mathematics) Projective plane Topological vector space Group action Glossary of scheme theory SmartRider Differential geometry and topology Wormhole Wishbone (computer bus) Nonblocking minimal spanning switch KCR West Rail Hiawatha Line General topology Miami-Dade Transit Interstate Commerce Commission Kowloon Motor Bus Transportation in Richmond, Virginia Discrete space EIA-485 Reading railway station Continuous function (topology) Compactification (mathematics) Topology glossary Dimension ALOHAnet Rail terminology Formal power series Topological manifold Topologies on the set of operators on a Hilbert space Connected space Topological property Quotient space Morse theory Real number U.S. Highway 66 Paracompact space Principal homogeneous space Transportation of Los Angeles Covering map New World First Bus CPU design Bus stop San Francisco Bay Area Grothendieck topology Euclidean space Homeomorphism PCI Express Mathematics Cable television Toronto Transit Commission Hausdorff space Simplex Sinclair ZX81 Generic point Pointless topology Areas of mathematics VHF omnidirectional range Ottawa O-Train Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority MBTA buses in South Boston CityRail MTA New York City Transit buses Algebraic structure P-adic number Universal Serial Bus
