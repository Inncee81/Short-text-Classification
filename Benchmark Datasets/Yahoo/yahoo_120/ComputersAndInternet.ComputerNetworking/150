router connection problems heres the problem i connected everything in the right spot but when i try to use the internet it wont work it doesnt say a connection is unplugged or there is no internet connection there are no warning signs or pop ups saying that i have no internet connection and all the lights in my modem and router says good but when i try to use the internet it wont work but every time i use the modem and put the router out of the way traditional modem to pc connection it does work can anyone help me on this people tell me to change my ip address and what not but i dont know how to do that sometimes the router works randomly but then it disconnects me and when i try to connect it again it wont work anymore hi there i would first try and log into your router's settings to do this you're going to have to put the router's ip address in the address bar of your favorite browser once you have done that make sure you have the correct settings set for dsl a pppoe connection dhcp etc i don't think it has anything to do with changing your ip address most likely it is a setting on your router that needs to be changed Router Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Digital Subscriber Line Denial-of-service attack Modem Password Domain Name System MAC address Communications protocol Voice over IP Differentiated services Point-to-Point Protocol Wi-Fi Broadband Internet access IPv4 Routing Border Gateway Protocol America Online IP address Netfilter/iptables Email authentication Internet fraud Lag Cisco Systems Novell NetWare Atomic Kitten Internet protocol suite IPv6 Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Internet security Uniform Resource Locator Hayes command set Wireless LAN History of the Internet Dialer Cable modem Ethernet Streaming media X.25 Open Shortest Path First Federal Standard 1037C Integrated Services Digital Network Internet service provider Spyware Open mail relay Windows XP Apple Open Collaboration Environment HomePNA ITU-T MDAC HyperTransport Satellite internet AppleTalk Telegraphy Local area network Atari 8-bit family IEEE 802.11 Opera (web browser) Slashdot subculture Tor (anonymity network) Universal Plug and Play Serial communications Commodore 64 Web crawler Prodigy (ISP) Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act IP Multimedia Subsystem Mozilla Firefox RS-232 Zeroconf Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Internet protocol spoofing Frame relay PowerPC Super Nintendo Entertainment System QuakeWorld Roxette CompuServe Windows Server 2003 Internet Protocol Softmodem Multiplayer MIPS architecture E-mail Dial-up access Xerox Network Services Control Panel (Windows) Power line communication OSI model Bulletin board system Damn Small Linux Asynchronous Transfer Mode Computer bus Blue screen of death IPv4 address exhaustion Alcatel Subnetwork
