tattoo based on personality i'm working on a tattoo design for a close friend of mine he wants something that has personal meaning to him while we've run past the idea of doing his name i was thinking perhaps something to reflect his personality on the outside he seems like a real tough guy and he is tough but while he might seem mean to people who don't know him well enough he's actually really chill and laid back confident and always up for a good time he's also really sweet and caring and always there for you in a bind i was thinking some kind of animal to repersent this but perhaps you guys have better ideas i feel really embarrassed posting this here as i know he'll probably read this but i wanted some ideas because i've hit a road block an animal is a good idea a tiger or dragon maybe dragons represent strength and also symbolise protection it is a beautiful creature graceful mysterious and has excellent lines and textures that you can work with in your design think scales flaming eyes the long curvy shape of it's body i would run this idea past him if i were you otherwise ask him to be a little more specific good luck with your art Dragon Booster Piccolo Junior Saga Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Tattoo Xiaolin Showdown YuYu Hakusho Social rule Monster Rancher monsters Shen Gong Wu Wood carving Humphrey Bogart Alignment (role-playing games) Predestination Characters of Naruto Team Fortress Classic Time Out of Mind Charmed Kender Battle City (Yu-Gi-Oh!)
