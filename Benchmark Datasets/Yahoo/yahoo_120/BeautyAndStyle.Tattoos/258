tattoo artists what are your opinions on sun and moon tattoos do you think it's a way too common played out design or do you think it will always be one of those classic designs that can be improved upon and made to look unique for the person getting it just asking because i never thought i'd give in to what i thought was the most common image but then i loved the design the artist did for me and got it i'd love to hear your opinions thank you i have a couple of moon tattoos and i love them honestly who cares if someone thinks that a particular design is played out if the design means something to you then that makes it special i agree that you should find someone who is excited to do your tattoo there's just something about an artist who is excited to do something that makes the tattoo pop even more i have a couple from an artist that i've gone back to time and time again and every time i see him he's excited about the design because i tell him what i want and allow him creative freedom so he can really create something special for me a couple of the tats i have could be considered played out but they were designed with excitement so i know that they are beautiful and unique if you want a moon i say go for it and work with an artist who is excited to work on you Irezumi Tattoo Art Aesthetic Realism Strap-on dildo Creativity Martin Sharp W.
