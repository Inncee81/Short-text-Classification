do you ever regret having a tattoo put on of your body ill put it to you this way i have tattoos of them i got all within days one of them is a tattoo of a canadian maple leaf im not canadian i got it because for about a year and a half i was very good friends with this chick that was canadian she was the perfect woman in my eyes looks attitude personality everything was just perfect then she moved to canada before i could ever ask her out about months after she left i went and got a canadian maple leaf tattooed on my wrist the size is inches by inches pretty big piece for a wrist on the opposite side of that one is a celtic shamrock same size both designed using celtic knotwork by me on my lunch break at work the shamrock is for me because i am of irish heritage anyways my whole wrist was swollen for about a week both tatts got infected because i am allergic to tattoo ink yeah all my tats have gotten infected unless i was on the medication to heal one tattoo while getting another one and even when she came back and i finally asked her out just to find out that she had become a different person she was still so damn cool and laid back but she had just changed its hard to describe how but i could just tell that she did some say that the tattoo was a waste because i dont feel the same way about her now than i did before she has since moved back to canada she just felt like she didnt belong here in texas but even after all that even though people tell me the tattoo was a waste or that its equivilant to getting a name tattooed on me or even the fact that i got the tattoo to commemorate someone i wasnt even married or engaged to was just stupid i dont look at it that way i got the tattoo so that i would never forget all the good times i had with her and so that even when i meet someone that i will start a relationship with i can remember that i never have to settle for someone for any reason that at one time there was a perfect woman for me out there and theres still one out there know it sounds weird but this tattoo is the one that no matter what happens i will never regret it all my tattoos mean something to me and i am able to look at them and remember the good times i had and shut out all the present bad times Kodocha Social rule Body piercing Avril Lavigne Friends Sydney Riot of 1879 Kyle Broflovski Piccolo Junior Saga Shaggy dog story Scarification Toronto Maple Leafs Unreal Order of Canada Stanley Cup Kurt Angle The Ashlee Simpson Show The Death Gate Cycle The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Vanilla Ninja Britney Spears Sento Blood on the Tracks Sexually-transmitted infection Cliff Richard Jon Secada Menstrual cup Badly Drawn Kitties Memento (film) Violin Random Harvest Weight training Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ice hockey Textile manufacturing Hiberno-English Earring Leon White Chester Bennington Ben Johnson (athlete) Ashlee Simpson The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's) Big Brother UK series 6 Picts Namie Amuro Parsifal Son Goku (Dragon Ball) God Emperor of Dune Teen Girl Squad New York Knicks Good Times John Diefenbaker Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Urinary incontinence Wood Canadian Senate Philip J.
