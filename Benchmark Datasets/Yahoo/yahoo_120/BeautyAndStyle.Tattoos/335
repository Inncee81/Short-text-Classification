is it appropriate for a leg tattoo to be visible at an event such as a graduation party shower or wedding i've seen people at work office job leaving theirs visible however mine is bigger if that matters it normally doesn't bother me but i was just wondering if there was a certain standard nowadays thanks advice coming from girls who have visible tattoos would really help well i have tattoos one on each outer side on my lower leg above the ankle i don't cover those two up the others are strategically placed so i guess it would depend on how large the tat is i have seen females with tat's on their legs that are too large as in the whole outer lower leg since i cannot see your tat i guess you should ask a family member if you should cover it or wear pants vs a skirt dress if you tat is tasteful then don't worry about concealing it most females today have tattoos so i think it would be acceptable to reveal it i recently went to a wedding and i wore a dress no panty hose in fact i receive many compliments about my tat's i hope this helps Undergarment Trousers Skirt and dress Tattoo Pantyhose Sento Avenue Q Black tie Suit (clothes) Stocking Bob Jones University Belly dance Kimono Social aspects of clothing Trailer Park Boys Kilt Culture of the United States Brassiere Aerial (dance move) Neutrino Combine (Half-Life 2) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Avril Lavigne Buttocks Buckingham Palace The Apprentice 2 Cowboy Heavy metal fashion Comanche Clothing Amy Dumas Hijab Figure skating Strap-on dildo Angelina Jolie One Piece minor characters Diving Eric Cartman Sauna Customs and etiquette of Japan The Marriage of Figaro Shorts Jeans Social rule __cole Polytechnique EastEnders Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sin City Swimsuit Jackass: The Movie Gender role Mariachi Dead Like Me Vanilla Ninja Shirt Jon Secada God Emperor of Dune Great Teacher Onizuka The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Marilyn Monroe Questionable Content Professional wrestling holds Piccolo Junior Saga Trish Stratus Negima Nudity Lie Lawyer Politics of Hong Kong Professional wrestling slang Bicycle Equine conformation Jam (TV series) Canadian Armed Forces Diving suit Academia High-heeled shoe Leggings Fruits Basket We Belong Together Electrophysiology Laserdisc Culture of Fiji Sniper Geology of the Moon Characters in the Smurfs Waterworld Kurt Angle Kenny McCormick Paul Is Dead Kim Possible Breeches role Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Order of the Garter The Dalek Invasion of Earth Kodocha Cross-dressing Gurkha Contingent Phil Hendrie
