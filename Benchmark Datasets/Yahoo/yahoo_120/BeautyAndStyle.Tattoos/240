i want to do a tattoo myself on my hand how do i do it and what sort of ink would i use hi there in my opinion the best ink to use would be either indian ink or quill ink the same ink that you would use to write on parchment paper i have done several tattoo's this way on myself others and i have never had a problem with infections or other health related issues some look very nice and professional remember tattoo's were done this way many thousands of years before the west side of the world started using tattoo guns as for applying the tattoo itself make sure that the design is clearly drawn on after you have washed your hands use a latex glove on your other hand that you will use to hold the needle or if someone else is going to do it for you make sure their hands are clean and they are wearing latex gloves the needle that i would use would be either a pleasure piercing needle or a sewing needle as they are both very sharp so the will not damage the skin after the tattoo is finished i would use a vitamin e based skin cream as this will aid the healing hope this helps and good luck with your tattoo Body piercing Earring Irezumi Clothing Upholstery Scarification Skin Fecal incontinence Prostate cancer Psoriasis Menstrual cup Safe sex Eczema Glove Anal sex Sewing machine Cape Feare Fountain pen Hepatitis C Stomach cancer Comanche Suture Gaia Online Knife Tefillin Play piercing Acupuncture Drawing Strap-on dildo Dialysis Inkjet printer Printmaking Certified Nursing Assistant Sexually-transmitted infection Dragon Booster Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ear piercing instrument Drill bit Methamphetamine Pen and ink Textile manufacturing terminology Label Bookbinding Intravenous therapy Boxing Nail (anatomy) Ink Gramophone record Scabies Diving suit Swimming Scar Tocopherol Gay bathhouse Naruto jutsu BloodRayne Sento United States dollar Dairy Kirby: Canvas Curse Avril Lavigne Sex toy Parchment Ballpoint pen Textile manufacturing HIV Softball Manicure Hazing Terminal ballistics Fisting Kurt Angle Veganism Iron-gall nut ink Applique Mattress Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist AIDS Pneumonia Characters in the Smurfs Acne Paint Arguments for and against drug prohibition Hamster Printing press Sewing Latex allergy 613 mitzvot Vanilla Ninja Circumcision Traumatic brain injury Vinland map Pazyryk The Invisibles Amulet
