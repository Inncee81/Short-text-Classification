tat idieas anyone can send me an image through email only designs not real tats best image gets best answer please include where put the tat any tat pink im a flirt funny and somewhat outgoing please send images to pandaox yahoo com okay the problem with soliciting tattoos through ya is that we don't really know you a tattoo is something sooo personal that it really needs to mean something to you and something you are willing to live with the rest of you life you should not be going for the cool factor because that disappears once you hit about or so grin and you are left explaining what the tattoo means to you once you've decided to get a tattoo i highly suggest waiting at least a year this is where you make a decision about what you want you can take suggestions from people who know you but ultimately it should be something you are willing to explain later on in life once you've picked a tat and a location then shop around for the best tat artist you can find and then go for it Social rule Internet fraud Vanilla Ninja Tatting Jennifer Lopez Oh My Goddess!
