in the uk we have been marking the year anniversary of the abolition of slavery it was abolished in britain years before it was abolished in america we have had calls for britain to apologise for the slavery we have even had people in the street chaining themselves up wearing sorry placards britains stance on this is that even though slavery was a terrible evil and a dark period in britains history we cannot apologise for this because there is not one person alive in britain today who has any direct association with the slave trade if that were the case then the germans french normans danes vikings and italians romans would have to apologise to us for invading the uk many years ago what is the american view of this given that the us and uk were basically partners in this appaling trade i would agree with your comments and further state that history shows that there has been slavery in every recorded civilization before the modern ones including all those in africa and asia i have no idea if that is true of the australian aborigines but it applies to everybody else seems to be a very recurring human failing Slavery Reparations for slavery Abolitionism Black (people) History of slavery in the United States American Civil War History of the United States Blacks and Mormonism African slave trade Trafficking in human beings Compromise of 1850 Homosexuality and Christianity History of Europe Sexual slavery Football African American Middle Ages History of Germany Prostitution History of Denmark Anglo-Saxons History of China Nation of Islam Colonisation Racism West Africa Robert E.
