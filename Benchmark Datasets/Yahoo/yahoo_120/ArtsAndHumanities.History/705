the world would be a better place if the confederacy would have won i have several reasons for my line of thinking if the confederate states of america would have won the u s federal goverment would be far less powerful than it is today therefore reducing terrorism warfare worldwide issues because if the us had a bitter enemy pushed right up against them in one small continent they would be far less apt to interfere in world affairs the shearing away of americans rights and freedoms would be much less today because of the impacts of the two american nations alliances i e the usa germany the csa england perhaps france the history of the world wars may have been far more in balance and far less destructive just to silence the critics slavery would have died a slower but far less tumulutous death anyway probably before what are your opinions on these points and this subject i am a military historian and not not not a racist btw i've always believed that had the csa won the war sooner or later the southern and northern states would reunite threats to american territories in the west by mexico and british canada would demand an alliance of some form reunification would be achieved by concessions to the states and a revised articles of confederation after a confederate victory northern states would have demanded consessions from the federal government and a weaker central authority would emerge newly admitted states would have more autonomy but i can't envision the divide between north and south surviving long i think the csa would have abolished slavery within years after the war the slave based agrarian economy was no longer profitable alternative sources of cotton sugar and indigo chiefly from british possessions would soon make slavery obsolete the issue would be their fate under the new constitutional regime some would be compelled to settle african colonies like liberia and sierra leone others would form semi independent mini states still others would assimilate and integrate into anglo society over time a confederate victory would have changed the course of world history my reunified america would be less entangled in foreign affairs spanish power in cuba and the philippines would be unchecked would we have purchased alaska from russia would british claims in the northwest be thwarted i think the territory of the states would be diminished due to a weaker central government i disagree that a usa german and csa england alliance would have resulted in less destructive world wars russia and austro hungary would still have initiated the first conflict if germany and england took their historical positions a new american schism would have erupted into another war American Civil War History of the United States United States Slavery History of slavery in the United States History of Europe History of the Southern United States German Confederation History of United States imperialism History of the United States (1865-1918) Federation Timeline-191 British Empire Soviet Union Imperialism in Asia Texas Revolution World War I Germany Racism World War II Napoleonic Wars Decolonization Africa History of Austria American Revolution Austria-Hungary Otto von Bismarck French colonial empires United States Constitution Jew State History of the United States Constitution Canada Southern United States History of the United States (1776-1789) History of Malaysia Nigeria Freedom Party (Harry Turtledove) Yugoslavia War of the Spanish Succession Libertarian socialism Spain Liberalism Military history of the United States History of Germany Timeline of United States diplomatic history Military history of the Soviet Union History of Germany since 1945 Arab-Israeli conflict Louisiana Purchase Democratic Party (United States) Western United States History of Poland (1795-1918) Dominion History of Hungary Louis XIV of France Penda of Mercia Transcontinental nation Switzerland Political status of Taiwan Liberia Iraq disarmament crisis East Germany Mexican-American War Liberal Party of Canada History of the European Union Anglo-Saxons German reunification Reconstruction Abkhazia Empire of Brazil Cyprus dispute Tariff History of Romania History of Lithuania History of Brazil Politics of the United States Colombia Freedom of the press Anarchism Abolitionism Franks Kurdish people Racism in the United States
