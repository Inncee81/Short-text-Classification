what is the relationship between russia and the us is it going to become another cold war between the two or things going to get friendly yes russia may not be as strong as it used to however the last thing the us needs is more enemies if russia becomes one what it lacks in might certainty makes up in the ability to pull no punches unlike the us how if the us and russia would go to war i'd bet on russia for the current russian president is an ex kbg agent a man who knows how a war can be run our politicians they wouldn't know how to properly plan a garbage dump much less a war right now its an uneasy groping between two nations that historically have not gotten along well but decided to try the us needs russia's help in curbing the nuclear weaponry ambitions of iran but russia has major trade relations with iran russia and the us both declare themselves against terrorism but russia invited a delegation from the islamic organization hamas to visit moscow a recent council on foreign relations task force declared that russia is less open and less democratic than it was a few years ago still the two proclaim that their friendship prevails despite differences when their national interests are at variance it is an alliance of mutual necessity diplomacy today is much more complex than it was in the cold war there is always hope neither russia nor the us can afford another cold war Soviet Union George F.
