russia usa and uk in ww having just done a discussion on ww and the part the allies played one person pointed out the contribution the russians made they quoted the numbers on each side and it appears the russians gave many many more lives than the western allies however some people have suggested that this credits the soviets as the main protaganists the main victors i hypothesis that the poor equiptment training conditions and organisation caused these deaths and as russia has such a huge populations these men were fodder to the machine guns until they got a bit better equipt usa and uk on the other hand were never invaded and therefore used our superior resources to strategically strike this i believe means that although russia got to berlin faster the bombing by the uk and usa meant it was a reasonably easier route so i still believe you can accredate the spoils equally probably weighted in favour of the uk and usa i hav debated this point in depth with my partner as she has the opposite view she is russian and learned soviet history as opposed to my uk history which are sometimes very different i agree with your assessment however the red army would've reached berlin just the same with or without the western allies the numbers were simply overwhelming consider deaths on both sides eastern front stalingrad million siege of leningrad million moscow smolensk kiev vorenesh belarus nd rzhev sychevka caucasus kursk lower dnieper kongsberg rostov budapest and others with less killed whereas on the western front battle of france normandy el alamein battle of the bulge not even on the same scale do the math World War II Battle of Kursk Operation Barbarossa Army Group Centre Hero City Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Blitzkrieg Battle of the Bulge Timeline of World War II Polish September Campaign Polish-Soviet War Erich von Manstein Georgy Zhukov Population transfer in the Soviet Union History of Germany during World War II Winter War Russia Soviet Union Military history of the Soviet Union T-34 Operation Saturn Luftwaffe World War I Red Army W__adys__aw Sikorski Continuation War Russian Revolution of 1917 Napoleonic Wars Smolensk Kiev Offensive (1920) Katy__ massacre Muscovy Battle of Berlin German 1st Fallschirmj__ger Division Battle of Normandy Participants in World War II History of Ukraine Western Front (World War II) Napoleon's Invasion of Russia Russian Civil War Lavrenty Beria Semyon Timoshenko History of Europe Military history of Germany Battle of Warsaw (1920) Battle of France Russian history, 1892-1920 Burma Campaign M4 Sherman T-72 War of the Austrian Succession RAF Bomber Command History of Poland (1939-1945) Left communism Pale of Settlement Ivan Konev History of Polish Intelligence Services Battle of Moscow Grossdeutschland Division Russian Orthodox Church Joseph Stalin Politics of Russia Polish-Muscovite War (1605-1618) Tunisia Campaign Trench warfare Vladimir Lenin Konstantin Rokossovsky Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Bombing of Dresden in World War II Franco-Prussian War NATO Axis and Allies Politics of Belarus Grand Duchy of Lithuania SS Division Totenkopf Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim History of Belarus Panzer Corps Feldherrnhalle Kievan Rus' Anti-communism Russian language First Indochina War Western betrayal Europe Moscow Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein Orange Revolution SS Division (motorised) Wiking Chernobyl accident
