has the story been written with russia developing n amer from w to e in 's instead of brits from e to w i would love to read someone's immaginative story of the settlement of north america with the russians moving from their west coast colonies into the north american continent the spanish from their california colonies eastword can you imagine the different world we would be living in had the brits and french not been so powerful as to control north america in the 's it would surprise me if no one has written this story i just can't find it i love historical novels with a fantasy twist this would be a great one so who wrote this story i don't know of any that have done this it's certainly a major departure from our history and could be the setting for a quite good story i'm seeing cossack cowboys for some reason you'd need a much more eastward focused russian empire that had greater development in siberia for this to work i'd think that could lead to a greater naval and merchant shipping presence in the north pacific which would be the key to expanded russian colonies probable conflict with spain along the west coast unless you write them out somehow most likely development would occur from both coasts but a more aggressively expansionist russia could win out not likely though one of the reasons the spanish colonies in the west didn't expand into the interior was the much more rugged and harsher nature of the western terrain compared to the east you'd need a fix for that problem too quite an interesting idea and one i'm off to play with a bit more myself French colonial empires Age of Discovery Imperialism in Asia Cossack Spanish colonization of the Americas Transcontinental nation Geography of Russia Frontier North America Christopher Columbus Russia South America British Empire Imperial Russia Central Asia History of Europe Pensacola, Florida Halifax, Nova Scotia Geopolitik Colony Napoleonic Wars The Influence of Sea Power upon History Western United States Geography of the United States Cowboy Mercantilism Europe Aircraft carrier Spanish Empire Portuguese Empire Western world Russo-Japanese War Siberia Geography of Canada American Old West Economic history of Canada Japanese strategic planning for mainland Asia (1905-1940) Spanish-American War Military history of France American Revolutionary War War of the Spanish Succession Appalachian Mountains Louisiana Purchase Pacific Ocean History of Canada Naval warfare Taish__ period Omsk War of 1812 New Albion Seven Years' War Genre fiction World War I Midwestern United States Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim West Indies Federation West Africa History of Florida Decolonization Royal Navy History of the United States (1789-1849) Economic history of Britain Philip II of Spain Habsburg Spain French colonisation of the Americas Indian Navy History of United States imperialism Odessa Geography of China Jean-Fran__ois de Galaup, count de La P__rouse History of Africa Atlantic Ocean Sovereignty of the Falkland Islands Grand Duchy of Lithuania Crimean War Axis Powers Falkland Islands Russian Civil War Piracy in the Caribbean Colonial America USS San Francisco (CA-38) History of Ukraine Military history of Canada History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union Scramble for Africa Maritimes Nikolai Rezanov United States Imperial Japanese Navy Conquistador The Chronicles of Narnia Novel Manifest Destiny Colonialism History of California
