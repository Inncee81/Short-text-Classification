for those who think the civil war was fought over states rights what rights did the southern states want in besides the right to secede the federal government was not nearly as intrusive in the 's as it is today i am looking for specifics rights or laws or issues what federal law about slavery i think most wars are about power and money but i am willing to listen to other points of view if anyone has facts and details the civil war isn't something that just sprung up overnight the first issue that started the crisis over state's rights was the issue of nullification the south felt that individual states should have the power to nullify federal laws that they disagreed with the nullification crisis occured during the presidency of andrew jackson and came to ahead over the tariff of the south lost the battle over nullification and began to feel that their interests were not being represented by the government the abolitionist movement became increasingly important and influential in the north during the s and s which increased the south's feeling of alienation they began to feel that the government would not leave them alone and let them tend to their own lives but was planning on interfering and running everything less government was very important back then and too much government interference in day to day activities was not at all desired immediately were following were a number of crises concerning new states being admitted into the own upsetting the delicate balance between slave and non slave states with the election of lincoln in they felt that they had lost any chance of being allowed to go their own way and live out their lives in the culture and society they had created however all of this feeling was over years in the making and their concern over state's rights was quite a valid concern for that time period American Civil War History of the United States (1789-1849) Democratic Party (United States) Origins of the American Civil War Nullification Crisis History of slavery in the United States John C.
