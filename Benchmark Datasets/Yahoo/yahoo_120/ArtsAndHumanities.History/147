had culturally rich dynasties and artifacts buildingsand religious and art forms still practiced to this day why arent there any art forms or societies as great appealing or worthy as the historical monuments empires of our ancestors where has our appreciation for livity pride and art gone its like money and racism killed any chance of appreciation of life and beauty clarification back then ppl built their empires made art and practiced traditions with pride and dignity they put effort into their work that attracted ppl to them now because of the need to feel superior you have ppl arguing who started which empire which empire was the best ppl bashing other cultures when all of those listed above at one time embraced and traded intermarried etc with one another and taught and apprecated one another i dont see that happening again the first two ansers prove my point exactly edjdonnell excellent point but while there were constant battles over who was superior back then now its at a all time high there was a time when the ancient cultures did get along which is the reason we have so many different races and ethnic groups due to mixing and education it is a fact that life back then was much more appreciated to be a priest and scam those who follow you meant death in those day theft was taboo and art was a way of life somewhere down the line that all changed and you've meantioned some events but ppl in todays world with moral value and appreciation for life and openmindedness are the minority now there were sick leaders like napoleon yes but now its like because of money ppl are much more devious lol to the dumb fu k who said i hate america learn how to read okay where in this have i said anything about america i said ppl world wide have lost their sense of humanity dont fuc kin get mad because it just so happened that i described your punk b itch ass this is sad i make a valid point and post a reasonable question and all i got was a bunch of cry baby punk sissies wtf empires never appreciated each other at no time in history did a conquering nation allow the things stay as they where they disfigured the pyrimids the roman and greek building and middle eastern palaces japan and china took turns decimating other nations and empires relics as well and in south america it was a free for all in slaughtering one another and taking ove the use of the others buildings for there differnt religions and purposes much like the pyrimids no one is sure what they where first a tomb or a astronomy center for figuring out the weather and calanders of the time napoleon had target practise on the spinx that is why the nose is gone england ran off with all kinds of mummies and relics from the world ove from fallen empires the romans transformed the outer look to fit there designs os there really is no difference from today yes they made elegent and amazing buildings but they did not have technolgy like today so they built to last and most had a religious puropose or to brag on a rulers power and strength the toys have changed but the games are the same Jew Black (people) Ancient history Mythology Patriotism Nationalism Cultural and
