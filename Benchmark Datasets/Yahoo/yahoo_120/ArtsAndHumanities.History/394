why does asia dislike japan should japan apologize you already know the answers because of the war crimes done during ww ii my personal opinion is that japan or the countries whose armies made crimes should not apologize because that makes no difference instead they should try never to minimize the number of victims or disregard the nature of their sufferings that is so much better than saying we re sorry we won t do it again because you ll be bound to repeat it every once in a while just like in personal life and you ll have a feeling of collective guilt and hence a good soil for aggression in national corpus which leads to repeating crimes it s a circulus vitiosus but if you just learn about things done in past with a critical review of course you ll probably have some better feeling of being able and responsible not to allow such things to happen again Responses of Germany and Japan to World War II crimes Comfort women Capital punishment Japanese war crimes Theory of conduct A Course In Miracles Expulsion of Germans after World War II Attack on Pearl Harbor Reparations for slavery Hideki Tojo Yusuf al-Qaradawi Scientology beliefs and practices Slander and libel Simone Weil Japanese history textbook controversies Socrates Anti-Japanese sentiment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus International law National Kidney Foundation Singapore The Brothers Karamazov Narcissism Crime Aesthetic Realism Unlawful combatant Domestic violence Anschluss Evil Nanking Massacre Sadism and masochism Antisocial personality disorder Rape Paranoia Agent Holocaust denial Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Foreign policy of Japan Colonial Cambodia Novel Child sexual abuse Sin Christian apologetics Treaty of Versailles Transactional analysis Torture Diplomatic immunity Murder Criticism of libertarianism Yasukuni Shrine Theodicy Rhapsody in August Imperial Japanese Army Noam Chomsky Causes of World War II International Criminal Court Autism Plame affair World War II Moral objectivism Dyslexia Dennis Rader Philipp Melanchthon Presuppositional apologetics Domon Kasshu Surrender of Japan Strategic management John Lott Divorce Clinical depression Pacific War Objectivist philosophy Scenes from a Memory Intelligent design Sook Ching massacre Hearsay Racism Social justice Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses Social rule Japanese language Involuntary commitment Plato Funeral Due process Infantilism Non-aggression principle British Army Shinto Political correctness Crime against peace Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway Dead Like Me Self-esteem Roper v.
