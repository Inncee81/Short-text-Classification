can some one tell me what this means its a question and answer but i cant understand the answer but didn t the illuminati claim a much older origin than yes they did weishaupt originally claimed that the illuminati originated with the last king of persia who was a zoroastrian by religion yadzegerd iii d c although he confused him with yadzegerd ii d c king of persia from to and built a whole genealogy listing many famous historical characters when knigge joined the order he asked weishaupt for evidence of this genealogy weishaupt wrote back in january that the genealogy was an innocent lie in fact needed because not many would have joined a newly established order see ren le forestier les illumin s de bavi re et la franc ma onnerie allemande paris hachette the book is the doctoral dissertation of a famous french historian and a key source for the illuminati rather than being offended knigge agreed that a mythical genealogy was indeed needed and proceeded to build one of his own where the illuminati were declared as having originally been founded by noah and revived after a period of decline by st john the evangelist ok from i can understand i think it goes like this weishaupt claimed his ancestor was the king of persia and made up a whole genealogy about it then knigge ask weishaupt for proof of his genealogy and weishaupt confessed to the innocent lie weishaupt thought that it was a good idea so that people would think the order had been established for a long time instead of being a new order because no one would want to join a newly established order so knigge then made up his own genealogy saying that he descended from noah where after a decline in membership of the order it was revived again by st john the evangelist like i said i think that's how it goes Illuminati Adam Weishaupt Noah's Ark Young Earth creationism Sassanid dynasty Deus Ex: Invisible War Creationism King of the Britons Caucasian Iberia Creation science Christianity Zoroastrianism Genealogies of Genesis Augustin Barru__l Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Genealogy Evangelicalism Zoroaster Sons of Noah Henry IV of France Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Sexual orientation Ordo Templi Orientis Persian Empire France Biblical inerrancy Salvation History of Christianity Genesis Achaemenid dynasty Book of Daniel Roman Catholic Church Messiah Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Tamriel Feudalism Merit Emperor Sola fide 17th century Salic law Turkic peoples Historical Jesus Theory of conduct Jesus Documentary hypothesis Deluge (mythology) Religious conversion Bosniaks Flood geology A Course In Miracles New World Order (conspiracy) Witch trial Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Discordianism Friedrich Nietzsche Filioque clause Manetho Scientology beliefs and practices The Da Vinci Code Emperor of Japan History of creationism Charles Darwin's views on religion Mind control Jacques de Molay Deus Ex characters Book of Kells Parthia Alleged inconsistencies in the Bible Noah Jean-Luc Nancy Confucius B__b Abraham Philosophy Cultural and historical background of Jesus Dark Ages Confucianism Alan Campbell (pastor) Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Reptilian humanoid Franz Boas Ottoman Empire Angels and Demons The Bible and history Mumia Abu-Jamal Apologetics Theodicy Appeal Jewish history A Canticle for Leibowitz The Ark in Space Ham, son of Noah Lebor Gab__la __renn Intelligent design French States-General The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire
