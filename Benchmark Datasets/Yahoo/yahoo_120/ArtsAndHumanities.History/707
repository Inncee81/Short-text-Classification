what choices did america make to conclude ww and what impact did it have in the the obvious answer is whether to use the atomic bomb or invade japan plans were well advanced for the invasion the landings were planned for kyushu estimates of wounded and dead were very high perhaps as many as a million japanese were expected to die in the invasion these estimates were based on the invasion of okinawa the first home island that the u s invaded and captured the japanese had planned suicide attacks by women and children armed with rocks and sticks the concept was to make the americans sustain such heavy losses that they would back off from the landings and seek some kind of negotiated peace the emperor would have remained a deity and the sacred soil of japan would have remained unsullied by foreigners truman had little choice if he was to save the u s casualties for the invasion he actually saved japan and the u s from even worse carnage to boot japan would probably had to deal with a soviet occupation probably all of hokkaido the 's would likely have seen a partitioned japan with communist government in hokkaido and north honshu the korean war probably would not have happened the north koreans could have invaded s korea and had the whole thing wrapped up before the u s could act the repelling of the n koreans and later the chinese was possbile with the help of the japanese japan earned its return to independence with their eager assistance to the korean war conduct perhaps five years before it would otherwise have had to wait Korean War Operation Downfall Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan Vietnam War Surrender of Japan USS Missouri (BB-63) Polish September Campaign Operation August Storm USS Yorktown (CV-10) Battle of Okinawa Participants in World War II Korea First Indochina War USS Wilkes-Barre (CL-103) 2003 Invasion of Iraq Military history of Japan USS Uhlmann (DD-687) Chinese Civil War Second Sino-Japanese War USS Taussig (DD-746) Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 USS Wedderburn (DD-684) USS Walker (DD-517) History of Korea (1900___1950) History of the Soviet Union (1927-1953) Eastern Front (World War II) Demographics of Japan Peleliu Continuation War USS Taylor (DD-468) USS Thompson (DD-627) Harry S.
