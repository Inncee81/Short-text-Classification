this is a question for guys here when you were growing up did you refuse to get haircuts or did your parents let you grow your hair until you were old enough to start school and had to get it cut because of school im a guy and i wish i had never let my mom tak me to the beauty salon to cut my hair i'm not a guy but my brother who currently looks like a mop head has refused to get his hair cut at all since summer started even bribery hasn't worked i think there's no way he'll be allowed back to school without getting it cut first though he's had it cut frequently up to his current age obviously and before he was old enough to start school otherwise it'd be like down to the floor or something and he'd look like a girl Haircut Hair Emo fashion Kodocha The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Doug Homestar Runner Teen Girl Squad Kenny McCormick Kyle Broflovski Skinhead Pubic hair Cow and Chicken KaBlam!
