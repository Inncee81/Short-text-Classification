getting hair cut for cross country i my hair is currently past my shoulders about inches past and i am in cross country my hair is too long to put it into a bun because it falls out of it and when it's in a pony tail it hits my neck and gets sweaty and annoying i want to get it cut so when i put it in a pony it wont be bouncing back and forth against my neck my hair is thick and sort of wavy i was wondering if anyone knew how i should get my hair cut that would be convenient for running but still cute to wear down long but not too short thanx well i ran in track this past year at school and i know how annoying long hair can be mine is also inches past my shoulders i think that an even cut right at or above shoulder length would be really versatile since your hair already has body an even cut would be enough to work with when you wear it down make sure to avoid bangs though i have 'em and they get in the way more than long hair i still love having them though hope this helped you out Haircut Horse Professional wrestling throws Violin Suplex Hair Knife Dobermann Mullet (haircut) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Softball Professional wrestling aerial techniques Diving suit Kodocha Archery Sesshomaru Pitaten Professional wrestling holds Table tennis Shotgun Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling attacks Laws of cricket Ponytail Casualty lifting Kimono Guinea pig Vegeta Havanese Neckbreaker Drill bit Finnish Spitz Comanche Swingout Scapula Saw Shetland pony W.I.T.C.H.
