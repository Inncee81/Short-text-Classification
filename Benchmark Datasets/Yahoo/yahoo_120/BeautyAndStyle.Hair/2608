is it true that stores like walmart won't buy professional hair products 'cause i brought some products from the nexxus line and afterward heard that the formulas have been changed so that they could be sold there but if that is true why wouldn't biolage have to change their formulas too 'cause i've heard that they have some of the best hair products and they're a professional hair line and i see their products in stores all the time and has anyone used nexxus before they changed and if so did they see a difference once the formulas changed and please only answers from people that know of this problem what i was told is that salon quality stuff is actually not supposed to be sold in these stores licensing agreements etc the stuff you see at wal mart or other chains is overstock from somewhere conterfeit or black market the companies who make it change the formulas after this happens so that their products will still indeed be exclusive to salons Wal-Mart Sears Holdings Corporation ASDA New Coke Price discrimination Department store MUMPS Publishing Best Buy Clear Channel Communications Circumscription Commodore International Hair coloring Trademark Bank Hypermarket Cable television ITunes Music Store Breastfeeding Apple Computer G.I.
