a question about dying your hair or any kind of color or highlights glazing and everything possible if you either glze color highlight dye or do w e with your hair at a young age like or will it cause serious damage even if other ppl do it for soooo long or w e i have heard some ppl have been dying their own hair for like years and things like they've been doing it since the rd grade and i have done it every says itz supposed to make ur hair really dry and stuff my hair is really healthy and i died it streaks of a nice fuschia and it is awesome nothing changed in my hair and itz about to fade now the only difference i see in my hair is that it smells like the stuff i used to dye it my hair is still really healtthy and i use a really good product and my hair is possibly better but then i hear ppl saying that it kills brain cells w e and ppl have still used it really long or w e i am worried that it will affect me girls in my skoo l have it and they aren't dumb or anything right so wat are the cons or really damaging i was also thinking of dying my hair again after it fades my mom and aunts have been doing it for a long time now but i am definitely younger so will it affect me i am going to see the majority of answers that come up to decide whether i should do it again or not plz answeers wat about cute u's opinion i have been coloring my hair myself for a long time i also have gone to salons to get it done and my hair is healthier when i do it myself you do have to be careful if you lighten your hair at home but if you use a kit intended for at home use and you follow the instructions you should be fine however it's hard to judge if it's even or not so i would still suggest going to a stylist or at least having someone check to make sure that everything is evenly covered as for damaging brain cells wouldn't getting your hair done in a salon damage brain cell as well that's really not true it won't cause brain damage and if you are truly worried consult a doctor before coloring there aren't really any cons and it's very likely that dye will make your hair thicker because it expands the hair shaft but your hair will be unhealthy if it's over processed so be careful with what you do to your hair and know that what your hair can take has limits Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Hair coloring Theory of conduct Phoebe Buffay's songs Wood Hair color Stomach cancer Puberty Physical attractiveness The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Marilyn Monroe Hair Philosophical skepticism Radiation therapy Upholstery Totally Spies!
