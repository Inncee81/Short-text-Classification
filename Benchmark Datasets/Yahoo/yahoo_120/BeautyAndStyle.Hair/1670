what do you do when your boyfriend wants you to shave your pubic hair but you don't want to hes willing to change something about himself but theres nothing i want to change about him so im kinda in a pickle he wants this of me but i don't want anything of him and he won't let up i don't want to break up with him because i do love and care about him but if he can't let this go i think i'll have to leave him for some one who can appreciate me for me and not want to change my body unless i want to change it what should i do in the interest of hygiene and grooming maintaining some kind of upkeep with your pubic area is recommended but this can be as simple as trimming and shaving the edges if you don't feel comfortable completely shaving the area don't let your boyfriend pressure you into doing it sure he can influence you a bit on your decision maybe moreso on other trivial things but a girl's private regions are her own business you do to them what you want to do because it's your body not his let him know that if he really cares for and respects you he will quit his whining and let you deal with it however you see fit this in itself is a petty thing to break up with a guy over but if you see a trend ex he needs to control everything about you needs to know where you are every second of the day won't let you make decisions yourself give your relationship some serious thought if he's the good guy you think he is eventually he'll realize that he loves you for you without you changing a thing however i'd give him some time and obvious hints to get to that realization he is after all a guy Pubic hair Friends Social rule Megan Griffin Depilation W.I.T.C.H.
