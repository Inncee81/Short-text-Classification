cosmetology school a mistake ok so basically i'm i recently finished my first year of college at a really expensive university for fashion design marketing i work a full time to job and i have no choice because i pretty much support myself i had to stop going to the university i was attending because of the costs and now i'm really burned out from work and everything but i know i need to stay in school i want to own my own business preferably a salon so i recently decided i wanted to go to cosmetology school because i'm really interested in that and would love it why do people my aunt my family look down on cosmetology school my aunt says she doesnt want me to be surrounded by retards and people beneathe me and other people look at it as an easy career where i wont be making money when i tell them of my dreams they dont believe i'll make it happen is cosmetology really that low of a career choice i dont want to make a mistake i totally know how you feel i have been wanting to enroll in cosmetology school for the past year and haven't because i feel as if everyone around me looks down on that field i already have a bachelors degree so whenever i've mentioned to anyone that i would like to pursue cosmetology i get alot of negativity i just now enrolled in beauty school and am supposed to start in september i just decided to tune out all the negativity and listen to the voice that really matters which is mine i need to do something that will make me happy and not something that will make everyone else happy also i think pretty much any field that requires you to learn a skill is not a mistake having a skill means that you will be able to find work alot easier than someone that doesn't have a skill i recently worked for a large fortune company who out of the blue decided to lay everyone off there were people that worked with me that had been working there over years and now had to start all over and find work with cosmetology you wont have to worry about not finding work because salons will always need hair stylists there is also the luxury of having your own salon which is nice i hope this helps and good luck on whatever you decide to do if you need to talk you can email me at iceprncss yahoo com Atomic Kitten Cosmetology Education in Portugal Pitaten English grammar Education in the United States 2000 Australian Grand Prix Social rule Education in the People's Republic of China Avenue Q RuneScape quests Microeconomics Singlish Graduate school Economic inequality Kodocha Freeters The Apprentice 2 Outsourcing Fancy Crane Charles Goodyear Community college Kender Phoebe Halliwell Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Supply and demand Software engineering W.I.T.C.H.
