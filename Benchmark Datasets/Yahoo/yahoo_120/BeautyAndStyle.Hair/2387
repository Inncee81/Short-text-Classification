im not a racist but i need african americans to answer this question i'm a year old african american and i would like to get a kiddie perm my mom is doing some research on it and one of my friends fot a adult perm and her hair fell out but i really need one because the braids break off my edges and i play sports when did you have your first perm was it a kiddie perm did it affect your hair in any way besides doing the job it was suppose to do do you think it is ok for me to get one thanx in advance for all of you who anwered hi i first got a kiddie perm when i was years old and in the th grade my mom used just for me but as for your friend it depends on who did her perm relaxer and what she did to it after wards relaxing hair before age is not recommended because of hormone changes also you have a good understanding of how to take care of your hair before relaxing it however if your mom finds it difficult to manage your hair you may consider texturizing your hair with the bodiphier natural hair relaxer many mixed race children have unmanageable hair texturizing the hair makes it more manageable and softer the key to relaxing your hair is to keep the relaxer at least inch off the scalp at all times if you think you can t do this you can apply petroleum jelly to the entire scalp before applying the relaxer or texturizer this will protect the scalp from any irritation also be careful not to apply the relaxer over previously relaxed hair you should wash his or her hair regularly at least every five days or so only because you play sports and your hair is going to sweat condition your hair and scalp with a light conditioner towel dry your child s hair rather than using excessive heat make sure you have your hair trimmed regularly to keep it manageable and neat also you should wash your hair after swimming in chlorine pool water because it damages hair if left in too long Hair Psoriasis Dandruff Sauna Menstrual cup Drug test Sento Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Haircut Acne Androgen insensitivity syndrome Urinary incontinence Shampoo Swimming pool Violin Breastfeeding Upholstery Cancer Sewage treatment Prostate cancer Dog Swimming Eczema Drawing Baldness treatments Diving Tarantula Dreadlocks Coffee Fecal incontinence Anal sex Hyperthermia Chronic fatigue syndrome Radiation therapy Textile manufacturing terminology Asthma Dundas Square Social rule Massage Comanche Manicure Casting Growth hormone treatment Carnivorous plant Cornrows Gelatin Chlorine Hair color Drowning Collecting fossils Traumatic brain injury Norway national football team Afro textured hair Pitaten Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Hair conditioner Kodocha Escherichia coli O157:H7 Diving suit Guinea pig Microeconomics Common cold Scar Hiking Body piercing Tag Certified Nursing Assistant Menstrual cycle Motor oil Leather Tire Diabetes mellitus Graduate school Herpes simplex virus Equine conformation Liquid crystal Tattoo Haloalkane Food preservation Solar cell Burdock Teen Girl Squad Cephalic disorder Hamster Theory of conduct Salad Fingers Opportunity rover Species Depilation Growth hormone deficiency Corrosion Tofu Race Protein
