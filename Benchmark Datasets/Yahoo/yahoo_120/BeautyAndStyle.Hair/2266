i have a question ok so i know how to straighten my hair and stuff does anybody have some cool hair styles or easy ways to curl my hair thank you my hair is naturally straight er i wont say completely straight because i still need to straighten it to look nice but i have some difficultly getting my hair to curl but i use different techniques the first one is when i get out of the shower i brush through my hair once and then i take a lot of mousse and just scrunch my hair i usually add a little bit of gel i gather it up in a bun and let it stay for a few hours if i am impatient i will take a blow dryer and hold it to my hair while i scrunch it that gives it a little wave the second one requires overnight after i get out of the shower i french braid my hair while it is wet the more braids the tighter the wave but if you're going out in public it's probably best to do while my hair is in braids i run some mouse and spray it with spray gel i sleep on it and the next morning when i take it out it is curly the third is soft rollers they key with this is not to use too many i usually use or on a side of my hair and i never rol them all the way up to my scalp you sleep with them overnight when you pull them out spray the tight curl with spray but pull on the curl until it gives you a nice loose curl the fourth is hot rollers leaving them in for as long as possible gives me the most hold i have con air ones its best to take small sections at a time i mousse and spray with hair spray individually as i am going along if you arent going some place where you are going to sweat a lot i would recommend putting a little wax in each curl too for hold you could always use curling irons too but that takes a lot of sitting in front of the mirror time but is best if you cant sleep in curlers or dont have a few hours to leave curlers or braids in Haircut Aerial (dance move) Textile manufacturing Curling Afro Professional wrestling throws Thermal power station Internal ballistics Comanche Equine conformation Brewery Guinea pig Shaving Fire fighting Sauna Urinary incontinence Shampoo Mouse (computing) Rope Professional wrestling holds Paint Cornrows Breastfeeding Roller coaster Anchor Quotation mark Carding Diving Swingout Hypnosis Glossary of firefighting equipment Instant coffee Ranma __ characters Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Saxophone Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Sento Drug test Swimming pool Toilet humour Drawing Japanese tea ceremony Hyperthermia First aid Skateboarding trick Bacon Felis sapiens Campfire Psoriasis Sleeping car Mattress Energy development Pottery RuneScape quests Hair conditioner Stage lighting Sleep apnea Mohawk hairstyle M16 (rifle) Milton H.
