is dyeing your hair repeatedly unhealthy for it i have a job at a theme park as a character which requires me to have to dye my hair black every month or so my natural color is strawberry blonde and i was wondering is that unhealthy for my hair to dye it every month will it kill my hair or even cause it to fall out just wondering because if its going to have lasting effects on my hair then i might want to reconsider dyeing it okay don't listen to what anyone else has said first off sure when coloring your hair with bleach you can damage it but color itself is usually not that harmful make sure that you are getting it done by a professional the reason i state this is that professional color has been profected over the years and most of them have conditioner right in them so not to damage the hair not only that but pending on how you style or do your hair normally they can give you great tips on how to keep it healthy and can i mention a two in one shampoo and conditioner will not do it i recommend pending on how long your hair is to just have shampoo unless it is long then make sure you are doing them seperatly you need the conditioner for the ends of your hair that is where if you get damage it will occur if you have short hair i recommend conditioning it at least once a week and make sure you are leaving it on your hair for about minutes while you are in the shower again professional color is better if you can't afford to go to the salon then i would suggest finding a friend or a friend of a friend who can at least go and purchase the good hair color for you and teach you how to do it good luck Hair color Shampoo Dandruff Blond Guinea pig Hair Tattoo The Ashlee Simpson Show Psoriasis Ranma __ characters Dreadlocks Beltway sniper attacks Marilyn Monroe Hulk Hogan Joker (comics) Baldness treatments Androgen insensitivity syndrome Urinary incontinence Red hair Dog Baldness Upholstery Paul Is Dead Puberty The Rasmus Team Fortress Classic Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Contract Atkins Nutritional Approach Leaf Chicago White Sox Tooth enamel Hypoglycemia Diamond John Layfield Link (Legend of Zelda) Technicolor Guild Wars Breastfeeding Queen of Wands Clinical depression Stem cell Hearing aid 2005 World Series Yu-Gi-Oh!
