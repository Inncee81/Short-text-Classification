im going to dye the bototm layer of my hair blond i have light brown hair any tips because idk what to do im not going to a salon but i do not know how im going to go through with it and what type of blonde dye to buy okay the only way to lift the brown out of your hair is to bleach it normal people shouldn't bleach their hair at home more than one two shades so having lighter hair is a good thing for you get a bleaching kit not blonde hair dye because that isn't going to lift the color out of your hair i don't bleach my own hair often so i'm not sure the best brands try going to sally's and asking them if your hair has any red tones in it at all you're going to have to get some toner also so go home and bleach the section that you want blonde and then deep condition it cause bleach is harsh ask yourself if it is as light as you want if not bleach it again in a week or maybe days if you're impatient but condition it a lot once it's as light as you want you want to get rid of all the oranginess brassiness so tone it and deep condition it again keep toning until it's the pretty blonde shade you desire and i can't stress this enough condition condition condition good luck edit however i do recommend you seeking professional hair help i know they're a lot more pricy than just going out and doing it yourself but they're a lot less likely to screw up than you are Blond Hair coloring Hair color Hair Human skin color Dragon Booster Photographic film Upholstery Leaf Marilyn Monroe Madonna (entertainer) Drawing Kender Red hair Blonde on Blonde The Rasmus Emo fashion The Ashlee Simpson Show Leather Acne Link (Legend of Zelda) Paragliding Discus (fish) Skinhead Bleach Dandruff Anchor Guinea pig Theory of conduct Colonial mentality Color McFly Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tobacco Naive set theory Ganguro Singlish Dolly Parton Wood Camouflage Joker (comics) Shampoo Tattoo Flag of India Melanin Public policy Blood on the Tracks John Layfield Paintball C-41 process Polar Bear Community emergency response team Diamond Laser hair removal Infantilism Dog Hydrogen peroxide Cat coat genetics RuneScape quests Skin Queen of Wands Great Teacher Onizuka Yami no Matsuei Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Tooth bleaching Reservoir Dogs Atari 8-bit family Light-emitting diode Baldness treatments Insomnia Staining (biology) Knife Bong Charlie Brown Coffee Car handling Telephone exchange Menstrual cycle Sunglasses W.I.T.C.H.
