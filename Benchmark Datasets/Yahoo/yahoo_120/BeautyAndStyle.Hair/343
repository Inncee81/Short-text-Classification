good shampoo for oily hair my hair gets very oily i have to wash it everyday within hours it starts to smell like oily dirty hair what can i do to fix this use a daily shampoo that won't leave a lot of residue you can tell if the formula is clear ish instead of creamy and use a light conditioner preferably one designed for fine hair because they rinse clean also when you are shampooing don't scrub terribly hard just a gentle massaging motion with your fingertips is adequate otherwise you'll only stimulate the glands that are producing the oil then once a week you should probably use a stripping shampoo that will remove all traces of product buildup and oil i like the neutrogena anti residue formula because it isn't too stripping where it will ruin any artificial hair color Shampoo Dandruff Dry cleaning Soap Baldness treatments Nuclear fallout Sento Skin Acne Psoriasis Breastfeeding Cleanser Massage Human skin color Hair coloring Hair conditioner Contact lens Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Coal Industrial wastewater treatment Carbon dioxide sink Halitosis Town gas Dairy Printmaking Dishwasher Extreme Programming Wok Thyroid Vinegar Leather Sewage treatment Drawing Motor oil Washroom Embalming Polyethylene terephthalate Social rule Essential oil Sebaceous gland Knife Thermal power station Oily fish Kosher foods Coffee Phoebe Buffay's songs Pubic hair Hair (musical) Smoke-screen Carburetor Bong House Mouse E85 Wound healing phases Water Laundry detergent Car washing techniques Menstrual cycle Shaving Rice First aid Brush Puberty Peanut butter Bubblegum Tofu Panthenol Brewery Stroke Chocolate Technetium Reflexology Keeshond Hair color Pitaten Japanese tea ceremony Hydrochloric acid Perfume Fire dancing Guinea pig Transformer Lionel Corporation Multiple chemical sensitivity Menstrual cup Milton H.
