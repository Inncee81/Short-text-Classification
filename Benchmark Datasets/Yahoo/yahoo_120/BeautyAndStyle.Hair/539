how to deal with a halo of frizz on curly hair my hair is curly and frizzy especially now with the humidity the frizz is just out of control i can't let my hair down because of all the frizz and even in a ponytail the short hairs on my head stick out creating what i call the halo of frizz if i put gell or other products that only makes the frizz more compact but the little hair still stick out i tried using clips to tame the frizz and it would take over clips to keep it all in place and it looked bad would it be ok to just trim the halo of frizz and if so how short or is there something else that can be done don't cut that it will just make it stick out more when it grows try using anti frizz creams or some kind or ati frizz serum i think john freida and then use a defuser attachment on your blow dryer and dry your hair using it should help have softer curls Haircut Hair Shampoo Leaf Pubic hair Shaving Depilation Machinima Afro textured hair Textile manufacturing Ponytail Halo: Combat Evolved Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Knife Maltese (dog) Glossary of American football Dreadlocks Barbie Pottery Marilyn Monroe Pseudofolliculitis barbae Ice cream Halo (video game series) Beard The Ashlee Simpson Show Static (superhero) Homestar Runner Razor Casting Nintendo GameCube Dolly Parton Afro Equine conformation Fur Flamen Dialis Nine Inch Nails Baldness Keeshond Skinhead Cosmetics Phoebe Buffay's songs Xbox Trichome The Addams Family Poodle Bungie Studios Hay Poker jargon Guinea pig Counter-Strike The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Hair (musical) Napoleon Dynamite MCMXC a.D.
