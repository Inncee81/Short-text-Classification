do girls like guys who have long or short hair please explain why i am growing my hair to atleast to the middle of my back but would like for my hair to reach the middle of my butt i think that long hair on guys makes a guy look like a chick since stereotypically girls should have the longer hair but it's your life and if you like it then the girl should like you for the way you are and you shouldn't have to change something that you like about yourself just to do it her way Haircut Hair Puberty Baldness Kodocha Teen Girl Squad Totally Spies!
