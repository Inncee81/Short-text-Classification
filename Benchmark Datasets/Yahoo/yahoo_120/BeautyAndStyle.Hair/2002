is it safer to take hair vitamins from gnc store well i am concern about those hair vitamins at gnc store because something in the vitamins are too much like high biotin mcg and high vitamins a like iu is that too much taking biotin and vitamin a are very good for you most hair pills have mcg so mcg's is not alot besides the body gets rid of any excess biotin that the body doesnt use there are no known side effects of biotin as far as vitamin a you can get it ways either as vitamin a itself or as beta carotene from a plant that the body converts into vitamin a if you just take vitamin a itself too much can be toxic or more iu can cause headaches vomit blurred vision etc the recommended doseage for vitamin a is iu a day however some people may need more than others i believe iu is just fine if you take vitamin a as beta carotene you cant overdose because the body will only convert what it needs into vitamin a so check to see on the label what kind of vitamin a is inside of it Vitamin Retinol Folic acid Vitamin D Biotin Tocopherol Vitamin poisoning Vitamin C Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Milk Psoriasis Nutrition Dietary fiber Prostate cancer Isotretinoin B vitamins Cyanide Paracetamol Multiple sclerosis Cancer Hangover Lutein Niacin Stomach cancer Diabetes mellitus Raw food diet Signal transduction Rice Golden rice Mushroom Chronic fatigue syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Anorexia nervosa Non-medical use of dextromethorphan Hypoglycemia Medical prescription Rickets Sunlight Domestic rabbit Omega-3 fatty acid Clinical depression Potato Veganism Plutonium Migraine Caffeine Aspartame Common cold Warfarin Coffee Vegetarian nutrition Aspirin Melanin Spirulina Hamster Fish oil Oral contraceptive Carrot Sunscreen Scar Dieting Hyperthermia Antioxidant Egg (food) Radiation poisoning Marathon (sport) Cannabis (drug) Drug overdose Shampoo Atherosclerosis Oily fish Isoprene Polychlorinated biphenyl Controversies in autism Sildenafil Nutrient Cephalexin Eczema Acne Patent medicine Topiramate Osteoporosis Drug test Common bean Cocaine Human skin color Insulin Cyanocobalamin Protein Genetic engineering Chemotherapy Breastfeeding Ultraviolet Zinc Energy development Benign intracranial hypertension Traumatic brain injury Heart Protection Study
