proof ish tobi is not obito spoilerish hahaha ive been tellin people for ever that he is not obito and kinda randomly i was rereading manga chapters and in chapter kisame and itachi are talking and its raining and kisame tells itachi that it looks like he's crying and that its a shame that about his little brother then read here bottom pannel http www onemanga com naruto hahaha kisame says you're the sole member of the uchiha clan tho itachi says he knows sasuke is still alive but they are in the akatsuki with tobi which means they would know what he does and all therefore in my logic tobi is not part of the uchiha clan most likely meaning that he took uchiha madara's power and is not madara or obito muahahahahaha anyways i suppose that there is a slight possiblity that im wrong and the leader and unknown member are the only ones that know he's part of it but im betting that it isnt that way cuz it'd be pretty hard to hide it from the whole organization especially his partner hahaha well i dunno if we should trust kisame but doncha think that someone in the orginization would tell them or at least itachi would know and kisame would find out also i was just thinking do you think pein can like control weather or somfin i know its kinda random but at the end of that chapter pein's talking to the unknown member and tobi and it started raining again and the unknown member said pein you and he is from the rain village its really random but ya maybe maybe not Hatake Kakashi Naruto jutsu Uchiha Sasuke Naruto geography Naruto kekkei genkai Uzumaki Naruto Naruto (manga) Naruto ninja ranks Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 4 Hyuga Hinata Naruto: Narutimate Hero 2 Revenge Rock Lee Hyuga Neji Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 3 The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Nara Shikamaru Haruno Sakura Negima Randomness Gaara Samurai Deeper Kyo Alice's Adventures in Wonderland Akimichi Choji One Piece minor characters Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen 2 Craps YuYu Hakusho Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Naruto: Narutimate Hero Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Outlaw Star Jiraiya (Naruto) The Da Vinci Code Cardcaptor Sakura Tao Te Ching Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Gaia Online Pitaten Inuzuka Kiba Naruto: Gekitou Ninja Taisen Transformers: Cybertron Toby Keith Roswell UFO incident Combine (Half-Life 2) Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Wolf's Rain Seiy__ Poker jargon Saint Seiya V.F.D.
