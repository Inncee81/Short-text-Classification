where did gambit go i follow all the x men comic titles but found i got lost betwen current titles and x men the end title where did gamit go and why is he not in uncanny astonsihing and new gambit became death one of apocalypse's four horsemen in an attempt to infiltrate apocalypse's ranks in order to save the x men but he didn't realize that the transformation would warp his mind and body after the four horsemen were defeated sunfire brought gambit back to japan to clear his mind of apocalypse's brainwashing and to give him time to heal but they were approached by mr sinister gambit recently returned as a villain leading the marauders against the x men in x men in cable and deadpool cable makes a mental note that gambit doesn't seem to be himself still even though he does appear to be back to his normal self indicating that he may be under someone's mind control the x men the end stories are not in the same continuity as the regular x men titles so that may be confusing you Gambit (comics) House of M Cable (comics) Age of Apocalypse Dark Phoenix Saga X-Factor Wolverine (comics) Mister Sinister Deadpool Rogue (comics) Apocalypse (comics) X-Men Cable & Deadpool Sabretooth (comics) Jean Grey Weapon X Mystique (comics) Magneto (comics) Archangel (comics) Bob and George Psylocke Fabian Nicieza Ultimate X-Men Lady Deathstrike The Invisibles Cyclops (comics) Chess opening X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse Thunderbolts (comics) Doctor Eggman Onslaught (comics) Mirror Universe (Star Trek) Marvel Universe The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix Nasty Boys Book of Revelation Megatron Beast (comics) Vegeta Daredevil Venom (comics) X-Men: Evolution Captain Marvel (DC Comics) Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan Headmaster (Transformers) Caliban (comics) Exiles (comics) Joker (comics) Virtual Realm Astonishing X-Men Shannara creatures Messiahs in fiction and fantasy Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Mutant Massacre Methos Agent X Apocalypse Now Captain Britain Shadow the Hedgehog Rick Jones (comics) End times Cobra Commander Transformers: Cybertron Hyperion (comics) Healing Factor Luke Skywalker Sunfire Transformers: Energon Galvatron Fixer (comics) Deathstroke Rachel Summers Juggernaut (comics) Cybertron Protoss Master (Doctor Who) Shannara Druids Shockwave (Transformers) Sith Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Stryfe Ruy Lopez Series finale Hulk (comics) Silver Surfer Bishop (comics) Havok Sonic the Hedgehog Catwoman Spider-Man (games) X-Force Superhero Swamp Thing Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Marauders (comics) Omega Red Marvel vs. Capcom series
