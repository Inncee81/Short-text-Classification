super saiyan is very weak who agree's with me let me explain myself when goku reached the previous level of ssj his huge ki shook the earth and the seas and even the other world since even north kaioh felt it as he was there ok for the first transformation when chibi goku became ohzaru gold and then compressed his power into a being of normal size but then when he turns ssj there are no more than few earthquakes ok this trasformation happens several times more than the other one but this way the idea of how goku becomes poweful is halved most db fans think ssj should had been so powerful he would take the risk to destroy the earth if he just would have moved quite too roughly but they got really disappointed come on he barely defeats bebi he's useless against super goku hurted much more as a child goku is able to defeat a dragon more as a chibi than as ssj without considering the final victory the gt sometimes doesn't respect any logical thread of some events occurred in the z for example why in the gt does gohan turn ssj if during the z serie he reached the level of mystic gohan i'm sorry to admit it believe me but dbgt has been realized just with commercial meanings if only tori would wanted to have a hand in it another question who looks cool in these stages of super saiyan to me ssj future trunks ssj son goku ssj son goku saikyou no senshi mystic gohan ssj although it was very weak son goku and vegeta i agree raises hand and waves it Freeza Saga Future Trunks Shadow Dragon Saga Trunks Saga Dragon Ball Z Oozaru Tenshinhan Bebi Saga Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi Dragon Ball Z movies Piccolo Junior Saga Majin Buu Saga Saiyan Babidi Saga Fusion Saga Vegeta Saga Namek Saga Son Goku Freeza Super Android 17 Saga Dragon Ball GT King Piccolo Saga The Rebirth Of Fusion Son Goten Cell (Dragon Ball) Android 17 Hyperbolic Time Chamber Bebi Z Fighters Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2 Garlic Junior Saga Kid Buu Saga Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 3 Chibi Trunks Chi-Chi (Dragon Ball) World Tournament Saga Androids Saga Akuma (Street Fighter) Vegetto Genki Dama Bulma Buu Tullece Cooler (Dragon Ball) Rou Dai Kai__shin Tsufurujin Kami (Dragon Ball) First World Martial Arts Championship Saga Planet Vegeta Paragus Retcon Gotenks Ginyu Saga Red Ribbon Army Cell Games Saga Emperor Pilaf Saga Gogeta Black Star DragonBall Saga Dragon Ball Z: Budokai North Kaio Pan (Dragon Ball) Yamcha Dragon Ball (original series) Fanon (fiction) Mr. Satan End of Han Dynasty Tenkaichi Budokai Super Sonic Chibiusa Shadow the Hedgehog Bra (Dragon Ball) Bardock Fortuneteller Baba Saga Lord Slug Namek Great Saiyaman Saga Doctor Gero Bubble Bobble Videl Chibi Chibi Kryptonite Ecco the Dolphin R-Type Yajirobe Ox King (Dragon Ball) Boss (video games) Kyoryuu Sentai ZyuRanger Shun Goku Satsu Sailor Moon GunBound Michiru Kaioh
