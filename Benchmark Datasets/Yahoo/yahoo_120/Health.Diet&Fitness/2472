do you sabotage your diets when you start doing good or is it just me everytime i start a weight loss plan i'm focused and don't cheat once i start notice my clothes getting loose and people tell me i look thinner i relapse it never fails what is wrong with me i want to be thinner so what the i don't go back to junk food as a way to reward myself for the weight loss i go back to it because i start freaking that i've lost weight i don't understand why i do this i wish i knew the answer to that it would solve my problem i have always done the same thing that you are doing only gaining more weight than i lost in the first place some times in my life i have actually managed to lose weight and keep it off for a couple of months but i always end up putting it back on i think the real solution is to for real stop eating all those wonderful foods that taste so good even movie stars have to forgo the cake chips and icecream that tempt at every turn i haven't beaten the junk food gang but hopefully one day i will keep trying and maybe you could reward yourself with non food goodies when you reach a goal or even everytime someone say you look thinner Anorexia nervosa Atkins Nutritional Approach The Apprentice 2 Theory of conduct Super Size Me Dieting Social rule Goodness and value theory Adjustable gastric band Newcastle United F.C.
