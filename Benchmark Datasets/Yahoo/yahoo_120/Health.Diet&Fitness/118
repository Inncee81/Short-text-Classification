whats the ultimate energy molecule glucose atp why glucose is a molecule that when broken down it gives the potential energy to yield atp from adp and phosphate then atp has that potential stored in its bonds when these bonds get broken you get energy so the answer is atp is the ultimate energy molecule Adenosine triphosphate Cellular respiration Glycolysis ATPase Citric acid cycle Glucose Photosynthesis Sarcomere Fatty acid metabolism Phosphate Crista Oxidative phosphorylation Sugar Cell (biology) Adenosine monophosphate Enzyme Mitochondrial genetics Insulin Glycogen Calvin cycle Mitochondrion Thioester Thylakoid Muscle contraction Light-dependent reaction ATP synthase Glucokinase Active transport Fatty acid Protein kinase Gluconeogenesis Molecule Starch Metabolism Cardiac cycle Chemistry Redox Carbohydrate Membrane potential Signal transduction Glycosidic bond Phosphorylation Chemical formula Phosphorus Creatine Fermentation Matrix (biology) Hemoglobin Hydrogen Origin of life Skeletal muscle Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency Anaerobic respiration Cell membrane NaKATPase Protein Computational chemistry Glycemic index Actin Deoxyribose Brewery Chemoluminescence Energy Molecular motors Motility Activation energy Alkane Sucrose C4 carbon fixation Nuclease RuBisCO DNA RNA world hypothesis Mass spectrometry Chemical reaction Colloid Phosphoric acid Phospholipid Chemical bond Water (molecule) Ion gradient Alkene Orbital hybridisation Heat capacity Corrosion Aldehyde Diabetic ketoacidosis Covalent bond Red blood cell Dieting Ecology Electrochemical potential Alcohol Biomolecule Neurotransmitter Infrared spectroscopy Fat Whole proteome analysis
