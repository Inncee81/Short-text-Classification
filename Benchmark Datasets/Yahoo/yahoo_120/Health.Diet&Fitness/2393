how can i lose lbs in only month i am ' and weigh about i am to scared to weigh myself this is the heaviest i have ever been and feel gross to the average person they would not think i look fat or even over weight but mentally for myself i feel horrible i do not eat bad as is but am open to any recipes to change my diet i usually eat some sort of egg product or a egg sandwich for breakfast i always substitute a tomato for potato lunch a sandwich or just meat dinner i always eat some sort of protein and a veggie i usually snack on meat sticks and so forth i am not a junk eater and can not understand why i am the way i am i know i could benefit by exercising but i never have energy at the end of the day to get motivated enough to exercise any suggestions to help this for someone who is seeking advise and honest answers some of you are mean your eating doesn't sound too bad count your calories for a few days and see if you are actually eating more cals than you realize what you really need to do though is motivate yourself to exercise believe it or not it actually gives you more energy and helps you feel physically better if you go into it gradually and don't overdo to lose weight you have to burn more calories than you consume lowering your calorie intake too low is unhealthy and slows the weightloss process so the desirable alternative is to exercise which speeds up the metabolism and encourages the body to burn fat start by walking as briskly as you can for mins a day when that doesn't leave you out of breath move up to mins try to work up to hour eventually if you are so inclined you might add some jogging spurts in there buy you a few aerobics workout videos or dvds or tape fitness programs on tv and workout with them when i'm trying to lose weight i exercise mins in the morning yoga or toning scupting workouts and mins in the evening of cardio typically walking jogging i try to do this days a week and then maybe a min workout the other days of some sort but if i don't get to that i don't sweat it days of exercise is plenty if you have no energy at the end of the day to workout then get up earlier and exercise i get up at am every day so i can workout before i have to be at work at am if we want something bad enough we typically find a way to get it or do it if losing weight means enough to you you'll find a way to do what you need to do i understand how you feel i was obese for a decade and didn't want to be but that desire wasn't strong enough at the time to motivate me to change my eating or activity habits good luck Bodybuilding Obesity Vegetarianism Veganism Exercise Low-carbohydrate diet Breakfast Super Size Me Breastfeeding Anorexia nervosa Milk Food Hypoglycemia Cuisine of Denmark Hamburger Binge eating disorder Puberty McDonald's Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Calorie restriction Calorie Nutrition Coronary heart disease Tofu Healthy eating Dietary fiber Weight loss Egg (food) Clinical depression MRE Prostate cancer Bacon Equine conformation Chocolate Tocopherol Aerobic exercise French cuisine Coffee Organic food Sandwich Little Britain Aikido Junk food South Beach diet Omega-3 fatty acid Running Shit Meal Adjustable gastric band Social rule Tai Chi Chuan Food guide pyramid Fuel injection Chronic fatigue syndrome Energy Cat Protein-energy malnutrition Friends 2000 Australian Grand Prix Barbecue Protein Chicken Alcoholic beverage Robert Falcon Scott Sant Mat Jewish cuisine Trans fat Theory of conduct Unemployment Kodocha Marathon (sport) Guinea pig Vegetarian cuisine Sleep In-N-Out Burger Urinary incontinence Piccolo Junior Saga Peanut The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Jet engine Garfield Fecal incontinence Hot dog Hamster Sugar substitute French fries Folic acid Extreme Programming Snack food Stomach cancer
