gaining weight please help ok so everybody says im way too skinny and i know i am im male ' and weight like pounds but i just have a really high metabolism i need to gain weight fast but i wil not eat fast food or protein shakes pills etc what can i do to gain weight fast and not belly fat but in my arms legs neck etc would eating a gallon of ice cream do it haha please dont suggest any supplements protein shakes pills or any medication or fast food thank you my best suggestion would be weight lifting if you want to gain weight you want it to be good weight plus muscle outweights fat to so by gaining muscle you increase your chances of gaining weight if you haven't lifted before start with lower weights higher repetitions to build a good base as you develop your body you can start to do higher weights and lower repetitions as you increase your weights your own body weight will increase make a weight program for yourself make sure you include your bigger lifts bench press squat cleans dead lifts etc as well as some other lifts that focus on specific muscles for the first couple of weeks you're going to want to lift times a week i suggest monday wednesday friday you need to put rest days in between in the first couple of weeks you should be doing sets of repetitions at of your maximum weight for each lift for example if your max on bench is lb you should be doing repetitions at lbs do this for sets the first few weeks might feel easy but they are necessary you can't just show up on your first day and lift lbs you need to build your body as you continue your workout start to lower the repetitions and increase the weight by week four or so your exercises should look like this set x lbs set x lbs set x lbs set x lbs you shouldn't go any lower than repetitions in a set and those reps should not be easy as you begin to increase your weights and you begin doing of your max you should break up your workout into upper body and lower body back and workout times a week do upper body monday and thursday lower body tuesday and friday wednesday as a rest day when you get to this stage you will see a dramatic improvment in your size obviously this was a quick run though of a possible workout i suggest you get the personal help of a trainer or someone who can workout with you i used this workout to get in shape for football i began the workout in the winter and by the end of the next summer i had gone from lbs to lbs so it is very much possible to gain weight also if you begin to weight lift you're going to need protein you body just needs it to rejuvinate and build muscle avoiding shakes and supplements is perfectly fine during my training where i gained lbs i never used any supplements but i had alot of protein in my diet chicken eggs etc are very high in protien so is peanut butter after my workout i would make a shake i usually put in fruit carrots and yogart for flavor and i would throw in eggs you never taste the eggs in the final shake but you get the protein eggs have about g of protein i usually try and take in at least g of protein and no more than g after a workout just believe that you can do it the first step in the whole process is erasing the word can't from your vocabulary become motivated you have to want to gain weight to actually gain weight and you will gain weight if you want to i wish you the best of luck with everything Dieting Equine conformation Atkins Nutritional Approach Protein Veganism Exercise Fasting Milk Aerial (dance move) Tocopherol Obesity Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Peanut Prostate cancer Professional wrestling holds Brewery Puberty Tofu Anorexia nervosa Vegetarianism Clinical depression Swimming Marathon (sport) Body type (exercise) Creatine Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Professional wrestling throws Stuttering Diabetes mellitus Ice cream Low-carbohydrate diet Chocolate Breastfeeding Osteoarthritis Suplex Breakfast Triathlon Dietary fiber Egg (food) Urinary incontinence Traumatic brain injury Guinea pig Insulin Hypoglycemia Dairy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hamster Sugar substitute Repetitive strain injury Omega-3 fatty acid Organic food Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Fancy rat Cuisine of the Southern United States Babe Ruth STS-62 Siphon Tyrannosaurus rex Jewish cuisine Carnival Atherosclerosis Cancer Cuisine of Denmark Internal ballistics Coronary heart disease Cat TGV Mitsubishi 3000GT Lent Enzyme Coffee Food Hamburger Muscle Japanese cuisine Nutrition Chicken British House of Commons Swingout The Ashlee Simpson Show Dog Antarctic krill Protein-energy malnutrition Butter Boxing Adjustable gastric band Cuisine of the Philippines McDonald's Domestic goat Colorectal cancer Acorn
