i am lbs underweight is this something i should be worried about according to my bmi i'm underweight i am quite thin and i don't really eat three meals a day i often skip either breakfast or lunch i'm not starving myself but i never find myself to be hungry my parents get worried when i don't eat so i only eat practically because they tell me to not out of hunger should i be worried about these pounds what's the healthiest way to gain these pounds thanks in advance yeah i'm pretty much in the same boat the only real concern with being underweight is whether or not you are supplying your body with the nutrients it needs to perform normal physical and mental function if you are a male you will continue growing until you are in which case further physical development such as growing taller depends in part by genetics but mostly on nutrition if you are a female you'll know that you need to eat more if you do not get a monthly period healthiest way to gain weight is via protein and carbs but make sure to squeeze in dairy for bone maintence and fiber afterall its kinda nice to be able to poop in the morning Obesity Body mass index Dieting Milk Anorexia nervosa Food Veganism Nutrition Coeliac disease Vegetarianism Binge eating disorder Protein Weight training Breastfeeding Super Size Me Human height Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hypoglycemia Low-carbohydrate diet Puberty Nutrient Prostate cancer Folic acid Fasting Cephalic disorder Adjustable gastric band Stomach cancer Agriculture Breakfast Cheese Domestic rabbit Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fecal incontinence Urinary incontinence Physical examination Eating Raw food diet Brain McDonald's Meal Bodybuilding Chicken Insomnia Vegetarian nutrition Soybean Egg (food) Hunger Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hamburger Insulin Sexual attraction Fancy rat Acorn Spider Cystic fibrosis Healthy eating Chromosome Liger South Beach diet Tlingit Physical attractiveness Protein-energy malnutrition Salmon Tocopherol Domestic goat Bread Taboo food and drink Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Genetically modified food Terri Schiavo Colorectal cancer Norman Borlaug Cannabis (drug) Cell growth Radiation therapy Roman eating and drinking Vitamin C Diabetes mellitus Bovine spongiform encephalopathy Guinea pig Snack food Ketchup Japanese tea ceremony Omega-3 fatty acid Sexual reproduction Pound Liver Stuttering Sleep Sexual differentiation Growth hormone treatment Green Revolution Infantilism Cerebral palsy Domesticated turkey
