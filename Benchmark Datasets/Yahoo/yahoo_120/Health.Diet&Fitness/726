ab exercises when do i do them i have a routine strength training that i do but it works pretty much evrything but my abs ive gone through numerous ab routines separate from my other routine and they dont give the results i want so my question is should i do a separate ab workout or should i just add ab exercises to the workout i already do ps my current routine doesnt have any exercises that target my abs if this helps i always heard this do abs times a week do exercises sets of reps each i did this with different exercises but no real results but i heard that doing abs everyday is bad i heard they take longer than any muscle group to heal do the abs daily they have a hour recovery period it doesn't matter if you incorporate them into your current workout or do them separately Weight training Bodybuilding Exercise Urinary incontinence USS Wallace L.
