i am trying to loose weight any pointers i am not morbidly obese but i have put on a stone and a half over the past few months and am trying my hardest to loose it but i find myself craving chocolate and sugary foods mainly after lunch and dinner is there anything i can put in its place im also fed up looking at fruit so any other ideas i like cruncy things like cereal as it reminds me of crisps but cereal can also be bad in large quantities is there anything low in fat that i can eat a lot of and that is crunchy i'm not sure it's possible to get rid of cravings without indulging a little bit but you should restrict how much chocolate or sugary foods you eat when you do get these cravings like when you crave chocolate allow yourself just one or two small pieces no more as for losing weight the key is to burn more calories than you take it i think about calories equals one pound so exercise more and watch what you eat is the best way to go one thing that helped me keep track of my progress was a website called caloriesperhour com it allows you to input what you eat and therefore how many calories you've consumed as well as keep track of how many calories you've burned during the day even if all you've done is sit around you'll still have burned calories keep the number of calories consumed lower than the number of calories you've burned and you will begin to drop the pounds you also don't have to completely cut out the foods you love just because they're high on calories just try cutting the amount you would normally eat in half and make two meals out of what would normally be just one as for being able to eat a lot of something crunchy and low on calories there's nothing that comes to mind except maybe celery when you're trying to lose weight there's really nothing you can over indulge in without paying the consequences i think all none fruit or vegetable food has a decent amount of calories in it that quickly adds up even if it's advertised low fat good luck Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Obesity Breakfast Calorie Anorexia nervosa South Beach diet Food Low-carbohydrate diet Healthy eating Super Size Me Little Britain Calorie restriction Nutrition Chocolate Breastfeeding Hyperglycemia Adjustable gastric band Veganism Hamburger Food guide pyramid Tofu Binge eating disorder Dietary fiber Fecal incontinence Vegetarianism Bread Jewish cuisine Tooth Cereal Cuisine of Denmark Hamster Ice cream Omega-3 fatty acid Guinea pig Meal Sugar Kosher foods Energy Cuisine of the Philippines Internal ballistics French cuisine Weight loss Fasting Conker's Bad Fur Day Tocopherol Bodybuilding McDonald's Domesticated turkey Alcoholic beverage French fries Explosive material Weight training MRE Carburetor Acorn Chewing gum MyPyramid Folic acid Coffee Date Palm Garfield Poker jargon Passover Domestic rabbit Kashrut Egg (food) Life extension 613 mitzvot Chinese New Year Cuisine of Brazil Dairy Raw food diet Ramen Welding Snack food Organic food Roman eating and drinking Pound Theory of conduct Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Piccolo Junior Saga Soft drink Weight Watchers Burger King Fancy rat Microeconomics Equine conformation Cheese Aspartame Glycemic index Illegal drug trade
