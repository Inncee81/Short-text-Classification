how do women lift weights i usually take lb weights in both hands and then lift up to my chest to see a bulge in the bicep but i think this is resulting in me having really broad shoulders i want toned arms not muscular arms this is why i usually dont wear tank tops besides lifting weights i squat and do crunches but am i doing something wrong with the weight lifting if all your doing a bicep curl i don't see how that is going to make your shoulders broad especially with only lbs thats a totally different range of motion start with your arm straight down your side keep it straight as you raise your arm out to the side that is the primary motion of your deltoid anyway i say keep it up if not increase the weight but realise the female physique does not build muscle like males unless you inject testosterone add different motions tricep curl overhead press etc spread the workout to all the muscles in your arm chest back everything will even out and no one muscle will stick out unless you can curl lbs or bench lbs you will not look like a body builder Weight training Aerial (dance move) Equine conformation Professional wrestling throws Bench press Powerlifting Arm Humerus Swingout Breaststroke Bruce Lee Bodybuilding Suplex Weightlifting Muscle Clean and jerk Mr. Olympia Brassiere Puberty Professional wrestling attacks Scapula Gesture Elbow-joint Wing Chun Calisthenics Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Testosterone Hair Boxing Physical attractiveness Casualty lifting Volleyball Rotator cuff tear Archery Autopsy Pole vault Female bodybuilding Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Diving Lindy Basic Squat (exercise) Charleston (dance move) Canoe Gay slang Horizontal bar Mitsubishi 3000GT Androgen insensitivity syndrome Parade (military) Peripheral nervous system Professional wrestling aerial techniques Human position Gray Wolf Double bass Curling Flight controls Deltoid muscle Mixed martial arts Knitting P-61 Black Widow Front crawl Duchenne muscular dystrophy Stretching Urinary incontinence Helicopter Terminal ballistics Glossary of climbing terms Chair MS-06 Zaku II Aikido Sexual differentiation Car handling Field hockey Anatomical terms of location Deadlift Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Powerbomb Swimming Backstroke Glossary of ballet terms Sport rowing Salute Lift (force) Punch (strike) Badminton Heinkel He 112 Softball Tetrapod Tai Chi Chuan Butterfly stroke Straitjacket Backbreaker Press up Platypus Sailing Contredanse Diver rescue Scar Skateboarding trick Dumbbell
