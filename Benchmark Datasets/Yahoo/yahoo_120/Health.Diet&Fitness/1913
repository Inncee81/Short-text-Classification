eating disorder recovering advice i am currently recovering from a eating disorder i am '' and went from pounds to pounds in two months i didn't used to run and then after track i started running miles a day to running miles and walking i am taking steps towards becoming healthier but i still do not want to go back to pounds i would like to maintain a healthy pound frame while still running miles a day since i am a dedicated track runner i want to be healthy but i want to try to stay at pounds if i eat balanced and continue to run every day do you think i will be able to stay fit especially a toned stomach or will i fall back into pounds advice please really even is too thin more than that would be make you feel better i know it takes awhile i struggled with anorexia for long years recovery was the hardest thing i have ever had to do in my life i started a serious attempt about three years ago and i still struggle with the mental war that goes on in my head keep taking steps don't stop once you hit a certain weight because then you'll find yourself going back to unhealthy habits after that trust me that things get better the longer you can stick with it don't set weight goals but rather eating and life goals like for one try adding another little snack in everyday or instead of running the addition two miles every day try using that time to volunteer with kids or the elderly a few times a week it'll help you remember that there is more out there for your life than weight food and exercise just to help you out here are some things i don't miss about my ed i don't miss being freezing cold every waking moment i would shiver constantly wear coats in the summer take showers a day just to feel warm i don't miss aching all over i never realized my muscles and joints hurt so much until i was able to sustain a normal level of body fat for a month i don't miss the headaches i don't miss crying almost everyday i don't miss lying to my friends and family i used to avoid them because they would inevitably do something involving eating i now get to have much more fun with them i don't miss seeing tears in my mom's eyes when she would hug me and i'd feel her hands trying to count my ribs i don't miss losing control and blacking out for periods of time it'd usually be in the morning when i was trying to get ready for work i almost lost my job because i'd be hours late some days i don't miss co workers telling me i looked awful they'd always say 'oh you don't look so good are you sick ' or 'weren't you able to sleep last night ' okay this is long and sappy but while it's different for everyone i've been through the same eating issues and wasted too much of my life on my ed stay strong Shaggy dog story Obesity Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Dieting Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Social rule Atkins Nutritional Approach Bodybuilding Jon Secada Milton H.
