juicing blending i'm thinking of doing a bit of a detox and don't have a juicer could i use a blender instead would this work and would you get more goodness as i'd use all the fruit or veg if you blend you end up with thick goo which then needs water or something to make it drinkable just blend a carrot or two to see what i mean also juicing has the added effect of concentrating the essential minerals and vitamins you digest better as well and liquid is a far greater detoxing agent then thick goo detox involves flushing so liquid is better and don't forget to take lots of water as well if you want to use the pulp to add to your diet you can use it to make soups etc but that is apart from the effect and positive impact of juicing however you must decide on your own disciplines you will be amazed at how much juice comes out of two or three large carrots and an apple if you use quality produce you will fill a large glass don't forget to include some green veg from time to time such as some spinach leaves kale etc use carrot and apple as your base start with smaller quantities as well if you just make a huge glass to start with you will feel like your head is spinning out that's the ultimate proof of the condescing effect of juicing you can add some whole veg from time to time that don't juice very well such as courgettes good luck and good juicing Rum Hamster Cider Alcoholic beverage Coffee Russian cuisine Sugar beet Food Beer Champagne (beverage) Cuisine of Denmark Carrot Vitamin C Veganism Honey Folic acid Sewage treatment Yoghurt Wood pulp Tofu Glass Peruvian cuisine Fecal incontinence Wine Nutrition Egg (food) Potato Salad Apple Sauerkraut Dietary fiber Water Vodka Collard greens Mango Brandy Breakfast Lemon Cuisine of the Philippines Bong Sulfuric acid Chicken soup Jewish cuisine Orange juice Minute Maid Tooth Mayonnaise Vinegar Wine making French cuisine Tooth enamel SoBe Aspartame Chocolate Ramen Carbon dioxide Cake Cookware and bakeware Bengali cuisine Banana Orange (fruit) Kosher foods Soup Pomegranate Martini cocktail Vitasoy Domesticated turkey German cuisine RISC Paint Kale Soy milk Drink Vegetarian nutrition Poker jargon Sugar Hydrochloric acid Ice cream Antioxidant Domestic rabbit Retinol Gramophone record Omega-3 fatty acid Cat Fruitarianism Dim sum Flowering plant Textile manufacturing Ecology Uranium Jam Cuisine of the Southern United States Vitamin
