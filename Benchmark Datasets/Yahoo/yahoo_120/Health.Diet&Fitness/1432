why don't i notice my weight loss i have lost pounds in weeks but i can't notice it by looking at myself i weigh stones why can i not see any difference yet because lbs is not a large amount of weight and since you have lost it over the span of weeks you have only been losing lbs a week often because you or people who are around you daily the loss is not noticed as much at first until you start losing larger amounts of weight or gaining muscle tone but if you were to go and see a friend or relative you have not seen in over a month they will probably compliment you on how you look also keep in mind alot of the weight lost at first is water and food waste if you started eating more healthy your system is gonna start clearing out waste that has been stuck inside your intestines and the access water retention in your fat cells so once you burn off the first lbs you will realy start seeing a differnce in your body tone it depends on whether you are just dieting or if you are excersising too dieting will help with weight loss but will not cause your muscles or skin etc to tone or firm up Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Muscle Obesity Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Insulin Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Weight training Super Size Me Protein Dialysis Adjustable gastric band Weight loss Stomach cancer Weight Nutrition Tocopherol Vitamin C Bodybuilding Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Domestic rabbit Clinical depression Diabetes mellitus Binge eating disorder Breastfeeding Low-carbohydrate diet Pound Anorexia nervosa Puberty Skin Cancer Dietary fiber South Beach diet Milk Glucocorticoid Marathon (sport) Mixed martial arts Elephant Protein-energy malnutrition Human skin color Prostate cancer Tofu Cirrhosis Exercise Diarrhea Fancy rat Fugu Weight Watchers Hydrogen economy Dehydration Guinea pig Weighing scale Folic acid Doxepin Decibel Brain Raw food diet Coronary heart disease Albatross Cephalic disorder Growth hormone treatment Physical attractiveness Coconut crab Sewage treatment Egg (food) Sea Otter Wood Sperm Whale Fecal incontinence Homer Simpson Acorn Acne Vitamin Cholesterol Hamster Creatine Swimming Fetal development English unit Microeconomics Biotin Growth hormone Equine conformation Single Transferable Vote Energy development Healthy eating Hiking Brown Bear Omega-3 fatty acid Lung cancer Tooth enamel Red Fox Internal ballistics Potassium Great White Shark Eye Chocolate Tasmanian Devil
