soy based baby formula is made of corn syrup is this bad i was looking at the ingrediants of a soy based baby formula and noticed it was made up of corn syrup plus other sugars isn't this unhealthy i know babies need fatty acids but this seems like alot the regular formula does not mention corn syrup in the ingredients at all does anyone have some insight on this very weird the brand is similac by the way someone mentioned to me that maybe it has corn syrup to add calories because soy milk does not have alot of calories but even so there are healthy ways to add calories i'd be very leery of it there are some studies that indicate that the rise in obesity is partially due to so many foods using high fructose corn syrup no way would that be healthy for a baby but it's probably best to ask your pediatrician and see what they say Corn syrup Soy milk Sugar Soft drink Tofu Atkins Nutritional Approach Breastfeeding Omega-3 fatty acid Veganism Healthy eating Soul food Chewing gum Coca-Cola Soybean Ice cream Golden syrup Nutrition Starch Pancake Bodybuilding Soy protein Soy sauce Bread Sucrose Cantonese cuisine Junk food Cuisine of Singapore Pepsi Max Infant formula Vegetarianism Cuisine of Malaysia Dieting Twix Ramen The Coca-Cola Company Honey Glycogen storage disease type I Maple syrup Bacon Gatorade Sugar beet Maize Trans fat Dr Pepper Sauce Food Low-carbohydrate diet Food preservation Taiwanese cuisine Energy McDonald's Sugarcane Margarine Patent medicine Pecan pie Sucralose Glycerin New Coke Japanese cuisine Barbecue Milkshake Chocolate Food guide pyramid Aspartame Flour Cheese Fat Sushi Pepsi-Cola Alcoholic beverage Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Fast food Diet soda Rum Monosodium glutamate Dietary fiber Peruvian cuisine Fructose Food additive In-N-Out Burger Natt__ Protein-energy malnutrition Insulin Lactobacillus acidophilus Vegetarian cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Rice pudding Diet Coke Coffee Calorie Tortilla Pomegranate Saturated fat Chili con carne Carbohydrate
