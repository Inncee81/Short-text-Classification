exercise help will this work okay so my plan was to walk jog everyday and do stretches and crunches afterwards well i did this a couple days ago did crunches sets of and my abs are still killing me so i haven't stuck to my plan since cause i'm still in pain my husband says i should do it anyway and doing crunches will make the pain go away i'm not sure what to do and i have started and stopped this plan several times because of this same problem also i'm curious if when i actually do stick to this plan is it enough to tone up my skin i've lost almost lbs and have some loose skin but it's not too bad also would like some advice for that thanks in advance you need a different plan i would suggest you continue an aerobic form of exercise such as jogging walking on a daily basis incorporate into that some form of core exercise and strength training however keep a day in between the core and or strength training this gives the muscles a chance to heal before you continue on this is very important or you will continue to be discouraged the other thing you need to remember is that you need to start slow and work up that many crunches to start with are far too many there are other more effective ways to work on your abs without all the pain my suggestion would be to find a pool to workout in for now while your abs are healing then start on a program with much less rigid reps to start with and build up consult a personal trainer you should be able talk with one at an athletic club or ywca for next to nothing check this site for two articles for starting your exercise program http www products fitness com articles html sounds like you are on the way to a healthy life style hope these suggestions will help you get yourself started on a program that you can work into slowly without the discouragement good luck you should see some changes in the loose skin but that is also dependent on the resiliency of your skin type Weight training Running Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Exercise Stomach cancer Prostate cancer Swimming Fecal incontinence Bodybuilding Muscle Aerobic exercise Aikido Iliotibial band syndrome Urinary incontinence Social rule Repetitive strain injury Psoriasis First aid Infantilism Massage Radiation therapy Equine conformation Game programming Myocardial infarction Medicine Brassiere Poker jargon Scientology beliefs and practices Heart rate Growth hormone treatment Dualism (philosophy of mind) Clinical depression Thermoregulation Babe Ruth The Inside Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Stroke World Wide Web Carpal tunnel syndrome Skin Diving Human height Natural Selection (computer game) Stopping power Theory of conduct Tocopherol Piccolo Junior Saga Cancer Osteoarthritis Tai Chi Chuan Chinese martial arts Physical attractiveness Alcoholics Anonymous Marathon (sport) Timpani Hyperthermia Utilitarianism Video game developer Atherosclerosis Characters of Naruto Pneumonia Hiking Nicomachean Ethics Le Malade imaginaire Boxing training Creatine Wound healing phases Electroshock gun Divorce Wood Breastfeeding Chronic fatigue syndrome Wart Enzyme Insulin Pain Violin It's All Gone Pete Tong Blood (computer game) Cole Porter Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Stress fracture Obedience training Theodicy Extreme Programming Scar Physical fitness Asthma EastEnders Domain Name System Kasparov versus The World Quotation mark Adjustable gastric band Aerial (dance move) Horse Grief
