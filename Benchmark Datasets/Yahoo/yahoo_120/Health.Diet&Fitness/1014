after exercising in the gym how many many minutes should i wait before hitting the showers how many minutes should i wait after working out as not to harm my muscles i'm in the gym now just done working out so a quick reply is greatly appreciated thanks because isn't it bad to wash your hands after activities like maybe playing the piano for an hour or writing without stopping it may cause the hand to tremble even when you're trying to control it you can't i think that is just a latin superstition my husband refuses to shower while he is hot he thinks he has to be cooled down or he will get muscle cramps i told him that modern medicine begs to differ but he grew up with these superstitions and cannot accept that they may not be true First aid Weight training Urinary incontinence Swimming Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Social rule Milton H.
