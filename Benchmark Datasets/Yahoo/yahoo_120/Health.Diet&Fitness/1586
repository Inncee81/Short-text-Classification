what would be a good breakfast for me if i don't have long to make it i'm so when i go to school in the morning i don't have a long time for breakfast i haven't got time to start chopping up fruit and all that so i need a very healthy breakfast as i go to the gym times a week it also has to be as filling as possible suggestions at the moment i have a cup of tea with one sugar which i really need to get me through the day a not very healthy cereal and toast p s i don't eat eggs bagels toast quickly and you can put cream cheese tomato cucumber whatever you like on it eggs are filling due to their high protein content you probably wouldn't want to eat them everyday but they'll keep you full until lunchtime a lot better than a bowl of cheerios will and probably the quickest way to do this is to scramble them you could also hard boil them the night before and grab them on your way out the door also fruit is very healthy though not exactly filling and you could eat something that requires no prep time like a banana an apple an orange a pear something like that yogurt with fruit and granola mixed in is quick and doesn't really require preparation other than mixing it up with a spoon probably your best bet is to do as much preparation as possible the night before leftovers can make good breakfast you could make yourself some sort of wrap or breakfast burrito the night before and either heat it up or eat it cold in the morning hummus and guacamole are filling and healthy and you could eat these wrapped in a tortilla or flatbread or spread on a bagel with veggies or cheese or whatever you like if you prepare it the night before you can have a really nice healthy filling breakfast ready for you when you wake up things you'll probably want to avoid include anything really sugary or heavily grain based as these things will give you an energy rush that will quickly go away and leave you tired and hungry fill yourself up with protein and fiber in the morning and you should be happy until lunchtime Bread Bagel Cuisine of the Philippines Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Breakfast cereal MRE Vegetarian cuisine Pizza Cheerios Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Tea Peruvian cuisine Vegetarianism Full English breakfast Veganism Food preservation Hamburger Yoghurt Sandwich Cuisine of Argentina German cuisine Polish cuisine Fecal incontinence French cuisine Pancake D__ner kebab Tofu Cuisine of Brazil Kellogg Company Milk Porridge Cheese Muesli Organic food Hot dog Ice cream Avocado Cuisine of the Southern United States Rice pudding McDonald's Russian cuisine Korean cuisine Hamster Sushi Hummus In-N-Out Burger Bengali cuisine Meal Snack food Recipe Roman eating and drinking Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Fruit Kit Kat Burrito Soy protein Chili con carne Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Coffee French toast Dumpling Dietary fiber Mexican cuisine Food guide pyramid Tamale Healthy eating Food Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Oreo Salad Theory of conduct Tomato Pop-Tarts Soybean Ron and Fez Kosher foods Sausage Fast-food restaurant Cajun cuisine The Rutles Dairy Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Taco Tea (meal) Cha chaan teng Hong Kong-style milk tea Toast
