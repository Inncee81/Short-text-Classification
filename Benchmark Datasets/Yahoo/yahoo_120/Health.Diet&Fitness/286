switching between weights i've heard from a couple different trainers when weight training that you are suppose to do your lower body first then upper i've also heard to rotate both do a couple upper then lower mix it up which is correct doesn't matter really i'm thinking that your trainers are also pretty well rather weird since cycling workouts by upper and lower body is a bodybuilding practice i don't think you want to be a bodybuilder anyway the best gauge for which workout to start with is to workout the large muscle groups before the smaller ones this is just so that you can exert more force and effort trigger a better hypertrophic effect or a greater fitness effect involving more muscle groups before moving on to smaller less significant ones more muscles means more work besides if you start with your smaller muscle groups your compound exercises bench squat deadlift will get weaker and you'll lift less weight not a good thing Bodybuilding Deadlift Exercise Equine conformation Powerlifting Triathlon Weightlifting Bench press Professional wrestling holds Urinary incontinence Aikido Brassiere Internal ballistics Squat (exercise) Creatine Appeal Female bodybuilding Mass Dieting Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Anorexia nervosa Stuttering Atherosclerosis Humerus Puberty Car handling Professional wrestling throws Heart Bicycle Weight Sauna Clinical depression Eye Gravity Glossary of partner dance terms Protein Tide Propeller Ronnie Coleman House of Lords WCW Power Plant Jet engine Tetrapod Overtraining Massage Action potential Muay Thai Terminal ballistics Archery Body mass index Narrow gauge Motorcycle Electric motor Anabolic steroid Ozone layer Chronic fatigue syndrome Diving TGV Aerial (dance move) Swimming Lou Ferrigno Dog training Carburetor Extreme Programming Tire M16 (rifle) Wind turbine Space Shuttle program Social rule Skateboarding trick Tank Hand grenade Strap-on dildo Aortic valve stenosis Cardiac arrhythmia Babe Ruth Bicycle helmet Recumbent bicycle Fecal incontinence Milton H.
