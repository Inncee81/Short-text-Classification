how much weight will i lose in ten days if i do this details inside please look okay i don't want anybody saying that i shouldn't be doing this or i'm too young or i'll be anorexic cuz it's only for ten days if someone says that i'll report you not to be mean but i've delt with a lot of that already i'm ' and pounds i need to lose at least a pound a day for ten days cuz that when i start high school i have the whole day to exercise and all that here's my plan burn calories on the exercise bike do crunches run miles a day should it be for breakfast dry cereal that sixty calories per serving and one gram of fat and grams of fiber a cup of grapes for lunch same as breakfast for snack fruit for dinner whatever my mom gives me how much weight will i lose if i stick to it please give good honest answers thanks in advance ten points to best answer all that in one day wow just be careful don't overdo yourself take some breaks too that's not being anorexic so what they saying well i don't think it's true if you can do all that in a day then you should lose about lbs and day or more depending on the calories you intake here's some of my advice to lose weeight build muscle it'll take your extra fat fat that didn't get burn i don't exactly remember how drink lots of water eat nuts and raisins to increase metabolism workout eat healthy eat slowly because it takes awhile for food to digest so it takes awhile to be full after eating eating slowly will allow you to know when you're full to eat less don't sit in front of the tv while eating pretty much pay attention only to your food when you eat also allow your body to tell you when you're hungry when it growls eat do aerobic exercises do min exercises then have a min break you'll lose more wight than not taking breaks at all play music that you enjoy or music that makes you feel like dancing to you'll exercise more longer you can run in one place for min per day or more or run up and downstairs or jog run walk around your block then slowly increase the time by min per day and if you're gonna do sit ups cutches pull ups etc add per day starving will get you skinnier but at the end of it when you eat normally again your body will be saving it and you'll gain weight faster like bears saving their food for the winter also laughing for minutes burns calories if you get cravings in afternoon it means you're not getting enough food in the day have and extra half apple or an extra of something healthy for breakfast or have a snack before yur usual cravings start everyday all these have been proven true here
