eating small meals i know it's supposedly good for you but does anyone have any examples i'm kinda confused about what counts as a small meal and when you should have them well my best thought about how to identify a small meal is to eat until you are satisfied not until you're full eating a little slower helps with that too but that's a different point some people say that you should have a meal the size of your fist but some people's stomachs are smaller than their fist some people's stomachs are bigger than their fist because of that it's not a very good rule of thumb most of the eat small meals diet programs i've seen which mostly claim you can eat whatever you want as long as you follow certain steps for eating it are basically different variations of eating until you are satisfied they go by the discovery that the brain doesn't get the message from your stomach that you are actually full for about minutes after you have reached that point as such eating until you feel full can actually make you over full because of how long it takes for your brain to get the message by eating until you are satisfied you won't get over full and you won't be hungry when you leave the table which a lot of starvation diets do and that only makes you want to eat more Meal Fasting Stomach cancer Binge eating disorder Professional wrestling holds Fecal incontinence Adjustable gastric band The Time Machine Cheese Cuisine of Denmark Hypoglycemia Garfield Dieting Japanese tea ceremony Professional wrestling match types Super Size Me Omega-3 fatty acid Sheepshead Fugu Gastroparesis Draw poker Chopsticks Double the Fist Anorexia nervosa Hunger Atkins Nutritional Approach Betting (poker) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jumpstart 3rd Grade Boxing Contract bridge Little Britain Homer Simpson Professional wrestling attacks Raw food diet Weight training Obesity Tea (meal) Kashrut Poker jargon Blackjack Ramen Single Transferable Vote Tomato Trigonometric function Glucokinase The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Piccolo Junior Saga Knife CPU design Fast bowling Egg (food) YuYu Hakusho Drowning English grammar Eating Vegetarianism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Comanche Object-oriented programming Shen Gong Wu Treehouse of Horror XV Kosher foods Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mahjong Salad Fingers Cuisine of Brazil Ojibwe language Hand Veganism Hiccup First aid Escape from New York Nutrition Mnemonic Oh Hell Bl__t 613 mitzvot Falconry Surreal number McDonald's Quicksort Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Cancer Wushu Skat Invader Zim Treehouse of Horror V Human Action potential Glossary of partner dance terms Dyslexia Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Albatross Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Theory of conduct Swingout Hiberno-English Publication of Darwin's theory
