i lost pound in day my breakfast was a bowl of cereal only calories my lunch was salad with tuna and my dinner was the same as my breakfast i also went to the gym and burned about calories how did this happen i still cant believe it try not weighing yourself everyday perhaps try every other day or every two days even once a week when your body feels under nourished it can hold onto fat especially in your stomach muscle weighs more than fat so depending on the type of exercise there is a possibility you built muscle tone resulting in your scale not budging i looked this up below good luck your weight can fluctuate or more pounds within a single day or from one day to the next this fluctuation can be caused by water retention different clothing weighing at different times of the day etc it is very difficult to gain or lose even one pound of fat throughout the course of a day gaining and losing fat are slow processes that add up over time therefore weighing yourself after a large meal or exercise with a different scale or more than once a day is not a good indicator of fat gain or loss Dieting Weight training Atkins Nutritional Approach Bodybuilding Obesity Breastfeeding Breakfast Anorexia nervosa Super Size Me Weight Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Meal Milk Adjustable gastric band Insulin Calorie Cuisine of Denmark Urinary incontinence Weighing scale Protein-energy malnutrition McDonald's Tofu Exercise French cuisine Tocopherol Low-carbohydrate diet Swimming German cuisine Body type (exercise) Nutrition Pound Prostate cancer Fasting Growth hormone treatment Skin Diabetes mellitus Marathon (sport) Osteoarthritis Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Veganism Gastric bypass surgery Aerobic exercise Coffee Cheese Bread Food Alcoholic beverage Hamburger Roman eating and drinking Roman currency Sleep Energy Bacon Traumatic brain injury Coeliac disease South Beach diet Slim Fast Jewish cuisine Equine conformation Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Omega-3 fatty acid The Contender (television series) Domesticated turkey Hyperglycemia Diabetic neuropathy Mass Indian cricket team in Zimbabwe in 2005-06 Ton Egg (food) Healthy eating Aspartame Tyrannosaurus rex Fat Stroke Wood Great White Shark Hydrogen economy Thermoregulation Calorie restriction Ketosis Garfield Dietary fiber Explosive material Clinical depression Chinese New Year Welding Cuisine of the Southern United States Glycogen storage disease type I Dinner Carbon dioxide Creatine Acorn Anchor Physical attractiveness
