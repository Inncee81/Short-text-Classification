do any of these diets work people with experience please answer i was just wondering if the apple diet or the banana diet or the tea diet or the liquid diet work like any of them apple diet just eating apples yogurt banana diet just eating bananas milk tea diet just drinking tea liquid diet just drinking liquids thanks any of those will cause weight loss however because they are so restrictive and low calorie you will immediately put the weight back on when you stop using the diet because you cannot continue to eat drink that way indefinitely this is the case with most diets they contribute to weightloss because eating so few calories has to but if the dieter hasn't learned to make a lifestyle change for long term they are a waste of time eat a healthy well balanced diet all the time and exercise days a week shoot for hour a day and you'll lose weight the healthy way when you reach your goal you can make an adjustment to your eating and or your exercise so that you maintain weight not keep losing good luck Dieting Breastfeeding Anorexia nervosa Obesity Adjustable gastric band Nutrition Weight training Fecal incontinence Super Size Me Healthy eating Weight Watchers Veganism South Beach diet Weight loss Soft drink Chocolate Vegetarianism Bodybuilding Kit Kat Hypoglycemia Milk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hyperglycemia Fancy rat Urinary incontinence Diabetes mellitus Alcoholic beverage Prostate cancer Pig (zodiac) Omega-3 fatty acid Raw food diet Yoghurt Calorie restriction McDonald's Diarrhea Egg (food) Drink Potassium Tea Bread Binge eating disorder Food guide pyramid Fasting Dairy Tooth Folic acid Breakfast Explosive material Guinea pig Japanese tea ceremony Diet of Japan Dick Gregory Stomach cancer Coffee Food Junk food Hamster Clinical depression Cuisine of the Philippines Bong Coconut crab Life extension Terri Schiavo Marathon (sport) Cheerios MyPyramid Insulin Nim Chimpsky Tofu Cheese Vitamin C Zone diet Koala Domestic rabbit Snapple Cuisine of Denmark Margarine Hamburger Apple Matt Hardy Diet soda Carburetor Chronic fatigue syndrome In-N-Out Burger Gout Singlish Beer Cancer Meal Vitasoy Fanta Dehydration Equine conformation Water Tea (meal)
