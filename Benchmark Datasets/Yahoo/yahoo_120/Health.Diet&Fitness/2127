what is wrong with me i can't lose weight for about months now i have been trying to lose weight i hit the gym times a week sometimes twice a day burning anywhere between calories a session i have also cut back on my food intake eating only when i'm hungry drinking lots of water and carefully watching what i eat a little over a month into this i weighed myself expecting to see at least a little shift in the scale and hadn't lost an ounce so i started taking alli to help the weight come off i have kept up with my regime and i've been watching what i eat even more i see some physical results but definitley not as much as a should and i am terrified of the scale what is wrong with me is there anything i can do to make the weight come off help to chels n i'm years old and to jimmy i didn't think you could really hit a plateu unless you've already lost a few pounds but i am by no means an expert so i'm probably wrong lol and just to add i have about pounds to lose i have a diet that will let you lose up to lbs a week it works extremely well but you really have to follow it you can't snack or cheat during the day because the foods that you eat and in the order that you eat them makes the diet work it also helps if you have a scale at home breakfast fruits and starch snack non fat milk snack like yogurt lunch veggies protein starch fruit snack something natural almonds peanuts unsalted dinner veggies protein eat hours before bed no salt no white sugar you can have a cheat once a week so you don't go crazy do this for weeks and start adding starch for dinner then veggies or fruit as appropriate i lost lbs in about a month and a half and my dad lost over lbs it really worked for both of us i'm by the way so if you're my age you can definately do it Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Milk Food Pound Cheese Hamster Tofu Hypoglycemia Bodybuilding Veganism Tooth Ice cream Garfield Breastfeeding Super Size Me Low-carbohydrate diet Weight training Peanut Obesity Cuisine of the Philippines Yoghurt Fasting Meal Healthy eating Protein Vegetarianism Tocopherol Chocolate Rice pudding Sugar The Contender (television series) Bread Guinea pig Fecal incontinence Little Britain MRE Soy milk Hamburger Jewish cuisine Nutrition Kosher foods Tea (meal) Cake Coffee Insulin Homer Simpson Binge eating disorder Organic food Dietary fiber Shaggy dog story Vegetarian cuisine Folic acid Peanut butter Bacon Anorexia nervosa Tea Soft drink Ham German cuisine Glucose Sugar substitute 613 mitzvot Crohn's disease Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest Soybean Protein-energy malnutrition Cuisine of the Southern United States Adjustable gastric band Cuisine of Brazil South Beach diet Calorie Slim Fast Dairy Pancake Ron and Fez Pizza Social rule Calorie restriction Watermelon Domesticated turkey Taiwanese cuisine Dim sum Food guide pyramid Springfield Elementary School Peruvian cuisine In-N-Out Burger Raw food diet Potassium Weight loss Glycemic index Delicatessen
