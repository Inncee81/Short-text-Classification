i wasn't clear the last time ok i worked out my leg muscles yesterday on my exercise bike there was some resistance then i accidentally went on the bike again today it wasn't a full session like yesterday it was about minutes because i realized i already worked my muscles in that area but i do feel sore mainly in my inner and outer thighs and i've never felt this sore before i basically had resistance training days in a row did i harm my muscles did i ruin the process of muscle building and instead cause muscle depletion if not what did i do thanks ahead of time i don't think you did any permanent damage those muscles just need to take it easy for a couple of days take some ibuprofen or aspirin to relieve some of the soreness drink plenty of water and try to rest those muscles try going for a light walk or swimming a little tomorrow and the day after just to work the stiffness out then get back into your regular routine Weight training Exercise Fecal incontinence Bicycle Bodybuilding Triathlon Equine conformation Cramp Urinary incontinence First aid Diving Swimming Osteoarthritis Marathon (sport) Chronic fatigue syndrome Running Asthma Mattress Breaststroke Muscle Carpal tunnel syndrome Aerial (dance move) Myocardial infarction Traumatic incident reduction 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tension headache Poliomyelitis Iliotibial band syndrome Mr. Olympia Traumatic brain injury Stretching Menstrual cup Bike lane debate USS Wilkes (DD-441) The Beatles discography Repetitive strain injury Childbirth Biped Tai Chi Chuan Blonde on Blonde Gout Cliff Richard Strap-on dildo Stroke Hey Jude Mountain bike Milton H.
