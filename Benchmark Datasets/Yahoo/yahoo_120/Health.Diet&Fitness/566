why is it that i feel i can eat and eat wen i am bored and i never get full but i cant wen i am not bored because you need something to do when you start eating your stomach begins to feel full but does not relay this message to your brain for quite some time most experts say it is about minutes this is a long time to eat and eat i know all about what you are experiencing i eat the same way so i have real world experience when it is mealtime your brain is prepared for a meal it is ready for food it knows that it should be sending signals that you are full soon unfortunately because you have eaten such a volume of food while you are bored your stomach is stretched so it takes longer for it to send messages to your brain telling it you are full and this keeps repeating itself until you are at the point you are at where you can eat until you are blue in the face and not get full what to do about this problem if only i knew i would write a book and give you a free copy good luck my boredom feasting friend Stomach cancer Hypoglycemia Fasting Little Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Garfield Gastroparesis Comanche Binge eating disorder The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Morse Code Anorexia nervosa Publication of Darwin's theory Conspiracy (TNG episode) Insulin Boredom Brain Pain Wen Jiabao RuneScape quests Waking the Dragons Kodocha Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Japanese tea ceremony Drowning Fugu Teen Girl Squad Meal Cheese Nutrition Obesity Eating God Emperor of Dune The Amazing Race Passover Jumpstart 3rd Grade Psilocybin Adjustable gastric band Bernard Williams Public-key cryptography Reservoir Dogs Hannibal Lecter 613 mitzvot Francis Crick Urinary incontinence Guinea pig Current teachings of Prem Rawat Lutefisk Chocolate Eucharist Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Breastfeeding Mojave people Dog training Shenzhou 6 YuYu Hakusho Japanese New Year Vostok 1 Broadband Internet access Action potential Eating disorder Gmail Fecal incontinence Stroke Marshall McLuhan Cat Kosher foods Spam (electronic) Veganism Clacks (Discworld) Foodborne illness Raw food diet Vomiting April Fool's Day Out-of-body experience Cuisine of Denmark Hunger Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Air traffic controller Scientology beliefs and practices Tomato The Demon Headmaster Infantilism Ethernet Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Purim International response to Hurricane Katrina Salad Fingers Tenshinhan The Amber Spyglass Terri Schiavo Professional wrestling holds Egg (food) Alexander Technique Lucid dreaming My Parents are Aliens Human adaptation to space EastEnders Mercury Atlas 6 Homer Simpson
