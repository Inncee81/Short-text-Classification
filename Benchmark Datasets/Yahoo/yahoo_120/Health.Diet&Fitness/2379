should i drink my protein shake using milk everytime i do i end up feeling sick in my stomach all the time i don't know if im lactose intolerant but is there going to be any difference if i mix water with my protein shake instead of milk finally if i do continue to drink with milk which i've been doing for months will it all go to waste when i get diarrhea thanks i take my shake after workouts i would talk to a doctor an allergist may have the most info about it typically milk tastes better with protein powder but if you are allergic or sensitive to it it's better to take it with water i've seen a couple protein powders that were unflavored so they can also be mixed with fruit juice as far as the effect there is no difference of whether you take protein powder with milk or water you still get the same protein from the powder if you do drink it with milk you will get some benefits of it but the amount of that benefit will vary depending on if it's an allergy sensitivity or intolerance oh another possibility that just popped in my head when are you taking the protein powder are you taking it right before the workout after it or an hour or two beforehand if you are taking it right before your workout that may be causing the stomach upset i've got that problem i can't eat or drink anything other than water within an hour or two before an intense workout or i get a really upset stomach Lactose intolerance Milk Breastfeeding Soy milk Allergy Stomach cancer Chocolate Dairy Yoghurt Food Protein Cat Cheese Tofu Insulin Food allergy Coeliac disease Cocaine Sulfasalazine Veganism Fecal incontinence Aspartame Dieting Hypoglycemia Adjustable gastric band Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fasting Crohn's disease Guinea pig Charles Darwin's illness Nutrition Biochemistry Chronic fatigue syndrome Ice cream Sugar Hay fever Bong Vegetarianism Milkshake Monosodium glutamate Multiple chemical sensitivity Brewery Dairy product Mango Tea Carnivorous plant Coffee Western blot Breast milk Cannabis (drug) Japanese tea ceremony Mouth ulcer Kosher foods Bodybuilding Soft drink Halitosis Breakfast Peanut Sugar beet Russian cuisine Antiretroviral drug Insomnia Explosive material Rum Foodborne illness Chemotherapy Enzyme Eczema Sewage treatment Lactobacillus acidophilus Drug addiction Tattoo Psilocybin Helicobacter pylori Haloperidol Sugar substitute Rice Drink Prostate cancer Wine Kashrut Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tooth Soybean Cholera Yerba mate Healthy eating Ultraviolet Fancy rat Nuclear magnetic resonance Beer Hangover Rooibos Urinary incontinence
