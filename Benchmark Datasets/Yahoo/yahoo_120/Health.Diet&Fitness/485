how do i lose muscle i am a fourteen year old girl who is lbs and inches i am overweight for my height and age though very muscular i know muscle is good for you but too much muscle can make a girl look a little not like a girl i know stretching helps with lean muscles but i am already very flexible and even though my muscles are long they are still very big i need a plan for long lean muscles please answer stretching actually doesn't do anything to make you look long and lean the only way to lose muscle presuming you're not weight lifting is to lose weight which is accomplished thru inducing a negative energy balance ie burn more than you eat however it is probably not healthy to purposely lose muscle if this muscle developed naturally ie without lifting weights because this is likely your natural build Weight training Bodybuilding Equine conformation Puberty Obesity Exercise Dieting Muscle Atkins Nutritional Approach Urinary incontinence Professional wrestling holds Body mass index Creatine Bruce Lee Gravity Terminal ballistics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Growth hormone Chinese martial arts Physical attractiveness Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Car handling Fecal incontinence Stretching Triathlon Anorexia nervosa Insulin Human height Brassiere Growth hormone deficiency Bicycle Tai Chi Chuan Abdomen Human penis size Weight Swimming Douglas DC-8 Super Size Me Growth hormone treatment Post Polio syndrome Diving Enzyme Sleep apnea Action potential Horse Cancer Cramp Strap-on dildo Sport rowing Pound Urination Horsepower Alaga__sia Mercury Cougar Wind turbine Breaststroke Back injury Recumbent bicycle Skeletal muscle Childbirth Repetitive strain injury E85 Becker's muscular dystrophy Fuel injection Duchenne muscular dystrophy Dodge Charger Swingout Body type (exercise) Hypotonia Hansel und Gretel Professional wrestling slang Menstrual cup Macropod Weight loss Stuttering Deadlift Textile manufacturing Pole vault Bates Method Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Drifting (motorsport) Goodness and value theory Binge eating disorder Mr. Olympia Sail-plan Torpedo First flying machine Helicopter Jean Grey Kodocha Mitsubishi 3000GT Atheroma Flat feet Bench press Shane Mosley Squat (exercise) Aikido Explosive material
