open this i am about ' and weigh about pounds i have fat on mostly my thighs and butt anyway to get rid of this also to gain some muscle there do u have any specific exercises thanks also buy new jonas brothers cd yay well the fat on your thighs and butt are alot harder to get rid of because the only exercise that is most proven to lose weight is running or cycling these actually add muscle to those areas if of course you decide to run alot more you can actually lose some of the fat but to counter that in the place of the fat you will gain some sort of stiffness of muscle so all in all what you are doing is just toning out the area that is my belief of that anyways there are specific exercises that help tone the butt and thighs as well but they arent specifically proven to reduce its size you can always have plastic surgery they remove the fat there other than that i would suggest ample amounts of running and diet fruits and water and cereal d Dieting Weight training Exercise Obesity Tocopherol Milk Prostate cancer Coronary heart disease Urinary incontinence Equine conformation Anorexia nervosa Super Size Me Weight loss Wood Muscle Hamster Insulin Breastfeeding Fecal incontinence Osteoarthritis Body type (exercise) Triathlon Diving Ham Homer Simpson Tyrannosaurus rex Bicycle Swimming Coffee File Allocation Table Puberty South Beach diet Low-carbohydrate diet Chronic fatigue syndrome Trans fat Muay Thai Scar Plastic surgery Combine (Half-Life 2) Strap-on dildo Physical attractiveness Welding M16 (rifle) Aerial (dance move) Garfield Iliotibial band syndrome Vitamin C Dialysis Weight Stress fracture Aerobic exercise Nutrition Myopia Anal masturbation Atherosclerosis Breast cancer Chair Food Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Growth hormone Ischaemic heart disease Dairy Epilepsy Ostrich Vegetarianism Diabetes mellitus Skin graft Cat Intersex surgery A600 Duchenne muscular dystrophy Protein Potassium Soap Weighing scale Cancer Calorie Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Guinea pig Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling holds Crohn's disease Eye surgery Clinical depression Adjustable gastric band Hypertension Babe Ruth Butte, Montana Chocolate Biochemistry Folic acid Hypoglycemia Buttocks Fancy rat Albatross Breaststroke
