i was wonderng how a cdma works telecommunications the cdma revolution the great attraction of cdma technology from the beginning has been the promise of extraordinary capacity increase over narrowband multiple access wireless technologies simple models suggest that the capacity improvement may be more than times that of the existing narrowband cellular standards such as amps in north america nmt in scandinavia tacs in the united kingdom historically the capacity was calculated using simple arguments reality of course is much more complicated than the idealized models real cell coverage areas are highly irregular not the neat hexagons found in textbook models offered load is not spatially uniform changes dramatically with time of day and is often subject to other uncontrollable influences communication between base stations and mobile stations is established by a negotiation upon call origination once communication is established between base and mobile movement of the mobile is detected and the service is handed over from one base station to another one cell at a time services each mobile in the narrowband services the concept of handoff is extended to a multi way simultaneous soft handoff in the cdma standards tracfone pre payed still used cdma on there cell phone so when i go to the mountains those are the only cell phone that will work Advanced Mobile Phone System Mobile phone Global System for Mobile Communications Telephone numbering plan IS-95 W-CDMA Time division multiple access Federal Standard 1037C Sprint Nextel Corporation CDMA2000 Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Verizon Wireless Telephone Wireless network Qualcomm Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Nordic Mobile Telephone Bluetooth Voice over IP Mobile phone radiation and health WiMAX ALLTEL Modem North American Numbering Plan Virgin Mobile Telecom New Zealand 3G Radio GSM frequency ranges Radio clock Capitalism Global Positioning System Digital AMPS Push to talk Broadband Microeconomics SCIP IP Multimedia Subsystem RISC Air traffic control Redundant array of independent disks General Packet Radio Service Cellular automaton Telephone tapping Short message service Geographic information system Communications satellite GSM services Wireless Application Protocol Solar cell Asynchronous Transfer Mode Inmarsat Cordless telephone Coding theory Cingular Wireless UK telephone numbering plan Internet Electrophysiology EGovernment Turkcell Wi-Fi SaskTel Digital divide BlackBerry Mobility management Television United Parcel Service Mouse (computing) U.S. Cellular Radiotelephone Vodafone Amateur radio Person Geodesy Surveillance Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications WiDEN MTR Nokia Cable television SETI Enterprise content management Compiler optimization Opera (web browser) Hard disk Gmail Session Initiation Protocol Speech recognition Tax Hydrogen
