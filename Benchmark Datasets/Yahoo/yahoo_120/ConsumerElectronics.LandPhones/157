make a rotary phone dial i have a rotary phone from the 's 's i adapted it so that it would accept calls and it has full voice mine and theirs my problem is that it was used an extention phone so that you just talk and no dialing was used so i cant dial any numbers just talk if someone is already on the line or calls me when i opened her up i noticed the wires from tthe dialer were disconnected so all i need is to know where they need to be plugged in or atleast a clue to what it might look like ex the green cord goes in slot a any clues would be appreciated thanks http www porticus org bell images networks dsc jpg thats a pic of a board similar to the one in the phone so where on the board do all the dialing wires need to be plugged into been a long time since i dug into one of those but i can give you the basic principle and maybe you can get it working first i would suggest that before you change any wiring around that you make a diagram of the current wiring so you can at least get it back the way it was rotary pulse dialing works by briefly interrupting the telephone circuit if you examing the rotary dial you will find that there are a couple sets of switch contacts likely enclosed in a cover these would appear to be long thin metal strips that touch each other there will be at least two pairs of these contacts with the dial in the normal resting position you will find one set of contacts touching called normally closed and another set where the contacts are not touching normally open any time that the dial is not in the resting position the normally open contacts will be closed the wires from these contacts will be connected to the wires from the earpiece most likely two white wires the function of these contacts is to short out the earpiece while you are dialing so that you dont have a really loud clicking sound in your ear you dont need this to make it work but it does save your hearing the normally closed contacts are operated by a cam and will briefly open and close again as the dial is rotating by itself back to the resting position if you turn the dial to and release it this set of contacts will open and close times that it how it signals to the phone company what number you are dialing dial a and it sends pulses the wires from the normally closed contacts need to interrupt the connection between the phone and the line coming into the phone you need to located the wires coming from the wall into the phone they will go to a terminal block or network and are normally a red and a green wire ignore black and yellow remove one of the wires either the red or green doesnt matter from the terminal block and connect one of the wires from the normally closed contact to the terminal block in its place then connect end of the red or green wire that you removed from the terminal block to the other wire from the normally closed contact when the dial is at the resting position it will restore the connection and the phone will work turn the dial and release it should pulse the line and you should be able to call someone Switch Modem Telephone Dual-tone multi-frequency Transformer Phreaking Jack plug Telephone numbering plan GSM services Enigma machine Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Rotary dial Predictive dialer Voice over IP Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Telegraphy Digital Subscriber Line Television UK telephone numbering plan Electric motor Mobile phone Microphone Potentiometer Overhead lines Circuit design Integrated Services Digital Network Headphones Apollo Guidance Computer Residual-current device Emergency telephone number Vertical service code Action potential Relay Telephone switchboard Private branch exchange IPod 9-1-1 Antenna (radio) Oscilloscope ITU-T Federal Standard 1037C North American Numbering Plan Diode Morse Code Ethernet Gas metal arc welding Drill bit BS 1363 TGV Volleyball Spark plug Spyware Dial Stargate (device) Transistor Tesla coil Digital circuit Teleprinter Bluetooth Telephone tapping Musical Instrument Digital Interface Call for help Seismometer Caller ID Burglar alarm X10 (industry standard) Impedance matching Electronic amplifier Dialer Stepping switch Time-division multiplexing Snooker Public Switched Telephone Network Fuse (electrical) Capacitor Phone fraud Distribution board NorthwesTel Rail terminology Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Telephone number Embedded system Circuit breaker Hayes command set Session Initiation Protocol Escapement VHF omnidirectional range Almon Strowger Commodore 64 Hearing aid Central processing unit Crossbar switch Wi-Fi Copy protection
