ploblems with the sbc connection called sbc tech phone tech adt tech im having a problem everytime the phone rings or we use the phone i get disconnected from the internet ive called sbc and everywhere that would have something to do with it and they where no help i acually spoke with the sbc supervisor twice no help what should i do i do not have dial up you didn't mention whether you had dial up or dsl if you have dial up you will lose your connection when the phone is used if you have dsl i would guess that a filter could be the culprit at each phone connection there should be a dsl filter which will have two ports one for the phone and one for the computer the filter blocks the higher frequencies the computer data is sent with from interfering with the phone and the lower frequency audio from interfering with the data transmissions i would check all of the connections on all your phones to make sure the filter is properly installed if you find nothing then disconnect them and try each one by one until you hopefully find a bad one and then replace it i suppose that it is possible that if you are using dsl and have your dial up modem still connected to the computer and phone line and it is on that that could be also be the cause Digital Subscriber Line Modem Bluetooth Telephone Broadband Internet access Phreaking Voice over IP Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Telephone exchange GSM services Federal Standard 1037C Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line Dialer Ethernet Internet Low-pass filter Transmission Control Protocol NTSC Wi-Fi UK telephone numbering plan Atari 8-bit family Dual-tone multi-frequency Prodigy (ISP) Domain-specific programming language IEEE 802.11 Digital signal processing Cable television Mobile phone Private branch exchange Vertical service code X.25 ITU-T Serial communications Skype AT&T HomePNA Universal Serial Bus Global System for Mobile Communications Software-defined radio Apple Newton USB flash drive Asynchronous Transfer Mode Telephone tapping NorthwesTel Broadband Hayes command set Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Whois Nordic Mobile Telephone Super Nintendo Entertainment System Telephone call Power line communication Loudspeaker Commodore 64 Blue box Predictive dialer Computer network Television Router Circuit design Radio Coding theory Amateur radio Transformer E-mail spam Capacitor Hardware random number generator Common Unix Printing System Digital photography Telephone number Phone fraud Malware IPod Digital camera Aliasing Global Positioning System Alcatel Coaxial cable Multiplayer Softmodem Code division multiple access Floppy disk Phase-locked loop Communications protocol Universal Mobile Telecommunications System FM broadcasting Single-sideband modulation Dial-up access Buffer overflow 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Cable modem Computer hardware IP Multimedia Subsystem Laserdisc
