what is ufc magicmarker holla m magicmarker's mom britney and shampoo all said that ufc is better than wrestling yet i'd want to know what is so great about ufc besides the fact that it's real i just want to figure this out if you check the wrestling section see for yourself on what's going on i get what you mean by the large techinical ways you can fight in ufc yet not to mean or anything but what makes it truly great like giving that excited feeling you get like a flicker of change ufc is the ultimate fighting championship sam is wrong no one has ever died in the ufc someone died in a no rules mma thing in nevada some years ago but that is in no way the ufc's fault it can be bloodier than wrestling if heavy elbows are used but some of the wrestling things i have seen are much bloodier mind you that blood is fake it is a sport like basketball or football and is in that class it's not intended to be as entertaining as wrestling because it doesn't care it's a sport that is entertaining not entertainment fighting there are lots of techniques and different complicated variables that real fighters can appreciate or anyone who has a fascination with mma if you don't think it's entertaining enough to keep your interest that's fine but don't compare it with something like wrestling you might as well compare the ufc to dragon ball z Ultimate Fighting Championship Mixed martial arts Martial art Ken Shamrock Royce Gracie Chuck Liddell Randy Couture Muay Thai PRIDE World Wrestling Entertainment The Ultimate Fighter Matt Hughes (fighter) David L.
