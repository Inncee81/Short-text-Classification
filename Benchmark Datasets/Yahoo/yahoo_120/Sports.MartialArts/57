what martial art is tault to marines just interest to know thanks well above they gave you the technical term for it but where it got it's history comes from several art forms of martial arts in the beginning judo was taught to basic infantry men in ww as history gets closer to us now the military has taken aspects from several differant arts such as judo ju jitsu silat karate to name some today the good stuff is kept to the special forces most average training is taught in basic level techniques an th grader can learn they make it simple and easy so simple that is sometimes in my opinion is no longer effective the best thing i think though is that many already have had personal training in real life in martial arts before they joined and others take it up after they join and find a school nearby to train with i have had many marines and other military forces in our class programs Martial art Aikido Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Chinese martial arts Jujutsu Mixed martial arts Karate Korean martial arts Kata (martial arts) Tai Chi Chuan Shotokan Silat Hapkido Eagle Claw Eskrima Bruce Lee The Book of Five Rings United States Marine Corps Taekwondo Genseiryu Military Ninja Wing Chun Kyokugenryu Karate Kung fu Tekken Ultimate Fighting Championship Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Muay Thai Air Education and Training Command Xingyiquan Black belt (martial arts) Education in the United States Association for Renaissance Martial Arts Education in Romania Recruit training Shaolin (martial arts) Goju Ryu Warrant Officer Zen McDojo Kalarippayattu Lisp programming language Grappling Structure of the British Army Martial arts film Sparring Virginia Military Institute Corporal Military science Military of the United States Infantry Steven Barnes Sword Royce Gracie Double Dragon The Karate Kid Japan Self-Defense Forces Commando Division (military) Art Graduate school Sport Choy Lee Fut American Kenpo CLAMP School Detectives Hung Gar Visual Basic Parkour Vovinam Military police Royal Marines Kenpo Homeschooling Education in Portugal Wang Chongyang Japanese tea ceremony Qigong BASIC programming language America's Army Regiment Kenwa Mabuni Motobu Choki Robert Garcia Stereoscopy Drill instructor Yang Guo (fictional) Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira M60 machine gun Diablo II: Lord of Destruction RISC Akuma (Street Fighter) Chuck Norris Kyokushin
