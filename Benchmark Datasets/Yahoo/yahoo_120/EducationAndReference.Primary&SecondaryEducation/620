please help me how to tell to my class to discipline their manners i've tried so many times but it cannot solve my problem please help me well you have not provided much information it is difficult to answer without knowing how old the students are i also don't know which manners you are talking about do you mean basic politeness in class or are you teaching formal manners for class manners you must make clear what you expect from them for instance they must raise their hands and wait until they are called on to answer questions not shout out the answer for these type of classroom manners you must insist on them performing them and be prepared to deal with the rule breakers if a student shouts out an answer without being called on he will get no credit and you will ask another student the same question praise when it is done right correct when it is done wrong if there is a problem child i would take him aside after class when no one is around since children who shout out are often seeking attention i would tell him that i think he is very smart and i really like him but ask why he is disrespecting you by not following the rules by praising him first and telling him you like him he will feel ashamed that he disrespected you then ask him to help you enforce the rules by being a good example to the others it is a good way to put an unruly student on your side it often works Theory of conduct Expert system Alexander Technique Philosophy of language Logic Social rule Philosophy of education Martial art Boston Public GED Socrates Scientology beliefs and practices Plame affair Halting problem Contract The nature of God in Western theology Coming of Age (TNG episode) Complexity classes P and NP Objective-C Aikido Little Britain Education in the United States Education Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism The Princeton Review Current teachings of Prem Rawat School discipline Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Mojave people Theodicy Economics Property (ownership right) Liberalism Japanese tea ceremony Bernard Williams Past teachings of Prem Rawat Jumpstart 3rd Grade Good Morning, Vietnam Second language acquisition Appeal Dog training Sydney Riot of 1879 Education reform Standardized testing Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Asperger syndrome Graduate school Extreme Programming Shaggy dog story Confucianism Francis Crick Transactional analysis Brian Lenihan Catechism Utilitarianism Popular culture studies John Howard Yoder Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Computational complexity theory Physics Education in Japan Secondary education in Japan Cryptanalysis Tag Cyprus dispute Richard Feynman The Usual Suspects Visual Basic Poker jargon Moral Politics Corporal punishment Monty Hall problem Motivation Singlish Abstraction (computer science) Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Cryptic crossword Ludwig Wittgenstein Meaning of life NP-complete Schabir Shaik Trial Corporate governance Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an No Child Left Behind Act Thread (computer science) Gender-neutral language Speed of light Grade (education) Algorithm Credit card Article One of the United States Constitution Domain Name System Serial killer A Course In Miracles French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Socratic method Milton H.
