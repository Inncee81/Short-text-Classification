what is the best way for a high school student to make fast money forget the burger joints the money there is trivial try this it worked for me find an awesome high end star restaurant and very very quietly get their menu memorize it learn everything you can about the restaurant it's parent company etc then dressed to the nines and go in and ask to speak with the manager ignore totally anyone who says we're not hiring they're losers now you need to wow the manager with everything you know and how awesome it would be to work for him the idea here is go and take the job which will pay big in cash don't ever go in and meekly ask for a job like this they're competitive and only the aggressive people get the jobs In-N-Out Burger Poker jargon McDonald's Beavis and Butt-head Burger King Restaurant The Apprentice 2 Great Teacher Onizuka Hamburger Homer Simpson Octopus card Education in the United States Krusty Krab Charles Ponzi Paris Hilton Mike Alfonso Freeters A&W Restaurants Subway (restaurant) Graduate school Anger management Wheel of Fortune Eric Bischoff James J.
