how many colleges are high school seniors graduating in applying to i'm trying to get some information so my soon to be a senior child has a sense of how many college applications to complete it depends on the kid has he narrowed down what types of colleges he'd like to go to do his grades and test scores limit him to a certain range of schools how are the finances in the family i went to what you would call a college prep high school i just applied to a small handful of schools all public schools one application i just had to check a box to send a copy of that application to a particular campus my gpa wasn't high enough for the harvards and stanfords usc was an option but i saw no point in paying private school tuition for undergrad since i knew i also was going to need money for grad school plus at the time usc was really far down the rankings and was on par with the state school i ended up attending however i had friends with great grades and test scores they applied to a bunch because there were many colleges they'd love to attend and they had a credible shot at all of them no guarantees tho so they had to apply to a bunch to maximize their chances of getting in to one also for ego's sake Education in the United States Graduate school Grade (education) College admissions Education in Germany Education in Australia Affirmative action Education in the People's Republic of China University of Southern California Law school High school Student loan SAT Education in Taiwan Independent school (UK) College GED Rice University Private school Law School Admissions Test Lynbrook High School Quizbowl Education in Canada Bowl Championship Series Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Hunter College High School Phillips Exeter Academy Education in Malaysia Lowell High School (San Francisco) Education in Japan School choice Undergrads Credit card University of Michigan Tuition Normal distribution No Child Left Behind Act Harvard University Cornell University Poker jargon Notary public Education in Hong Kong College and university rankings Ivy League Public education Juris Doctor Advanced Placement Program The Citadel (Military College) Middle Tennessee State University Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Betting (poker) Trinity College, Dublin Stuyvesant High School New Trier High School Duke University Education in Romania Model (economics) ELO rating system Miami-Dade County Public Schools University of California, Los Angeles National Certificate of Educational Achievement Program for the Exceptionally Gifted Life insurance United States Postal Service Taipei American School Stern School of Business The Hockaday School Walt Disney World College Program California Polytechnic State University Caulfield Grammar School Stanford University Standardized testing Baylor University Tulane University Culture of the United States Regents of the University of California v.
