i am going to be a junior in high school i know that colleges want leadership qualities and i've never held that president or vp title nor i have i been historian secretary treasurer etc i'm sure that even if i do run for office in a club or something i wouldn't be elected soo is there anything else i can do to prove that i show some leadership what exactly are colleges looking for in terms of leadership i don't know if the colleges would look at my ideas as leadership but they would be looked upon with favor and a good sign of your ability to go after what you want in life and do things constructive and beneficial to society you could do volunteer work either at a hospital or at a rescue group for animals as a hospital volunteer you might be able to set up a program for encouraging people to get their pets certified to visit terminal patients to bring them joy this would show leadership as a volunteer at a rescue group you might be able to set up a program to teach children proper care of animals so they don't end up in rescue you could tutor younger high school students you learn a tremendous amount by tutoring you learn more as a tutor than you do as a student you're close in age to the kids you'd be tutoring and they'd learn better from you this shows initiative on your part to do something like this and you school would appreciate it especially if you can do it during a study hall or at school at the end of the day i'll bet you'd get a great review and a letter from your highschool that would help you in getting into the college of your choice that's all i can think of for now maybe that will stimulate you to get some other ideas No Child Left Behind Act College Physician Community college GED High school Homeschooling Education in the United States Education in Japan Trinity College, Dublin Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints University of Southern California Columbia University Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Charter school Graduate school Far Eastern University School choice University of Tennessee Education reform Independent school (UK) Pitaten Chinese University of Hong Kong Second language acquisition Education in Romania Social psychology SAT Teacher Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses Rabbi Phi Kappa Sigma Students' union Christian Brothers University Brown University Software engineering Autism The Giver Yitzchok Hutner University of Notre Dame University of Houston Education in Singapore Anarchism and society Secondary education Hikaru no Go Otterbein College Eton College Theory of conduct Conscription Abortion debate Yale University Minister of religion Washington gubernatorial election, 2004 Education Nursing Franklin and Marshall College Clergy Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Happiness University of San Francisco Baylor University Theodore Roosevelt Civil Air Patrol PLATO University of Pennsylvania Halloweentown Robert Hutchins Purdue University Montessori method Anglo-Chinese School Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban General practitioner Carnegie Mellon University Jeb Bush University of California, Los Angeles Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Strategic management University of Michigan Richard Bentley Donald Rumsfeld Alpha Phi Omega Student Affairs Ludwig Wittgenstein University of Alabama Clare Hall, Cambridge Midwifery Georgetown University Great Teacher Onizuka AmeriCorps Professor Hunter College High School Trinity College (Connecticut) Emerson College Caulfield Grammar School National Junior College Community emergency response team Delta Tau Delta Gifted Education Programme (Singapore)
