how can i fight the school board's hair color policy our local school board does not allow students with 'unnatural' hair colors i think this is grossly unfair and sends a very negative message to our kids does anyone have any practical advice about how to force the school board to admit my daughter is there a good way to challenge the legal basis of the school board's authority if we expect our children to respect others we must start by respecting them control of one's own hair color is not much to ask my daughter is an advanced student with an excellent record i am amazed at the number of people answering who think following rules more important than common sense how easily we relinquish our freedoms you can't nor should you teach your child the lesson that sometimes you have to adhere to the rules especially as a child it will be a valuable lesson when she makes it out into the workforce and it's much easier to learn it now than later on perhaps you may need to learn it too perhaps you need to reflect on the negative message that you may be sending to your daughter some battles should be fought this is not even remotely one of those it's a vanity issue pure and simple Education in Japan Teach the Controversy Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Separation of church and state IP (complexity) Ethics Intelligent design movement A Course In Miracles NAACP Homeschooling Waldorf Education Creation and evolution in public education Scientology beliefs and practices Current teachings of Prem Rawat Abington School District v.
