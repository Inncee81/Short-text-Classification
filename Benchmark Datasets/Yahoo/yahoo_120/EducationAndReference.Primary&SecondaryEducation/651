what would be a good funraiser for a secondary school i am principal of a secondary school and i need to raise some money for our school and to kids in poverty it would be nice if you could help me help well you could do the traditional type stuff raffles cheese rolls selling sell confectionery etc to people and have a prize for the people who sell the most etc but it depends what specifically they are going to do with the money that you can use to help you like at my school they raised money so children in gambia could have bikes so they could ride to school and they like drew a bike really big with chalk on the court and collected coins which they put on the drawing outline and if you donated you got a ride on one of the bikes they had there which sounds really simple and doesn't cost anything but it worked really well or another good thing is a people auction where you buy students or teachers to do jobs for you for a length of time which is fun to watch he he or another thing my school did was sell bricks it sounds silly but they put some new brick pavings in so they let people buy one that is they got to pick a message to put on it which got engraved on and that made a good profit well there a millions of ideas i could go on and on but i hope you fundraise lots Poker jargon Microeconomics Supply and demand MapleStory School choice Animal Crossing Current teachings of Prem Rawat Internet fraud Economics Raffles Institution Garth Brooks Tax Mutual fund Fort Ashby, West Virginia Ra (board game) Mario Tsunami Relief Cardiff Extreme Programming W.
