i need nice school supplies that will last for almost the whole school year i want cheap schools supplies that will last almost the whole school year think cheap im going to th grade ok your first problem is that good stuff usually isn't cheap if you get wal mart cheap you will probably not last through the first quarter much less the rest of the year my suggestion is to spend a little more money in the beginning and go to staples they have heavy duty notebooks that if you take care of them will last you the entire year the fun thing is that these are view binders so you can put your favorite artwork inside to personalize them stuff you can get on the cheap at wal mart pens pencils notebook paper scissors glue etc the other way to save money is not to fall for the crap that places try and sell you you don't need keepers or other fancy products Wal-Mart Floppy disk Gross domestic product Microeconomics Theory of conduct Shit Autograph Fountain pen Laptop Economy of Russia Pencil Craps Inflation Keynesian economics Surplus value Rich Mullins Bank The Star Wars Holiday Special Deflation (economics) Say's law Economy of India Community emergency response team Sears Holdings Corporation Tax Graduate school Economics Diagon Alley Tourism Cruising (maritime) Red Hot Chili Peppers Arthur Laffer Care Bears Nuclear power Economy of Africa Humphrey Bogart Neopets Spidey Super Stories Upholstery Guitar Externality British small press comics Capital accumulation Gramophone record Traditional animation Money supply Tariff Outsourcing Professional wrestling slang Blood on the Tracks Celeron Pinball W.
