what is the difference between ap classes and other classes for high school i'm going to be a high school senior and i'm from a small town my school does not offer ap classes is there really a difference between regular and ap classes what if i decided to take the highest classes offered is it the same so far i'm hopefully taking calculus world history and english iv ap classes if you take the ap test at the end of the school year and you get a passable grade that the college you're going to accepts you will get college credit for taking the class in high school that means you won't have to take the class in college if it's a class for your major or one of the required classes you have to take anyways even if you don't take the class in high school you can still opt to take the ap test at a different high school at the end of the year and still pass it and still get credit for the class the scores on the test do not transfer over in gpa for college a friend of mine wasn't in ap classes but he still took the tests and got college credit for them i have no idea what the international baccularette sp does i'm not sure if you get college credit for it or not but i know it looks good on your transcripts if you really want college credit before going to college i'd recommend buying ap books fairly cheap on amazon reading them and then taking the ap test at a different high school Graduate school Grade (education) Advanced Placement Program Education in the United States Education in Germany GED SAT College admissions National Certificate of Educational Achievement High school Secondary education in the United States Law school Education in the People's Republic of China Hunter College High School Education in Taiwan Community college Stuyvesant High School Education in Romania Ontario Academic Credit Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Medical school Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in Malaysia Education The Citadel (Military College) Affirmative action New Trier High School Test (student assessment) Lynbrook High School A-level Credit card No Child Left Behind Act Law School Admissions Test English cricket team Kwantlen University College Education in Australia Phillips Exeter Academy Yale Law School University of Central Florida Jaime Escalante Standardized testing College Worcester Polytechnic Institute Independent school (UK) Cricket Mutual fund Physician Cooper Union College Board Contract bridge History of Test cricket (to 1883) Yearbook Education in Sweden Middle Tennessee State University U.S. Electoral College Education in Canada Extreme Programming Brown University Hopkins School Rugby union Saved by the Bell Franklin W.
