can anyone help me with international baccalaureate i will be a sophomore next year so i'll be entering the pre ib program at my high school i have to choose to do full ib or just partial which will be everything except for science and theory of knowledge i do gymnastics after school for hours each day during part of the school year so i don't know if i'll have time for all the extra science homework do you think i should shoot for full ib or just do partial i have to decide sometime this summer school starts at the beginning of june ib courses require a lot of self discipline and a lot of work teachers of ib courses expect more out of you because you are considered to be an advanced student in many ib courses you are expected to maintain a c or better or you fail ib courses have about double the homework of regular courses ib english courses alone can have hours of homework a night they say that the regular high school course requires minutes per course for homework and ib courses require minutes per course for homework those times are each night very few kids in our school back when i was in high school completed all ib courses with passing grades many of the students flunked out of ib courses all together and ended up in summer school those who did complete them had a difficult time earning respectable grade point averages it sounds like at your school there is not much difference between full ib and partial ib schedule if you really like science i would say go full ib if science isn't one of your strongest subjects due to your schedule i would say to go partial ib you can always change your decision later all though teachers and schools get annoyed when you do so if you find out that you make the wrong decision all though you usually have to stick it out for at least one semester before they will let you make the change Graduate school IB Diploma Programme Education in Romania Education in the United States Education in Germany Juris Doctor Grade (education) A-level Advanced Placement Program Education in Portugal Education in the People's Republic of China Secondary education in France Theory of conduct GED Education in Hong Kong Education in Singapore Education in Australia Secondary education in the United States Ontario Academic Credit Education in Austria Secondary education in Japan Experiential education Master's degree Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Education in France Education in Taiwan Stuyvesant High School National Certificate of Educational Achievement High school Education in Sweden Professor Tai Chi Chuan Montgomery Blair High School Massachusetts Institute of Technology Education in Japan Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Physician UCAS Bristol Grammar School Shaggy dog story Hopkins School Teacher Japanese tea ceremony University of Massachusetts Amherst New York State Department of Education Test (student assessment) Nurse Medical school Hogwarts Brown University Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Cooper Union Asperger syndrome Worcester Polytechnic Institute Student Associate's degree Social rule College Clements High School Martial art North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Kwantlen University College Doctor of Philosophy Halting problem Chiropractic Reiki Bologna process Education in Scotland Lawyer Poker jargon One Tree Hill (TV series) Badminton St. Ignatius College Prep University of Maryland Baltimore County Academic term __cole Polytechnique Full Metal Panic?
