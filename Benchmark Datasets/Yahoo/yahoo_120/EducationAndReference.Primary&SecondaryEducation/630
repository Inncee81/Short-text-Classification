me and my education im going to high school this year and i need help studying and getting good grades i used to sometimes cheat in middle school and i knew it was bad because i didn't learn anything now its hurting me because i dont know how to study and get the information in my brain can someone help me i need help on how to study so i dont have to cheat in high school for example when i study for science and history i just read a little and get bored i try to put the info in my head and then the next day i take the test i forget everything that makes me want to cheat im good at math can someone help me on how to get the info into my head i dont know why i dont remember it i try to i want to be smart and get good grades so i get into a good college i think its that i dont put my head into it its like im not interested but i want to be and want to get good grades please help me thanks first of all the scenerio you describe could be mine no one taught me to study and i really didn't learn until i went to college when you get an assignment like reading a novel or writing a paper try to figure out how many pages you need to read each day to finish about a week ahead of when it's due while you read keep a log where you will write something down every couple of pages don't forget page numbers so you can find it if you need to if it's your book you should also keep a log but then you can highlight the important statement you can do this with science and history classes to also sometimes reading a loud to your self can help you remember things some people are audio learners so we learn by hearing it better than reading silently in math you need to keep a math notebook rewrite instructions on how to do particular problems so you don't have to search through the text book then you can study for your test from that instead of plodding through all the stuff in the book you could aslo get a study partner just to run through things with i would guess that you have test anxiety and so you go blank on tests i found that if i read all the questions in order skip the ones that you can't do but get the ones done that you are sure of done then go back if you are filling in the dots on an answer sheet just be careful to get your answers in the right place also get a good nights rest before the test you could also tell your teachers and guidance counselor that you have test anxiety and maybe they will have some options for you it's nice to see a student who is interested in doing better take deep breaths and try to relax before you focus on a problem good luck to you http www urbanext uiuc edu succeed test html this is a link on test anxiety GED Education in Romania SAT Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Graduate school Turing machine Grade (education) No Child Left Behind Act Second language acquisition Theory of conduct Test (student assessment) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Mathematics Cascading Style Sheets Current teachings of Prem Rawat Social rule Education in the People's Republic of China American and British English differences Meditation Pitaten Education in Taiwan Stuttering EastEnders Gifted Dyslexia Milton H.
