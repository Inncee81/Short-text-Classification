catering costs traditionally include i don't have a lot of free time so i am trying to do as much research ahead of time before i book consultations when a catering company talks about their ability to provide tables chairs linens as well as food obviously is all of that included in the per person price as i type it seems like a dumb question but as i said i am having to make do with internet research to narrow the field as to whom i wish to set up appointments with thank you i agree with the previous answers as some caterers do provide table and chairs but very few if any actually own their own tables and chairs in most cases a food caterer will offer this service but they will go to an outside rental company and rent from them tack on their handling fee on top of the basic rental and you pay more although it may seem more convenient to use one vendor for all these needs it would be best for you to call around to some party rental companies and get prices on per chair and per table rates deliver set up and break down costs in most cases rental companies have websites that list their prices on their sites you will more than likely come out ahead using more than one vendor hope this helps Online DVD rental Cable television Legal research Netflix Leasing First-sale doctrine Airport Microsoft Mainframe computer Education in the United States Economics Islamic banking Blockbuster Video Auto insurance Microeconomics Supply and demand Publicly funded medicine Restaurant Insurance Expert system Professor Enterprise content management America Online Citigroup Economic rent Broadband Internet access Renting Price discrimination Computer Rental agreement Life insurance London Congestion Charge Spam (electronic) Subscription business model Kitchen Contract Windows 2000 Bank FairTax Tertiary education fees in Australia Xerox Airline Rental car GNU General Public License Interest Best Buy Visual Basic Toll-free telephone number Intermediate consumption Wall Street Rafic Hariri International Airport Food and Drug Administration Domain Name System Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol United Kingdom corporation tax SCO-Linux controversies Virgin Mobile Filling station Tesco EasyGroup Enterprise resource planning PE ratio Education in Australia Intellectual property Spyware Eircom Futures contract Apple Computer Education in Hong Kong Inflation Singapore Changi Airport Public transport Bulk vending The Apprentice 2 Mortgage On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Credit card Slot machine CPU design Education in the People's Republic of China Housing cooperative IBM PC compatible Information Services Procurement Library CPU cache Monopoly File system Privatization Craps National Weather Service The Internet Movie Database Call centre Economy of the United States Database Limousine Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Modem Tax
