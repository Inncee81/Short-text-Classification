of questions could be answered by this agree google it or to keep our sponsor happy google or yahoo it imho of all questions asked could be answered by the asker if they'd take as much time to research the question before posting as they do in composing and uploading the question in the first place agree or disagree and if you agree very existential here what the hell are we all doing here looking for attention killing time trying to gain points with no purpose nor value feeding our egos or social networking under the guise of something more meaningful than facebook or myspace dig deep what really irritates me are the kids asking for the answers to math problems especially when they just want the answers i think that what you are saying is absolutely right i admit i ask questions on here that i probably could find if i googled it however sometimes i ask questions that require a person's opinion i think those are much better questions to ask on here for the most part the ones i would exclude are the ones where people ask medical questions and baby names and things like that if you have a medical issue ask a freakin doctor we're just average people how much do you really think we know about the human body the baby names are stupid as well since most of the time they are asking what people think of these retarded names the worst one i have ever seen was decklyn what kind of parents are you if you name your kid that that's almost as bad as african american names as to your second question i think your last reason makes the most sense most people are very social facebook and myspace especially are full of ads and all this other crap that gets in the way of that social networking people can more accurately communicate here even though those peopel are complete strangers however that's not to say that's why everyone is here i know some people that get on here to rip on everyone and answer questions with more questions or answer their questions with mockery i don't blame them sometimes i read questions on here and it blows my mind i read on the other day that said i just had my period and i took a pregnancy test that came out negative but could i still be pregnant the state of intelligence in our society just boggles me i actually met a teenager she was supposedly yesterday who had no idea who ernest hemingway was ernest hemingway one of the great american authors and she had no idea who he was it frustrates me so much that someone as talented and as influential as hemingway is unknown to some of the kids today i hope society has not really fallen that low your question reminds me that there are intelligent people out here on this site and that not everyone is an idiot thanks for the refreshing question and i hope you have an amazing start to the month Theory of conduct Autism Pregnancy Mental retardation Goodness and value theory Person EastEnders Plame affair Infantilism Objectivist philosophy Falsifiability Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Mind transfer Milton H.
