what are the cultural differences between england and america any answer between two very varied groups of people has to be purposefully vague even if you limit it to just the english rather than all the british peoples on the whole without going into the murky area of the english idea of class there are only two huge generalisations that come to mind americans are polite the english are proper an american will tell you they are good an english person would rather you not i would take point to encompass more generally an american liking of rules and regulations while the english preference for unwritten common sense in appropriate action for point american society is more self cantered combatitive and for want of better words egotistical an american will come in and say i know you should do it this way and fall flat on their face if they get it wrong the english would rather show appropriate respect to other peoples positions as it is likely that someone else will know best even if their position is good this can lead to american thinking that brits are snobs for not giving time to their opinions and the brits thinking americans are just being loud and self important not realising that person x over there is an expert in it you can often find this in conversation that an american will be quite happy to give their views and sound knowledgeable on many subjects you will have to prise any detailed pov from an englishman after much questioning but they will generally know a whole lot more than they first let on i would disagree that any answer is a result of age of civilisation or perceived american multiculturalism middle american main street is very similar to the english town high street in terms of cultural variation some will point out large cultural differences in the big cities but major english cities have this too london is at least as multicultural as new york the us maybe founded on immigrants but the uk has be trading people with europe for millennia has local cultures e g the cornish running back over centuries and had huge waves of immigration from the empire both cultures as they are perceived today are a result of the industrial revolution creating the modern metropolis and the subsequent universal suffrage and institutions that this produced modern england was created out of the english civil war which is not far removed from the first major us colonisations and the declaration of independence Sociocultural evolution Democracy England Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Constitution Black (people) Appeal Anglosphere Human Prime Minister of the United Kingdom American Revolution Multiculturalism City Postmodernism Common law Republic Objectivist philosophy State Cultural relativism Who is a Jew?
