is gandhism relevant today yes i believe that nonviolence prevents stacking additional burdens on the given problem or conflict so that instead of compounding a conflict more as in the middle east there is less mess and damage to deal with in order to address the root cause of oppression so the injustice can be resolved so yes in terms of nonviolence i think this is very critical to communication and conflict resolution that is required for global change however i think more is needed than passive resistance normally associated with gandhi such as getting arrested to publicize protests which merely empowers the current system of authority and media bias toward negative conflict and discrediting opponents i think what is called for today is not civil disobedience but civil obedience where citizens enforce just civil standards as equal responsibility of the government and do not accept to be criminalized but turn the tables and correct the injustice that is criminal to invoke and act upon equal authority as government requires absolute nonviolence diplomacy civil respect and cooperative agreement with given authority otherwise it would be discredited as a disorderly or violent rebellion that disrespects public safety and current authority instead of challenging unjust laws by breaking them making it clear that the parties allowing injustice are the ones disobeying higher laws about equal protections and enforcing solutions as meeting the legal standards this requires both the same organization and unity as previous reform movements but also direct diplomacy and cooperation with the conflicting institutions not division or opposition there must be a balance between respecting given authorities and institutions while equally empowering the people whose consent is the basis of government and social contracts in a civilized society so this is a step beyond the choices most people consider how to work with the given institutions and policies and people to invoke the change together by agreement by political force of unity and respect for mutual laws and standards not by forcing change by negative opposition and competition i think that is the difference that is needed in the world in order to achieve change on the next level it involves the principles of gandhi but takes them even further where everyone is on the same side solving problems as a team Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Liberalism Nonviolence Social justice Democracy Mahatma Gandhi Appeal Mediation Christian anarchism Nonviolent resistance Anti-globalization Affirmative action Unlawful combatant Civil rights Contract Conservatism Federal World Government International Criminal Court Pacifism Treaty Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Law Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India Government of India American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Indian Independence Movement Oslo Accords Ethics Same-sex marriage Worldwide green parties Corporate governance Arab-Israeli conflict Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Separation of church and state Libertarian socialism Consensus decision-making Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Human rights Microeconomics Indira Gandhi Domestic violence Libertarianism Gay rights Free trade Property (ownership right) Anarchism Globalization Constitution of Ireland Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Nationalism Martin Luther King, Jr. Law of the People's Republic of China Civil disobedience Projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs American individualist anarchism International law and the Arab-Israeli conflict Bretton Woods system Jos__ Luis Rodr__guez Zapatero Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) State Vicente Fox Gandhism Social contract Government of France Anarcho-capitalism Zapatista Army of National Liberation Precautionary principle Same-sex marriage in Canada Nuclear option (filibuster) Comecon Freedom of speech Copyright History of South Africa in the apartheid era First Amendment to the United States Constitution Neville Chamberlain Cyprus dispute International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement American liberalism Tax resistance Supreme Court of the United States Equal Protection Clause Politics of the People's Republic of China Surveillance Involuntary commitment Crime Estoppel Trade union Politics of Russia Postmodernism United States House of Representatives
