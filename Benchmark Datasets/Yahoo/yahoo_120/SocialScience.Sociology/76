palgiarism copy and paste and the internet how do you think the current culture of internet plagiarism will play out in education and creative thinking in the near future on the one hand technology has made plagiarism so easy that it seems endemic do you think that is so on the other hand technology is also making tools for checking for plagiarism easily available hey lemur i think you are right but teachers can't do it on their own without support from administrators taxpayers parents it is much too daunting a task for an individual to take on that is why i ask the question cutting copying and pasting is not a good way to cheat especially in college all someone has to do is type in a portion of a paper into a search engine like yahoo or google and it will more than likely come right up in college we often have to submit our work into a site called turnitin com and it shows exactly where we got our work the percentage of information we took from different places and if we reworded it or not the best way to plagiarize for a student today is to pay someone else to do your paper although i wouldnt do it expensive basically students can only plagiarize if an institution allows it what im saying is that talk is cheap many institutions will talk about the severity and consequences of plagiarism but wont do anything to catch it while others will have the same policies and scope out the cheaters Plagiarism Open access Education in the People's Republic of China Education Intellectual property Jayson Blair Education in Japan Computer Open source culture Academic publishing Legal research Digital rights management Scholarship Cheating in Counter-Strike Affirmative action Technology Software patent debate Princeton University Open Directory Project Steam (content delivery) Education in Portugal Hey Jude FairTax Student loan Gmail Academia Burkhard Heim Privatization Extreme Programming Literacy Google search Neopets Librarian Slashdot trolling phenomena Microsoft Theory of conduct Newbie No Child Left Behind Act Cheating Microeconomics Science Life insurance Unemployment Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 BitTorrent Enterprise content management Education in Germany Jeff Gannon 2005 Philippine electoral crisis Mirror (computing) RuneScape cheats Google Grade (education) Search engine University of Pennsylvania E-mail spam Book Social Security debate (United States) Lyceum of the Philippines Massachusetts Institute of Technology Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards Redundant array of independent disks PHP Athabasca University College admissions Franklin W.
