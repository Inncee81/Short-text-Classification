marriage is being reshaped where is it heading judging by the number of divorces marriage is no longer an unbreakable covenant where is the marriage institution heading today's children are learning a behavior of marriage break up instead of unbreakable marriage this acquired knowledge will take them to marriage and divorce sorry it's long but i promise it's worth the read i live in a family where my parents are divorced sets of aunts uncles have divorced a few times and just this past weekend my dad's parents just got remarried this is their rd marriage together and they each have been married to someone else once the idea of marriage isn't at all what it used to be marriage as you stated used to be an unbreakable covenant so what's changed i think it's the worlds definition of love and loyalty back in the day when you got married you were stuck yeah divorce was around but society demanded that you stay loyal to your spouse for better and for worse but now that idea of loyalty does not exist the idea now is it's all about me with the me mentality when we find ourselves in a situation that we don't like instead of trying to fix the problem we just avoid it and run away from it after all if i'm not happy with someone or something it's not my job to fix it the next part is the current view or idea of love love is a word that has become to commonly used love was once a word to describe a pure feeling that was unbreakable and represented the strongest of relationships it still is but people claim love when they haven't reached that point when someone cares greatly for someone are attractived to them and enjoys them alot they automatically think it's love but eventually your feelings of caring the persons attractiveness and the enjoyment might fade so what's left if there's no love then there's nothing holding it together love is the glue of a relationship without enough of it everything else with fall apart where is it heading it's hard to say i am fearful that eventually the idea of marriage will be unsacred and no longer cherished at all but honestly it's up to us to bring those ideas of a pure and honest marriage back if the institute of marriage is not restored soon then it will just continue to crumple to nothingness everything in this world now revolves around one's personal desires of the flesh therefore everyone strives for something that will fullfill a certain desire as animals it's our nature to become selfish and fall into those desires but as humans it's in our nature to change and to become better so let's become better i've really enjoyed your question it was very thought provoking enjoy your day glen Divorce Marriage Polyamory Sexual orientation EastEnders Theory of conduct Alignment (role-playing games) Fathers' rights Goodness and value theory Love Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) Transsexuality Objectivist philosophy Human sexual behavior The Amber Spyglass Miss Saigon Meaning of life Sant Thakar Singh Happiness Friends Same-sex marriage Doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses T'Pol Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Sexual abstinence Polygamy Christian view of marriage Homophobia Transactional analysis Knots Landing Pedophilia Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The O.C.
