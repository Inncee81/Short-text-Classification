can loners in high school have good social life after high school i don't really fit into groups in my school and i have some friends here and there but even then we're not really close either will this be over because i feel so lonely yes my personal experience i wouldn't say i was exactly a loner but i wasn't that popular in school but once i left home i could be who i wanted to be who i felt was the 'real' me cuz no one knew what i had been it might take some effort on your part to get involved but do find some groups that have to do with something you're interested in clubs or something and mingle with new people research conversation starting comments or questions usually people like to talk about themselves so if you just start out asking people where they're from or what they do for a living for example you'll soon be deep in conversation with all kinds of new friends voila no more lonely you The Emancipation of Mimi The Catcher in the Rye Humphrey Bogart Social rule Theory of conduct One Tree Hill (TV series) Loneliness Year of the Spider Alcoholics Anonymous Hip hop rivalries Friends Plame affair Social psychology Anderson Cooper Milton H.
