but he wont stop begging for love how should i stop him i had met him before then it was a long distance serious relationship looked like it would end with a marriage then i dumped him because some of his habbits were absolutly unacceptable to me i told him about my concern from the beggining and he said he would change but he lieyed and stayed the same anyway so now it is six months later and still i get at least one e mail from him everyday he says he is sorry and sends loves and all that but i know he will stay the person that he is that is not a problem for me because i loved him and i still do and i rather not see my love with bad habbits thus i rather not marry him oh and i have not replied a single e mail of him in the past six months but he wont stop begging how should i stop him i would love your openion on this it's great that even though you love him you dont accept his bad habits if you did and you married him you would be even more miserable than you are now never believe someone will change sure it's possible but not likely my advice to you change your email address and phone number dont cave to his demands Episodes of Lost (Season 1) E-mail Gmail Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Atomic Kitten Friends Jennifer Lopez Plame affair EastEnders Alcoholics Anonymous W.I.T.C.H.
