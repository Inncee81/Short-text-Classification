what is cultural dualism cultural dualism is both a term that describes some characteristics of canadian society and in many people's view an ideology according to which the social and political systems of canada should be organized it is based on the historical fact that canada was colonized by both the french and the english and that both groups are therefore the founding peoples of canada this fact is used to justify the privileges accorded these groups in comparison to those accorded other ethnic groups and to justify the equality of the groups although the notion of cultural dualism has been translated into legislation and into policies of schooling religion language and the institutional rights of provinces its origins are difficult to determine some legislation can be interpreted as a defence of cultural dualism for example the quebec act legally recognized the catholic religion the seigneurial system and french civil law in qu bec the act of union proclaimed in recognized that the colonizing groups coexisted and the constitution act formalized some of the principles of cultural dualism first it determined the powers of the federal state and of the provinces thus recognizing some of the specificities of qu bec where french canadians formed the majority second legislation in regard to civil law was confirmed third in education a provincial domain a clause allowed for public funds to subsidize confessional schools and protected religious minorities in qu bec ironically this clause was demanded by qu bec english protestants who feared they would be outnumbered and overpowered by french catholics in qu bec french catholics in the rest of canada later attempted with little success to use the same clause to defend themselves against similar fears about the english canadians under qu bec language legislation bill and bill children of some groups particularly immigrants have been obliged to attend french schools but the legislation has not altered the denominational structure of education in montr al or the public funding of private religious or ethnic schools in qu bec it has often been said that canada was created as a state by mercantile capitalists and railway owners who needed a central administration from which to settle and exploit the country others especially many french canadians believed that confederation was a step towards a new state one that was independent of england it was understood that the founding groups were to coexist but the rights and privileges of catholic french canadians outside qu bec were either not specified or were denied or ignored see new brunswick school question ontario schools question manitoba schools question catholic schools often french were not subsidized by public funds french was forbidden in the public schools as were all languages other than english and a general assimilation into the anglo saxon british or anglo canadian world was seen as the only future for both french canadians and immigrants in the s the royal commission on bilingualism and biculturalism brought to light some of the difficulties encountered by french speakers and other groups in canada in the official languages act see also official languages act made canada at least symbolically an officially bilingual country and measures were taken to allow for service in french in the federal administration in the government adopted the policy of multiculturalism in a bilingual framework finally the constitution act affirmed some of the principles of cultural dualism the canadian charter of rights and freedoms stresses the right to equality and forbids discrimination french and english are described as the official languages of canada with equality in status in all parliamentary institutions and in the government of canada the charter also protects the rights of french and english minorities to be educated in their own languages allows for minority schools to be funded by public funds and confirms that it does not modify any rights or privileges guaranteed by or under the constitution of canada in respect of denominational separate or dissentient schools french and english are also official languages in new brunswick the only officially bilingual province there have been various interpretations of how the ideology of cultural dualism should actually manifest itself it has been argued that french and english should be equally represented by bilingual public servants at all levels of the federal system or that every federal government unit should have components one french one english and that there should be equality of opportunity at all levels of society eg political economic educational and social many french canadians believe that cultural dualism recognizes their specificity and their rights while others believe that it has never been applied in practice and that canada originally a british colony is now a us colony part of the french canadian population has also been in favour of a unilingual qu bec as a refuge for francophones and some believe that qu bec should secede from confederation but cultural dualism has been opposed most vociferously by english speaking groups many british colonialists wanted canada to be primarily an english speaking anglo saxon dependency of britain today several groups particularly but not exclusively in the west consider that canada should be unilingually english and that canadian american relations should be fostered because of a common general culture and because of the economic power of the us other groups have very much resented the ideology of cultural dualism believing that it excludes them from canadian life the native people stress that they were the first inhabitants of canada and that the french and english have eliminated them from the political and social life of the country ethnic groups who have immigrated during the last centuries believe that cultural dualism effectively excludes them as well from social and political life on the other hand many french canadians do not support the policy of multiculturalism because they consider that it does not recognize their special status the meech lake accord see meech lake accord document if accepted by the provincial legislative assemblies and the house of commons may be considered as a further step toward cultural dualism
