weird thing about my job is i travel all over the world to the best and worst places but actually wherever i am there is nothing about due to the nature of my job i work in pipelines nobody in thier rite mind puts a pipeline thru a populated place in case it ruptures they are put well away from people so no one can get hurt when people say to me where ye bin this time and i say something like australia they say oh you've got a great job but i cant be arsed explaining to them that i have been in the bush for months dodging creepy things on the rare occasion that i explain they still say yes but it must be great did the same thing for years dude got to see nothing but the inside of some great and crap hotels i know plenty who have like me given up similar jobs to 'fly a desk' and no if they haven't travelled for anything other than fun they won't get it try and enjoy it if you can but get out as soon as your finances allow Social rule Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Infantilism Spontaneous human combustion Professional wrestling match types Theory of conduct Shit Compiler optimization Viz (comic) The Inside Whose Line Is It Anyway?
