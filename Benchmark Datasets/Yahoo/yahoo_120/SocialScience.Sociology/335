do you ever wish body modification would quit being looked down upon i seriously wish it wasn't a determining a factor when determining job employment yes i do i would like to have blue hair you know not a real big on the body mod scale but blue hair is detrimental to what i want out of life it's a stupid sacrifice that i have to make simply because the color doesn't occur naturally and therefore doesn't fit in the profession i've chosen why would i want to dye my hair blue it doesn't make a difference and there's nothing wrong with brown hair blah blah blah when you get right down to it we all wear decoration every day we style our hair we wear clothes accessories shoes and drive vehicles that we use to decorate ourselves with as much as possible with as much individuality as possible and still conform with the social landscape the color of my hair harms no one if i want to pierce or tattoo myself i'm harming no one what business is it of anyone's how i choose to decorate myself others expect me to not judge them on their choices of decoration the difference between a nose piercing and a navy blue business suit is cultural acceptance and nothing else in india a woman with a nose piercing is feminine not disgusting in iran a woman in an armani business suit with a knee length skirt is a whore not professional people who judge the worth of others by their appearance alone such as the hypocrite who assumes a person is bad because they have piercings beyond his or her idea of acceptable will probably never understand that their opinions are nothing more than their own conformation to cultural dictates these cultural dictates are good in some ways and just as bad in others if we were all conformists we should change the name of the nation to stepford and wear uniforms the reality is that people want the right to be individuals however they like but they don't want anyone else to have the right to be individuals unless that individuality conforms to their idea of what's acceptable it's the old idea of you can do whatever you like so long as i think it's okay this applies to adults who have the legal and moral right to their own decisions and the consequences from them not to children Clothing Gender role Physical attractiveness Suit (clothes) Tattoo Body piercing Goodness and value theory Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theory of conduct Kimono Abortion debate Social justice Morality Value system Determinism Skinhead Punk fashion Heavy metal fashion Social aspects of clothing Ethics Barbie Art Sexual orientation Economics Mediation Infantilism Han Chinese clothing Evil Human nature Comanche Victorian fashion Insurance Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Body modification Diving Scientology beliefs and practices Theodicy Human Undergarment Gender-neutral language Political correctness Extreme Programming Kilt Social psychology Microeconomics Democracy School uniform Cross-dressing Religion Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Meme Paul Is Dead Fashion Little Britain Single Transferable Vote Sento Polyamory Conscription Human physical appearance Textile manufacturing terminology Economic inequality Hair Japanese tea ceremony Transactional analysis W.I.T.C.H.
