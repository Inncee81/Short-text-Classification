volley ball question okay i'm startting a new school and when we registered they said volleyball practices start in spetember does that mean volley ball tryouts or when your sign up your on the team because they didn't say anything about tryouts they just said practices so any one who can help me please there is definitely a try out for any team but the anticipation might be that there would be less than fifteen players interested so that all of you showing up at the practice would pass the try out automatically Volleyball Beach volleyball Jeopardy!
