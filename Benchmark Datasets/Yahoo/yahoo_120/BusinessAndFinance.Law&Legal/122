jd mba question so here is my dilemna i went to a decent undergrad school and i majored in international business i am now currently attending a horrible law school i got into others but this was by far the cheapest and i had to go with it i kick myself all the time my career options from this school are really limited and i am thinking about getting another degree from a name school at this point i am thinking of an mba i have always been significantly better at math and i think i can get a decent score on the gmat if i can do well and get into a top mba program what benefits should i expect to realize i am going into my final year and i am thinking about signing up for a gmat class and taking it in january any suggestions advice i really feel for you i went to what was allegedly a top law school and it was absolutely the most horrid nasty experience in my entire life years after graduation i still hate the place ok that is out of my system but i do understand let me ask you a question what do you call a person who graduated from a cheap bottom tier law school who passes the bar exam attorney it really does not matter what type of law school you go to as long as you pass the bar exam i went to a name school and the name may have meant something in the pre days when graduates hired only graduates of the same law school name other than harvard yale the biggies means very little in the real world your career options are not tied to this school they are in your own hands it is totally up to you to make your own career options my top law school did nothing to help me get a law job because i was an older returning student after i passed the bar exam i went back to speak with the dean about this she said it is a shame some of our graduates are unemployable i got work in spite of them and because i busted my butt to get into law firms and get experience if you quit law school some business people will look at you as a failure someone who would not stick to things when they got tough once you graduate you must take a bar review course that will teach you all you need to know to pass the bar exam after you get a license then you can go to one of the llm or go after that mba my advice is to put up with this and do no rely on the law school for anything except the jd wait until after you pass the bar for the gmat Education in the United States Juris Doctor Lawyer Master of Business Administration Graduate school Law school The Apprentice 2 candidates Master of Laws Master's degree Grade (education) Education in Romania London Business School Babson College Stern School of Business Professor Attorney at Law Education in Germany Strategic management Chinese University of Hong Kong Harvard Business School Affirmative action Architect IBM PC compatible Law School Admissions Test Washington University in St. Louis MIT Sloan School of Management Advanced Placement Program College admissions Nuclear option (filibuster) Paralegal Education in Austria GED University of Southern California American football University of Tennessee Education in Taiwan Keynesian economics A Course In Miracles New York Giants Queen's School of Business Kaplan American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Software engineering The Apprentice 2 Unemployment Jaime Escalante Boston Public Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Australia Knots Landing Martin J.
