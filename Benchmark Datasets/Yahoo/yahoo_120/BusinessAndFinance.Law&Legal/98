is working full time whilst studying for yr law degree too much i currently have a dilema i have decided to go to university to study for a law degree however i am returning at the age of as a mature adult so i have adult bills like credit card debt loans etc so not having an income is not negiotable would studying for my degree part time be too much work load to handle would my studys struggle if i worked what you advise answers from anyone studying thee law degree would be great thankyou for yr time x no parents are not an option student loans and grants are not enough went to law school in the evening division i was well over at the time i was a director of it during the day horrid high pressure job i studied on the commuter train to my job at lunch before class until i went to sleep at night and most of the weekends actually i spent years forcing myself to sleep only hours a night all that did was make me tired and crabby all the time i did survive law school although i still hate it i now have my own law firm and yes it was worth all the problems cashed in my retirement fund to pay for school so failure is not an option you are a great age to go to law school many of your classmates will be the same age and in the same position as you are my opinion is that it is not too much work to handle but lets be realistic something will suffer you will need to give up a social life during law school especially during that first year of study the first year is when the tough class are thrown at you like the school wants to weed out those who refuse to make sacrifices in my case my real job suffered and i felt that i was not giving as much effort as i could to my studies but i graduated middle of the class passed the bar exam first time some hints as much as possible do not skip meals or sleep during the school year my dinner was a bags of m ms skittles all that did was make me fat give yourself a break if you were a straight a student in undergrad you probably will get your first c in law school i did and was so upset don't put undue pressure to succeed on yourself remember that question what is the difference between a straight a law student and a straight c law student after both pass the bar nothing they are both called attorney Graduate school Lawyer Juris Doctor Education in the United States Student loan Education in the People's Republic of China Attorney at Law Barrister Hikikomori Professor Education in Germany Education in Romania Avenue Q Education in Australia Poker jargon Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Law school American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Paralegal Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Grade (education) EastEnders Education in Portugal Community college Boston Public Barbara Boxer Education in Austria Sin City Undergrads Ocean's Twelve Rosa Parks No Child Left Behind Act Annuity GED The Devil Wears Prada Friends Hillary Rodham Clinton Massachusetts Institute of Technology Pittsburgh Steelers Mattress Master's degree United Kingdom corporation tax Pitaten Bond The Catcher in the Rye High school College John Kerr Babe Ruth 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Paul von Hindenburg University of Houston Moe Berg Brown University Knots Landing Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Education The Amazing Race Education in France Interest Theory of conduct Secondary education in France Tennessee State Constitution Master of Laws Labour economics Appeal Corporate finance George Brown, Baron George-Brown School choice Citigroup Homeschooling Education in Japan Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) College admissions Education in Finland Public transport Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Dialysis The Adventures of Pete & Pete Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Columbia University Evan Mecham Stomach cancer National Certificate of Educational Achievement Credit card Tripartite System Primerica Financial Services St. Elmo's Fire (film) New England Patriots
