is it a wise career move for lawyer to leave trial practice for an in house counsel job that pays higher now ive been a lawyer for and a half years ive been doing trial work from the start of my career days ago a big company called me and offered me a job as an in house lawyer no trial work just consultation and paper work it pays higher than my salary as a trial lawyer in my current law firm headed by my dad should i accept the offer and leave trial work indefinetly ya know what they say just because its bigger doesn't mean its better i'm not saying that you shouldn't take the offer but you should consider all of the different circumstances that surrounds the job more money yes more work hows the hours compared to what you have now and never forget what comes with big companies interoffice drama and its very impersonal but in all you've got to look at it this way are you going to be happy pushing papers behind the scene instead of being in a court room fighting for a case your still fairly new at being an attorney and still have got loads to learn and who better to teach you that your dad maybe after you get a few years under your belt you can move on to something else besides if they want you now they'll want you later because you'll have more experience i would speak to your dad about what he thinks you should do he's gonna know the law world better than you and he'll only be looking out for your best interest good luck Lawyer Attorney at Law Law firm Plame affair Court system of Canada Paralegal Appeal Divorce Barrister Leo Frank Economic inequality Karl Rove Graduate school Michael D.
