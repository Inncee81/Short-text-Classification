consequences of false reference my daughter was given a false reference from her care home employer just after she had worked her notice and just as she was about to start work at a different care home which was closer to her home subject to a satisfactory reference from her former employer the reference was false untrue and was understandably unacceptable to the new employer and has resulted in her now being out of work and unable to even claim jsa i understand from a previous post that it is possible to sue who should she sue the care home or the manager who wrote the reference how and where does she commence proceedings thanks in advance for any replies uk she needs to find an employment solicitor in her local area i'm not familiar with uk law in the us it is indeed possible to sue an employer for providing a false reference if nothing else it would appear that she has a claim for slander if she is able to prove that the accusations made against her are untrue again in the us she would sue the care home and the manager would be a named party to the suit the manager could have personal liability in addition to the care home sorry i can't be of more assistance good luck Slander and libel Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tort Appeal Lawsuit Divorce SCO-Linux controversies Sovereign immunity Constitution of Fiji: Chapter 16 Domestic partnerships in California Silvio Berlusconi Evidence (law) Insurance First Amendment to the United States Constitution Estoppel Workers' compensation Stump v.
