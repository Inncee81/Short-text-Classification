soccer in the us why is soccer so unpopular in the us i live in alabama and everyone says soccer is for gays and hippies i just tell them that a least our high school soccer team made the playoffs and the football team didnt haha stupid rednecks i have the same question why do so many alleged sports fans like and appreciate a variety of sports football to hockey to baseball to golf etc yet when it comes to soccer the mood turns sour and almost violently antagonistic i mean some folks don't like golf but you never hear them screaming and carrying on about how horrible it is the same with other sports but when it comes to soccer let the vile diarrhea of the mouth begin i don't want to hear the lame excuse that there is not enough scoring baseball and or hockey have long been low scoring affairs i don't want to hear that it is boring not enough action give me a break baseball in nearly unwatchable with all the delays and football is five seconds of action followed by a minute of standing around don't get me wrong i am a sports fan and can appreciate most sports i have a tough time with those that are based on judging skating gymnastics etc what is it about soccer that creates such animosity is it the jingoistic view that since it wasn't invented in the usa it is inherently evil is it that xenophobic fear that since the usa is not the top dog that we can't or won't appreciate it is it the fact that it is an easy target because it appears 'everyone' hates it and you're just stupid to even like something that the masses which quite often are asses frown upon is it because folks can get a quick laugh if they make fun of it Baseball Football (soccer) Playoff Sports timeline Sport Major League Soccer The Jim Rome Show Major League Baseball television contracts September 2004 in sports Ice hockey Boston Red Sox April 2005 in sports December 2004 in sports New York Jets American football Wayne Gretzky St. Louis Cardinals 2004 American League Championship Series Philadelphia Eagles Football July 2005 in sports October 2005 in sports World Series Texas A&M University Golf Stanley Cup Water polo Ty Cobb Eric Cartman March 2005 in sports Playoff format National Hockey League Salary cap College football University of Houston Associated Press Athlete of the Year Roller hockey June 2005 in sports Los Angeles Kings Toronto Maple Leafs May 2005 in sports I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Atlanta, Georgia Field hockey Summer Olympic Games January 2005 in sports Buffalo Bills National Hockey League rivalries November 2004 in sports Carolina Panthers Michael Jordan October 2004 in sports Georgia Institute of Technology Chicago White Sox Matt Hardy Equine conformation Steve Nash Virginia Commonwealth University September 2005 in sports Montreal Iron Bowl Jim Thorpe Babe Ruth Miracle on Ice Counter-Strike Cleveland Browns Sport in the United Kingdom National Hockey League All-Star Game Overtime (sport) Cleveland Indians Indian sport Atlantic Coast Conference Vin Scully Reggie Jackson Women's sports ESPN25 University of Denver Tie (draw) Lacrosse New York Yankees New York Knicks Pete Rose Sports in Canada Relegation Arkansas Razorbacks Southeastern Conference National Football League Lore Yelena Davydova David Beckham Football World Cup Al Michaels
