who thinks david beckham 's move to mls was the desicion of posh i think so after watching the show nbc did on her move to la i think she is trying to be like paris hilton posh is irrelivant beckham's move was an attempt to stay in the spotlight as long as possible when he made the move he had been thrown off england's national team he was benched on real and to top it off he's not really any good anymore now he is playing in a b league mls where he should be able to easily perform respectably since the only people who play mls are guys who can't make it in europe don't get me wrong i have nothing against beckham but he is just going to the us because he can't compete in europe at the level he used to he is doing the same thing pele and beckenbauer when they went to new york back in the day that being said i'm sure posh enjoys the opportunity to make a name for herself in hollywood Major League Soccer Victoria Beckham David Beckham Bobby Charlton Michael Owen Football in England Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Real Madrid Rugby league Major professional sports league Live 8 concert, London Eddie Pope Super Bowl Steve McManaman Ali Daei Major League Soccer All-Star Game 1957 World Series MetroStars Little Britain Tris Speaker Football chant Humphrey Bogart England national football team New York Jets Freddy Adu C.D.
