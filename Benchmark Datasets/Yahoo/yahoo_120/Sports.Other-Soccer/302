can you tell me ways to make my kicks stronger in soccer well obviously you need to go to the gym and work out all the muscles in your body cus hwen you strike a ball you use a lot of muscles but make sure you work on your legs and your abs cus when you shoot you are twisting your body and that uses your abs second make sure you are striking the ball properly when your just going for power you have to take about steps back and accelarate into the ball make sure you strike it w your laces more specifically hit yoru sweet spot a bone in the middle of your foot that is kinda higher than the rest of your foot and make sure you follow through when you kick the ball you hsould kinda be jumping into it and make sure you land on your leg you shot with look up some videos of ronaldinho shooting to see exactly what i mean cus he is a great example of how to do it properly and to keep your shot lower lean over the ball more and if yoru volleying keep your knee over it to keep it low and on volleys don't worry about power just concentrate on yoru timing cus you are just redirecting the ball so it should already have enough power o and to practice hitting yoru sweet spot you need to take off your shoe and feel around for the bone that is kinda like the peak of the top of your foot and put your hand on it and when yoru shooting like in practice or at home as soon as you shoot bend down and point to where you struck the ball on your foot and see if it is yoru sweet spot and keep doin this until you are hitting it evrey single time i promise if you don't already do this your shot power and accuracy will improve trememndously this is the best advice about shooting i have ever gotten so i hope this helped you as much as it has me good luck Volleyball Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling attacks Equine conformation Snooker Tennis Professional wrestling holds Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Fast bowling Swingout Weight training Professional wrestling throws Diving Muay Thai Professional wrestling aerial techniques 1957 World Series Mixed martial arts Seishun Academy Middle School Billiards Basketball Glossary of climbing terms Badminton Field hockey Table tennis New York Giants Backstroke Terminal ballistics Batting (cricket) Glossary of ballet terms Archery Golf Foot Baseball Kick Billboard Hot 100 Glossary of partner dance terms American football Football (soccer) Breaststroke Serve (tennis) Internal ballistics Rugby union positions Professional wrestling slang Horizontal bar Neckbreaker Water polo Glossary of American football Naruto jutsu Laws of cricket Pump It Up Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Cliff Richard Swimming Aikido Four square Rugby union Machine gun Squash (sport) Charleston (dance move) Fielding (cricket) Pinball Paintball Doom enemies Tenshinhan Massage Piccolo Junior Saga GunBound 108 form Wu family T'ai Chi Ch'uan Ravi Shastri Electrophysiology Side pass (dance move) Anterior cruciate ligament Textile manufacturing Jack Charlton Figure skating Parade (military) Golf club (equipment) Bodyline Horse Boxing Decompression sickness Cheerleading Shoe Proprioception Racquetball Combine (Half-Life 2) Strike (attack) Marching band Baseball Stars Peter Shilton Spanking Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Punt (boat) Croquet Pole vault
