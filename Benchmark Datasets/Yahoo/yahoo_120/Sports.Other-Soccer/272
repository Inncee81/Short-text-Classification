is raul tamudo or sergio aguero a better striker choice for my la liga fantasy team and who should start in midfield between dos santos and raul garcia raul tamudo is a much better choice he starts every game and scores much more goals than aguero he's a bargain and is definately worth it if you need a cheap striker who will give you goals in midfield i'd say go with raul garcia i'm not sure if you mean the dos santos playing for barcelona or almeria in fantasy play its important to be bringing in players who are going to be starting or atleast playing in nearly everygame dos santos playing for barcelona probably isn't going to get much oppurtunity amongst all og the midfield wizards in barca Real Madrid Ra__l Gonz__lez FC Barcelona Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Alex Ferguson Norway national football team Michael Owen Midfielder Leeds United F.C.
