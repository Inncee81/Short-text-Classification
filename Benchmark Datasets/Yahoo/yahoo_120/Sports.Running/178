mp or ipod for running i've been using this little yet handy mp player for the past year it's like mb and i currently have about songs that are now stuck there for life as the little drive thing is corrupted i'm definitly getting something new but i was wondering about opinions the best winning pts lol whether ot not i should go for an ipod or just a high mem capacity mp player i'm not too into the video portion of what ipods can offer so maybe there are some other stuff to it than that like my buddy telling me that you can track run progress and upload it from ipod to computer any insights would be great for running i recommend an ipod nano its small and portable yet you can store a good amount of songs still plus like mentioned before you can get a convenient arm band for it another nice thing about the ipod nano is that nike has a special thing that you can store in their special nike shoes you dont have to have their shoes for it you can also store those things behind your heel in your socks and itll wireless transfer information to you ipod giving it information about your run if you go to an apple store or check the website nike site you can probably find good amounts of information on it and see whether you like the ipod or not IPod ITunes IPod shuffle USB flash drive Digital audio player IPod mini Podcasting Walkman FireWire ITunes Music Store FairPlay PlayStation Portable IPod photo Redundant array of independent disks Disc jockey IMac Creative Zen Floppy disk MP3 Digital rights management Apple Macintosh Compact audio cassette Flash memory Online music store Mobile phone MiniDisc American Pie (song) Gramophone record H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Mixtape BitTorrent Apple II family DVD Nike, Inc.
