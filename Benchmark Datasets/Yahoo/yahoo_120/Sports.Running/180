cross country advice and question this is my first year running cc and i am a sr i am pretty nervous and don't really know people on the team cuase i am new to the school i got through first two days of practice fine but today was my third and i couldn't do the long run my quads and hamstrings hurt pretty bad and i am afraid these guys think i am a slacker i think i have doms thanks guys so much for the information i appreciate it a ton this is my second year running cross country and let me just tell you that everyone gets sore especially in the first couple weeks it gets better though it's the hardest in the beginning pretty soon you'll be able to run miles in your sleep and if your team is anything like mine nobody thinks you or anyone else is a slacker just showing up and running the miles makes you anything but that i don't think anyone expects everyone especially people that are new to keep up every time everyone runs at different speeds and have different amounts of endurance so i am sure you are doing great don't give up it's hard but it can be fun i have made a ton of good friends through the sport and i really enjoy it it also gets you in really good shape so good luck this year The Ashlee Simpson Show Norway national football team 24 Hours of Le Mans Theory of conduct Avenue Q Social rule Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cliff Richard 2000 Australian Grand Prix Marathon (sport) 1957 World Series Babe Ruth Team Fortress Classic Equine conformation The Fairly OddParents Kurt Cobain Craps Arianne Humphrey Bogart Weight training Eddie Guerrero The Amazing Race Teen Girl Squad Drag racing Triathlon Rod Stewart The Contender (television series) Shaggy dog story The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Tour de France Bon Jovi Timon and Pumbaa Gliding Jon Secada Milton H.
