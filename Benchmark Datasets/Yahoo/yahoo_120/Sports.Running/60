need to get an minute mile in weeks help i have soccer tryouts in weeks i have an minute mile now and i have to get it down to at least an minute mile any suggestions on what i can do thank you if your problem is that your pace is too slow gradually speed it up to lose apprx seconds in days subtract around or seconds each day or take off more time in less days if you just dont have enough strength and stamina try running more than a mile that way the mile wont seem as hard and itll be easier to run at tryouts Marathon (sport) 2005 Iditarod Speed of light Seabiscuit Second 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Indianapolis 500 USS Tunny (SS-282) Ravi Shastri Celestial navigation Fast bowling Year Haile Gebrselassie 24 Hours of Le Mans Apollo 8 Weight training Go (board game) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Sprint (race) 24-hour clock Team Fortress Classic Royal Marines IBM PC compatible Toyota Prius Air traffic controller Mercury Atlas 6 Apollo 15 Day Drag racing Tempo Equine conformation Equation of time Middle distance track event Time Jeopardy!
