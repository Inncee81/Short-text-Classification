im good at short distance running and i want to improve in long distances how do i do this i don't know how much you run to begin with but i would start of by running days a week with a mile mile rotation if you are in shape monday through friday do this for two weeks and then progress yourself to a mile mile rotation with another on saturday always hydrate constantly long distant running in the summer will burn numerous calories as well as dehydrate you try running in the early mornings and late evenings to avoid the heat make sure you have a good set of cross country running shoes which can be purchased at most local sporting good stores don't put more than miles on one pair of shoes if you begin to have pain in your workouts ease off a bit walk some and then try running again if the pain is reoccurring you need to knock your mileage back down some becoming a better runner is not about running as fast as you can for as long as you can run one or two days a week with an increased amount of speed take the day following the speed workouts with a slower pace and then allow yourself or days to run a generally moderate pace if you are running in a hilly area you might want to decrease your mileage a bit and run hills depending on the hill size will dictate how many hills you should run always warm up and stretch before running and do a post work out cool down walk and stretch being limber is a vital part of running long distance especially on uneven terrain hope this helps and good luck with the running Marathon (sport) Weight training Triathlon Equine conformation Hiking Fast bowling Swimming Jet engine Carburetor Running Welding Tire Interstate Highway Internal ballistics Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Indianapolis 500 Fasting Tank Drag racing Breastfeeding Energy Stress fracture Recumbent bicycle Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Fell running Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2005-06 Paragliding E85 Horse gait Drill bit Disc brake CPU design Explosive material John McDouall Stuart USS Tunny (SS-282) Dog agility Gliding Iliotibial band syndrome Gas metal arc welding Ben Johnson (athlete) Iditarod Sprint (race) Mercury (planet) Sport rowing Bicycle Speed limit 24 Hours of Le Mans 2003 North America blackout Port Authority Trans-Hudson Hybrid Synergy Drive Portland cement Heinkel He 100 Hybrid vehicle Freeway Day TGV Action potential Future energy development Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Speed of light 1957 World Series CPU cache Diesel engine RISC Geography of Russia Wind turbine 400-Series Highways Billboard Hot 100 STS-62 Elis Prefecture Dieting Diving 2000 Australian Grand Prix Auto racing Babe Ruth Toyota Prius Softball Easter Dairy Energy development Nuclear power Fanny Blankers-Koen Horseshoe Auto insurance USS Ammen (DD-527) Marching band Bubble Bobble Cleveland Browns Inflation Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Athletics Soap opera Sauna Daylight saving time
