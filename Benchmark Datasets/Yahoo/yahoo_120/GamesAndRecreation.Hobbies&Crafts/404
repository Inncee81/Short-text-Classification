painting on fabric very basic questions i want to paint a rose on a thin synthetic fabric transparent chifonne i want it to look like watercolor it would be a part of my dance costume so it only needs to look good from far away it doesn't need to be a great masterpiece i found this website http www dharmatrading com that seems to have everything i possibly need but the question is what do i need i think i need a dye not a paint am i correct what is french dye what is jacquard silk dye maybe i should use something completely different what resist should i use if you have an answer to any of those questions i'd really appreciate it i have a lot of spare fabric pieces to experiment with first off if your fabric is synthetic like you say dye isn't going to work if the dye can't soak into the fiber it won't stay pretty much unless your synthetic is rayon you'll perhaps want to think about paint acrylics should work if you water them down and they should act like a watercolor wherever you purchase your acrylic paint you should be able to find what's called textile medium i can't remember if it's delta applebarrel or folkart that makes it but it costs about what it does is it will prevent your paint from cracking i would also recomment finding some way to keep the fabric not stretched but taut either seriously weighted down all around or push pinned at relatively close intervals with white paper or waxed paper underneath good luck to answer some of your other questions the jacquard silk dyes work beautifully and if you want a watercolor effect it is pretty much exactly what you want but it's designed for silk resists are best if you're doing a complete dye and want a specific area or design to remain the original color of the fabric resists are also good if you want to contain a design within an area but are really only necessary if you're painting with a really watered down dye Plastic Textile manufacturing terminology Watercolor painting Dye Paint Textile manufacturing Weaving Knitting Textile Jute Yarn Undergarment Acrylic paint Indigo dye Carpet Diamond Leather Mattress Upholstery Sari Cloth Traditional animation Inkjet printer Casting Rubber stamp Silk Turquoise Fiberglass Batik Clothing Screen-printing Shroud of Turin Carbon fiber Bong Strap-on dildo Technicolor Photography Printmaking Rope Korean art William Perkin Light-emitting diode Zipper Wood carving Lapis lazuli Violin Parachute Tallit De Lorean DMC-12 Copy protection Chromium Wood Theory of conduct Pysanka Model aircraft Floppy disk Painting English longbow Tzitzit Titanium Bow (music) Ammolite Cross-stitch Cochineal Epoxy Pastel High-heeled shoe Staining (biology) Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Crimson Brush Paper marbling Polymethyl methacrylate Paintball Metallurgy Kilt Bulletproof vest Kite flying Lacquer Hand grenade Printed circuit board Nylon Condom Pigment Han Chinese clothing Fan (implement) Headgear Hair coloring Reinforced concrete World Wide Web Handloading Economics Swimsuit Christo and Jeanne-Claude Book Intelligent design Dyneema Drawing
