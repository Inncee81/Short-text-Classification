what materials do i need to make a dummy wedding cake the best way to make a dummy wedding cake is to get dense styrofoam in the shape you wish the cake pieces to be either round or square you then cover the styrofoam with royal icing this type of icing hardens very fast so you need to work quickly to get a smooth finish another way is to cover the styrofoam with marzipan icing which can be purchased rather than making it yourself you will then need to purchase the type of pillars you might want to separate the pieces or the cake or layer the pieces one on top of the other but in either case you need to ice the layer before you assemble the cake you will need to use royal icing as glue to stick the pieces together next you need to get a piping bag and tips to pipe your decorations onto the cake you should again use royal icing for this but can colour the icing used for piping to give it a more exciting look lastly you can add your cake top and pipe around the bottom of it to help it stick to the cake it might take a few tries but it is fun to make your own wedding cake Polystyrene Cake Violin Pottery Casting Guitar Cookie Bong Wedding cake Cuisine of Denmark Mattress Christmas tree Bread Diamond Woodworking Marzipan Doughnut Skiing Glacier Enceladus (moon) Mochi Knitting Forge Glaze Drill bit Radio controlled airplane Kimono Billiards Tofu Nunchaku Ammunition Dairy Pastry bag Glossary of nautical terms Glass Wood carving Tire Spidey Super Stories Textile manufacturing terminology Mooncake Ice Seismic retrofit Climbing equipment Birthday Diving suit Brazing Vermicompost Chicago-style pizza Leaf Cookware and bakeware Dim sum GunBound Culture of Korea Repouss__ and chasing Katana Homestar Runner Upholstery Leather Manifold Double bass Shoe Soap bubble Carbon fiber Ice core Loudspeaker Chopsticks Brewery Textile manufacturing Anchor Chair Beehive (beekeeping) Sea ice Rigging Boat building Amateur telescope making Cross-country skiing Curling Dredge Stairway Classical order Baked Alaska Coffee Roswell UFO incident Land mine King cake Stainless steel Colours, standards and guidons Ice hockey Solar cell Kilt Quilting New York Giants Stucco Smoking pipe Stage lighting Harp
