does any one know if an australian solid silver coin is worth it's a commermorativret it was a present so if it was worth anything will sell and treat myself if it isn't any suggestions of what to do with it by the way it's cms across and is pretty weighty the australian mint issues a bewildering array of commemorative and bullion coins for collectors and yours could be any of them i'm going to guess however that yours is at a minimum one ounce of pure silver which right now is us per ounce the two dollar coins however are generally two ounces two ounces grams it probably carries a modest premium over silver also which would put it in the us range this assumes that the coin is still in the plastic capsule it was issued in and so on any local coin dealer should be interested in buying it United States dollar Australian dollar Precious metal Liberty Dollar Royal Canadian Mint British coinage Canadian dollar Mexican peso Pound sterling United States coinage United States Mint Gold standard Nickel (U.S. coin) Gold as an investment Coin collecting Gold sovereign Philippine peso American Gold Eagle Money in Harry Potter United States dollar coin Gresham's law Silver Certificate Krugerrand 1933 Double Eagle Banknote Gold Legal tender Spanish dollar Yen British coin Guinea Coin New Zealand dollar 1804 silver dollar Silver Ringgit Hong Kong dollar Farthing (coin) Pound Thaler Baht Bretton Woods system Dime (U.S. coin) History of the English penny Roman currency Money Eisenhower Dollar Pataca Hyperinflation Coinage of the Republic of Ireland Franklin Mint New Orleans Mint Double Eagle (U.S. coin) Wheel of Fortune Currency History of the British penny (1714-1901) History of the halfpenny Stamp collecting Dollar Romanian leu Free Silver Euro Coinage Act (1792) $ale of the Century Rupiah Ruble Speed limit Alcoholic beverage Gramophone record Kennedy half dollar History of the English penny (1154-1485) Latin Monetary Union Sacagawea Dollar Philatelic investment Fiat money Money supply IPod U.S. one hundred-dollar bill Hydrogen economy Sterling silver Bulk vending New Taiwan dollar Tael British Five Pound coin Jamaican dollar British Two Pound coin Cocaine British coin Florin Life insurance Football (ball) Dodge Charger State Quarters British Fifty Pence coin Ancient Greek coinage Arguments for and against drug prohibition Deutsche Mark Solar power U.S. ten-dollar bill
