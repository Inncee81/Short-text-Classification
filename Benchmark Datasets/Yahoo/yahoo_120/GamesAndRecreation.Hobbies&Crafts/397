my kid has alot of yugio cards has yugio come and gone or are these a sellable collectable still people still collect and buy the cards the value of the collection will depend on which cards your kid has and the condition of the cards a good way to get a feel for the value of the ones you have would be to look on ebay and compare what you have to what has sold if you have just ordinary cards they probably won't be worth very much money however if you have one of the rarest ones it could sell for a pretty high price look under yugioh and yugio since people use different spellings when they list good luck Philatelic investment Monopoly (game) Yu-Gi-Oh!
