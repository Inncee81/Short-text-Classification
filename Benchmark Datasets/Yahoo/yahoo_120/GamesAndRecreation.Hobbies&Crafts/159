craft ideas for women's handkerchiefs i found maybe oldish looking printed women's handkerchiefs when i was going thru my mom's belongings they are all different sizes and prints some with irregular or scalloped edging i'm not much into quilting what else could i do with them i love old handkerchiefs i've seen and made cute valances with them by laying them out partially overlapping with a point at top and bottom and tacking them together then the top point folds over the rod and you tack that as well you can add some cool old buttons or bows etc where they're tacked together if that's not suitable you can use them as pillow fronts either leaving them as they are or adding some embellishment since they're probably thin and maybe frail i'd mount them on sturdier fabric if you're lucky enough to have some truly gorgeous ones they can be beautiful framed or even used as a mat behind another work of art have fun with them Mattress Upholstery Sewing Quilt Sundial Textile manufacturing terminology Drill bit Sailing Japanese tea ceremony Shirt Bicycle Brewery Knitting Colours, standards and guidons Quilting Dodge Charger Katana Parts of a sail Bed (furniture) Knife Otello Lava Saw Seismic retrofit Suit (clothes) Bicycle frame Floppy disk Rigging Kitesurfing Strap-on dildo Violin Door Guitar Poker jargon Chair Wood carving DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution Traditional animation Printed circuit board Mouse (computing) Order of St. John Fiberglass Sword making Brassiere Amateur telescope making Canoe View camera AFI 100 Years series Dog Campfire Kylie Minogue Professional wrestling holds Bondage (BDSM) Japanese art Fan (implement) Anchor Fabrication (metal) Symmetry Sail Glossary of nautical terms Art Equine conformation Dinghy Paper size Glass Radio controlled airplane Cowboy DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Loudspeaker Black tie Rail tracks Boat building Spinnaker Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Piano Diving suit Curling Wire Recumbent bicycle Trousers James Kochalka Cello Applique Tank Christmas tree Paul Is Dead Snooker King Crimson Clothing Caprice Bourret Screw Avenue Q Comanche EastEnders Sega Saturn Carpet
