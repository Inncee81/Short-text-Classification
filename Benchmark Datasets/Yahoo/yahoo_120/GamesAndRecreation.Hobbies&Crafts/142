do they make drill bits for glass i am making some crafts using old glass soda bottles old pepsi crush and coke bottles and i need to drill a small pencil sized hole in the thick bottom of the bottle do they even make drills for glass and will the bottle crack if i try to drill hi you can use a dremel with a diamond drill bit to drill through glass stone and tile if you drill slowly you shouldn't have any problems with the glass cracking it probably would be more prone to fractures if the area that is being drilled gets too hot so that the temperature difference with the surround glass is too much if you go slow it shouldn't overheat be sure to wear safety glasses when you do this too Drill bit Glass Diamond enhancement Printed circuit board Seismic retrofit Diamond Disc brake Woodworking Plastic Brewery Ice core Drilling and threading Polyethylene terephthalate Bicycle frame Welding Drill bit shank Casting Metalworking Drill Ion implantation Happy Tree Friends Pepsi-Cola Drill bit sizes Diamond simulant Energy development Climbing equipment RuneScape Mini-Games Ceramics The Coca-Cola Company Diamond clarity Coffee Diet soda Fountain pen Forge Masonry Soft drink Safe-cracking Float glass Cocaine Beer Sento Bread Wood Fiberglass Irn-Bru Coca-Cola Wine bottle Petroleum Naval mine Oil well Lampworking Glasses Wheat beer Champagne (beverage) Tesla coil New Coke Floppy disk Directional drilling Cider Campfire Laser engraving Motor oil Glacier Drink Tennessee Williams Polymer clay Piccolo Junior Saga M16 (rifle) Equine conformation Compact disc Titanium Inca Kola Geology of the Moon Diamond cut Rail tracks Shotgunning Engine cooling Decompression sickness Material properties of diamond Ammonia Guinness Igneous rock Hamster Metallurgy Vacuum tube Derrick (lifting device) Volcano Milk Knife Furnace Pebble bed reactor Optical fiber Jackass: The Movie Internal ballistics Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards Cookware and bakeware Grinding machine Geothermal areas of Yellowstone
