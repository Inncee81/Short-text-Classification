does anyone have any good ideas on how to make a scrapbook style coupon organizer i want to make something that will organize coupons according to what category they are in i e food household etc any ideas would be appreciated well buy a scrapbook with plastic pages used to put your scrapbook pages in instead put your coupons in them and label the plastic with the levels of the food pyramid put your coupons in the right plastic slip and if you have left over plastic put furniture coupons or even discount cards in them it would be a lot easier to keep track of them and it would be a lot spacier then categorizing them in food considering how many foods there are Bond Tamper-evident Scrapbooking Floppy disk Charles Ponzi Hamster Fixed income Marathon (computer game) Plastic Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Retailer MapleStory Zero coupon bond Radio controlled car Loyalty program Price discrimination TurboGrafx 16 Music genre Fast bowling Rational pricing Staples, Inc.
