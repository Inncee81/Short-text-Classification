i want to make a quilt what do i do i suddenly decided i want to make a quilt but i have no idea how to do it or what i would need i want to make one for on my bed not on a wall can you tell me what some good sites i can look at that show clearly every step involved and some good sites for inspiration also what sort of fabrics are best a class is always the best way to learn to quilt but it isn't always possible there may not be any classes in your area or the expense may not be practical for you if you have the money to spend you're probably looking at for a series of four to six classes do some research in your area check the phone book for a local quilt shop it should be listed under quilting they will be your best resource they may offer classes often with discounts on fabric for your class project the lqs class is the best way to go because you're building a relationship with the people who work there and you'll always be able to go back for help even if they don't offer classes they may be able to tell you who does they can also put you in touch with your area quilting guild some quilt guilds are fantastic welcoming to new members and willing to help you learn unfortunately i wasn't that lucky since my guild was all about who's already been there for twenty years and they had no interest in anyone with different ideas you may also be able to take a class from a community college check with your local schools about adult education courses if a class is not practical for you then you need to teach yourself i recommend getting a couple of good instruction books like start quilting with alex anderson and the quilter's ultimate visual guide the first is a thin book that teaches you the basics with just six blocks the second books is more reference than instruction but it has a lot of information for beginners i also like quilt in a day eleanor burns their books are clearly illustrated and explain strip and chain piecing which are relatively new techniques in the last twenty or thirty years quilt in a day also has dvds available to go with their books a video is the next best thing to taking a class if you can't take a class but can afford a investment i'd suggest the book and dvd from eleanor burns called still stripping after years it contains beginner to intermediate level projects there are also videos available for free on the internet spend some time checking out hgtv's simply quilts videos the show is no longer being aired but you can watch segments online speaking of television shows check out your local pbs station quilt in a day has a show as does fons porter love of quilting there's also an online network called quilter's news network that has quilting shows all the time for block patterns you must check out quilter's cache there are over free block patterns with detailed illustrated instructions they are instructions for the blocks only so you'll need to learn a bit about piecing methods and sizing to figure out what you need to make an entire quilt but it's well worth the effort as far as fabric you really should start with cotton and use the best you can afford you can get quilting fabric at places like joann fabrics hancock fabrics hobby lobby and even some walmart stores they generally aren't the highest quality actually some of it is really awful and some is pretty good but the pretty good stuff tends to be more expensive at these stores than the really good stuff is at quilt shops if you have a quilt shop buy from them keep your local stores in business if you're on a budget shop their clearance section they all have them if you don't have a local quilt shop check out the many online shops my personal favorites are hancocks of paducah no relation to hancock fabrics and connecting threads which has several new lines of quilt shop quality fabric for about less connecting threads is also a great place for inspiration go to their books section and click on a title it will bring up the page for that book and under the photo of the book it says view inside images this will show you up to a dozen projects from that book another great place for inspiration is webshots or the many other photo sharing sites just go in and search for quilt finally do a google search for quilt and then click images at the top left you'll have thousands hundreds of thousands of quilts to look at Quilt Quilting Mattress RISC CPU cache E-mail spam Neopets Compiler optimization Enterprise content management Theory of conduct Education in the People's Republic of China Teletext CPU design Wal-Mart Knitting Google Scientology beliefs and practices Mach kernel Extreme Programming The Star Wars Holiday Special Infantilism Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Genealogy PHP Plame affair Legal research Hash table Surveillance Expert system Avenue Q MMORPG Gaia Online Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Computer W.
