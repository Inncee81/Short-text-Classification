african dwarf frog best filter okay i have just recently purchased a gallon tank and i want to get two african dwarf frogs for the tank however the tank came with a whisper filter waterfall type the thing is it's huge takes up way too much room in the tank any suggestions on a hanging type filter that is smaller and effective or what type of filter should i use to help keep the tank clean use the one that you have it may look big but that is only because your tank is so tiny the small whisper filter is actually pretty decent if you are really set on getting a new one get the hagen aquaclear it will do a good job and you can adjust the flow so you won't have to worry about your frogs getting sucked up the intake GunBound Tank Carburetor Bong African clawed frog Low-pass filter Frog E85 Marine aquarium BZFlag Aquarium Dead Like Me Manifold vacuum Dry cleaning Autonomous building Thermal power station Dialysis Jet engine Reef tank M60 machine gun Les Claypool Lung Cannabis cultivation Water supply Loudspeaker Light pollution Air purifier Fossil fuel power plant Siphon Sewage treatment Japanese toilet Spacecraft propulsion Final Fantasy XI Syphon Filter Axolotl Hydraulic machinery Little Britain Strap-on dildo Light-emitting diode Shrimp farm Vacuum cleaner Two-stroke cycle Phase-locked loop T-72 Transformer Fire fighting Air filter Stereoscopy Spidey Super Stories Water heater Turbocharger Fume hood Biodiesel Model aircraft M3 Lee Water purification Hamster Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Operational amplifier Habbo Hotel Rebreather Rail terminology Glossary of firefighting equipment Vickers 6-Ton Analog-to-digital converter Prostate cancer Automobile emissions control Domestic rabbit Power station Technicolor Pump RuneScape weapons Snorkel RISC Nyquist___Shannon sampling theorem Yacht Whitewater Gasoline Noise reduction Dark matter P-47 Thunderbolt Cruising (maritime) Sea-Monkey Gas turbine-electric locomotive Waterfall Fuel injection Bouncy techno Warrior (World of Warcraft) Races of Final Fantasy Dairy Superconductivity Modem Filter (mathematics) PID controller Filter (optics) Subspecies Bristol Zoo Advance Wars: Dual Strike Euphemism
