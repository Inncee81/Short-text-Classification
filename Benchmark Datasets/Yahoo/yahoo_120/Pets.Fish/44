can blunt trauma cause swim bladder a toddler got into my fish tank with the net and my fish has been floating upside down ever since three full days now at first i thought it was dying from being scared or hit with the net now i'm thinking it has swim bladder the question is was that caused by the incident with the net or is it just a coincidence would this have happened regardless it's one of the less expensive fancy goldfish i read a post on another forum that cited an aquarium owner's manual saying swim bladder can be caused by rough handling if that's the case i wonder if it's curable like other forms of swim bladder disorder now its fins are falling apart it's been a bowl by itself for over a day now so it couldn't be the minnow biting it i thought i noticed damage to the fins when i first found it floating but i couldn't say for sure now that damage has gotten much worse there are clearly sections of the tail fin missing and it's frayed is this the symptom of some disease can fish ever recover from such damage as you have guess i think it's swim bladder problem too but i never encounter any situation where rough handling lead to to swim bladder problem i would think it was probably a coincidence i believe it would have happen even if the toddler didn't mess up the tank what i believe he did was probably to stir up the gravel in your tank thereby loosening all the waste trap in the gravel that the additional bio waste probably mess up your water really fast and over loaded your filter the bad water could give rise to the swim bladder problem if you have thick gravel there is the possibility that there might be low level of hydrogen sulfide due to anaerobic metabolism this will also cause serious problem if it's present and release to the tank water due to a disturbance of the gravel if your gravel is mess up these are the possibilities as for treating swim bladder problem you could refer to this http www arofanatics com members dragonfly sg swimbladderproblem Sewage treatment Urinary incontinence Aquarium Carnivorous plant Brewery Fishing Hydrogen sulfide Coral reef Chronic fatigue syndrome Kidney Bladderwort Prostate cancer Equine conformation Ecco the Dolphin American lobster Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Shark Swimming Rebreather Urinary system Hypoglycemia CPU cache Autism Dead Like Me Gar Swimming pool Nuclear power Abortion Goldfish Tocopherol Tobacco smoking StarCraft: Uprising Tank 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake Pok__mon Abilities Shrimp farm Gas bladder Debugging Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Mental illness Scientology beliefs and practices Dissociative identity disorder Unreal Halitosis Schizophrenia Floppy disk Asthma Sea-Monkey Cancer Multiple sclerosis RMS Titanic Post-traumatic stress disorder Alzheimer's disease Atlantic herring Apollo 13 Flush toilet Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Obstetrics Shaggy dog story Salmon Intracranial pressure Nutrition Marine aquarium Conker's Bad Fur Day Anorexia nervosa Fish farming Carburetor Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coeliac disease Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Alcoholism Mosquito Cantonese cuisine Dairy Autonomous building E85 Pneumonia Parkinson's disease Insulin Acute renal failure Thermal power station Tag Coffee Dog Bacteria Spina bifida DragonFly BSD
