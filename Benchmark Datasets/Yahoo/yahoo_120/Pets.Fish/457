i have a male and a female betta how should i breed them the water needs to be a little warmer than usual but not hot and a little pinch of aquarium salt helps keep both fish healthy the male often kills the famale during or after mating he has to squeeze the eggs out of her and in this process she sometimes drowns fish drowning yes because they are surface breathers she will eat the eggs if you leave her in the tank so if she survives remove her immediately and give her special care for a few weeks some people divide their fish tanks with clear barriers so the males and females can see each other but are separate until the time is right when the male has a good bubble nest built and she has ripe eggs if the barrier is low enough they will be able to jump over to get to the mate good luck Kakapo Goldfish Leatherback Sea Turtle Aquarium Clownfish Platypus Sea-Monkey Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Bird Fugu Spider American lobster Salmon Halfbeak Emu Ant Octopus Chicken Cantonese cuisine Seabird Marine aquarium Discus (fish) Tarantula Hamster Egg (food) Shark Humpback Whale Dwarf gourami Life in the Freezer Tilapia Fishing Live-bearing aquarium fish Tuatara Osprey Sexual reproduction Hemp Tofu Albatross Dairy Antarctic krill Coral reef Fish farming Monogamy Zerg Kosher foods Drowning Beetle Cuisine of the Philippines Orca Fish Sewage treatment Nuclear fusion Murray Cod Ostrich American Alligator Jewish cuisine Nile crocodile Mosquito Pysanka Red Squirrel Sexual dimorphism Gharial Wine making Swimming pool Cyanide Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Sea Otter Anopheles Freshwater angelfish Dinosaur Parthenogenesis Percula Clownfish Mallard Thermal power station Brewery Frog Mango Omega-3 fatty acid Great White Shark Non-human animal sexuality Minor Harry Potter Beasts Roman eating and drinking Reef tank Egg (biology) Condom Jellyfish Bubble Bobble Sailfin Molly Earthworm Zebra Danio Great Bustard Water (molecule) Rhea (bird) Hermaphrodite Myxobolus cerebralis Pikmin Angling African Fish Eagle Gray Wolf Sex
