why does my new fish tank look like it has green water how do i fix it so it looks clear water doesnt look murky just green the green water is caused by an algal bloom i am facing this problems as i speak this can be caused by too much direct sunlight or poor water quality overfeeding fish which is my problem can also lead to this condition recommended solutions are blackouts for a few days no light diatomic or micron filtration and getting something called daphnia for the tank one of the best preventative measures for green water is frequent water changes if water quality is good and light is diminished then your green water problems should stay at bay good luck Eutrophication Algal bloom Solar power Aquarium Algae Lake Sea-Monkey Light pollution Sewage treatment Diatom Marine aquarium Autonomous building Fish farming Shrimp farm Houseplant Aquaculture Coral reef 2003 North America blackout Brewery Lake Burley Griffin Psoriasis Plankton Salton Sea Water E85 Kidney Traffic light Bladderwort Lichen Water pollution Potomac River Mercury Atlas 6 USS Tunny (SS-282) Color Drowning Carnivorous plant Photosynthesis Axolotl Inflation Renewable energy Jellyfish Gas metal arc welding Cloud Rickets Hydroponics Welding Water purification Reef tank History of the tank Krill Antarctic krill Swimming pool Fish Scotch whisky Lake Ontario USS Yorktown (CV-5) Energy development Hard water Dundas Square Cyanide Clear Lake Public policy Vitamin D Hash table Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Diatomaceous earth Eye Neutrino Daylight saving time Dam Sunscreen Bicycle lighting Knife Equine conformation Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Discus (fish) Rail terminology Thermal power station Bong USS Thresher (SS-200) Laser applications Public good Extreme Programming USS Wahoo (SS-238) Rebreather Shipwreck Tide Rainbow Cyanobacteria Sun Hydrogen economy Chesapeake Bay Cancer Gasoline Chlorophyta Urinary incontinence Elis Prefecture Keynesian economics
