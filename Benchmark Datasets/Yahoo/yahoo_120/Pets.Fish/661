good fish for a gallon high tank if you'd like a lively colorful tank you can try platies or mollies try to keep a ratio of females for each male and don't stock more than about of them trust me it'll look like plenty they're very active and playful you don't want to overstock these guys because they are big waste producers like goldfish read the labels carefully on the mollies some of them like the sailfins and the dalmations get much larger than others also swordtails seem too large and aggressive to me for a gallon especially a tall which won't have as much swim space now a tank of livebearers can end up being problematic because they do breed like bunnies and you can end up overstocked one solution is to keep only large leaved plants in the tank and only small gravel so that the fry have nowhere to hide and can be eaten by the adults i've also found that keeping a single female betta in the tank is a great population control tool those girls are quite the predators for bottom feeders a small school about cories and a couple of olive nerite snails have worked great for me Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Live-bearing aquarium fish Sailfin Molly Goldfish Aquarium Marine aquarium Sea-Monkey Green swordtail Sewage treatment Poker jargon Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends Discus (fish) Halfbeak Snail Fugu Hydrogen economy Gas turbine Clownfish Lake Burley Griffin Koi Brewery Livestock Gar Alcohol fuel Kakapo Unreal Dwarf gourami Domestic rabbit Tilapia Seabird Autonomous building Spider Biological pest control Crayfish Hydroponics Shrimp farm American lobster Olive oil Gray Wolf Yacht Axolotl Albatross Biodiesel The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Shark Poeciliidae Hamster Fishing Ostrich Atlantic herring Transformer Striped bass Guinea pig Fuel injection Olive Fossil fuel power plant Solar power Tank Salmon Leatherback Sea Turtle History of the tank Dry cleaning Spacecraft propulsion Lion Bottlenose Dolphin Gay slang American Alligator Kangaroo Domesticated turkey Tarantula Gasoline Dog Tlingit Muskellunge Cheetah Carburetor Grunion Cat Murray Cod Liger Clown loach Dairy Seine (fishing) Equine conformation Glossary of wildland fire terms Sexual dimorphism Diving Stingray Mosquito Corydoras E85 Musk Duck CPU cache House Mouse Anchor Coconut crab Energy development American Dad!
