cleaner shrimp i have a g fresh water fish tank i have heard that cleaner shrimp really do clean your tank i have an algea problem and i am getting cleaner today but other wise i have not way of cleaning the gravel or the fake plants can cleaner shrimp live in freshwater are there any other fish shrimp or water creatures that you can buy at a pet store that clean your tank you can get red cherry shrimp that do eat algae but dont think it will do as good of a job as a few snails there are some bottom dwelling cat fish that will clean up some of the waste material but the biggest mistake made by people is getting a pleco sucker fish many people at the fish store will tell you they will clean up the tank but in your size tank you have to realize they grow to inches not only that but the ammount of waste they produce is far greater than the algae and waste they consume so i feel they are counter productive i feel your best bet would be a few snails and they will do the best job on the algae remember that its the aquarists job to clean a tank not the inhabitants of the tank so just cause you have snails or catfish or shrimp that are known to clean the tank you still have to keep up with your regular water changes hope this helps and good luck with the tank Marine aquarium Shrimp farm Sea-Monkey Discus (fish) Fish farming Aquarium Goby Eutrophication Hamster Biodiesel Fugu Dry cleaning Gar Shrimp Tilapia Halfbeak Algae Suckermouth Catfish Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Chinook salmon Goldfish Fishing Veganism Future energy development Cuisine of Denmark Sewage treatment Brewery Dairy Energy development Aquaculture Ecology Mattress Salmon Snail Kissing gourami Nuclear power Lobster Reef tank Drill bit Hydrogen economy Taboo food and drink Care Bears Fauna of Australia Axolotl Trawling Fish Roman eating and drinking Clownfish Agriculture Lake Marine biology Finding Nemo Livestock Fancy rat German cuisine Cuttlefish Hydrogen vehicle Justification (theology) Dead Sea Zebra Danio Sailfin Molly Japanese tea ceremony Atlantic herring Brine shrimp Plankton Danio Vacuum cleaner Cantonese cuisine Irrigation Plant Vegetarianism Natural gas Textile manufacturing Earthworm Photosynthesis Confidence trick Animal Ron Weasley Water purification Solar power Chlorophyta Fossil fuel power plant Domestic water system Water resources Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Characters in the Smurfs Water garden Cuisine of the Philippines Radioactive waste Dwarf gourami Domestic rabbit Hydroponics Krill Blue catfish Bengali cuisine Geodesic dome One Piece minor characters
