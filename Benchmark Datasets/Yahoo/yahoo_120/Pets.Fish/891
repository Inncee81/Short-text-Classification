i am trying to prepare an aquarium but everything is going wrong my betta bow died today so i am now trying to prepare an aquarium for a new family member and try to avoid all the mistakes i made with bow i set up my gallon tank with tap water put a bowl buddy in it and let it sit for about hours i just tested the water and that's when i found out what kind of poison soup bow must've been swimming in hardness of the water was at ppm alkalinity at ppm ph was at and even though there's nothing living in there yet the nitrite is between and ppm what is going on how can i fix all that stuff i don't want to start dumping chemicals in there because that'll be hard on a fish plus be a real bear when i have to change water does anyone have any advice your tank is going through what's called a cycle process i'm assuming it has a filter on it if so you'll want it to complete this process here's a link that explains it click on how an aquarium cycles http freshaquarium about com od startupcycle step the cycle htm now you need to have an ammonia source in the tank i'd recommend doing a fishless cycle so you don't harm or kill the fish i would pick up a salad or cocktail shrimp frozen food section of the store put it in a pair of nylons pantyhose with the leg cut off knot it and toss it in the tank and let it rot that's your ammonia source with nitrites showing up in the tank it's about done cycling should take a few more weeks you want your ammonia and nitrite to be at ppm and some nitrates showing when those levels are reached remove the shrimp and do a water change to get the nitrates under ppm then add your fish soon after that then you'll need to do weekly water changes of about to keep the water quality good if there's no filter in the tank dump all the water out add new water and when you add the fish you'll need to do about a water change every days or so to keep the water quality good with no filter you do not want your tank to start cycling now your ph is a bit high what kind of substrate do you have in the tank any sea shells corals rocks those could be raising the ph if so remove them another test you can do get a glass of water from your tap test the ph leave it out and test it about hours later and see if changes if so then that's your problem and you'll probably be best off using bottled spring water for your water changes stay away from the chemicals like ph up ph down ph neutral etc they don't work unless you buffer your water and you really need to know what you're doing otherwise the ph will crash or rise dramatically thus stressing killing your fish you're smart trying to stay away from using chemicals as much as possible they're not good for the fish overall and usually all they do is mask problems not solve them Sewage treatment Ammonia Eutrophication Hydrogen sulfide Cyanide Fishing Water Nitrogen Fish farming Sea-Monkey Thermal power station Extreme Programming Shrimp farm Hydrogen economy Carbon dioxide Fugu Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Cocaine Reef tank Food preservation Antarctic krill Hydroponics Ammonium nitrate Biogeochemical cycle Kosher foods Coral reef Water purification Textile manufacturing Fossil fuel power plant Ecco the Dolphin Dairy Ultraviolet Brewery Hard water Oplan Bojinka Bong Cannabis cultivation Hydrogen peroxide Rebreather Discus (fish) Aerial (dance move) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Plastic RuneScape skills Diseases of the honeybee Illegal drug trade Refrigerator USS Yorktown (CV-5) Octopus Angling Biodiesel Tea Autonomous building Goby Tilapia Hamster Rum Shrimp Solar power Chlorine Clownfish E85 Microeconomics Moon Carnivorous plant Laserdisc B-47 Stratojet Cider Coffee Japanese tea ceremony Uranium Nitric acid Dry cleaning Software testing Krill Ozone depletion Web crawler RuneScape Random Events Fire fighting Polymerase chain reaction Common Unix Printing System Shark Nutrient Hash table Sun Windows XP Portland cement USS Vestal (AR-4) Origin of life Ozone Town gas Cantonese cuisine Glossary of climbing terms Climate change Silver
