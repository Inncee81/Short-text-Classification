if i was to boil the rocks and gravel from my fish tank would this clean kill the hairy algae of them i can't get algae eating fish as the only tank out of is my piranha one they would not live long hi jamie why do you want to clean off the algae algae are part of the natural environment of the fish they are not harmful they help to absorb some of the waste products produced by the fish and provide micronutrients for them you will never eliminate algae from your tank completely because algae are a fact of aquatic life algae are a sign of a healthy tank also as copperhead and magicman pointed out by boiling the gravel you would disturb the fine balance in your tank and thus potentially harm your fish just clean the algae from the glass with a scourer such as used for dishes and don't worry about the rest of the tank you could try to plant your tank this would look very attractive and the stronger plants would compete with the algae for nutrients so that the algae would have less chance to grow for good aquatic plants in the uk i recommend http www aquaticplants eu com index html regards chirpy Eutrophication Biodiesel Nutrient Fish farming Veganism Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Sea-Monkey Aquarium Vegetarianism Algae Carnivorous plant Plant Agriculture Brewery Nutrition Ecology Chinook salmon Water Shrimp farm Coral reef Hydrogen economy Chlorophyta Hydroponics Autonomous building Organic farming Cyanide Photosynthesis Hamster Vitamin C Fugu Coal Energy development Dead Sea Botany Marine biology Biodiversity Aquaculture Weed control Solar power Nuclear power Diatom Water purification Healthy eating Snake Water pollution Kissing gourami Biogeochemical cycle Jute Future energy development Lake Myxobolus cerebralis Polar Bear Coffee Depleted uranium Uranium Dairy Pollution Slow sand filter bed Fertilizer Coral Omega-3 fatty acid Power station Lake Burley Griffin Water resources Lichen Weed Algal bloom Danio Antarctic krill Goldfish Tilapia Biological pest control Egg (food) Carbon dioxide Hydroelectricity Green alga Cancer Gaia theory (science) Introduced species Kosher foods Reef tank Ketchup Jellyfish Wetland Soil life Halfbeak Fishery Lobster Sugar Rice Plankton Boiling point DDT Axolotl Trophic level Frog Discus (fish) Fungus
