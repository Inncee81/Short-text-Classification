snails in aquarium yesterday i purchased a x x aquarium set it up with live plants and gravel and a filter etc etc put all the water in and let it run overnight to start the runnning in period this morning i lifted the lid off to find two tiny little snails in the tank they're currently very small i'd say no longer than mm at the most maybe even mm anyway first what should i do with them are they likely to breed how soon and also are they in danger at all due to the lack of algae and bacteria in my tank please help i've just had a closer look at them they have shells that are long like ice cream cones with like a spiral around it they seem to have black and brown yellow dots on their shell any indication of a breed they are good for your tank they clean up left overs and help contriol algae i like them in my tank i do not do live plants cause i always kill them so i don't get any in that way so to get started i kept my eye open at the fish store and ask for a few when i saw them once i had a few they took care of themselves by breeding of course once i had them in one tank it was easy to move a few to the other tank people say that they breed like crazy i have never found that to be a problem some fish will learn to eat the small ones and the egg patches they lay helping keep them under control i think that also their population is controled by the amount of waste and algea in your tank as a side note do not put a penny in your tank hard metals are bad for all life in your tank if you decide you do not like snails there is a special liquid at the fish stores that will kill only the snails i believe it is safe for all fish but read the label to be sure or ask i have never used it because i like them so i do not know all the details on it Sea-Monkey Marine aquarium Fugu Sewage treatment Aquarium Discus (fish) Algae Snail Water purification Fish farming Motorcycle Brewery Fishing Goldfish Hamster Halfbeak Clownfish Carbon dioxide Roman eating and drinking Octopus Dairy Biodiesel Autonomous building Coral reef Ice cream Danio Koi Hydroponics Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) BZFlag Reef tank Fire fighting Antarctic krill Frog Egg (food) Nuclear power Atlantic herring Agar plate Hydrogen economy Pysanka Kissing gourami Japanese tea ceremony Carnivorous plant Animal Tag Beetle Floppy disk Textile manufacturing Energy development Cantonese cuisine Life in the Freezer Money Freshwater angelfish Food Seabird Dog Fuel cell Water Fancy rat Japanese toilet Sento Hydrogen vehicle Battle of Tarawa Diseases of the honeybee Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Cyanide Salmon Tlingit Operation Market Garden Dry cleaning Smoke-screen Kodocha Water pollution Shrimp farm Tofu Eutrophication Guinea pig Egg (biology) Minor Harry Potter Beasts Bong Seine (fishing) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Kosher foods Spider Terminal ballistics Zerg Hydrogen sulfide American Alligator Eye E85 American lobster Drill bit Casting Lake Potato
