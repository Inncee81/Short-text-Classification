my pond fish are eating ants that fall in is that healthy if you have goldfish and or koi it's not a problem at all both of those types of fish are omnivirious that means they eat plants and animals i have a pond with koi and goldfish the koi actively hunt insects and the bigger koi the inchers eat anything that land during the day i've seen them eat ants japanese beetles a favorite mosquitos mosquito larvae anything that lands on the water is fair game though i haven't seen them eat a hornet or wasp yet we've had a drought around here and i see hornets and wasps land on the edge rocks and plants all the time to take a drink i imagine if they do grab a hornet they'd get stung before they would be able to crush it with their chewing plates remember koi and goldfish both have bony type plates further down their gullets that they use to break down pellets and bugs that's why when they eat pellets you'll see them gobble some then take a break below while they stand still making chewing motions i have cannas around my pond and japanese beetles love to eat them each afternoon i'll go out and catch the japanese beetles and throw them hard at the water so they can't fly off the koi will fight over them at night i have lights around the pond the low voltage kind and also the low voltage spotlights i've gone out quietly and i've spotted the koi and only the koi swimming skimming the surface actively hunting the surface for any bugs that land on the water so don't worry about ants your fish are meant to eat bugs it's adds protein to their diet it's also gives them fun the fun of the chase good luck with your pond you can see some photos of mine on my site http yahoo com kenrnoto ken Goldfish Beetle Koi Mosquito Insect Biological pest control Spider Poker jargon Animal Crossing Water garden Hornet Happy Tree Friends Gypsy moth Garfield Fauna of Australia Bee Pikmin Camp Lazlo Aerial (dance move) Frog Ant Shrimp farm Domestic rabbit Wasp Evidence of evolution Fish farming Shaggy dog story Sewage treatment Coconut crab USS Wasp (CV-18) USS Thresher (SS-200) Tooth USS Yorktown (CV-5) Carnivorous plant Diving Paper wasp USS Wasp (CV-7) Dairy Magikarp The Fairly OddParents Game show STS-59 Animal Veganism Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography Conker's Bad Fur Day Pok__mon types Humphrey Bogart Vegetarianism Discus (fish) Taboo food and drink Honeybee USS Enterprise (CV-6) Wrigley Field Gar The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time weapons and items Hamster USS Tunny (SS-282) Naval mine USS Wahoo (SS-238) Timon and Pumbaa Shadow Warrior Fancy rat Diseases of the honeybee Asian tiger mosquito Pond Parachuting Ecology USS Washington (BB-56) World Series Japanese tea ceremony RuneScape economy Ramen Battle of the Philippine Sea Caterpillar Bladderwort Acorn Jellyfish Hematophagy Roman eating and drinking Ecco the Dolphin USS Anderson (DD-411) Carp Chopsticks Ladybird Tea Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an FLCL GunZ The Duel
