i have live plants in my gallon tank with goldfish is it essential to have a light i have fantail goldfish and rather large plants in my tank i would like to maintain my plants as best as possible do i have to get a light for my fish the fish don't require a light over their tank as long as they have enough light in the room to distinguish between day and night but plants can't survive without one the plants need to make their food by way of photosynthesis which is a light dependent reaction if you don't provide adequate lighting the plants will die and foul the water if you don't want to provide a light it may be better to use plastic or silk plants than live ones also be aware that goldfish will eat the leaves of some aquatic plants or they'll uproot them as the search through the gravel for food if you want live plants i would suggest using java fern java moss or anubias as these don't seem to be something most fish care for and these have lower lighting requirements so a standard aquarium light will be bright enough for them to grow Goldfish Houseplant Carnivorous plant Photosynthesis Plant Tilapia Sewage treatment Leaf Solar power Biodiesel Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Marine aquarium Ecology Kissing gourami Autonomous building Hydrogen economy Discus (fish) Moss Japanese tea ceremony Carbon dioxide Fish Hydroponics Koi Fishing Fish farming Clownfish El-Fish Brewery Tetrapod Veganism Biodiversity Fern Iowa class battleship Hamster Neutrino Gar Embryophyte Aquatic plant Nuclear power Bottlenose Dolphin E85 Simone Weil USS Yorktown (CV-5) Vegetarianism Nutrient Cannabis cultivation Salmon Energy development Agriculture Clown loach Thermal power station Water garden Dwarf gourami Shrimp farm Epiphyte Capercaillie Stoma Town gas Eutrophication Bonsai Axolotl Botany Sugar beet Cyanide Airport Solar panel Light-emitting diode Flowering plant Light pollution Nuclear reactor Chlorophyll Bamboo Sunlight Dairy Angling Fossil fuel power plant Tofu Tank Sorghum Irrigation Algae Antarctic krill Renewable energy Gas metal arc welding Halfbeak Gasoline Banana Chicken Chlorophyta Animal Swimming pool Coffee Vitamin C Filling station Bladderwort Gypsy moth 2003 North America blackout
