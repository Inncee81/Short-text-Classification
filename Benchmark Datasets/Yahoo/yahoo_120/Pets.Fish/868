bass in an aquarium i have two convict cichlids in a gallon aquarium they are a mating pair and have laid the eggs i have another gallon in the basement with nothing but neons in it i was wondering if i could catch a few small bass from a lake and put them in the gallon in my basement to eat the convict fry i know my neons will be eaten and i'm fine with this thanks im actually pretty good at keeping perfect conditions so i dont think that would be a problem i have raised bass before i would suggest you go for a smaller species than a bass a bass will quite quickly out grow that tank try a bream or crappie or for a tropical species a two spot pike cichlids would be perfect mm Tilapia Cichlid Live-bearing aquarium fish Aquarium Marine aquarium Freshwater angelfish Goldfish Clownfish Sea-Monkey Salmon Jack Dempsey (fish) Beetle Lake Tanganyika Oscar (fish) Krill Chicken Autonomous building Egg (food) Crayfish Octopus Halfbeak Fish Egg (biology) Penguin Orca Brackish water Fish farming Lake Malawi Danio Bird Albatross Walleye Antarctic krill Coral reef Angling Shark Mantis shrimp Grunion Jellyfish Gar Reef tank Georgia Aquarium New England Aquarium Atlanta metropolitan area Vancouver Aquarium Marine Science Centre Earthworm Tarantula Goby Zebra Danio Ant Shedd Aquarium Spider Perciformes Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) E85 Fishing Killifish Dwarf gourami Panama Canal Snake Bottlenose Dolphin Stingray Bee Neon tetra Crappie White Cloud Mountain Minnow Hamster Texas Ranger Division Billboard (advertising) Brewery Beluga Lake Texoma Fly fishing Nile crocodile Elephant Aphid Gray Wolf Mnemonic Gypsy moth Microeconomics Anopheles Seahorse Domestic rabbit Marine angelfish Emu Great Lakes Aztec Esox Lake District Kakapo Mushroom hunting Hornet Rose Shrimp farm Chopsticks Zambezi Whale shark
