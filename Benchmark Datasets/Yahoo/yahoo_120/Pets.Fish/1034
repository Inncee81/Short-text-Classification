help betta fish problem earlier on i thought my betta had swim bladder disorder i treated him and he became one happy little fish i started feeding him bloodworms only for two days he then later starts acting like he used to i just figured it was swim bladder again because it looked like his stomach was bloated and he wouldn't eat i just went to look at him and he is really pale it almost looks like his scales are out a bit and he's breathing really hard he almost looks near death but i'm not sure what it could be so i don't know if i should have hope help what is it what can i do if his scales are raised then it's dropsy i'm so sorry dropsy is an awful disease and very hard to treat the epsom salt bath that another person posted about might help but more than likely not there are lots of medications that claim to treat dropsy but don't waste your money they don't work the only thing i ever heard of working was one time someone tried the epsom salt bath at the very very first signs and it seemed to help so try that keep his water clean and keep him comfortable if he seems to be suffering then you may consider euthenizing him Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Shark Drowning Stomach cancer First aid Theory of conduct Stroke Charles Darwin's illness Fecal incontinence Anxiety Traumatic brain injury Gastroparesis Gas bladder Diving Cancer Anorexia nervosa Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hyperthermia Guinea pig Fugu Asthma Vampire Rocky Mountain spotted fever Hamster Bipolar disorder Sauna Sea-Monkey Little Britain Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kashrut Fish farming Fishing Prostate cancer Creatures in Bionicle 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story Terri Schiavo Happy Tree Friends Bloat Social rule Urinary system Autism Tetrapod Kurt Cobain Hypertension Magnesium sulfate Omega-3 fatty acid Salmon Dietary fiber Escherichia coli O157:H7 Urine Obsessive-compulsive disorder Chronic fatigue syndrome Time Out of Mind Tuberculosis Hearing impairment Myxobolus cerebralis Pneumonia Insomnia Garfield Multiple sclerosis Factory farming Paget's disease of bone Dwarf gourami Alcoholism Snake Decompression sickness Breastfeeding Iridology Kosher foods Kidney Utilitarianism Urea Hydrochloric acid Livestock Cat Fasting Sewage treatment Human physiology Hard water Bearberry Hypoglycemia Garlic Menstrual cup Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder The Wall Dehydration Aquaculture Bulimia nervosa Health insurance Triage Mental illness Death Folic acid Carnivorous plant Water Hydrotherapy Hookworm
