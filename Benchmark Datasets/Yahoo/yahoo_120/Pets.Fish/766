is it possible to make my freshwater tank into a saltwater tank i want to make my freshwater tank into a salt water tank it is only gallons but i want to get like clown fish and fish like that i always take very good care of my tank and fish i have some freshwater fish but i will wait till' they die off i know that sounds mean but they will die eventually i really want this to happen would i need to buy a new tank and filter i want to use the one i have now it would be possible to convert your tank to saltwater although a gallon is a little small you would be able to keep a pair of clownfish if these were ocellaris clowns the nemo type as they only get around inches although other species that grow to inches would be too large generally the larger you go in saltwater the better since the fish are less tolerant of changes to their environment poor water quality and overcrowding the fish tend to be more aggressive territorial and most grow to a larger size than typical freshwater community fish so this generally means much lighter stocking rates for saltwater if your tank is a regular tall that would be okay for the clowns if it's a long you might be able to keep another fish as well i would recommend something very different than a clown for a third fish because their territorial aggressive nature doesn't allow them to mix with fish with similar colors or body shapes or members of the same family this applys to most marine species so for most groups this means only one fish per type tangs triggers wrasses etc in the tank there are a few species that can be kept as mated pairs clownfish cardinalfish and even fewer that can be kept as a school if you want to try a third fish a good place to start your research is with the types of fish you want and check their compatibility aggressive vs peaceful adult sizes activity levels minimum tank sizes and whether or not they would be reef safe then figure the tank size you'll need to keep them then you can plan the rest of the tank and equipment from there there's no reason you can't use the equipment you already have either this will save you some of the expense in setting up the tank for most items there is no freshwater or saltwater versions you just want to make sure what you have is appropriate for your tank size if you have a stand for the tank you might need to protect it if it's anything other than solid wood the particleboard stands won't hold up if they get wet and the glue separates and the iron metal stands will corrode if any salt gets on them or you could get a metal stand just use a flannel backed tablecloth under the tank to protect the stand from splashed water saltwater is expensive enough that you don't want the entire system crashing to the floor some night some of the other items you'll need filter you want one that's properly sized filters x x the tank volume per hour check the gallons per hour rating if you want to get a new one or upgrade there are lots of choices and what you'll need will really depend on budget what you're trying to keep and personal preference i'd consider the best type to be a refugium or wet dry trickle filter but this would be overkill for a gallon tank next best would be a canister followed by a biowheel then a standard hang on tank unless you're using a fine sand or oolite substrate you can also use an undergravel filter to supplement filtration but i'd suggest powering it with a reversible powerhead to blow the water up through the substrate prevents stuff from building up under the filter and clogging it powerhead s to provide more water circulation in hard to get to places this also helps circulate dissolved oxygen to the bottom of the tank having depending on their sizes should be enough for your tank heaters for a saltwater tank i'd suggest getting and putting one on each end if you get a tank that's more than gallons you might even want to do this if what you have is a long this will provide more even heating and your tank has a back up if one heater gives out figure the correct size as watts per gallon divided by heaters if you need to heat the water more than degrees above the room temperature go one size higher lighting if you never want anything but fish you can use the standard lighting and hood made for your tank you might want to upgrade the lamps to a k tube or a actinic if you're going to try corals anemones etc go with a compact fluorescent metal halide or combo system these will provide more intense light that they'll need for photosynthesis substrate you want something made of aragonite to help keep the ph from changing i like the smaller shell material that carib sea puts out it doesn't have to be live sand either some folks like crushed coral but the particle size is bigger than i like and it tends to have a lot of dust that never rinses completely out another very fine grained material is oolitic aragonite looks like small white balls and aragonite sand here's an idea of the materials available http www caribsea com pages products dry aragonite html while it's possible to keep a marine tank with regular aquarium gravel or no substrate the aragonite will keep the ph from falling below it should be salt mix if you're only keeping fish you can go with one of the less expensive brands of synthetic sea salt if you get any invertebrates shrimp snails crabs corals anemones etc switch to a better quality mix before you add them these cost a little more but you won't need to be using additives for the trace elements they need either hydrometer this measures the amount of salt that's dissolved inwater there are two kinds you can get one made of glass that floats on the surface more accurate but easy to break and a plastic container that has a needle that rises and falls as the amount of salt changes less accurate bubbles attaching to the needle gives false readings for fish only you want the specific gravity to read if you're keeping inverts you want it to be water testing kit minimum of ph ammonia nitrite nitrate cleaning supplies elbow length gloves gravel vacuum gallon bucket large plastic container and powerhead for mixing the salt to be done well ahead of water changes algae scraper razor blades for coraline algae and diatoms that like to attach to the glass water conditioner for removing chlorine or chloramine from your tap water unless you plan to use a reverse osmosis filter or buy ro water which is preferred for a reef tank the following are optional but strongly suggested protein skimmer this removes dissloved and small organic materials that would normally contribute to the ammonia nitrite and nitrate in your tank not necessary for fish only tanks but will be handy if you have inverts to keep up good water quality by removing organic materials that become nutrients for algae glass cover this reduces evaporation and keeps the fish inside the tank some are jumpers although with a metal halide lighting system it can overheat your tank live rock this give the tank a more natural appearance provides hiding places for the fish and inverts and increases the biological filtration not to mention you get all kinds of cool critters that hitchhike into your tank shrimp snails sea urchins sea cucumbers sea stars etc chiller if you use metal halide lighting or the water temperature regularly gets above o for corals or anemones fish can take a little more heat you may need to invest in a chiller to keep the tank cool the water temperature should run of there may be additional items that you could need such as kalkwasser to raise your ph if you can't get it to but you won't know these until you get the tank set up and running and test your water before going out and buying all this i would suggest some reading to see what you're getting into by keeping saltwater since you still have existing fish this will give you time to to read up on saltwater in smaller doses i did research for almost years before i set up my first tank and i had about years of freshwater aquarium experience already rushing into a saltwater setup usually doesn't give you good results and the equipment and fish are a little too expensive to be finding out in a few weeks you got something that's not appropriate for what you want for your tank i'd also recommend a good reference book for some research either of these would be a good one to start with the new marine aquarium by michael s paletta microcosm ltd isbn or the conscientious marine aquarist by robert m fenner microcosm ltd isbn here are some websites that can also get you started http www wetwebmedia com marsetupez htm http www peteducation com index cfm cls http www wetwebmedia com
