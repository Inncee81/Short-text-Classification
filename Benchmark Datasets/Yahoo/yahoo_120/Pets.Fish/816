returning goldfish my goldfish are getting too big for my gallon tank i was just wondering if anyone knew if petco or petsmart would take them even though i've had them for over a year i am glad you are getting the poor things out of that tank i love letting them get big in a bigger tank but many pet stores will take them back and resell them local non chain stores do for sure and they are likely to give them a better home good luck Goldfish PETCO Park Cosmo and Wanda Mr. and Mrs. Turner Samuel Goldwyn Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Cruising (maritime) Big-box store Garfield Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) Sin City The Jazz Singer Eaton's Jennifer Lopez Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 The Perishers Neopets P-47 Thunderbolt Sears Holdings Corporation Grandview, U.S.A.
