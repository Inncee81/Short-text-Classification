i have live plants and a red clawed crab the crap apparently enjoys pruning because he is always clipping the leaves off of the plants near the base and sometimes right through the stem is there any tricks to preventing this if i put a straw around the bottom part of the plant so he couldnt get to the stem would that hurt the plant crabs can be strong so he might be able to cut through that straw like nothing you can try putting rocks around the plant that you think would be hard for him to reach or climb over its that or remove the plants hope this helps wt Pruning fruit trees Glossary of climbing terms Leaf Bamboo Coconut crab Grafting Professional wrestling holds Pruning Wisteria Tobacco Hemp Queen (band) Apical dominance Bong Bonsai Combine harvester Hamster Plant Hop (plant) Malus Hydrangea Xiaolin Showdown Vine Creatures in Bionicle Apple Olive Auxin Black pepper Nico Robin Cannabis cultivation Rose Plum Weed control Arthropod Mattress Tea Madder Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Professional wrestling throws Netsuke Crab Craps Cocaine Aloe Fruit tree propagation Comfrey Oat Bladderwort Aerial (dance move) Bob and George Climbing Ivy Geodesic dome Wheat Fireblight Jute Mango Marillion Crab louse Knife Yerba mate Drill bit Computer chess Evidence of evolution Desert Beer Rooibos Shrub Eric Cartman Hashish Kudzu Alfalfa Red Rock Canyon Porgy and Bess Mosquito Dungeness crab Hay Vegetative reproduction Tomato Porcelain crab One Piece minor characters Coffee Hat Plant stem Beet The Legend of Zelda series races Fecal incontinence Compost Cuscuta Flax Sugar beet Japanese tea ceremony The Dalek Invasion of Earth Sorghum 1957 World Series Hyssop Winx Club
