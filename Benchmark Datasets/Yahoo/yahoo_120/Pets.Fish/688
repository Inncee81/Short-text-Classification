how does a protein skimmer work and do i need one for my gallon saltwater aquarium in my opinion you do need a protein skimmer in theory a skimmer actually removes waste products by placing them in a collection cup tiny bubbles that are produced in an a air water interface ie a small pump is the foundation of a skimmer waste molecules are atttracted to these tiny bubbles which float up into a cup thus it actually removes waste from your tank also with a bigger tank you should not have to perform more water changes small tank more water chemistry problems than a larger tank i have a gallon tank and do not have a skimmer on it Aquarium Marine aquarium Brewery Reef tank Sea-Monkey Sewage treatment Dairy Autonomous building Carbon dioxide Seabird Blood Alcohol fuel P-47 Thunderbolt Fish farming Cell (biology) Hydrogen economy E85 Water (molecule) Sonoluminescence Biochemistry Carburetor Mitochondrion Rebreather Goldfish Bong Soap bubble Fire extinguisher Fossil fuel power plant Biodiesel Dry cleaning Shrimp farm Chemistry Gas turbine Gasoline Mass spectrometry Dwarf gourami Sugar beet Septic tank Hydrochloric acid Flush toilet Tilapia Technetium Fire fighting Oil platform Automobile emissions control Energy development Photosynthesis Sake Cold fusion Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Renewable energy Origin of life Naval mine Hydrogen chloride Carnivorous plant Chromatography Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Thermal depolymerization Hydrogen bond Hydroponics Siphon Milk Champagne (beverage) Swimming pool Cracking (chemistry) B-47 Stratojet Landfill Red blood cell Acetic acid Francis Crick Pebble bed reactor Protein Hard water Hanford Site Natural gas Intravenous therapy F-16 Fighting Falcon Tank Alternative biochemistry Wine making Thermal power station Cheese Nephron Liquid crystal Nuclear power Life Clownfish Tank truck Cavitation Glossary of firefighting terms Iron Vickers Valiant Menstrual cup Multiverse Plastic Ecology Light-dependent reaction Pump Kidney
