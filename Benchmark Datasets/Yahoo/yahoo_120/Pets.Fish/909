i'm a new betta owner and i don't think i'm doing too well please help i got a betta two days ago the first day i put him in a vase the next day i found out that the vase was less than one gallon and that i needed to feed him not just put a pellet in and let it sit the water was gross from the pellet so i changed his water today i got him a gallon tank i put the filter it came with in but it was visibly moving the water and he kept getting stuck behind it and i think it made him stuggle to swim the water is conditioned but i haven't tested the levels yet there are three small plants in the bottom but the walls are covered in bubbles is this normal whenever i put the water in the tank it did this and where i have scraped off the bubbles they are gone but everywhere else they're still there now he's floating not upside down head up but he won't move unless i disturb him i think he might be sick or really stressed his eyes don't look quite as clear and his fins aren't quite as full any suggestions or comments he's not moving his tiny fins right by his face hardly is that bad too this morning he looked happy he ate pellets in less than a minute i just put a pellet in and he ignored it he has no reaction time like i got him two days ago and usually wouldn't let me near him but i brushed him with my hand removing the pellet then he pointed downward and just drifted down until i disturbed him and then he quickly swam to the top i don't think he's going to make it he is acting really wierd and is not swimming at all i did take the filter out though i turned off his overhead light maybe he was getting too hot i just hate the way he keeps swimming up and then drifting down he looks pale and his fins keep looking worse well i don't know what others might tell you but i had a gallon tank with a very flowing filter and a light and a very agressive beta and he loved the tank to the point that when i moved him to a slightly smaller unlit and bubbleless tank to make room for baby mollies he litterally starved himself to death beta seem pale when not doing good and they often just sit still i fed mine regualr tetratropical fish flakes and he loved them and when i was trying other foods like pellets and tetrabetta i noted that his color was duller than on the tropic food rip socortease Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Sea-Monkey Brewery Bong E85 Thermal power station Carbon dioxide Marine aquarium Goldfish 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Professional wrestling throws Fish farming Swimming pool Domestic rabbit Fusion power Shaggy dog story Aquarium Discus (fish) Dwarf gourami Ecco the Dolphin Pikmin Dog Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Iron Dairy Autonomous building Fire fighting Shark Seabird Glacier Sewage treatment Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Axolotl Bottlenose Dolphin Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Antarctic krill Bubble Bobble Traffic light GunBound Diving suit Fossil fuel power plant Bladderwort SS Andrea Doria Frogman Fin Whale P-47 Thunderbolt Carnivorous plant Electrophysiology Cliff Richard Stingray Combine (Half-Life 2) MS-06 Zaku II RuneScape quests Sento Sin City Motor oil Apollo 8 Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Backstroke Internal ballistics Shotgun Naval mine Breaststroke Krill Textile manufacturing Whale Orca Guinea pig Paul Is Dead Little Britain Sonoluminescence Suplex Extraterrestrial skies Poker jargon Drowning USS Yorktown (CV-5) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Elephant Pebble bed reactor Lake Conker's Bad Fur Day Aerial (dance move) Tilapia The Legend of Zelda series enemies Rum USS Tunny (SS-282) Hamster Pac-Man The Legend of Zelda series races Solar power
