should you do water changes in general pond maintenance i am used to keeping fish tanks yes you should especially for smaller ponds the pond plants if you have them may remove some of the nitrate it's a plant fertilizer but when their leaves die it also produces wastes and the same for fish they eat and produce wastes as well good pond maintenance will lower the potential for algae along with using floating plants like water lettuce and water hyacinth and floating leaved plants like water lilies to create shade just as you would turn off aquarium lights doing water changes with tap water may also add back some calcium magnesium sodium and other minerals used by the organisms in the pond although how much will depend on the degree to which your water has been softened just remember to add a dechlorinator as you would in an aquarium if you have fish or inverts Sewage treatment Aquarium Hard water Fish farming Reef tank Soil pH Nuclear power Carnivorous plant Ecology Chlorophyta Autonomous building Sodium chloride Koi Cyanide Desert Hydroponics Dead Sea Water purification Dishwasher Photosynthesis Coral reef Irrigation Sodium carbonate Hydrogen economy Goldfish Water garden Sea-Monkey Carbon dioxide Tilapia Terraforming Fertilizer Tofu Casting Lake Shrimp farm Illegal drug trade Wind turbine Acorn Eutrophication Milk Sulfur Arable land Pond Transformer Nutrition Power station Solar power Thermal power station Caliche Biogeochemical cycle Crayfish Biodiesel Sugar beet Electric motor Discus (fish) Nuclear reactor Algae Incineration Veganism Renewable energy Dairy Fossil fuel power plant Aquatic plant Polychlorinated biphenyl Fugu Ammonia Pebble bed reactor Jellyfish Lighting Brewery Zebra Danio Aluminium Hemp Gardening Environmental concerns with electricity generation Hydrochloric acid Bacteria Ion exchange resin High-voltage direct current Halfbeak Thermal depolymerization Rebreather Fish Aquaculture Textile manufacturing Salt Industrial wastewater treatment Cannabis cultivation Fire fighting Fishing Acetic acid Lemnaceae Leaf Sodium Energy development
