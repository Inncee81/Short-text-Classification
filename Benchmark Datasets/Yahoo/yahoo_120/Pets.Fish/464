should i give up on my betta fish i've had a double tail betta for months now and since day i've been struggling to get rid of what i think is a swim bladder disorder his abdomen is swollen and has problems staying balanced i've tried feeding him less even used an antibiotic called kanaplex i change his water weekly and put acquarium salt in his tank this has been going on for the months i've had him i suspected he might have had an internal parasite since he darts around a lot and tries to scratch his gills a lot so i tried treating him for ick i'm not sure since i don't see anything on him but he's has not gotten better and recently is getting much worse just the other day i saw that his fins were extremely torn up and shredded half his lower tail is gone there's nothing plastic or sharp in the tank that could've done this his gills are even having a hard time closing and he's gotten much more lethargic he hardly moves much anymore should i just give up and euthanize him don't euthanize the fish your first mistake was treating the fish when you didn't know what it had medications are very hard on fish so all the treatment has probably made him worse what do you keep him in for best health you should have in him a tank that's at least gallons and has a small filter and heater keep the water temp around f to f giving him perfect conditions will help strengthen him enough to help him get over whatever he has two things to try for the next few days epsom salt bath mix one tbsp of epsom salt with a gallon of water put the betta in for up to mins do this tomorrow as well fasting don't feed your betta today or tomorrow laxatives after tomorrow give your betta a pea frozen works best soak the pea in hot water until room temp then remove the skin and feed bite sized pieces of the pea to your betta use a toothpick is needed if you don't see improvement in a few days email me for farther help Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fancy rat Shrimp farm Marine aquarium Thermal power station Electrophysiology Hamster Chronic fatigue syndrome Psoriasis Shark Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Aquarium Coffee Fish farming Prostate cancer Tetrapod Traumatic brain injury Breastfeeding Brewery Myxobolus cerebralis Multiple sclerosis Hyperthermia Dairy Diseases of the honeybee Tofu Diarrhea Sea-Monkey Swimming pool E85 Fire fighting Procrastination P-38 Lightning Equine conformation Menstrual cup Fugu Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chicken Bladderwort Intersex surgery Acne First aid Asthma Krill Dialysis Gastroparesis Gramophone record Allergy Bipolar disorder Autonomous building Cantonese cuisine Aerial (dance move) Water purification Folic acid Drowning Extreme Programming Cuisine of Denmark Pneumonia Radiation therapy RuneScape quests B-47 Stratojet Pea Temperature P-47 Thunderbolt Corrosion Leather Gar Spider Axolotl Piccolo Junior Saga Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Terminal ballistics Cruising (maritime) Cat Magnesium sulfate Internal ballistics Solar power Common cold Hydrogen economy Unreal Theory of conduct Anorexia nervosa Carnivorous plant Stingray Childbirth Atlantic herring Milk
