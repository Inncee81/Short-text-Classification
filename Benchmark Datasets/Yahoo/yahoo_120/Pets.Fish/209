what type of fish i can have in my fresh water pond it all depends on your size personally i have a gallon pond with inch long goldfish in it it will soon contain almost gallons i'm playing with the measurements right now and more goldies it's entirely indoor will have a small waterfall and will be planted with low light hardy plants goldies typically end up taking about gallons each when they reach the foot long stage so guessing that the other two will be a foot long gallons is a minimum on the high end of the scale for all five fish and if the other two don't survive at least the three originals have an absolutely beautiful massive place to live in Goldfish Aquarium Fish farming Fossil fuel power plant Koi English unit Tilapia Water garden Shrimp farm Japanese tea ceremony Panama Canal Volume Power station Marine aquarium Biodiesel Gallon Lake Swimming pool Ecology Pond Fuel efficiency Thermal power station Sewage treatment Potomac River Smelt Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Ton Houseplant Water (molecule) Carnivorous plant Imperial unit E85 Fire extinguisher Ocean thermal energy conversion Bladderwort Softball Murray River U.S. customary units Dairy Illegal drug trade Alcohol fuel Drill bit Homebrewing Ship model Gasoline Hydrogen economy Gardening Lighting Volleyball Inertial confinement fusion Town gas Density Autonomous building Eyepiece Metrified English unit Stairway Windsurfing Transformer Pansy River Mattress Pachypodium baronii Nuclear power Chatsworth House Barrel (storage) Economy of Algeria Irrigation Hydroponics Largest organism Parallax Aquifer Iowa class battleship Goldeen Yacht Antenna (radio) Concrete Cannabis cultivation Hamster Milk Orlando, Florida Murray Cod Temperature Metrication in Canada Cross-country skiing Shotgun Carbon dioxide Tide Explosive material Iceland Maui Lacrosse Dog agility Sea ice Optical fiber Solar power Bong Thermoregulation Garden Firework
