i just got a fish tank i dont have the gravel or anything yet but i have the tank and filter and hood i want to start the cycling process now should i only fill it like of the way and do i have to turn the filter on for this to work if i want to put gravel from another tank can i wash it off first and how much do i need per gallon i can get some from petsmart where i work this is going to be freshwater probubly with some electric yellow cichlids or some other small africans ok when i say im going to add gravel i mean for cycling not for the whole bottom i dont know fish i dont do that at work cycling with fish is slower and less efficient than cycling without them the only reason you need the fish is for the ammonia they produce with their wastes a perfectly good alternative is household ammonia as long as it's pure no fragrance or surfactant as a nice bonus the household ammonia doesn't suffer permanent painful gill damage from the cycling process what you do to really simplify it is start with a full tank and running filter pour some ammonia in the amount depends on the size of the tank but it's probably anywhere from a couple of spoonfuls to a cup adding some used gravel from an established healthy tank will kickstart the cycle by introducing some of the bacteria you need so they just have to multiply and spread rather than grow from scratch use a couple of big handfuls stored in a nylon stocking which the bacteria can easily travel through but is also easy to reach in and pull out when you're done start testing your water regularly like every other day or so with ammonia and nitrite kits you don't need the expensive master kit partway in you'll have to start feeding the growing bacteria colony spoonfuls of ammonia and testing for nitrates when you have zero ammonia zero nitrites and slowly rising nitrates your tank is cycled for specific numbers and directions check out this article http www aquahobby com articles e fishless php the forum at that website is full of friendly experienced people who will talk you through the process if you ask for help good luck and enjoy your tank Marine aquarium Ammonia Fish farming Dairy Dry cleaning Hydrogen economy Eutrophication Biodiesel E85 Sea-Monkey Autonomous building Biogeochemical cycle Internal ballistics Brewery Sake Fossil fuel power plant Menstrual cup Thermal power station Nuclear power Tilapia Electric motor Water Energy development Textile manufacturing Soil pH Fire fighting Carnivorous plant Casting GunBound Tlingit Microeconomics Menstrual cycle Nitrogen Tank CPU cache Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Billiards Plastic Hydrogen sulfide Bong Illegal drug trade Polymerase chain reaction Fusion power Ammonium nitrate Sun Sugar Transformer Diesel engine Galactic Civilizations Radio controlled airplane Compiler optimization Glacier Fugu Bicycle Refrigerator Hash table Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Foodborne illness Hydrogen vehicle CPU design Domestic rabbit Water (molecule) Water purification Drag racing Town gas Supply and demand Vermicompost Ocean thermal energy conversion Circuit design Nutrient Poker jargon Soil life Anchor Fishing Hard disk Biochemistry Neopets Quicksort Jet engine Hybrid vehicle Items in the Metroid series Milk Cruising (maritime) PHP Saturn V Explosive material
