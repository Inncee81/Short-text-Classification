hermit crabs as classroom pets i am considering getting some hermit crabs for my classroom this year i have visited hermit crabs com and read up on the care and everything but all of that is geared toward someone having them at home my question is what about the weekends will they generally be all right over a day weekend i would bring them home if it was an extended weekend but i'm hoping not to have to do that every weekend as i have a big glass tank and also it sounds like it would stress them out to be moved that often advice also about bathing the site i looked at recommended a bath once a week for those of you who have successfully kept hermit crabs kept them alive for their natural life spans how often do you bathe them thanks i want to make sure i do this right hermit crabs do not carry diseases please only answer if you actually keep some hermit crabs would be a great class room pet but they don't like loud noises and can get stressed easily what are the ages that you teach how many students are there in your classroom if you think that your students won't be loud and won't disturb the hermit crabs while they are sleeping during the day then they should be fine but if you think that will be loud and such then i would recommend that you don't get a hermit crab if you decide that you want a hermit crab or two in your class room then here are your answers to your questions weekends you are right taking a hermit crab home for only two days and moving them will be very stressful on a hermit crab they will be fine in the classroom as long as they have enough food and water some pet stores and even online pet stores sell water pillows made just for hermit crabs i would recommend that you get these for over the weekend here is the link http www petco com product esu reptile hermit crab water pillows aspx also www petco com has some good food packages for hermit crabs they are blocks filled with food that way you will know that the hermit crabs have enough food for the weekend here is the link http www petco com product hbh hermit crab vacation food aspx i would recommend that you don't feed the hermit crabs fruits or veggies over the weekend since they can get very stinky when you get back but feeding the hermit crabs fruits and veggies during the days that you are at the school would be great bathing bathing a hermit crab once a week is great but also putting a dish like the link below and filling it with distilled water or the second link below then putting the dish in the hermit crab tank is great it allows the hermit crabs to bathe themselves whenever they want also if they are running low on water they can drink from the dish too make sure though that you clean out the dish everyday and replace it water here are the links dish http www petco com product kritterz reptile fossil food and water dish aspx hermit crab water http www petco com product saltwater glub for hermit crabs aspx also make sure that you spray the hermit crabs down with some water the distilled water or the hermit crab water is good to put in the sprayer here is a good sprayer to get http www petco com product t rex crab island mr mister water sprayer aspx also make sure that you spray the corners of the hermit crab tank everyday that way when the hermit crabs molt they will have enough moisture spray the tank once a day hermit crabs are really fun pets to have but i would recommend that read up on them some more there are a few good hermit crabs out there that you should read here are a few http www petco com product hermit crabs for dummies aspx http www amazon com hermit crabs complete owners manual dp ref pd bbs sr ie utf s books qid sr http www amazon com quick easy hermit crab publications dp ref sr ie utf s books qid sr i highly recommend the last book i have that one and i love it thank you for taking this answer and good luck future vet Coconut crab Hamster Domestic rabbit Garfield Upholstery Friends Cheese Chicken Thermal power station Apple Tofu Marine aquarium Mattress Mosquito Customs and etiquette of Japan Shaggy dog story Minor Harry Potter Beasts Pet skunk Plastic Urinary incontinence Tung Chung Guinea pig Kosher foods Hermit crab Cat Rule of St Benedict Sin City Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Discus (fish) Cruising (maritime) Professional wrestling match types Migraine GED Japanese tea ceremony Carnegie Mellon University Fahrenheit 9/11 HyperText Transfer Protocol Shrimp farm Professional wrestling holds Water Fancy rat Brewery Creatures in Bionicle Tooth A Course In Miracles Avenue Q World Wide Web Education in Japan Dog training Commodore 64 Canary Full Metal Panic?
