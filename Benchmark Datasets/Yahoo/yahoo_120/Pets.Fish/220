what kind of fish i have pleco's and a channel cat in my gal tank what would be the biggest most aggressive fish that i could put in there withou it eating any of the other fish and also what is the best fish to put in there that eats the waste the snails do a good job but the channel cat keeps gettin to them and eating them hmm at the moment it seems your tank is pretty close to full for a gallon your looking at about of possible fish you can put in there i'd say throw in a jack dempsey or archocentrus octofasciatus if you want the scientific name they get about at the most and are pretty aggressive it's a very colorful fish and it would do perfect with what you already have in your tank to the dude below i just did alot of the research for him i checked and double checked sites stated the jack dempsy would get no larger than and another stated it would reach it's max at about and my parents used to have one in their aquarium it died just recently and you obviously dont put an oscar or arrowana in a gallon tank those are minimum fish as for the knife fish story the same thing happened to me the store manager assured me that the pachu wouldn't get bigger than but the damn thing sits behind me right now and its getting pretty damn close to yeah the dude below me is right though a good rule is to go to a fish store to buy a fish not to browse for one Discus (fish) Marine aquarium Fugu Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Goldfish Aquarium The Amber Spyglass Hiberno-English Mojave people CPU cache Milton H.
