the other day i noticed that there were thousands of tiny little white worms in one of my aquariums all i have in that aquarium is a red clawed crap and ive been feeding him bottom feeder pellets i think ive been way over feeding him so this might be one reason why there were worms i cleaned the tank very well and there isnt anymore but im worried that maybe they were some weird parasite or something they are very tiney like the biggest were maybe a quarter inch long white but appeared a little brownish in areas where there were alot of them and they clung to the glass and the gravel what could they be these worms are harmless they are from overfeeding and leftover food left at the bottom of the tank and or from not doing partial water changes doing of water change per week x if there is no filter these worms are harmless and can easily be removed from doing water changes and from feeding less after couple water changes they should be all gone and the next time you feed hours remove all the leftovers hope this helps wt Fish farming Marine aquarium American lobster Aquarium Discus (fish) Goldfish Atlantic herring Axolotl Seabird Pet skunk Gar Textile manufacturing Dracunculiasis Guinea pig Clown loach Hamster Dairy Shark Tilapia Krill Brewery Breastfeeding Shrimp farm Chicken Thermal power station Clownfish Filter feeder Salmon Fancy rat Foie gras Bong Vermicompost Sewage treatment Myxobolus cerebralis Diarrhea Animal Dry cleaning Acorn worm Lamprey Annelid Bird migration Koi Reef tank Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Laserdisc Zebra Danio Cochineal Leech Roundworm Capercaillie Kissing gourami Antarctic krill Computer virus Corydoras Pikmin Lionel Corporation Sandworm (Dune) Carbon dioxide GunBound Bladderwort Honey Heartworm Refrigerator Whale shark Ascariasis Bat Mydoom Domesticated turkey Hydroponics Kashrut Hard disk Computer worm Freshwater angelfish Goby Crayfish Fossil fuel power plant Diseases of the honeybee Conspiracy (TNG episode) Brachiopod Lobster Philip J.
