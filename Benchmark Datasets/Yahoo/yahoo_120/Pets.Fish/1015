deaths in my tank i got up this morning to find one of my platys and one of my cardinals dead in the tank both with no signs of illness whatsoever all the other platys and cardinals of each now are fine and my betta seems ok too what could have killed them i was concerned over this weekend because my tank was getting very warm due to the warm weather we had in the uk the temperature got up to about f c could this be what killed the fish i tested my water today and all is fine nitrate is nitrite is and ammonia is the only thing i had noticed with the platy was that she was not growing as large as the other platys and she always had her fins clamped to her body but the cardinal i have no idea why he died i'm doing a partial water change tomorrow is there anything else i should do to ensure the rest of my fish don't suddenly die thanks i've been keeping tropical fish for over years now and i'm afraid this sort of thing happens occasionally and you just have to accept it i once had a shoal of about cardinal tetras die in a few hours but had no problem whatsoever with any of the other tetras in the tank including neon's unless the water became too oxygen deficient lifting the temperature to c shouldn't do any harm water test kits are useful but they are not particularly accurate and without full laboratory facilities it's impossible to test for everything if you've got a filter try cleaning it out use tank water if it's a biological one and by all means change some of the water but try and get the fresh water to something like the temperature in the tank before you add it put a drop of water conditioner in to neutralise the chlorine if you've got any keep an eye on the other fish for a week or so look out particularly for any tiny white spots that appear on them if you see any put some white spot cure in the tank Marine aquarium Sewage treatment Ammonia Aquarium Sea-Monkey Discus (fish) Fish farming Shark Water purification E85 Water Eutrophication Ozone depletion Electrophysiology Fish Dialysis Carburetor Carbon dioxide Ozone hole Cardinal tetra Energy development Betta (Siamese Fighting Fish) Fire fighting Swimming pool Explosive material Ocean thermal energy conversion Global warming and agriculture Hydrogen economy Autonomous building Goldfish Diving suit Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Hyperthermia Food preservation Shrimp farm Corrosion Alternative biochemistry Cetacea Drowning Dry cleaning Carnivorous plant Immortality Ozone Nitric acid Lake Avalanche StarCraft: Uprising White Cloud Mountain Minnow Albedo Fossil fuel power plant Neon tetra USS Tunny (SS-282) Polychlorinated biphenyl Sauna Sterilization (microbiology) Disinfection Marine biology Rebreather STS-50 Global climate model Fugu Diseases of the honeybee Motor oil Bottlenose Dolphin Cloud Helium Acetic acid Tropical cyclone Foodborne illness Dairy Haloalkane Thermoregulation Climate of the United Kingdom P-38 Lightning Hydrogen Weather lore Sonar Mercury Atlas 6 Cryonics Sea level rise Mercury (element) El Ni__o Fishing Hypoglycemia Gas mantle Ecology Chlorine Dead Sea
