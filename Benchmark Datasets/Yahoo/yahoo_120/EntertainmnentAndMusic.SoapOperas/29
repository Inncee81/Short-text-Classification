why does the media always portray men as bumbling idiots think about it almost every tv show or movie you can think of depicts the husband father as incredibly stupid and the wife is the only smart one i havent even seen that many movies or tv shows but i always notice it in almost every movie or show example everybody loves raymond king of queens family guy even childrens shows lizzie mcguire thats so raven etc i cant think of a whole lot right now but how many agree with me do you think that if the media stopped telling everyone that men were stupid and incompetent and started portaying them as smart intelligent and honest that it would make a difference in men in the real world lol bmetjerry some guys are stupid but i think that the media is really most of the problem i know a lot of very intelligent guys and they dont get enough respect apparently you haven't seen the jeffersons honkey in all actuality it's more of a clich then anything else the dad thinks he's the king of his castle and his wife lets him think it all the while controlling things kinda like the rare opportunities when fat people aren't scarfing down everything in sight or republicans not compared to the devil or democrats not compared as tree hugging sissies etc all it is is typecasting people enjoy fitting people into categories and the networks fill that need but i do agree stereotyping leads to people expecting less from themselves and adds to the decline of civilization Humphrey Bogart Married... with Children Joke Recurring South Park characters The Fairly OddParents Family Guy Garfield Ren and Stimpy Theory of conduct Beavis and Butt-head The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Hogan's Heroes LaVeyan Satanism Maid Marian and her Merry Men Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kyle Broflovski Friends Plame affair American Dad!
