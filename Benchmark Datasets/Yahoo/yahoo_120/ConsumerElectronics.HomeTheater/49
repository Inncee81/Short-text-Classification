can someone tell me what a blu ray disc is how is it different from a dvd the difference between a dvd hdvd cd and blue rays are merely technical it is all about the laser and how the information is stored and maybe the material used to make the disk a dvd uses a red laser a blu ray uses a blue laser the blue laser is at least half the size of the red laser meaning that you can stored double the information or more in the same space the difference is like using a crayon and a color pencil you can color a more detail picture with the color pencil because the tip is smaller there might be other difference in the way the information is written to the disk but i'm not sure remember that most of us do not need to know all the details to use the product only people that build the product or products that are going to use the blu ray need to know the exact nature of the beast what the average user need to know are things is that the more information you can squezed into an area the better a picture or movie may look remember that the fact that you saved a picture or movie to a blu ray will not improve it what it will do is that you can put more information in it so the level of detail can be better is like saving a picture in high resolution the higher the resolution the more details you can see especially when you zoom into it the drawback is the size of the file so people compromise by getting a picture that is good enough as opposed to the best quality posible the other thing to know is that devices have to be made to handle this new format you cannot play a blu ray movie or an hdvd on a regular dvd because the device or dvd player was not built for this in mind one final thing to note is price and availability of the product there is a big competition between the blu ray and the hdvd i think the blu ray has more capacity but it is more propietary that is people have to buy the rights to use it from sony so you can buy one or the other but you may end up with useless equipment if the technology you chose did not win in the end Blu-ray Disc DVD Laserdisc Compact disc Floppy disk Digital photography High-definition television Digital rights management Redundant array of independent disks Gramophone record Television Camcorder Laser 8 mm video format MiniDisc DualDisc Handheld game console Mouse (computing) Sega Dreamcast Enterprise content management CPU cache MP3 Movie projector Video codec Color Apple II family Machinima Hard disk IPod GunBound USB flash drive Nintendo 64 Disk image Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Atari 8-bit family PlayStation 3 Copy protection Raster graphics Videocassette recorder NTSC Compact audio cassette Anamorphic widescreen Karaoke Walkman File Allocation Table Gamut ITunes Music Store Video game music Audiophile Volleyball CPU design Windows XP Surveillance JPEG Final Fantasy (video game) CD-R Computer Pixel Warez Digital cinema Windows Vista Modchip PlayStation 2 Virtual memory Amstrad CPC Widescreen Plasma display S-VHS Photography Windows 2000 Ebook DVD-R File sharing Nintendo H.264/MPEG-4 AVC View camera PNG ITunes Digital image editing R-Type TiVo Binary prefix NTFS System 7 (Macintosh) Solarquest Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 Topps Motion picture rating system
