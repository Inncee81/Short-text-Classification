is it possible to clean the inside of a speaker and if so how i think it's called the drum i dunno but there's something sticky on the interior of one of my speakers for a stereo system i have and the affected speaker doesn't work so i put and together and thought that this sticky stuff is preventing the speaker from working i could be wrong and probably am but anyway how can i clean this the speaker won't come apart it's just solid wood no screws or anything something tells me that this isn't possible well i'am a professional sound engineer and am also a cretified speaker repair tech and i've seen it all let me tell you once this guy brought a pair of high end cerwin vega in the repair shop and said they don't sound right and it has a really bad oder when it's played so i hooked it up and yes one of them sounded muddy in the low range and had an oder to it so i took it apart and to all of our amazement there was a dead kitten inside the cabinet lol ok now to answer your question if the speaker smells burnt it is just that and if the sticky stuff is black it is probably that your cross over is burnt out the capasitors have melted probably due to being over driven for long periods of time either by a voltage that is too low or too high meaning that your amp is too little or too big for the speakers and the answer to if you can clean them to get them working again is no once they stop working that's it sorry but if you really like them and you can't get the same model anymore you can always have them reconed and the crossovers rebuilt by a professional in your area if you were in fla i would recomend the speaker exchange on fowler ave in tampa i used to work there a long time ago and they're good at what they do good luck Bass guitar Loudspeaker Extreme Programming Shit Bicycle lighting Non-native pronunciations of English Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Phoebe Buffay's songs Subwoofer Singlish Poker jargon Tris Speaker Tire Social rule Electrophysiology Timpani Homer's Enemy Drag racing Wonderland (McFly album) Theory of conduct Violin Keynesian economics Heinkel He 100 Ruy Lopez Firefighter RuneScape quests Clarinet Electronic amplifier Friends Anchor Car audio Indian English Transformer Supply and demand Cruising (maritime) Piccolo Junior Saga Empire Burlesque Equine conformation Drill bit Magnet Philosophy of language Jet engine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an New Zealand English Economics Wind turbine Operational amplifier Ron and Fez God Emperor of Dune It's All Gone Pete Tong Membrane potential Incandescent light bulb Time Out of Mind Carnegie Mellon University Draw poker Bon Jovi Scientology beliefs and practices Vowel Teen Girl Squad Professional wrestling throws Ra (board game) Toyota Prius Thermal power station Glossary of climbing terms Screw Year of the Spider Good Morning, Vietnam Floppy disk Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Ashlee Simpson Show Big band Rose (Doctor Who) Audiophile Reservoir Dogs Oscilloscope Standard Cantonese Headphones Sound effect Stuttering Seismometer Chopsticks The Inside The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Snooker Speech recognition The Amber Spyglass Telephone exchange Buddy Guy Guitar The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Johnny 5 Naruto jutsu Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Doomtown Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Incarnations of Immortality Carburetor W.
