what might have happened to my audio system my audio system sony receiver speakers and cd player all sat at my grandmother's place for a while till i got moved in and insured now it's output is a little quite and it's running about twice as hot as it used to what might have happened i haven't had a chance to really sit and listen without fans running but so far the clarity still sounds like crystal it seems to just be the volume that's been affected system has been dusted all the connectors were cleaned thoroughly and inspected durring install none looked corroded or anything worse than a little dusty i checked the speaker switch the connectors wires and all the settings i don't think it's a short because i know this system has short detection and will kill the power till it's manually reset volume is digital not analog so there is no pot the knob works like a mouse's scroll wheel it seems to be improving the longer it's running it sat for over months i missed my baby cd player to receiver is digital optical and tried it with the high end rca analog cables same volume video through it via composite and s video are as clear as they ever were if that helps anybody diagnose my problem do you have performance cables if so i think you are noticing a common problem known as breaking in cables especially performance one require a brake in of a few days before they sound ok in my own experience i have found it necessary to hook a system up turn it on for a few day to run in and then come back to alter dsp eq settings etc i have also found settings will vary just letting a system sit idle to long you also say you moved have you calibrated to the new environment also how was the equipment speakers cables stored this will have an effect in performance as well you could also have a power issue are you using a power conditioner let me know details on how you stored the equipment as well as the details about the new environment as well details on the equipment itself this will help to make a proper diagnosis DVD SCART Laserdisc Ethernet IPod Oscilloscope Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Modem Universal Serial Bus Loudspeaker Carburetor Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Television Nintendo Entertainment System Synthesizer Musical Instrument Digital Interface Audiophile Embedded system Xbox Gramophone record RS-232 8 mm video format Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Rail terminology Optical fiber RCA connector Hard disk High-definition television USB flash drive Mixing console Movie projector FireWire Mouse (computing) NTSC Spark plug Lighting Radio Xbox 360 Sound recording Sound Blaster Digital circuit Super Nintendo Entertainment System Compact disc Windows XP Phonograph Camcorder Potentiometer Sega Dreamcast Windows 2000 Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Cable television Atari ST Dimmer Amstrad CPC MP3 Fuel injection Atari 8-bit family Sega Saturn Central processing unit Nintendo GameCube Thermal power station GSM services Poker jargon Circuit design PlayStation Portable D-subminiature Compact audio cassette IBM PC compatible Copy protection Prostate cancer Galileo spacecraft Commodore 128 High-voltage direct current Circuit breaker XLR connector Telephone exchange Vacuum tube S/PDIF Drill bit Fire alarm control panel Digital Visual Interface S-VHS Federal Communications Commission Amiga ITU-T Asthma CPU design AES/EBU Analog-to-digital converter Commodore 64 TGV Broadband Internet access Diablo II
