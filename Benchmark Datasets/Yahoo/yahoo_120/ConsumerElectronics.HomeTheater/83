is there a difference in hdmi cables if there is a difference what are the specs what does the pin vs pin change or improve why i can see cables costing and some costing thank you for your time despite alot of misinformation available on the internet there are significant difference between different hdmi cables when trying to decided between a higher priced cable and a lower priced cable a good rule of thumb is to weigh the value of what you are connecting for example let's say you just spent on a small lcd for a kid's bedroom don't buy the monster m hd cable save your money and get a good quality monster cable m hd instead the reason for this suggestion is because while the m cable will give you superior performance it doesn't make sense to spend this much on a cable for a television that only cost additionally the smaller the display the more difficult it will be to discern the differences between the lower quality cable and the top end cable now let's say you just bought a p display spend the and get the best quality monster cable m hd or other length depending on your needs you will be able to see the differences on the larger higher resolution display the larger the screen size the more obvious these differences will be you will find it will not be worth saving very little money in relation to your total investment on a sub par cable remember as is the case with most all audio video products specs do not determine a systems performance it is the combination of quality high performance components that make the differenct between and okay system and a great system while there are cheap cables out there that will work there are also cheap tires at wal mart for your bmw they may allow your bmw to roll down the street but the performance you paid for in the purchase of your bmw goes out the window without the correct tires don't let you av system suffer the same way at the same time don't waste your money putting bmw tires on a yugo get educated visit the eduction center in the link below to learn more detailed information about the hdmi technology i hope this information is helpful Digital photography Cable television Inflation Television Gross domestic product SCART Laptop PlayStation 3 High-definition television CPU cache Laserdisc Atari 8-bit family IPod Oscilloscope Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Liquid crystal display Loudspeaker Microeconomics FairTax Universal Serial Bus Tax Audiophile Redundant array of independent disks Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Wind turbine IMac High-Definition Multimedia Interface Bluetooth BMW M5 Digital single-lens reflex cameras Light-emitting diode Bond Screenplay Digital television Capitalism Outsourcing NTSC IBM PC compatible Password Stereoscopy High fidelity Sport utility vehicle Deflation (economics) Final Fantasy XI Broadband Internet access Labor theory of value Gas metal arc welding FireWire Embedded system Carburetor Ethernet Mutual fund TFT LCD ATI Technologies Nintendo Entertainment System Windows XP Airbus A380 Modem Supply and demand Plasma display Diesel engine TurboGrafx 16 Solar cell Personal rapid transit Surplus value Graduate school Light rail Professional wrestling slang Poker jargon Digital Subscriber Line Hyperinflation 3dfx Nintendo DS Isetta Home cinema Game Boy Nintendo GameCube BMW Z1 Analog-to-digital converter Keynesian economics Solar power Monopsony Apple Macintosh Supply-side economics Handheld game console PlayStation Portable Xbox Free trade TiVo Galactic Civilizations Radeon Bicycle frame Progressive tax
