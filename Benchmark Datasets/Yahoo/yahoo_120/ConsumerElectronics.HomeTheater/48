how do i connect my ps to my surround sound system there's a couple of different answers to your question based on what kind of sound system you have because the ps has multiple ways of delivering sound i'll cover the most common here and you can choose one that best fits your setup and your configuration preferences the first is hdmi which can carry both a high def video and digital audio signal to do this your receiver needs to have at least a hdmi input and your ps has to be configured in the options settings to send audio and video through the hdmi cable if your tv does not have hdmi but your receiver does or if your receiver has hdmi input but not output then hopefully your receiver has component output which you would then connect to your tv most tvs today have at least component inputs if your receiver does not have hdmi but your tv does and your receiver has a tos link otherwise known as optical audio input then you can connect the hdmi to the tv the optical to your receiver and specify in your configuration settings that you want the hdmi to carry video only and the audio to be on the digital optical output if your receiver has a tos link input and component video inputs outputs then you can connect the ps directly to your receiver using the optical for audio and the component for video then have component out from your receiver to your tv you would want to do this if you have multiple video sources going to your receiver and want to use your receiver as a video selector without having to change the video source on the tv constantly if your tv has digital output at all be it optical coaxial or hdmi and your receiver has a matching input then you can connect the ps to your tv and then connect the audio to your ps be aware however that though the audio may pass through the tv the audio signal may lose the encoding of surround sound if that feature pass through is not supported by your tv DVD SCART Television Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting High-Definition Multimedia Interface Home cinema RCA connector Modem Laserdisc High-definition television Input impedance Transformer Bluetooth Oscilloscope Loudspeaker Impedance matching Digital Visual Interface Operational amplifier Digital Central processing unit Dolby Laboratories Ethernet Original Amiga chipset Nintendo GameCube Enterprise content management Synthesizer Digital audio workstation Electronic amplifier Digital circuit GSM services Xbox 360 Camcorder Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sound Blaster Xbox PlayStation Portable Coaxial cable Analog-to-digital converter Audio level compression Mouse (computing) Phase-locked loop AES/EBU Dolby Digital Universal Serial Bus Musical Instrument Digital Interface Vorbis Circuit design Atari ST Atari 8-bit family NTSC Cable television Asynchronous Transfer Mode PC Engine Satellite television Decibel Computer Nominal impedance Lossless data compression MP3 Video codec Movie projector Audiophile Repeater Transistor Optical fiber Surround sound Digital audio FireWire Jack plug Amstrad CPC Sound card Radio S/PDIF Gramophone record Common Unix Printing System Data compression Federal Standard 1037C ITU-T Blu-ray Disc Super Nintendo Entertainment System Sound reinforcement system IPod Logic gate High-voltage direct current ITunes Bicycle lighting
