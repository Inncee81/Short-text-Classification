why do hd channels on io appear in format my tv has picture options to convert it to but when i do it it will blow the pixels up making it look like an ordinary digital channel so my question is is the aspect ratio on hd channels by design to compress the pixels more or do i have to manually adjust to fit the screen i have a inch i widescreen hdtv it's by default and the ordinary digital channels fit the screen when i fix the aspect ratio of the hd channels it makes it look out of proportion you shouldn't need to adjust your t v the program you are watching most likely was not filmed in hd most channels do not run hd programing along with commercials which are rarely broadcast in hd so that might be what you are seeing i do not know what provider you have but with cox there will be a little hd symbol next to the program name in the little menu bar and i am guessing other providers do this as well also are you using an hd input from the cable box to the tv either component or hdmi that also might be your problem if you still can't figure it out i would call the company and ask them whats up Television Digital television Widescreen Pixel Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting DVD Aspect ratio (image) Digital photography Cable television Anamorphic widescreen ATSC Oscilloscope PlayStation Portable Laserdisc Mouse (computing) 1080p Channel 4 Movie projector MPEG-2 Nintendo DS Digital cinematography Amstrad CPC Digital cinema Xbox 360 Babylon 5 Pan and scan Transformer JPEG Video codec NTSC Digital Visual Interface SCART RGB color model Xbox Dolby Laboratories British Sky Broadcasting Apple IIGS Liquid crystal display Apple typography Enterprise content management 35 mm film DVB AppleScript MTV Loudspeaker High-Definition Multimedia Interface Computer display standard System/34 TiVo AmigaOS Super Nintendo Entertainment System Color Graphics Adapter IPod Digital video recorder Commercial broadcasting Commodore 64 Media in Canada Nintendo GameCube Satellite television BBC ITunes Palm OS MP3 EIA-708 Photography Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Stereoscopy Sound Blaster Video compression Circuit design Jet engine IBM PC compatible Macromedia Flash Screenshot Ethernet Freeview Digital image editing Teletext Frequency synthesiser System/36 Synthesizer Chroma subsampling Gramophone record Windows XP View camera H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Movie camera Digital audio broadcasting Musical Instrument Digital Interface BBC Three Field-programmable gate array ITV Halftone
