is onkyo the most user friendly of receivers i want to buy a receiver for around but i am not savvy when it comes to settings and all that i really just want to turn it on and have my surround but i want my sound to be free of distortion as well my friend had a yamaha and it was so confusing it almost turned me off to home theater when he was showing me how all the settings worked i need somewhere between watts per channel whatever that means it really depends on how comfortable you are with the onkyo's remote control unfortunately surround receivers are generally very confusing to setup but this can be mitigated by having your friend or a professional do the installation after that it's just a matter of learning the on off volume and switching different inputs on your remote control i would audition a few different brands sony pioneer denon and see which remote is most comfortable for you after all we are now an armchair society so the remote is really the key to becoming savvy note there are integrated remotes that allow you to press one or two buttons to do a whole series of things turn on the tv cable box dvd receiver to eliminate different remotes harmony makes some very nice remotes good luck and enjoy your new remote Remote control Musical Instrument Digital Interface PlayStation Portable Kenwood Electronics Modem PlayStation 2 Xbox IPod Synthesizer Loudspeaker Windows XP Sound Blaster Digital audio workstation Xbox 360 High-definition television Bluetooth Home cinema Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Electric guitar Sega Dreamcast TiVo SCART DualDisc Telephone exchange Mouse (computing) Walkman MP3 Vision mixer DVD Federal Standard 1037C Photography Digital rights management X10 (industry standard) Visual Basic Home theater PC Windows Vista Transistor Internet Trademark Integrated Services Digital Network Sony Dimmer High fidelity Game controller Copy protection Mike Watt Our Gang Electronic amplifier Mattress X Window System Password Cheating in Counter-Strike Management information system Family Guy Phreaking Computer and video games Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Common Unix Printing System USB flash drive System/36 Beatmania IIDX Electricity meter Apple Macintosh Danger Hiptop Audiophile Trusted computing S__CAM Television Amstrad CPC Blood on the Tracks Telephone Oscilloscope Solar power GSM services MAME Screenshot ATI Technologies Programmable logic controller Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Effects pedal Microsoft Windows Poker jargon Palm OS Radio control Private branch exchange BlackBerry House music Transformer Set-top box MDAC Mixing console FreeBSD Global Positioning System Citizens' band radio Apple Open Collaboration Environment Floppy disk
