why are women so caught up in what they look like why after months of medical treatment am i so upset to lose my hair for a second time it shouldn't matter under the circumstances but it really does thanks so much for all your messages of support thanks to diurmuid you're right of course to those suggesting wigs i have a very nice one but they never seem to fit me properly and i don't feel very secure especially when it's windy it manages to be windy every time i need to wear the wig outside at home i wear scarves awww i'm so so sorry about your hair i understand what you are saying i never get why people are so vain and need to look there best but i guess they just want to be liked and by looking nice on the outside it might cover what lays inside i know many different people and to tell you the honest truth all the girls i know that are pretty have horrible personality's and dont give a damn about anyone apart from themselves then i know girls like me who are normal not the prettiest who are caring sensitive have a heart great personality and people love them for who they are personality shines through where as beauty wears thin there are so many beautiful girls women but when they grow older there looks will fade and if there personality is bad gosh help them lol i have a friend who has no hair i've known her for about years and she has never had any so she has to wear a wig but she is the sweetest person ever and nobody cares whether she has hair or not we still treat her the same and love her the same it wouldn't change if her hair grew back remember even if you dont have hair or the latest mobile you will be loved for who you are not what you look like or what you own and dont worry i'm sure you will have beautiful silky hair in years to come good luck sarah x Theory of conduct Baldness The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Hair Sharon Tate Jon Secada Kodocha Gender role Marilyn Monroe Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Singlish Social rule Characters in the Smurfs Urinary incontinence The Shining (film) Headgear AFI 100 Years series Prostate cancer The Inside Roxette Cliff Richard Totally Spies!
