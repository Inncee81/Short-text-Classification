i just saw an ad for loreal pro xylane hyaluronic spheres skin treatment a scam i've heard of xylene and know how to pronounce it in the ad pro xylane whatever that is is pronounced prox ylane yeah sami enough bullsh t already they have only hydration thanks k i'm surprised you found an abstract and i'm disappointed in medline k looks like another vanity journal passion share reduce the cause of aging a scam in my mind it is advertising a magical solution i'm sorry i just heard the ad again on cnn treat not reduce thanks k no doubt pixie dust is at least as effective for aging as this is k i actually found an abstract on this as you appropriately say bullsh t ingredient the abstract isn t even intelligible but also written in a way that appears to promote the ingredient it is not written as an academic abstract so i thought this can t be a peer reviewed journal did some more searching and this guy in italy is listed as a founder and publishing director of the journal of plastic dermatology no website for the journal itself that lists the review board submission procedures etc most ads p ss me off but this p sses me off extra not only is it listed in medline which i'm not sure why won't separate peer reviewed and non peer reviewed sources but people are led to believe there is some scientific backing when there is only money backing the ingredient what a crock of sh t there are only other articles that exist in the journal of plastic dermatology and they are as equally unintelligible and suspicious as that regarding pro xylane anyway see for yourself i hope i m wrong somehow sarcasm of course but here s the link to the author s notice the quotes webpage and the vanity journal s abstract scroll down to press translated version http ca search yahoo com language translatedpage tt url text http a www antoninodipietro it default php fsezione lp it en intl ca fr fp tab web t in case that link doesn't work here's the italian version that you can translate http www antoninodipietro it default php sezione the fake abstract di maio milano italy pro xylane a 'green chemistry' product to slow the skin aging journal of plastic dermatology vol pp pro xylane is a new anti aging molecule for the skin developed by l'oreal it is a 'green' product in fact the first ingredient is xylos a natural sugar from beachwood sourced from western europe and the synthesis has only two optimised steps in which water is used as solvent studies performed with the episkin model have shown that in the epidermal dermal junction pro xylane stimulates the glycosaminoglycans gags production the sythesis of type vii collagen and the cd expression in female subjects ages after two months treatment with pro xylane there was an improvement of the face wrinkles and immunohistological studies revealed an increase of condroitin sulfate in the wrinkle trough edit yup i don't understand why nothing is done about this as one academic i am insulted by the existence of these vanity journals i mean it trivializes empirical work methodological rigor confuses the heck out of society and leads to people spending money for nothing man people interested in anti aging get yourself a good real dermatologist save your money for what will minimize surface wrinkles albeit only temporarily prescribed tretinoin gel glycolic acid peels micro dermabrasion botox restylane tretinoin is the least costly a tube here if you have no insurance relatively cheap and efficacious edit woooo wouldn't it be nice if wrinkles could be treated i think that bit might be more believable if they called it pixie dust i mean of course in favour of the ridiculous name they've chosen that is suppose to sound scientific and be a secret on account of it's wild efficacy don't want
