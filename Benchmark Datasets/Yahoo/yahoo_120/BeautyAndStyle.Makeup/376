what liquid foundation is the best for asian combination skin i also have some blemishes on my skin and i need a foundation that will hide them and also won't make me break out hey there i'm asian yellow warm toned light skin and i'm currently using revlon's colorstay makeup with softflex for combination oily skin it has spf controls shine looks natural yet offers great coverage my pores are invisible and bonus not a single new pimple has popped up on my skin since using it i really recommend this foundation it's the best thing i've found yet it retails in drugstores for singapore or us if you have light skin i recommend sand beige it has enough yellow tone to look natural and perfectly blended in for me otherwise try to stick with anything that has the word golden tan caramel etc and stay away from anything that has the word nude a word of advice this foundation stays so make sure you don't neglect to wash your face at the end of the day or you'll be clogging up your pores like crazy i wash my face with a gentle cleanser then use a toner to make sure every last bit of foundation is off before i hit my bed also i'd be careful with trying out foundations because many brands like maybelline covergirl etc can be too pink toned rather than yellow toned which would make you look unhealthy or ill hope that helps good luck Cleanser Cosmetics Tattoo Hamster Sunscreen Social rule Psoriasis Happy Tree Friends Dragon Booster Snooker Rum Fecal incontinence Pump It Up Skin Cher (entertainer) Leather Vinegar Wal-Mart The Legend of Zelda series enemies Upholstery Care Bears Queen (band) Jon Secada Apple Textile manufacturing Color theory Singlish BoA Brewery Customs and etiquette of Japan Elton John Donovan Potato Gramophone record Mattress Blur Houseplant Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Physical attractiveness Cao Cao Champagne (beverage) The Beatles' influence Jute Notable lines in the Star Wars series Ultraviolet Weight training Scotch whisky Power Rangers Roxette Bedbug Sharon Tate Coffee Hide (musician) 613 mitzvot Sex and the City Madonna (entertainer) Cliff Richard Namie Amuro The Adventures of Pete & Pete Fancy rat Drawing Avril Lavigne Eczema Tutankhamun Camouflage Hiking The Rutles Blood (computer game) Sunburn Dandruff 1957 World Series Smoke-screen Undergarment Empire Burlesque Methanol The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Ceramics Color Theory of conduct Tofu Naruto jutsu Buddhism Pneumonia Gary Numan Soap Mobile Fighter G Gundam Mud People Collectibles in Bionicle Hip hop music Michael Jackson Bee Gees Mixtape Smegma Dog training Hard water Leopard Comanche
