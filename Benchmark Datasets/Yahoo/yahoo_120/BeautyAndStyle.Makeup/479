has anyone had any experience with 'i d bare minerals' i planned on getting their foundation powder however being a powder i'm afraid that it will look all cakey if you know someone how uses it or if you use it yourself can you please tell me how it worked out i appreciate it i'm a culinary student and we're not allowed to wear any makeup i wear my bare minerals everyday and i've never be caught it doesn't look cakey at all and i personally hate wearing makeup i'm not a very girly girl but bare minerals takes literally minutes to put on it's a little expensive i think i got my starter kit for but it also lasted me like months or something like that if you want it to look the most natural i would search online and see if there are any stores near you that carry it i used to live close to el paso texas and there was even a store there i know the sephora stores carry it as well if you go in they can actually put it on you and you will be able to choose the shade you think works get someone else's opinion and decide if you like it before you get the whole kit and blow your Japanese tea ceremony Characters in the Smurfs Ranma __ characters University of Texas at El Paso Infantilism Indianapolis 500 Cosmetics Surveillance Nintendo Piccolo (Dragon Ball) The Human Stain Diamond Wal-Mart Chili con carne Mining New York Giants The Legend of Zelda series enemies Gramophone record Kurt Angle Vegeta EastEnders M16 (rifle) StarCraft: Uprising Light-emitting diode Hard disk Ultimate Spider-Man Gender role Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Marilyn Monroe Columbine High School massacre American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968) Titanium K' Professional wrestling match types Dairy Milton H.
