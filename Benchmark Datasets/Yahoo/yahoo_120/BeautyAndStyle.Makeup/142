does anyone know of a place where i could get the discontinued clinique city sheer shimmer i know there is was a company that would make a discontinued lip color if you had a sample saw it a few years ago on tv but i can't find what the company is or if they do this kind of product i worked for clinique for a few years and they have a spot on there website at clinique com look at the area that lableled last chances they give you another website called gone but not forgotten com i believe where you can look for products that have been discontinued that product has been gone for a while so your chances are slim also the company is really great and friendly and if you want get there off the website and call customer service yourself and see if they have any in stock good luck Michel Foucault Amazon.com Est__e Lauder Inc.
