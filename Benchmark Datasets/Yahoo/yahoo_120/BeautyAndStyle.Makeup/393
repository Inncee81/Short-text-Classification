hair make up and clothes for roller skating today i am going roller skating with friends and i was wondering how you think i should do my make up hair and what i should wear i was thinking about not wearing any make up the only problem is that at the moment i have a major breakout make up covers it really well but i am still not sure whether to wear any seeing as it is sunday i usually don't wear make up on sunday do you think i should now to my hair i just got it cut yesterday it is just above my shoulders with heaps of layering i also have short side bangs my hair is naturally curly i was thinking about straigtening it what do you think i should do with it i really want to wear something nice i live in australia so it is winter over here i am not sure what to wear i want to look nice the place i am going is very trendy so what do you think i should wear thanks for reading my very long question thanks for answering thanks again i think that you should only wear makeup if you believe the breakout is bad enough to do so don't wear it if it interferes with your religous beliefs if you do decide to base would be best don't overdo your eye makeup incase of sweating you dont want your eyeliner to run for your hair i think you should straighten it however i'd wear it half up and half down poofed at the crown use hairspray so your bangs don't get in the way this way your friends cans still see your new layers and cut but it won't bother you while you are trying to have fun as for clothes find a cute long sweater tunic or something of the sort since layers are in right now you can't hardly go wrong that way you can shed some if you get to hot while blading try to avoid a heavy bulk like winter coat if it's not too cold because then you'll have to lag it around for pants i'd go with some leggings so your legs will be warm you'll be moving them alot anyway and they won't look bulky or fat with your blades on Hair Figure skating Little Britain Haircut Ice hockey Diving suit Equine conformation Cosmetics Shirt Jackass: The Movie Leaf Sin City Professional wrestling throws The Ashlee Simpson Show Diving Comanche Horse Avenue Q Mummy Sauna Kodocha Skirt and dress Russian joke Paul Is Dead Social rule Canadian Armed Forces Skinhead Guinea pig Leather Theory of conduct Singlish Brewery Aerial (dance move) Clothing Havanese Jumpstart 3rd Grade Teen Girl Squad Thermoregulation Garfield Jennifer Lopez Roller skating Goaltender Shoe Tire Heavy metal fashion Dog Mercury Atlas 6 Fur Kimi Finster Knife Dragon Booster Undergarment Shorts 2000 Australian Grand Prix Textile manufacturing Johnny Appleseed Napoleon Dynamite Kimono Casualty lifting Grunge music Plastic Strap-on dildo Happy Tree Friends Death rock fashion Goofy Mullet (haircut) The Apprentice 2 Motor oil Time Out of Mind Battle of the Bulge FoxTrot Phoebe Buffay's songs Fecal incontinence Dairy Charles Darwin's views on religion Game show Tibetan people Emo fashion Mattress About a Boy The Amazing Race Hip hop rivalries Artistic roller skating Marilyn Monroe Inca Empire Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Salad Fingers Swimming Menstrual cup Sesshomaru Chu-Han contention Vestment Barbie Dinosaur Frogman Shen Gong Wu Sock Spontaneous human combustion Waistcoat
