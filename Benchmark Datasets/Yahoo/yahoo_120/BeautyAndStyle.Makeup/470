what's the difference between foundation and powder and why is there loose powder and pressed powder do they work differently it's because i want to use physician's formula and don't know what to get where can i buy physician's formula detailed answer points foundation is usually a cream but it can be in many forms it is used to even out skin tone and hide small flaws powder is used mostly as a foundation or make up setter like spraying hairspray on hair to keep it in its place the powder helps your make up stay in place and in many cases absorbs oil loose powder can be a bit messy some women prefer applying it however because they can get their brush full of powder more quickly and they can also avoid contaminating the powder since only a little at a time is exposed inside the container there is a plastic seive it keeps the majority of the powder down in the container while you use only what you need pressed powder is similar to powder blush it is firmly packed into a compact and therefore is more portable it takes more effort to fill your brush but most women consider that a small price to pay for something that won't spill a whole bunch of powder if they knock it over some pressed powders are also considered a foundation they cover a little better than regular powder but don't offer as much in the area of evening out skin tone or hiding blemishes there are powders that actually convert to cream once they are applied to the skin these offer the best coverage you can expect from a powder but if you have oily skin it can make a mess on your face a lot like mud most women apply foundation some offer spf anti aging or moisturizing types allow it to dry then apply blush and eye powders then sometimes lip liner then they apply the powder to set the makeup after that you can use mascara brow pencils or lipstick if you were to apply these before the powder it would make the powder cling to your lashes and brows applying lipstick over a lipliner that's been set with powder lasts longer sometimes even the best powder can fall prey to oily skin at that point some women reapply powder and others use blotting tissues blotting tissues are made of the same paper as those paper toilet seat covers used for hygeine in public bathrooms i'm cheap so i used to grab a couple from work and cut them up instant blotting paper it soaks up the oil without ruining your make up Cosmetics Psoriasis Tattoo Upholstery Handloading Tofu Fecal incontinence Fire extinguisher Japanese toilet Bulk vending Acne Toilet paper Professional wrestling match types Dairy Internal ballistics Japanese tea ceremony Breastfeeding Menstrual cup Genericized trademark Explosive material Manicure Shaving Drawing Plastic Transformer M16 (rifle) Physical attractiveness Cremation Ammunition Casting Hamster Knife Massage Sento Diaper Shotgun shell Ice cream Androgen insensitivity syndrome Dialysis Blushing Skin Euphemism Social rule Hand grenade Gas metal arc welding The Legend of Zelda series enemies Textile manufacturing Mattress Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tea Urinary incontinence Western blot Laserdisc Comanche Dog Paint Eczema Hiking Titanium Gramophone record Ultraviolet Herpes simplex virus Milk Powder metallurgy Welding Gelatin Leaf Toilet Puberty Plastic surgery Bong Cartridge (firearms) Life insurance Fluorescent lamp Embalming Volleyball Leather Printmaking Black hole Gunpowder Floppy disk Illegal drug trade Instant coffee Professional wrestling throws Radio controlled airplane The Shining (film) Oscilloscope Motor oil Tocopherol Health insurance Tobacco Pencil Cochineal
