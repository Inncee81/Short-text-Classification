please please help self injury i asked another question earlier about how to minimize scarring because i self harmed for the first time today but now im realy worried because one of the cuts looks like a wound and it wont close i can see pink flesh do you think i need stitches also other cuts that arnt too bad have closed up but there is almost a blood colour forming under the skin thats spreading what should i do and yes i am going to get help from a psychologist moro but right now i need to know what this is and how to stop it i'm really scared the other cuts i made today are closing and the reason i did this today is because i saw the man who sexually abused me for my whole child hood and freaked out so shut your fucking mouth the first guy who answered and the problem wasnt my daddy didnt hug me enough my daddy hugged me too much fuck you i hun believe that all these people telling you that it is stupid to self injure are insecure about themselves they probably haven't been through the same shit that you have in your past they don't understand i'll insert a favorite quote of mine here to those who know no explanation needed to those who don't no explanation possible you can get through this i believe in you i am here for you and you know i always am and will be as much as i possibly can if you want to play doctor and stitch this up yourself wait i think i already told you this but anyways lol clean it up with some kind of antiseptic wash try to be careful with the other wounds around that area see if you can close it up and get it to stay closed and if it gets any worse try to find a way to see a doctor whether you have to sneak out or whatever you have to do if you try to heal it yourself it probably is possible but will probably leave a keloid scar whereas a scar from stitches will probably be much less visible in the future but requires a visit to the emergency room in the end it's all up to you remember you are in control in life and you have people me out there that believe in you i hope you find my answer helpful and my addy is alwaysashley if you'd like to im me hugs hang in there you'll be okay Scar Scarification The Shining (film) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Father's Day (Doctor Who) Body piercing Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Boom Town (Doctor Who) Self-harm Social rule Triage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Empty Child Keloid Theory of conduct Sexual orientation Ex-gay Milton H.
