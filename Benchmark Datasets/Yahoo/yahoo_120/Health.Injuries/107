knee injury ok so i just started pt for my knee i injured it back in june and the ortho just refered me to pt and i had my rd session today the therapist had me doing wall slides this is where u stand with ur feet shoulder width apart and slide down the wall so that ur knee is bent at about degrees or as far as u can go with out pain so i do this and on the way back up i feel kind of a grinding and then pain on the front and inside of my knee it wasnt so bad so i pushed on and continued with the set after the therapist did ultrasound message and iced my knee anyway when i got home i noticed that my knee was still hurting so i iced it my question is could i have reinjured my knee or was the pain caused because i have been in an immobolizer since the injury and haven't bent my knee that far also if pt doesn't help what will be the next step that the dr will take any help would be great the initial injury was a partial mcl tear thanks to all who have answered so far today at thereapy before i began the exercises the therapist stretched my knee out a bit but while soing the wall slides my knee still made that sort of pop and grind noises and then tonight when i got home my knee felt a little loose which it hasn't felt that way since i first injured my knee the pain is same however as always no increase but no change either if any one else has any thoughts that would be great thanks your quads and your knee are not used to such extreme exercises since you have been in the immoblizer if wall slides hurt don't do as far down go down only to where you feel no pain these should become less painful as time goes on what was your injury i don't know what to tell you the doctor might do next if i don't know what your injury was probably surgery but like i said i don't know what your injury is if you e mail me maybe i can help some more Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Aerial (dance move) Iliotibial band syndrome Knee Diving Volleyball Professional wrestling attacks Skateboarding trick Backstroke Glossary of ballet terms Swingout Massage Fecal incontinence Repetitive strain injury Anterior cruciate ligament Casualty lifting Breaststroke Tai Chi Chuan Weight training Charleston (dance move) Fast bowling Pain Swimming Carpal tunnel syndrome Glossary of climbing terms Babe Ruth Horizontal bar Professional wrestling aerial techniques Spanking Milton H.
