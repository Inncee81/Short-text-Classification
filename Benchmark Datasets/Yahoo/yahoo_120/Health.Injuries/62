glenoid labrum what are the odds that i am suffering from a tear in my right glenoid labrum i recently july th injured my right shoulder and it was diagnosed as an a c sprain and a shoulder contusion but i am slowly regaining my range of motion and am now suffering from pain in the back of my shoulder rather than my a c joint like i have in the past i go back in weeks for another re evaluation of my shoulder and it will be determined there if i should go get an mri for the tendons my shoulder is also clicking popping more than it has in the past what are you takes on this it feels a whole lot more stable then it did in the beginning though i still can barely hold lift objects in that arm without it hurting and i can feel it start to pull down though i'm not sure if that's from my a c joint or not i originally landed on it playing soccer i am a goalie and it landed underneath me more than it normally does when i dive i think there is a decent chance you have a tear in the labrum considering the symptoms you describe the pain in the back of the shoulder may be from tightness in the infraspinatus muscle or in the posterior shoulder capsule does your shoulder feel unstable if so that is another good indicator of a tear in the labrum like the other person said tears in the labrum dont always appear on the mri how did you initially injur the shoulder that is another way that helps determine whether you may have a tear good luck with that Scapula Humerus Supraspinatus muscle Professional wrestling holds Traumatic brain injury Shoulder Aortic dissection Rotator cuff tear Diving Weight training Professional wrestling throws Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Myocardial infarction Iliotibial band syndrome Anterior cruciate ligament Prostate cancer Repetitive strain injury Decompression sickness Multiple sclerosis Pain Stroke Tetrapod Syringomyelia Bipolar disorder Osteoarthritis Elbow-joint Anatomical terms of location Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome Cardiac stress test Spanking Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Suplex Breaststroke Arm Professional wrestling slang Evidence of evolution Professional wrestling attacks Post Polio syndrome Bruise Adult attention-deficit disorder Internal ballistics Babe Ruth Chronic fatigue syndrome Hip (anatomy) Drowning Knife Retinal detachment Butterfly stroke Autism Eye Paget's disease of bone Rugby union Tenshinhan Water polo Magnetic resonance imaging Swimming New York Giants Cerebellum Backstroke Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breast cancer Massage Troy Glaus Boxing Cephalic disorder Chris Kanyon Casualty lifting First aid Cancer Breastfeeding Clinical depression Kodocha Gundam W G-Unit: Last Outpost Pneumonia Fibromyalgia Vegeta Stinger (medicine) Scientology beliefs and practices Angina Kurt Angle Professional wrestling aerial techniques Leon White Columbine High School massacre Ultimate (sport) Borderline personality disorder Professional wrestling Endometriosis The Contender (television series) Archery Traumatic incident reduction Norway national football team History of brain imaging Fecal incontinence Autopsy Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis
