is my foot sprained yesterday i was running and i ran into a fence my foot slid sideways upto the fence and after that it really really hurt it's still hurting mostly on my arch it hurts really bad to walk and i find myself limping pretty bad it's not swollen or if it is i can barely tell is this a sprain or not and if not how long will it take to heal thanks for your help the possibilities are endless you could have a small fracture dislocation or even tear of your lateral or transverse arches in the bottom of your foot i would see a doctor asap for some imaging studies in the meantime try to keep your foot elevated when you aren't active and alternate heat and ice ibuprofen can help with the pain and also the swelling it wouldn't hurt for you to wrap your foot snugly not too tight in an ace bandage or a foot brace to give it some support best of luck and happy healing Equine conformation Carpal tunnel syndrome Barbed wire Professional wrestling holds Osteoarthritis Wound Poker jargon Diving Drill bit Seismic retrofit First aid Glacier The Shining (film) Martial art Gobi Desert Scoliosis Alternative medicine Orthopedic surgery Milton H.
