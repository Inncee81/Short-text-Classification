laser surgey for ingrown toenails i have to get this done and im scared how the doctor is going to do it he said that he has to take the roots out but how help me i've had that done except with chemicals instead of a laser and it's not as bad as you think depending on how bad your ingrown toenail is he may be taking out the whole nail or just the edge but either way you really can't tell any of the nail is missing after it's done and has healed the doctor will numb your toe and then cut out the part of your nail that's causing problems since you'll be numb this won't hurt but it will sound like a nail clipper then the laser will be used to permanently burn out the root of your nail which will prevent it from ever growing back after it's done take some tylenol for the pain don't do advil as that will make you bleed more and follow your doctor's instructions you'll probably have to leave the bandages on it for hours and afterwards soak it in water with epsom salt mixed in a few times a day unless your doctor tells you differently put neosporin or similar products on it frequently to prevent infections it is kind of scary to think about having your toenail removed but once it's done you'll realize it wasn't such a big deal after all Nail (anatomy) Nail disease Callus Wound Manicure Pedicure Nine Inch Nails Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Textile manufacturing Milton H.
