is my leg dislocated i did hurdles in track a few months ago and i hurt my leg i felt it pop and i was in pain i didnt think i dislocated it because i played football a while before that and it popped just like it did and i only bothered me for a day or then the pain left but now a few months past the hurdle injury it is really starting to feel awkward when i walk so is it dislocated or wat if your hip was dislocated you wouldn't be walking at all it sounds like your hip is not lining up with the pelvis properly this can cause pain grinding popping or clicking unfortunately this is nothing you can fix yourself i would recommend you mention this to your chiropractor i assume you have one because you play football before football practice starts up a good chiropractor will be able to realign your pelvis so that the hip lines up properly if this goes uncorrected it can develop into arthritis later in life good luck and do something about this now it won't go away on its own Equine conformation Carpal tunnel syndrome Aerial (dance move) Paget's disease of bone Pelvis Diving Hip fracture American football Childbirth Weight training Dyspareunia Bryan Robson Iliotibial band syndrome Orthopedic surgery Denis Law Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Jack Charlton Hurdling Breech birth Contortion Casualty lifting Repetitive strain injury New England Patriots The Shining (film) Double bass 1957 World Series Eddie Guerrero Osteopathy Journey (band) Satchel Paige Music genre Kodocha Bone fracture Cincinnati Bengals Laws of cricket Professional wrestling attacks 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand Olympic medalists in athletics (men) Fanny Blankers-Koen Nine Inch Nails Norway national football team Hip hop rivalries Dog training Back pain Pain Osteoarthritis Renaldo Nehemiah Football (soccer) Piccolo Junior Saga Ja Rule Brian Close Subluxation Indian English Rod Stewart Van Halen Sydney Riot of 1879 Marching band Hip hop culture Pet Sounds Hip dysplasia Social rule FA Cup Dundee United F.C.
