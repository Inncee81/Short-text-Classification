can you run a triathlon week after they take off your cast weeks ago i fell and i broke my wrist displaced distal radius colles fracture when i was training for the bycicle leg of an olympic distance triathlon the actual race will take place days after they take off my cast despite the cast on my arm i've been able to run and ride a stationary bike so i kept my cardivascular system in good shape the problem is that i haven't been able to swim and won't be until the cast is off a total of weeks without swimming is it unrealistic to think that i will be able to swim mile week after the cast is off how about riding the bycicle can i ride a real road bycicle week after the cast is off will i need a wrist splint where do i get one i didn't have any problem swimming mile before the accident sorry but i think it's very unrealistic a joint which has been immobile for weeks will be quite weak even after a week of rehab the bicycle on the other hand is another story i think you'll be fine since you've said you were cycling even with the cast on you can wear a splint if your wrist is causing you pain you can buy one at just about any sporting goods store ask them to let you try it on first some do not provide you with the sturdy feeling they should Bicycle Carpal tunnel syndrome Equine conformation Swimming Ironman Triathlon Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics Osteoporosis Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics Tour de France Diving Austria at the 2004 Summer Olympics New Zealand at the 2004 Summer Olympics Brazil at the 2004 Summer Olympics Professional wrestling holds Orthopedic surgery Bicycle frame Anatomical terms of location Wrist Diving suit Yosemite National Park Hip fracture Cycling Netherlands at the 2004 Summer Olympics 2000 Summer Olympics Running Lance Armstrong Australia at the 2000 Summer Olympics Bicycle brake systems Weight training Road bicycle racing Traumatic brain injury Bicycle lighting Mountain biking United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Drag racing XTERRA Triathlon Bicycle helmet China at the 2004 Summer Olympics Racing bicycle Switzerland at the 2004 Summer Olympics Sport in Ireland Speedo (suit style) London 2012 Olympic bid Japan at the 2004 Summer Olympics Humerus Marathon (sport) Butterfly stroke Russia at the 2004 Summer Olympics Mari Holden Jujutsu Shin splints Argentina at the 2004 Summer Olympics Parallax Stress fracture Crucifixion Archery Boxing 2002 Commonwealth Games Cycling in Melbourne History of swimming Cyclo-cross Inline speed skating Tai Chi Chuan Captain Thunderbolt Breaststroke Horse Summer Olympic Games Fencing Sport rowing Mountain bike Hungary at the 2004 Summer Olympics Instant-runoff voting Evel Knievel Backstroke Transportation of Los Angeles Individual time trial Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Snowboarding Sailing Suicide methods Switzerland at the 2000 Summer Olympics Racing Vehicular cycling Sports timeline Sling (weapon) Jan Ullrich Carpus Graeme Obree Fanny Blankers-Koen Canada at the 2000 Summer Olympics Iwan Thomas
