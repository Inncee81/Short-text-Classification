can a lump on my testicle wait for my doctor to get back from vacation about a week ago i asked about a painful testicle following some advice given i went to youtube and learned how to do a self exam well i found what no man wants to find a lump on my left testicle my problem is that my doctor is on vacation in ireland until august th is this the kind of thing that can wait or is it something that progresses really fast thanks for your concern and i shall be awaiting your wisdom oh i forgot to mention the pain seems to originate from the lump at the slightest touch i'd say that sounds more like you're feeling your epididymis a bump towards the rear of each testicle and might even be suffering from epididymitis an infection inflammation of said portion of your anatomy but just to be safe i would recommend seeing another doctor if it is testicular cancer it can advance pretty rapidly Prostate cancer Epididymitis Epididymis Cancer Androgen insensitivity syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Varicocele Stomach cancer Medicine Sterilization (surgical procedure) Chiropractic Castration Psoriasis Gonorrhoea Fight Club Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cryptorchidism Milton H.
