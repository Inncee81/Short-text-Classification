fertility blend did it work my husband has just started taking fertility blend we will know whether it worked or not at the end of this month before that can anyone tell me whether it worked for any of u guys thx i am likewise taking this product i have super irregular periods and i am hoping beyond hope that this works my close friend tried for a year and a half to get preggo and couldn't but then she went on fertility blend and was pregnant within three months i definatly think its worth a shot but don't get frustrated it takes about three months for the stuff to get in your system to the level that it needs to give it months to a year and i bet you will concieve sometime within that time frame the only draw back is trying to remember to take the stuff three times a day good luck Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Friends Poker jargon Fertility awareness Time Out of Mind Phoebe Halliwell Peter Shilton Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Craps Deinterlacing Social rule TLC Tobacco Puberty Piccolo Junior Saga Blood on the Tracks Blackjack Humphrey Bogart Draw poker The Contender (television series) Tocopherol Who Shot Mr. Burns?
