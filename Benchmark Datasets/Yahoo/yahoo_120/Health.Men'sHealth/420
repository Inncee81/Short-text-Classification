question about supplements for weight training okay i bought some supplements to help in my weight training and am not sure what they are for or how effective they will be i just kind of bought whatever the sales clerk suggested the supplements are myoplex nutrition shakes hmb l glutamine creatine monohydrate zinc magnesium aspartame amino burst protein bars with some sort of bee stuff in them has anyone used these and can you tell me how effective they are as you have found out there are a plethora of supplements on the market given your list my opinions are myoplex nutrition shakes i myself prefer a isolate whey protein powder there are many brands on the market and as with most supplements 'you get what you pay for' i use pro nos whey isolate complex and i'm satisfied with the results as a side note i wouldn't mix protein powders with water or even fat free milk use milk while i'm on the subject of proteins and milk let me say this do not take soy supplements of any kind whatsoever soy is not a good protein at all avoid intaking it whenever possible hmb it's alright but if you really want to try a supplement that elicits an increase of your own growth hormones testerone primarily then i would recommend vy tech's hd i would recommend that you wait a while before considering such supplements you may find that you do not need them to get the results you're after glutamine now this is an essential supplement to facilitate mass building and you've many options for how you want to take it the powders are good but i feel the capsular products work as well creatine creatine does add some explosive power to your workout but most of the 'mass' you will see water retention you also shouldn't take creatine for more than a couple of months straight as it can be hard on the kidneys honestly i would not recommend creatine for someone who is just starting to hit the gym i would only recommend it for those who have hit a 'wall' in their training regimen zinc magnesium aspartame yawn amino burst someone's been to gnc i get most of my supplements from gnc 'amino burst ' is good but i do not think at this point that you need such a hyper loaded amino acid supplement i myself use gnc's amino acids and it seems to be working fine for me note however that my pronos protein powder is supplemented with amino acids as well protein bars i only eat them when i know i'm not going top be able to meet my protein intake goals for the day i like detour bars they contain mostly whey protein and they come in a regular and a low carb bar they taste 'okay' which is saying a lot for a protein bar most protein bars taste like ss again jack if you have any more questions don't hesitate to e mail them to me and i'll do my best to answer them Protein Atkins Nutritional Approach Weight training Nutrition Aspartame Vegetarianism Tofu Soybean Dieting Folic acid Cheese Protein-energy malnutrition Tocopherol Insulin Low-carbohydrate diet Breastfeeding Amino acid Magnesium Prostate cancer Dairy Soy milk Zinc Omega-3 fatty acid Vegetarian nutrition Herpes simplex virus Protein sequencing Iron Infant formula Organic food Chocolate Osteoporosis Nutrient Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Long-term potentiation Anorexia nervosa Antiretroviral drug Food and Drug Administration Cell (biology) Ice cream Illegal drug trade Kidney stone Healthy eating Growth hormone Fire extinguisher Cystic fibrosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Food Guinea pig Monosodium glutamate Vitamin Tryptophan Origin of life Androgen insensitivity syndrome Puberty Explosive material Ramen Kit Kat Vitasoy Vitamin C Brewery Colorectal cancer Flour Signal transduction Carburetor Genetic code Coffee Sugar beet Alzheimer's disease Soft drink Hypomagnesemia Kosher foods Gelatin Obesity Aluminium Clinical depression Bread Osteoarthritis Essential amino acid SoBe Water Chronic fatigue syndrome Glucokinase Dietary fiber Glucocorticoid Cocaine DNA
