looking to start home day care in illinois i am wondering if i should go ahead and getting licensed or just babysit and claim taxes what are the pros cons to each option i have a degree in child development and experinces working at a naeyc accreddited center no more than kids looking to just supplement income you are generally not required to get a license if you are providing care for only a few children but i would strongly recommend it not only is it much easier to find clients if you are licensed but you have some protection in case of an accident the requirements to be licensed are generally minimal and most are basic safety precautions that would be wise to follow anyway there are many grants and support systems available for licensed daycare providers that are not available for babysitters check with your local resource and referral agency most areas have grants that pay you back for any charges that you incur while obtaining your daycare license and it is well worth the initial time investment to have i ran a home daycare for years and the majority of my clients were referred to me through the resource and referral agency because i was licensed it was far cheaper than any form of advertising i could have done if you need some information on marketing your business visit marketing a home based preschool http education preschoolrock com index php preschool resources for teachers marketing a home based preschool Day care Education in the United States Education in Japan Child support X Window System Education in the People's Republic of China Insurance Social Security debate (United States) Publicly funded medicine Social work Dissociative identity disorder Ajax (programming) Identity theft Windows XP Nuclear power Linux Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Taxation in the United States Kindergarten Enterprise content management BitTorrent Real estate broker Common Unix Printing System Food and Drug Administration American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Novell NetWare Student loan Life insurance PHP MySQL Password Probation officer Microsoft Nuclear power phase-out Wget Mutual fund Client-server Windows Server 2003 Cable television OpenDocument XML Spam (electronic) McMartin preschool Pharmaceutical company Microsoft Office SCO-Linux controversies Motion picture rating system Btrieve Web crawler Lawyer Food Stamp Program Hillary Rodham Clinton Annuity FairTax Automatic number plate recognition National Health Service United Kingdom corporation tax MS-DOS Copyright Relationship marketing United States Postal Service Trademark Software patent debate Surveillance Security (finance) Accountancy Early childhood education History of Microsoft Windows Unemployment benefit Inflation Centrelink Domain Name System E-mail spam Education Medical prescription Open source culture Charter school Tax Advertising GNU General Public License Microsoft Windows Mozilla Firefox Education in Portugal Free software Gmail Auto insurance Public bodies and task forces of the UK government National Institutes of Health Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus No Child Left Behind Act Open Directory Project Copyleft
