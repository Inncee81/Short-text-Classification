if you took your preschooler into a garden what is one thing he she would definitely notice hello most definitely ants and slaters we watch the ants pulling along pieces of food which far outweigh them the struggles they have and their little counterparts coming along to help them or giving little messages and going on their way looking at this world from the eyes of a toddler is probably as close as god watching us struggle and grow through life slaters rolling up in little balls to protect themselves from harm when they feel it is all clear they unroll and go on their way snails asleep in their shell when he is picked up he will slowly come out to take a look at what is happening to his world to see from the eyes of a child is awe inspiring watching a bud grow and unfold into a beautiful flower is another thing of inspiration so many things in the garden i thought the little grandaughter had been throwing the rocks out of the bird bath onto the ground until one morning we were having a cuppa waiting for the birds to come for their early morning drink and the crows showed up we soon saw who was doing the rock throwing so much beauty and so may things to do in the garden take care The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Ant Hera Ayyavazhi mythology Piccolo Junior Saga Tenshinhan Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Social rule Hemp Night (book) Jon Secada Simone Weil Spidey Super Stories Garfield Johnny Appleseed Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hyuga Hinata Diving Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Care Bears The Pilgrim's Progress Snail Miss Saigon RuneScape quests The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Legend of Zelda series enemies Hamster Spider Into the Woods Poker jargon Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Naruto jutsu Humphrey Bogart Current teachings of Prem Rawat Sento Hun-Apu Roman eating and drinking Customs and etiquette of Japan Rugrats Evidence of evolution Motif of harmful sensation Time Out of Mind Father's Day (Doctor Who) Blood (computer game) Mario British hip hop Urinary incontinence Chicken Jam (TV series) The Flintstones Happy Tree Friends Tomato Oh My Goddess!
