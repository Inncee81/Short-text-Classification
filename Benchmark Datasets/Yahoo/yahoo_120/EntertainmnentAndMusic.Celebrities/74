how does hiphop artist akon not get arrested for having three wives i'm not hating or judging polygomists but seeing as how it's illegal in this country i am wondering how hiphop artist akon does not get in trouble for having three wives he first announced that he's a polyhomist on a radio station back in and now vh is taping a show featuring the three wives living under one roof and akon perhaps he's not legally married to all of them it's not illegal to cohabitate with more than one partner Marriage Hip hop culture Polygamy R.
