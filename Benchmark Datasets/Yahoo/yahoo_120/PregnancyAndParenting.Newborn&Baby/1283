upset tummy in week old baby my son only has a bowel movement once a day and it is fairly solid he always cries before he goes poo and gets really upset when he is gassy it breaks my heart to hear him like this and i am not sure if this is a normal baby thing or if he is really struggling to go he is formula fed by the reccomendation of his pediatrition but only because he has reflux due to being a preemie and he would puke up all of the breastmilk that i would give him anyone else have any suggestions to help my son out besides mylacon drops and diluted pear juice i was hoping to get him to feel better without having to take him into the dr's office if it is possible thanks for the suggestions hi there my daughter is now months and has horrible acid reflux she sounds just like your baby back when she was still so new i did give her drops of mylicon as well as thumping her to help with the problem tummy but i will promise what will work the best our dr has my daughter on a generic form of zantac it helps her with not only the acid reflux but with the gas and pain as well but the trick is that she can only brestfeed and i am not allowed any dairy it works with my daughter i could swear by it and to see her pain reduce and her weight start to gain she was very underweight we were so relieved truly consider a second opinion on the formula deal formula is so hard for their little tummies to digest and i suggest before any more medication or juices get a second opinion my daughter was a preemie too good luck p s i wouldn't listen to any old wives tales about what to try or whatever from on here it could really hurt your newborn just call another pedicatrician Breastfeeding Gastroesophageal reflux disease Childbirth Hypoglycemia Fecal incontinence Milk Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Days of our Lives Flatulence Knots Landing Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Prostate cancer Crohn's disease Shit Obesity Care Bears Irritable bowel syndrome Folic acid Terri Schiavo Gout Vitamin C Jaundice Ulcerative colitis Social rule Toilet humour Babe Ruth Chlorpromazine Breast milk The Ashlee Simpson Show Clinical depression Shaggy dog story Spice Girls Kodocha Adjustable gastric band Le Malade imaginaire One Life to Live Aspartame Glycogen storage disease type I Jam (TV series) Saturday Night Live Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ashlee Simpson Jon Secada Fancy Crane Chronic fatigue syndrome Gastroparesis Water (molecule) Pregnancy Miscarriage Alcohol Infant formula Tocopherol Insulin Infantilism Sharon Tate Concentration Pitaten The Contender (television series) Reflux Piccolo Junior Saga Vomiting Liam Gallagher Autism Milton H.
