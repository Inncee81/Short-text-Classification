convertible car seats vs infant car seats which is safer my son will be months old on the th of this month and our original plan was to have him in a convertible car seat in my car and have the infant seat with the base in my wife's car which we normally take on family outings since getting a new car weeks ago we have been taking my car on longer trips so we can prevent the kids from messing up the new car anytime soon my wife refuses to let the baby sit in the convertible seat and took it out and replaced it with an extra infant car seat base so that he can go in that in my car when i asked her about this she said it was because the convertible seat doesn't look as safe as the infant seat i do not want to choose the easiness of the convertible seat over the safety of the infant seat is one actually safer than the other i do understand that the convertible seat is made for rear facing babies lbs lbs but does the infant seat have any safety benefits i worked at a baby store i learned a lot on carseats from what i know theyre equally safe its just easier to use an infant one with a small baby most convertible carseats have cushions to help smaller babies fit in safely they're just as safe the benefit to using an infant one for a while is that if baby falls asleep in the car you can just take the whole carseat out take baby wherever your going in the convertible ones you have to undo it get baby out usually wakes a sleeping baby up i would go ahead and use the infant one for another month or just because its really more comfy for baby but if you want to try the convertible one go ahead theyre equally safe when installed right Breastfeeding Car safety Baby transport Airbag Infant baptism EastEnders Sudden infant death syndrome M16 (rifle) Daylight saving time Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Motorcycle Paragliding Neighbours Nuclear power Tire Abortion debate Humphrey Bogart Infant Mazda RX-7 Toyota Prius Ford Thunderbird Baseball Mattress The Family from One End Street Bike lane debate Childbirth Seat belt Chevrolet Corvair Jam (TV series) Douglas DC-8 Mitsubishi 3000GT Ford Mustang Crash test dummy School bus Car handling Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Car body style Metroid (video game species) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an German car number plates Kimberly-Clark Corporation Sex assignment Blood Simple NASCAR The Contender (television series) Utility cycling London Congestion Charge Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Headlight Shaggy dog story Ocean's Twelve Walt Disney World Railroad DragonFly BSD Urinary incontinence Friends Seat belt legislation Personal rapid transit Airport Herpes simplex virus Knots Landing Bicycle Social rule Ben Johnson (athlete) Recumbent bicycle Station wagon Pregnancy Cruising (maritime) Rules of the road Bond Elevator 2000 Australian Grand Prix Infantilism Saab 900 2005 United States Grand Prix Road safety Passenger car Israeli Arab Status of religious freedom in Malaysia Doomsday argument Baby Blues Traffic light Ford Falcon Manual transmission Mountaineering Mini Wind turbine MTR Hollywood Squares Electrophysiology Bicycle helmet Car classification Rail terminology Chair Sport utility vehicle Rajput Charmed Beltway sniper attacks Toyota MR2 Segregated cycle facilities Azaria Chamberlain disappearance
