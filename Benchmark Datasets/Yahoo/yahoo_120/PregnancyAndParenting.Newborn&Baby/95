my month old refuses to sleep on his back any advice i tried tricking him into sleeping on his back by letting him sleeping in my arms for mins before laying him down he'll sleep for a max of hours before realizing he's on his back and wake up screaming i've tried everything swing carseat boppy placing him on his side with a towel or blanket infront and behind him i even bought a foam to make him feel snug and giving him a little cereal he rolled over at days old and again at a week old and hasn't stopped since i think placing the blankets and foam makes him feel restricted i can place him on his back oneway only to find him facing the oppisite way when i check on him i even found him in the corner of the bed on his stomach with one arm hanging off when he's on his stomach i roll him back over onto his back only to him awaking up screaming refusing to go back to sleep no matter how tired he is i've read all the articles on sids and done the research is there anything i haven't tried that may work help sorry i worded my question wrong and as unbelieveable as it may sound yes my baby did roll over at days and also a week old even the nurse couldn't believe her eyes when he was in the hospital for jaundice my son had jaundice when he was born and had to stay in the hospital after i was discharged for days they had him under the special light on his tummy in just a diaper pretty much constantly for those days except for feedings needless to say once we brought him home from the hospital he hated to be swaddled and would not stay asleep on his back we made the decision to let him sleep on his tummy he took a pacifier shown to help prevent sids and just made sure there was no loose bedding or anything he was born in the winter so those blanket sleepers worked great instead of a blanket my son is a healthy month old even though he didn't sleep on his back like he was supposed to babies usually start rolling over at months anyway and some will roll on to their tummies no matter how you put them to sleep i'm sure your baby will be fine just make sure there are no pillows or animals in the bed and have a monitor just in case if you're really worried they have a baby monitor that has a sensor mat you put under the bedding if it detects no movement or breathing for seconds an alarm will beep good luck Mattress Breastfeeding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sudden infant death syndrome Sleep Shaggy dog story Knots Landing Stomach cancer EastEnders Sin City Care Bears Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kurt Cobain Milton H.
