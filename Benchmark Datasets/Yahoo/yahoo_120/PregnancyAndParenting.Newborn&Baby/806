cloth nappies opinions please am weeks preg and just wondering how good cloth nappies such as bambino mio are like the idea in principle but have heard mixed reports ie leaking x misspinkkitten has given you some excellent websites go check them out there are tons of nappies you can get and you don't have to buy all the same brand just like disposables different nappies suit different babies there are different fastenings fit rise absorbancy i started off with disposables and now am cloth i have loads of brands a colour and pattern for every outfit bulky ones slim fit ones i have a little girl and there's no need for fancy knickers under skirts and dresses when you have a funky all in one nappy or wrap we have tots bots bamboozles with which you need a seperate wrap and are reasonably slim fitting these are the most absorbant nappies i have go overnight easily and suit my baby's shape she's fairly slim and tall i have the aplix fastening they are available with different fasteners and several funky colours they come in two sizes which is up to about lb then which is about months to potty these take a long time to dry i also have some tots bots fluffles which are huge very big nappies i use a fleece wrap with these overnight fleece lets the botty breathe and the wetness evaporate through unlike plastic no good for under clothes but overnight really extends the nappy's absorbency there are pockets in fluffles which you can stuff with whatever material you like to increase wearing time these dry quickly and come in the same sizes as bamboozles never had a leak with these i have an babylove all in one nappy with has a built in liner and wrap it's easy to use but doesn't really suit my baby's shape which is why i only have one i have some wonderoos which are all in ones very funky colours very good nappies soft inner though take a while to dry these come in s m l some babies never need large popper fastening i have had a few leaks with these mainly because they are so very slim fitting but that also means they go under any outfit just like a disposable i have some motherease although i have heard tell that these are better for boys they are simple shaped cotton terry nappies with seperate wraps which are popper fastening at the side this is good for when your baby is older and tries to pull their nappy off these need changing more often than the tots bots i find but leaks are rare i have some cotton bottoms these like bambino mio are big squares of terry fabric that you simply fold into three and put between your baby's legs with a wrap over the top very simple a lot cheaper especially the birth to potty packs slim fitting round the sides some funky wraps out there the drawbacks are they need changing more often and are more prone to leakage especially solid leakage just because they don't go all round your baby you'll need to upsize these several times between birth and potty i have some happy hempys these dry fast but do stiffen up with repeated use pocket nappies very very absorbant need a seperate wrap three sizes s m l i have some cotton tots these are the funkiest nappies around pocket nappies all in one so you stuff them with whatever you need you can get these custom made with your choice of fleece colour for the inside and even the colour of the poppers very funky patterns indeed and very slim fitting absolutely fab for containing liquid stay dry as a bone when stuffed with a microfibre cloth three sizes s m l need changing more often as so slim fitting but very funky see i have too many to name seriously it is possible to get excited about nappies what i would do had i to start over i would get a set of newborn cotton bottoms or bambino mio along with a couple of size tots bots bamboozles and a wrap i'd use the cotton bottoms through the day on my new baby and the bamboozles at night then when he'she started to outgrow the newborn at about months i would start buying individual nappies one a week say to grow your collection and find which brand works best for you try looking on ebay there's a great selection of individual nappies on there and usually a lot of size ones and newborn size going cheap i get most of mine from there or if you're in the uk try the links below for some seriously good advice i really hope this helps you're always going to have a leak sometimes but if you find the nappies that work best for you and your little one you should be just fine try searching for your local council's website a lot of council run subsidies and will give you money back towards the startup cost of cloth or send you a free cloth nappy starter pack worth looking into even if you don't go for full time cloth in the end i wish you the best of luck and congratulations on your pregnancy Menstrual
