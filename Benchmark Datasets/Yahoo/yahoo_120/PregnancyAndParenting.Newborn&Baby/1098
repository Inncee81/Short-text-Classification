did you baby eat zucchini or did you have to mix it with another vegetable i make baby food for the families i work for as a nanny and many children find zucchini tasty on its own as it is very milk in flavour the peel itself though tends to be an issue when served mashed alone as it's rougher the problem with the peel seems to vanish when mixed with other fruits and vegetables zucchini eggplant carrots and yams sweet potatoes is a nice mix for baby around months after they've had the savoury and are moving on to sweeter foods also add rice if baby is okay with this texture just mess around with flavours and see what your baby likes zucchini is a great filler in baby foods if you are trying to introduce something new again because it is mild in flavour French cuisine Dumpling Tofu Cuisine of Africa Japanese cuisine Cuisine of Singapore Food preservation Peruvian cuisine Pancake Carrot Tea Ice cream Bengali cuisine Korean cuisine German cuisine Rice pudding Cuisine of the Southern United States Yam Curry Cuisine of the Philippines Mashed potato Soup Cuisine of Greece Potato Cuisine of Thailand Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Denmark Plantain Vegetarian cuisine Beer Polish cuisine Pizza Zucchini Kelantan Vinegar Cuisine of Malaysia Russian cuisine Food Jewish cuisine Apple Domesticated turkey Soul food Yoghurt Cantonese cuisine Chicken soup Chocolate Sushi Vegetarianism Pot Noodle Cuisine of Laos Date Palm Barbecue Soy sauce Root vegetable British cuisine Breakfast Quinoa Mooncake Cake Culture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Sauce Chinese cuisine Potato pancakes Fruit Banana Bread Cholent Couscous Healthy eating Kiwifruit Cheese Swedish cuisine Cuisine of Turkey Fish and chips Veganism Roman eating and drinking Sweet potato Potato chips Nabemono Salad Taiwanese cuisine Cha chaan teng Buddhist cuisine Hamburger Hot pot Milk Durian Hangi Sake Japanese New Year Wine Jelly Cuisine of Vietnam
