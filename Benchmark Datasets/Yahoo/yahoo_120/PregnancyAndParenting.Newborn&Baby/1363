question about lowering the mattress in my babies crib she's months old and probably very soon she will be able to pull herself up checked the instructions w the crib and if you lower the mattress you have to remove the front rail b c it turns into a bed then well i can't do that so is there anything i could put over the crib to insure her saftey like how the have baby nets and such even tho a net won't work lol is there anything out there to help this problem or will i have to just buy something else it's a simplicity crib if that matters after you lower the mattress you should be able to put the rail back on otherwise the crib makers weren't thinking if i were you i would call the manufacture to see if part of the instructions are missing because if they made the crib that wont be safe for the entire time they say a child should be able to use it they should have to pay for one that will it doesn't make sense to make a crib that turns into a bed when you wouldn't be able to use it for a good year or more of the child's life Mattress Cribbage Lisa's First Word Poker jargon Indianapolis 500 Theory of conduct Visual Basic Passenger car Vacuum mattress Bed (furniture) GLOCK Friends Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) The Critic The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Humphrey Bogart Microeconomics M16 (rifle) Philosophical skepticism Knots Landing Kasparov versus The World Compiler optimization Bedbug Rail tracks Firefighter Assassination Citigroup Donald Neilson Extreme Programming Publicly funded medicine Blood Simple Blackjack Shaggy dog story Ra (board game) Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Kodocha Procrastination The Amazing Race Economy of the United States Theodicy Short selling Wal-Mart EastEnders Textile manufacturing Miss Saigon Good Times About a Boy Bazeries cylinder Mutual fund Economic history of Canada Summa Theologiae Industrial Revolution Married... with Children Abortion debate Ocean's Twelve Table tennis Social Security debate (United States) Co-sleeping CPU cache Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Episodes of Lost (Season 1) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Kitesurfing Strap-on dildo Betting (poker) Charmed Bond History of Chicago Back pain Cryptanalysis of the Enigma Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dog training She Loves You Tax Condom Transformation problem Olduwan CPU design FairTax Let's Make a Deal Keynesian economics School bus Peter Shilton Inventory John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Personal finance Skateboarding trick Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Aerial (dance move) Paintball Little Girl Lost (The Twilight Zone) Time Out of Mind Professional wrestling throws Menstrual cup Equine conformation The nature of God in Western theology Pickup truck Breech birth Tire
