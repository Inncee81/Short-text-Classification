choking baby my daughter is months old now but ever since she was born by csection she seems to choke all the time on her own saliva milk and spit up when she was just born and up to weeks i had episodes where she scared me to death by choking she starting flailing her legs and arms like she was drowning thankfully for of the episodes i was still in the hospital and the nurses helped me out she is what my doctor calls a spitty baby too she spits up a lot as she's gotten older sometimes we'll go a couple days without a lot of spit up but she's still doing it i was so scared for her to sleep on her back when she was smaller because i was afraid she'd choke to death she now will roll to her side even if placed on her back so i don't worry as much but she sleeps right next to me so i can hear her in case she chokes my question is could there be something wrong with her my doctor doesn't seem to take it seriously and it is getting better as she gets older but i worry no this sounds normal my kids did this my oldest spit up huge amounts and this is sometimes cause for concern but if you hear them gulping and not seeming to breathe watch her and she should work it out herself if not pick her up and burp her sometimes if you've not burped her well enough she could do this or spit up more also i like laying my babies on they're side instead of back or tummy if you are really concerned and feel there is a problem see a different pediatrician Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urinary incontinence Childbirth Bart chalkboard gags Professional wrestling holds Rose (Doctor Who) EastEnders Unreal Kodocha The Empty Child Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Aerial (dance move) Prostate cancer Friends Insomnia Jam (TV series) Social rule The Contender (television series) Care Bears Darth Vader Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Piccolo Junior Saga Diving Conspiracy (TNG episode) The Curse of Fenric Breech birth The McGuire Sisters Characters in the Smurfs Professional wrestling throws The Adventures of Pete & Pete Sin City Ron and Fez Phoebe Halliwell Father's Day (Doctor Who) AFI 100 Years series Maggie Simpson The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Recurring South Park characters Jon Secada The League of Gentlemen (comedy) The Ashlee Simpson Show Elephant Knots Landing Cat Brian Jones (musician) The Tracey Ullman Show shorts FoxTrot Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Britney Spears The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Suspicion (film) Teachers (film) Piccolo (Dragon Ball) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Lisa's First Word About a Boy Neighbours Stomach cancer Love and Theft Hyperthermia Charmed Abdominal thrusts House of M Joke Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Mario Night (book) Sleeping Murder Babe Ruth Avenue Q The Apprentice 3 Anxiety Toilet humour Sesame Street, Season 35 Singlish Theory of conduct Kid Buu Saga Milton H.
