i had my rst scan today at weeks i saw the baby but i did she did hear the heartbeat is it normal not to hear the heartbaby on the first scan will it be performed on the nd scan did your doctor try to listen for the heartbeat and and couldn't hear it if so then that's not normal usually with an ultrasound you don't normally hear the heartbeat unless they actually make the machine pick it up this may have not been done you should have been able to see the heart beating and your doctor may have pointed this out if there was something wrong i'm sure the doctor would have told you usually you hear the heartbeat when they use the doppler in the office to listen to it that will probably be done at your next appointment and every consecutive one there after you will probably have to specifically ask to hear the heartbeat at an ultrasound because it not routine to hear it they usually just get a visual to be sure everything is okay hth Breech birth Miscarriage Medical ultrasonography Heart Obstetrics Cardiac arrhythmia Medical imaging Stroke Van Morrison Ultrasound Radiology Heart rate Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Pregnancy Prenatal diagnosis Heartbeat (television) The Curse of Fenric Childbirth Ben Johnson (athlete) Aortic dissection Rush Limbaugh Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ovarian cyst Social rule Hearing (sense) The Parting of the Ways Stuttering Urinary incontinence Anxiety Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures Mumia Abu-Jamal Blood pressure True Crime: Streets of LA Left-handed Loudspeaker Radiation therapy Traumatic brain injury Voxel Prolactinoma The Empty Child Joke Hypnosis Mary Wells Colony in Space Computed tomography Cardiac output Radar Atherosclerosis Phoebe Halliwell Sound Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Contender (television series) Electrocardiogram Intravascular ultrasound It's All Gone Pete Tong Halting problem Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Long Game Human brain Prostate cancer MP3 Breast cancer Blood on the Tracks Marching band Prenatal care Slow Train Coming Syringomyelia Embedded system Intact dilation and extraction One Piece minor characters Wheel of Fortune The Doctor Dances Action potential Malignant melanoma Hearing impairment Highway 61 Revisited Time Out of Mind The Jazz Singer Chiropractic The Two Doctors Mario Philips Jam (TV series) Smokey Robinson Aortic aneurysm Jon Secada Extraordinary Machine Hearing aid Endometrial cancer Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Paget's disease of bone Tachycardia Echocardiography Cirrhosis Gloria Estefan Paul Is Dead Heart sounds Killian documents The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases Positron emission tomography
