flying baby i am taking my son who is months on a plane this month and i was wondering if anyone knew the regulations as far as carrying on formula bottled water etc are they pretty strict about it i've been flying internationally and domestically with my children since they were months now here are some tips and advice that have always worked for me and i hope will help you you will need to have all your son's documents in order it is a good idea to keep a copy of his notarized birth certificate with you verify what travel documents you will need in advance to make sure you have everything faa regulations currently allow children under the age of two to fly free of charge as lap children not required to have their own seat you will need to inform the airline ahead of time that you will have a small infant traveling with you the flight attendants should place you in a front seat where you will have more room because of the length of flight the flight attendants should also give you a bassinet that attaches to the front wall to put your child in however you can not uses this during taxi take offs landings or turbulence this is not the safest way for a child to fly and the airlines recommend children to have their own seat with a child safety device i advise using a crs child restraint system because it is safe for the child especially during turbulence makes them feel secure is more comfortable for both parent and child and gives both of you the opportunity to relax a bit a crs is a hard backed child safety seat car seat that is approved by the government for use in both motor vehicles and aircraft in order to be certified for use on an airplane the car seat has to met the federal motor vehicle safety standards check the labels on the side of your car restraint for a sticker words will be printed in red for verification that your seat is safe for airplane use many airlines offer half price tickets so parents can be guaranteed that their child can travel in a crs device you should call your airline to ask for a discount and or ask what the airline's policy is for using empty seats for take offs and landings the best thing you can do to help with the ear popping is if your son is nursing nurse him if he is not nursing give your son something to drink formula milk water juice it doesn't matter or a pacifier baby formula is fine to take and you are not limited to the amount you can bring aboard as long as your child is with you do not worry http www tsa gov travelers airtravel children formula shtm new regulations allow you to take beverages including water from home as long as they are less than oz or beverages including water of any size that you have purchased from inside the security area onto planes you can also bring a limited amount of baby food onto the plane with you http www tsa gov travelers airtravel prohibited permitted prohibited items shtm save your money when it comes to buying water though because the flight attendants will provide you with hot or cold water or any other drink free at any time that you request no matter how many times you request it another trick is that if your child is not taking to the pacifier or wanting to drink gently rub his neck from the chin down to the chest several times this will cause a swallowing motion which will help with the ears popping make sure to pack plenty of things to entertain your child such as a few comfort things such as a favorite blankie or stuffed animal be sure to pack changes of clothes for your child you will need this in case he gets sick spills something on himself or in case your luggage gets lost keep your diaper bag well stocked with plenty of diapers wipes ointments and other essential things baby nail clippers and scissors are not allowed though just remember the new regulating liquids gels and such and pack accordingly you can usually find travel size baby products in stores and they are wonderful for plane use you should be respectful of other passengers and always change your child's diaper in the restroom they do have diaper bed changers in there although they can be a little small keep your doctors name and number with you also get the name and number of a doctor where you are visiting in case an emergency should come up it is a good idea to have a check up with your doctor before leaving to make sure your child is healthy enough to fly if he has even a slight cold the pressure in his ears during take off and landing even if you do the precaution methods could leave his ears aching for days after the flight most doctors recommend that if anyone is sick such as being stuffed up or already having an earache not to take the flight because of the potential damage to the ears i know my husband and other pilots do not work if they are sick because of this danger bring any medications that you might need for your child should he get sick or that he takes regularly remember that if they are not prescription medications the oz rule applies to them and they must be kept in a clear plastic bag do not give your child medicine with the hopes of it making him sleep this is not only cruel but dangerous as well last but not least if help is offered to you take it if i can be of any more help or assistance please feel free to contact me Airbus A380 Urinary incontinence Air safety Fecal
