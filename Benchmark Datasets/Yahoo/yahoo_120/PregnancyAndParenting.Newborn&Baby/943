highchair floor mat does anyone know where i can find a nice plastic floor mat for use under a highchair i dont want anything with cartoons or nursery decor we called ours a splat mat and got it at babies r us however it did have some geometric designs on it just my two cents don't bother with it unless you're feeding him on carpet the mat still needs to be cleaned and washed if you are on anything else but carpet you'll be sweeping and mopping anyway we used ours for about a month and then abandoned it it's a good idea but much more work than i wanted to do Carpet Vacuum cleaner Chair Textile manufacturing Bathroom Stairway Christmas tree Japanese tea ceremony Professional wrestling throws Jute 2001: A Space Odyssey Mat Textile manufacturing terminology Persian rug Brush Aerial (dance move) Toilet humour Mat Cauthon Basement Mosaic Onam Barry Minkow Toilet Shark Roof Professional wrestling attacks Aladdin (1992 film) New Zealand flax Plastic Jennifer Lopez Salah Repouss__ and chasing King Khalid International Airport Japanese architecture Urinal Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Bowls Plasticizer Book of Kells Japanese toilet Professional wrestling aerial techniques Sento Korean art Violin The Fast Show Crop circle Wallpaper group Animal Crossing Dry cleaning Port Coquitlam, British Columbia Sant Mat Bedbug Space Quest Washing machine New Zealand dollar Coir Racquetball Lahore Sundial Russian joke Bulk vending Washroom Reinforced concrete Humphrey Bogart House dust mite Frederick & Nelson Yerba mate Carl Barks Dial M for Murder Printed circuit board Sleeping Murder Punk ideology DDT (professional wrestling) Kitchen Dishwashing Sperm Whale Modernism Art Eminem Singlish Baby bottle The Apprentice 2 Weaving Ankara Oscilloscope Monticello Mousepad Characters in the Smurfs Atomic Kitten Fiberglass Applique Therion (band) Changeroom Marilyn Monroe Temple (Mormonism) Insulation Celtic art Tattoo Wood carving
