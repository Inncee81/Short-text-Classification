is it okay for a baby to eat only one kind of fruit and only one kind of vegie my baby only likes smashed banannas and sweet potatoes with applesauce should she be getting more of a variety of fruits and vegies or is it okay to just feed her that everyday if that is all that she likes i try getting her to eat new things she'll give me a ugly look and spit the food out then she'll act like she's tired and start scearming she's almost months and she's on formula she snacks on cherieos and biter biscuits a bit of ice cream here and there um she sometimes eats a little chicken that i cut into small chunks but never enough to make a meal out of it i really don't know what to do it's prob a good thing that she is seeing her doctor on monday for her checkup ok basically most babies are very picky eaters their tongue is a lot more sensitive than ours but it is very important that they eat more than just one kind you didn't tell your babys age but i'm assuming she's still getting breastmilk or formula if thats the case you wouldn't have to worry about her nutrition but if you don't get her to learn to like new foods now she will grow up to be sensitive about what she eats making her a picky eater also when she is weaned from the bottle mother she will need more of a balanced diet so you might as well start her out now Breastfeeding Hamster Potato Food Japanese cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Fecal incontinence Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Malaysia Street food Cuisine of Denmark Eating Jewish cuisine Ramen Veganism Breakfast Cat Snack food McDonald's Ice cream Vegetarianism Humphrey Bogart Coeliac disease Chinese cuisine Soybean Bengali cuisine Bread Garfield Cuisine of Brazil Sauce Korean cuisine Characters in the Smurfs Healthy eating Stomach cancer Little Britain Pancake Tomato Coffee Chicken Hot dog Milk Folic acid Meal Happy Tree Friends Elephant Soup Egg (food) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an MRE Cuisine of Austria Banana Polish cuisine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Rocko's Modern Life Cuisine of Africa French cuisine British cuisine Pie Cha chaan teng Fancy rat Fasting Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler FoxTrot Tea Sweet potato Tooth The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Cheese Adjustable gastric band Nutrition Watermelon Vegetarianism and religion Friends Kodocha 2000 Australian Grand Prix Soft drink Hamburger Pumpkin Trailer Park Boys Shark Cereal Dim sum Plantain Potato chips EastEnders Soul food Piccolo Junior Saga Domestic rabbit Joke Maize Milton H.
