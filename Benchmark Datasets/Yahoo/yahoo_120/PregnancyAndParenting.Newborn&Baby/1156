which brand of diapers my neighboor across the street just had a baby she keeps asking me which diaper brand is the bast what do you think abaout the diapers i mean for my son we started with pampers swaddlers but he was tiny so he would leak out the side on occasion we also tried huggies and they were just awful constant leaks out the side up the back i had been given packs of parents choice from walmart at my baby shower and so far they have been the best because they just seem to fit better they work great when he has super pees haha i swear sometimes i don't know where the liquid comes from now that he is getting bigger month old we have been using up the leftover pampers from the beginning and they work just fine tell your neighbor to sign up for samples online and try them out that way they will usually send you diapers sealed in plastic i used those for the first few days he was home to see what worked best then she can figure out what fits and if her child has any type of reaction to them diaper rash etc i personally am still sticking by the cheap parents choice from walmart though no sense in paying more if i found one that works Diaper Infantilism Urinary incontinence Procter & Gamble Genericized trademark Fecal incontinence Wal-Mart Ageplay Elimination communication Humphrey Bogart Cytomegalovirus Infant Aqua Teen Hunger Force Plame affair Jackass: The Movie Carburetor Let It Be...
