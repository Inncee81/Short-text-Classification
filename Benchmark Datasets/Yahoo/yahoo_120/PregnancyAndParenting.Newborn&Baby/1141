i just went thru c section months now my baby is on my feed totally i feel a lot hungry n i am hogging my doubt is what ever i hog gets converted into milk or will it add as my weight coz i already grew kgs so further weight gain is not a pleasant thought can some one guide me okay every one tells you that breastfeeding helps loose weight right well thats not entirely true while it does burn more than calories a day if you are eating more than you burn then the weight won't come off and you will actually gain weight i went through and am going through the same thing i had a c section and still look pregnant at months and that it with running miles a day my suggestion is to drink water first plus water is actually what helps you produce milk what you eat will not be converted into milk but it can have an effect on how it tastes just like eating curries make your sweat smell different and then decide if you are hungary lastest studies have shown that you don't need to add more food to your diet be smart about what you are eating also depending on your fitness level don't do anything that will make the incision worse make sure you are walking alot i just started running before that i just walked everyday it may not take the weight of but it keeps you stable and prevents more weight gain and you feel better Breastfeeding Milk Dieting Atkins Nutritional Approach Tooth Fecal incontinence Obesity Super Size Me Chocolate Anorexia nervosa Tofu Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fasting Oily fish Egg (food) Garfield Cuisine of Malaysia Cheese Weight training Dairy Soy milk Aspartame Coeliac disease Friends Sugar substitute Social rule Omega-3 fatty acid Nutrition Little Britain Prostate cancer Bong Coconut crab Vegetarianism Stomach cancer Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Tocopherol Garlic Curry Water Tea Veganism Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Hypoglycemia Family farm hog pen Vitamin D Soft drink The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Bodybuilding Healthy eating Ham Low-carbohydrate diet Adjustable gastric band Hyperglycemia Pig 613 mitzvot Diarrhea Colorectal cancer Acne Humphrey Bogart Insulin RuneScape quests Protein-energy malnutrition Vampire Diabetes mellitus Pregnancy Guinea pig Clinical depression Elephant Agriculture Trailer Park Boys The Contender (television series) Domestic goat Local food Organic food Breast milk Kashrut Explosive material Fertility awareness Domestic rabbit Food Tlingit Alcoholic beverage Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Indianapolis 500 Breakfast Sage Japanese tea ceremony EastEnders Coffee Cuisine of Denmark Raw food diet Dietary fiber Red Hot Chili Peppers Photosynthesis Jet engine Ron and Fez
