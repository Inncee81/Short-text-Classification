ok i will try another catagory to list question in dr did internal exam today need help understand what he need help understanding what he ment please posted in pregnancy catagory and didnt get much intrest so im trying new born cuz all you moms have just been in my shoes thanks in advace ok well the dr keeps bouncing back and forth as to how far along i am he says weeks one week the next any who here is my question i had an internal exam today to see if i was dialated or anything he said that your cervice starts out at inchecs thick and mine is now about and inches thick and i have lost about inch does this mean that my cervics is efacing he also said my cervics is closed i asume that is no dialation but that he can put a finger in there and feel the babys head he is going on vacation for a week but said when he gets back that he will rough me up to get things moving does that mean that he will strip membranes or something i would have asked all this to him but i was not really dumbfounded until i got home and started thinking about what he had said any opinions are aprecated what do you make of this thanks to the two who answered already its aprecated just wanted a few more opinions additional details second ago i guess you would have to know the dr to understand his sence of humor the rough you up comment is just him he is really a good dr i really like him and would not change i just had a dumb moment and didnt understand what he ment exactly thanks you're right about everything you thought effacement is change in the thickness of the cervix so from what your doctor said you're about effaced you will eventually get to effaced but this sometimes happens during labor as you dilate the dilatation is just as you said it's when the cervix starts to open up so closed means no dilatation yet the fact that he can get his finger in to touch the baby's head means that your cervix is getting soft and he can slide the finger up there softening of the cervix is the beginning of the ripening of the cervix in preparation for dilatation this is normal for your stage of pregnancy i would say that roughing you up is your doctor's humorous way of describing stripping your membranes doctors do this because this is believed to release prostaglandins a type of hormone that will help to continue to ripen soften the cervix the cervix needs to be nice and soft in order to dilate so that's why they do this some people are against doctors stripping membranes because it's uncomfortable for the woman and doesn't allow the process to occur naturally but it does often help to move things along toward labor hope this helps Childbirth Pregnancy Cervix Abortion Intact dilation and extraction Breech birth Fertility awareness Prostate cancer Gonorrhoea Cancer Obstetrics Abortion debate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gynaecology Menstrual cycle Human papillomavirus Fast bowling Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Friends Strap-on dildo Cervical cancer Theory of conduct Signal transduction Breastfeeding Wound healing phases Shaggy dog story Volleyball In vitro fertilisation Humphrey Bogart Intersex surgery Stenberg v.
