what if your baby hates blankets and being swaddled my week old hates being swaddled and kicks off her blanket as soon as she's awake enough to realize it's on i bought a sleep sack which seems to be acceptable though she does work to kick her feet out is it possible she's just warm natured and doesn't require the extra covering she doesn't have a fever house temp is set at f and i'm cold natured i can't imagine the one layer more than what you need applying to her my son would not tolerate having his arms restrained from the moment he was born he also has always needed one less layer of clothing than everyone else your daughter may just not like having warm feet or she may be warm overall just touch the top of her head or the back of her neck and you will know if she is warm or cool lips work best to check temperature and you thought mommies kissed babies all the time for no reason seriously stop listening to the books the friends the relatives and listen to your baby they know what they need better than anyone else of course you can try other people's suggestions but if they don't work they don't work Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story Garfield Global warming Diving suit Milton H.
