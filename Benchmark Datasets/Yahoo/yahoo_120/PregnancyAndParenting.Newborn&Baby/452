anyone have a problem with their cat jumping in the babys crib etc i am mos pregnant and have male cat who is yr old so far he seems to obey well except lately he's been a little bad we moved to a new place that could be why stress etc so my question pertains to my concern about if he may somehow jump into the babys crib while she's sleeping and possibly suffocate her he already jumped from a box onto her changing table once and grabbed an item of hers in the middle of the night and i found it the next morning on the bathroom floor i don't want to put up a protective tent or shut her in her room so i'm hoping it won't be a problem st time mom and st time cat owner ahh pets can be very dangerous for little ones especially cats because they are known to be more needy the fact that the cat has already taken something of the babies and the baby is not even here yet is not a good sign my parents have a jack russel and when i was at there house for the first months after my daughter had been born we made sure he was never near her unsupervised and he was always locked up when nobody could watch him in at night he went to bed with my parents and they shut their door tight so he could not get out i would recomend having a friend our family member take the cat for a while or lock him in a certain room at night and when the baby is in their room and you cant watch the cat Friends The Tracey Ullman Show shorts EastEnders Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Shining (film) Characters of Lost Domestic rabbit Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Phoebe Buffay's songs Sudden infant death syndrome Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Inside Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Cat Knots Landing The Fairly OddParents The Star Wars Holiday Special Co-sleeping The Doctor Dances Trainspotting (novel) Professional wrestling match types Rose (Doctor Who) Pet skunk Housebreaking Bad Wolf Boom Town (Doctor Who) Hamster Fancy rat Lisa's First Word The Brady Bunch Guinea pig Kurt Cobain Fancy Crane The Death Gate Cycle Neighbours Garfield RuneScape quests My Family (television) Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Conker's Bad Fur Day Baby Blues Tupac Shakur Lorelai Gilmore Shen Gong Wu Richard Chase Jumpstart 3rd Grade Fruits Basket Humphrey Bogart Toilet Kakapo 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Ferret Blood Simple The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Night of the Creeps Sharon Tate What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
