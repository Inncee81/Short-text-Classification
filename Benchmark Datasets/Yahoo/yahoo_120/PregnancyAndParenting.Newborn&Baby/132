i think my son is going through separation anxiety during his nap times but i'm not sure this has just recently started this week he is mths old when he goes down for a nap he is asleep and then mins into his nap he is waking up screaming if i stand there and rub pat his back he will fall back to sleep but i refuse to do that everytime he naps if i don't rub pat his back then he will just keep screaming until i finally go in and just get him up and say forget the nap we are both very stressed out help why do you refuse to do that every time he naps i don't mean that rudely but if that works and allows him to nap and you to get work done then what's the harm eventually he will not take naps any more so it isn't like you are going to be rubbing his back for more years he obviously is feeling some anxiety about being away from you and he needs you to reassure him that you are still there as long as you aren't picking him up i think a few back rubs to reassure him are appropriate Shaggy dog story Siesta Polyphasic sleep Blitzball Jam (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Narcolepsy Knots Landing Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March New Alliance Party Futurama (TV series - season 5) Nap Lajoie Urinary incontinence Anxiety The Amber Spyglass Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe New York Giants Dilbert Miss Saigon Salad Fingers Philosophical skepticism Oakland Athletics Cat Social rule The Stone Roses Lucid dreaming Memorial Stadium, Clemson Mattress Sleep paralysis General anxiety disorder Pok__mon Live!
