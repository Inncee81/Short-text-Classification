breastfeeding hi everyone i am wks preg and i am planning on breastfeeding i have a strange question to ask about it i know the benefits of it however i have some of my friends have insisted that their breasts were never the same for example one of my friends says that they are now lopsided another says one is bigger than the other another says her nipples are all messed up and yet another feels like they were stretched out so much that she is going to get them fixed i am just wondering how much of this is true or are they just exaggerating i just want to be prepared for the worst does breastfeeding really ruin your breasts i'd love to hear from moms who have breastfeed thanks hello there first of all i would like to congratulate you on making the wise and wonderful decision to breastfeed your baby it shows that you have really done your homework and that you are really dedicated to giving your baby the very best good for you i just want to tell you that every day they find new and wonderful things that breastmilk can do for you and for your baby it amazes me and i have been studying breastfeeding and all that it entails for about years did you know that just your colostrum alone protects your baby against potentially fatal diseases no kidding i can not imagine any loving responsible mother who would chose not to breastfeed unless there was a clear cut medical reason why she could not anyway back to your question i can only tell you that in my experience and it has been extensive the answer is no breastfeeding does not ruin your breasts i am sure that if you were to investigate a bit more closely you would find that the women who insisted that breastfeeding had ruined their breasts had probably gained a significant amount of weight over and above the recommended lbs it is weight gain and subsequent rapid weight loss that takes a toll on your breasts not breastfeeding to be precise i guess i should say it is weight loss that really does it when you lose or pounds while it may have been necessary it leaves your breasts noticably less firm and just changed from the way they were when you had the extra weight i don't think that there is any way around that i breastfed four babies until they were between and months old and it certainly never hurt the appearance of my breasts at all that is of course the only personal up close knowledge that i have other than that i know what women have told me and what i have observed in the many women that i have helped with breastfeeding issues i think that the bottom line is if pregnancy weight gain and breastfeeding are going to make changes in your breasts there is little that you can do about it heredity and your personal body size and shape have a lot to do with it if you are concerned i would say that you should keep your weight gain within the normal range and not go on any crash diets to try to lose weight after you are done breastfeeding rapid weight loss makes a big difference all in all i have to say that when looking at the effects that breastfeeding may or may not have on your breasts the bottom line is that the benefits of breastfeeding far and away are more significant than any changes to the appearance of your breasts i am not saying that it does not matter vanity they name is woman but it is surely not the most important thing lets face it pregnancy itself makes a difference in the way your body is going to look but we do not decide not to have babies it is part of the whole package i guess it is probably different for each woman but in my experience it is not breastfeeding that changes the shape and size of a woman's breasts but rather rapid weight loss and pregnancy itself have a wonderful time breastfeeding your little one you have a wonderful adventure ahead of you remember to get lots of rest eat and drink when the baby does and take good care of yourself the same way you did when you were pregnant feel free to write to me if you have any questions i would be happy to help take care and enjoy the wonderful time ahead of you love and blessings lady trinity Fertility awareness Folic acid Abortion debate Social rule Theory of conduct Pregnancy
