baby name for girl aaliyah my first daughter's name is stefani not too girly and it fits her personality i kind of like the name aaliyah but i can't get past it sounding so girly does anyone else like this name and has it become too common i'm in my th month already and i still can't decide on a name i also liked the name leilani or even chantal so is aaliyah leilani or chantal better i live in portland or originally from colorado eve is very old and common my sis in law is eva i think one is enough i do appreciate opinions even from the other side of the world i would like to think my daughters will not be confined to staying only in this country if they decided otherwise okay i forgot to mention that aaliyah was a singer actress that died about years ago in a plane crash at the age of for those who don't know she was very talented and a sweet person it's pronounced aah lee aah i mean aah lee uh i think aaliyah is a nice name i don't think it is too girly either i can't believe some people's comments but i do understand that sometimes a name just doesn't sound right until you can put it to a face for example my friend decided to call her third baby monique and people had their doubts about it and actually said them to her face after the baby was born she went ahead and called her monique anyway because she liked the name and she was naming her after her mother monica monique is now months old and she has a lovely personality and all those people who insulted her name before she was born all think it is now a lovely name i think because they can now put the name to a face and it actually belongs to someone so i guess i'm saying you decide which name you like and don't take other people's comments too much to heart because when you have a lovely little daughter in your arms and you're calling her by whatever name you decide it will seem right i prefer aaliyah out of the three names you mentioned not too common not too girly Aaliyah R.
