grunting and wheezing noises my mth old was sent to childrens hospital to check for respritory distress due to grunitng when exhaling and wheezing noises docotrs took x rays stating nothing wrong and noises normal but he wouldn't make the noises in the hopsital when the doctors or nurses where tthere he did them in front of the pediatrician that refered us to the hospital and so i then video taped him and played it to the pediatrician who is now refering us to a pulminolgist anyone had such problems he really grunts alot when laying on his back and can only sleep like and hr at a time we rolled him on his belly two nights ago and he sleeps for hrs on average please no sid's freak outs we are careful to watch him all night but he can't get any sleep otherwise which made him just screaming for lack of sleep but his grunting mostly goes away when on his belly and he sleeps but now he stopped pooping perhaps it could also be the tempature in the room cause if u find out he has got problems then that could one of the things that trigger it off for example he could have some sort of asthma i know my self when am in room where its stuffy i can feel myself wheezy and breathing hard perhaps it is the same for him but he is getting it worse due him only being a month old has he been checked for asthma or has anyone in ur family got asthma as for stop pooping the only thing i can think is not enough fiber in his food or might have something wrong with his bowel anyways i hope this helped a little bit hope ur wee boy gets better soon Asthma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breastfeeding Sin City Urinary incontinence Fecal incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Toilet humour 2000 Australian Grand Prix Shaggy dog story Chronic fatigue syndrome Triage Kingdom Hospital Sudden infant death syndrome Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Psychiatric hospital The Shining (film) Mattress EastEnders Pitaten Allergy Breath of Fire III One Tree Hill (TV series) 1957 World Series The Long Game Marilyn Monroe Hypoglycemia Full Metal Panic?
