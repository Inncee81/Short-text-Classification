can anyone explain how you dealt with being unable to bond with your baby my son's girlfriend has said she hates this baby he was a preemie and spent the first weeks of his life in the nicu about an hours drive away he is an excellent baby such a bundle of joy i bonded with both of my boys instantly so i'm having a hard time understanding this can anyone shed some light on this for me he is months old now no i never told her i bonded with my boys immediately she had a terrible pregnancy as well she was so sick hospitalized times for dehydration etc then spent weeks on total bed rest before she gave birth it really was a nightmare for her i had a difficult pregnancy months of throwing up and a blood clot at weeks after the blood clot i had months of painfully twice daily sots to disolve the clot i felt horrible most of my pregnancy i started to see giving birth not as a joyful time but as end to my nightmare i was induced at weeks but after hours of not dilating at all i had to have a c section c sections can be very tough on a person despite what some people say i did not want to see my baby i just wanted to be finished with everything i remember being rather annoyed that i had to bring her home thankfully i had a supportive husband and a wonderful and understanding mother i was able to talk about my feeling my mother came over almost everyday to help me recover and to help me take care of my daughter i was unable to breastfeed because my milk took over days to come in i started to exclusively pump to give my daughter the important antibodies in breastmilk she is months and i am still pumping but i missed out on the special bond that happens while a mother breastfeed i read an article that suggested that a bond can be created when a parent co sleeps so that exactly what i started to do when my daughter was a few weeks old co sleeping or even just taking naps together might really help the mother of your grandson i suspect she is also having some post partem depression that can be helped in a variety of ways talking to friends and family like i did going to therapy and or being put on some anti depressantes try to be understanding you did elaborate on the circumstances of the birth but if she had this baby prematurely then it sounds like she was probably going through alot at the time of the birth not everyone bonds instantly with their baby now my daughter is months and i can truly say that being a mom is the most wonderful thing in the world although at times the most diffcult as well i love her more than i can express it did take quite a while and the process was slower than i would have wanted i hope that she gets some help and is able to feel like i do about my child Stroke Pregnancy EastEnders Premature birth Kodocha Knots Landing Infant Miscarriage Shaggy dog story Abortion Days of our Lives History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cytomegalovirus Fertility awareness Folic acid Friends Traumatic brain injury About a Boy Hollyoaks Sharon Tate Married... with Children Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma One Tree Hill (TV series) Tupac Shakur Urinary incontinence One Life to Live Milton H.
