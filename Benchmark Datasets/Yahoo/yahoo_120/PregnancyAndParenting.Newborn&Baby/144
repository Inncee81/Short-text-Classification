i have a month old that has been vomitting for a few weeks everytime he eats he throw up about times he never cries when he throws up i took him to the doctor and told me that it was reflux but i'm not convinced it sounds like what your doctor told you is right i had that problem with my son when he was about weeks old even though they are too little at that age to eat food the doctor told me to put one teaspoon of rice cereal in his bottle for every ounce of formula you give him this helps to thicken up the formula so that it is easier for them to keep it down also after feeding him keep him sitting up and no pressure on his belly for about a half an hour afterwords this does help my son is now months and rarely throws up anymore also once you start feeding solids and less formula it gets better on it's own you might need to talk to the doctor to switch formula's usually switching to soy helps the throwing up too but use that as a last resort because it can sometimes be hard on a baby's belly to switch formulas hope this helps Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Gastroparesis Urinary incontinence Coeliac disease Infant formula Fancy rat Gastroesophageal reflux disease Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Adjustable gastric band Bread Shaggy dog story Soybean Caffeine Sea-Monkey New Coke Hamster Aerial (dance move) Dog training Milk Trailer Park Boys One Piece minor characters Suplex IP (complexity) Kodocha Rice pudding Terri Schiavo Japanese cuisine Jackass: The Movie Nestl__ Fecal incontinence Rais massacre Fire fighting Cheese Little Britain Soy milk Phoebe Halliwell Peanut Drawn Together Piccolo Junior Saga Soy sauce Jam (TV series) Anorexia nervosa Medical prescription Cantonese cuisine Kitten Fertility awareness Esophageal cancer Yom Kippur War The Empty Child Wheel of Fortune Botulism Social rule John Sheridan (Babylon 5) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe John the Baptist Prostate cancer Ben Johnson (athlete) Guinea pig Veganism Quaker Oats Company Flour Tofu Breakfast cereal Hypoglycemia Nestl__ boycott Humphrey Bogart Ron and Fez The Amber Spyglass Bottlenose Dolphin Rod Stewart Vermicompost Hannibal Lecter Poker jargon Vegetarianism Toilet humour The Curse of Fenric Minor characters in Teen Titans (animated series) Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Food Idli Infant Big Brother UK series 6 The Dalek Invasion of Earth John Harvey Kellogg Boom Town (Doctor Who) Big Brother (USA TV series) Mayonnaise Garfield Professional wrestling holds Food allergy Kellogg Company Le Malade imaginaire Days of our Lives Diarrhea Folic acid Alcoholics Anonymous The Shining (film) Capercaillie
