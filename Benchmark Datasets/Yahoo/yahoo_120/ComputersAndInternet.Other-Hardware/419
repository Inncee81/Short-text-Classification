when gb is erased from the recycle bin what size does it become on the hard disk i e a gigabyte of data is deleted from my documents to the recycle bin and from there i use an eraser tool i would like to know how much space on the hard disk that original gigabyte is now using up ultimately it will depend on whether you are using fat fat or ntfs it will also depend on whether it is a single gb file like a video file or a lot of smaller files there is a phenomenon called 'slack' that needs to be understood the drive is divided up into hundreds of thousands of identically sized chunks called blocks for example each block may be k in size if you only save a k file it will always consume a k block slack is the k that's left over if you right click on the file and select properties you find size k bytes size on disk k bytes if you save a k file then the slack is k in a k block if you right click on the file and select properties you find size k bytes size on disk k bytes so if your block size was set at k and you deleted a k file you free up k of space and if you deleted a k file you free up k of space if you save a gb file how much space does it actually occupy you need to right click on the file and select properties you will usually find three answers the size of the file in bytes the size of the file in megabytes or gigabytes the actual space used on the hard disk if you have your drive divided into k blocks ie under ntfs then you will need at least blocks to house the file but then each of those blocks does not contain k of data maybe k of actual data and k of location information where the last block is located and where the next block is located and parity information so you may be using blocks for the gb file that's a whopping of the space is given over to tracking info and not actual data so your file properties may read size gb bytes size on disk gb bytes there's a difference of bytes if ntfs uses a larger block say k or k which is better for large files like video there will be less slack space this is because the tracking information still only takes up k of the block leaving a huge k for the actual video data okay if you're still with me let's move on your hard drive will need at least k blocks to house a gb file quite a change from the needed for the k block this time your properties may read size gb bytes size on disk gb bytes there's a difference of only bytes so the answer to your question is this the space freed up when you completely delete gb from your hard drive will be the size on disk figure that you obtained by right clicking and selecting properties regarding the file or folder containing multiple files on which you want info CPU cache Virtual memory Floppy disk File system Windows 2000 Disk image Fragmentation Comparison of file systems Flash memory Partition (computing) Compact disc Gigabyte HFS Plus Files-11 Binary prefix NTFS junction point Unicode CPU design USB flash drive PNG Computer virus Dd (Unix) Megabyte Digital photography Enterprise content management Defragmentation System/36 Symbolic link Musical Instrument Digital Interface System 7 (Macintosh) Apple II family Atari 8-bit family Page table Macromedia Flash Computer Backup DVD Commodore DOS Plaintext Password CD-ROM Malloc ITunes ALGOL 68 RISC Mouse (computing) Magneto-optical drive Disk cloning ZIP (file format) Tagged Image File Format Forth programming language Filename extension Universal Serial Bus Computer storage HTTP cookie Original Amiga chipset Gramophone record Windows Vista IPod Macintosh Finder Linked list Image file formats Knoppix Amiga Old File System Memory (computers) AmigaOS Error correction and detection CompactFlash Logo programming language C programming language Coding theory Mach kernel Domain Name System Data remanence Brainfuck 64-bit Atari 2600 Commodore 64 Advanced Technology Attachment Java programming language TiVo System/34 Streaming media Hierarchical File System BitTorrent Large numbers MDAC IBM PC compatible Data recovery
