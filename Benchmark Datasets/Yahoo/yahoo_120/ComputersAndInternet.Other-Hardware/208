can a computer recognize the difference between usb ports if i turn off my computer and switch which port a device is plugged into will the computer get all huffy about it when i turn it back on in most cases it should be fine if you turn the computer off it won't communicate with the device if you put it back into a different drive then it will try finding the device and see it's attached however if it's like an external hard drive you are running programs off of example your drive i or something and you switch it it might get assigned a different name and the computer doesn't always switch it's references so i guess if you pay attention to that you should be ok Universal Serial Bus Apple Macintosh Booting Computer hardware Musical Instrument Digital Interface IPod Ethernet Computer forensics Hard disk FireWire Modchip Mouse (computing) Floppy disk Personal computer Laptop Embedded system Nintendo Entertainment System Serial ATA Port (computing) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets RS-232 Windows XP Computer bus Secure Digital card Desktop computer AmigaOS Amstrad CPC Windows 2000 IMac Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Digital audio player Advanced Technology Attachment Digital photography ZX Spectrum Central processing unit Architecture of Windows 2000 Dongle Apple IIGS FreeDOS Atari ST Modem DOS USB mass storage device class Computer SCSI Atari 8-bit family Power Macintosh G3 CompactFlash Table tennis IBM PC Common Unix Printing System Acorn Electron Computer storage Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis SCART PC card Mac mini Parallel port System/36 Apple Computer Sound card Apple II family PowerPC PlayStation 2 Mach kernel File system Sinclair ZX81 Screw Xbox Computer virus Acorn Archimedes Commodore 64 Bluetooth ALGOL 68 Electric motor Device driver C programming language Strap-on dildo Apple Newton Enigma machine Atari 2600 Flash memory TIA-568A/B Power Mac G4 Cube Commodore International System/34 Archos BIOS VMware NeXT Memory (computers) Danger Hiptop Programmable logic controller Residual-current device Computer and video games IPod shuffle Xbox 360 Knoppix Microsoft Windows
