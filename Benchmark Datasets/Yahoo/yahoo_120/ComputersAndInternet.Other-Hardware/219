as an overall high spec processor which is the best choice out of a pentium d or an amd x in my experience it depends on what you want to do in the past i've used both intels and amds and here's some comparisons i won't make any judgment just offer what i've noticed amd chips run a lot hotter than intels intel chips usually have higher clock speeds and bus speeds however amd processors often out perform intel chips despite a lower speed for instance my amd athlon xp ghz outperformed my p ghz this was while the cpus were being used for gaming amd chips are generally cheaper from what i gather intel's business philosophy is to make the bleeding edge fastest processors while amds is to offer the most stable though not necessarily fastest processors again these are just what i've found in my experience having built a dozen or so personal pcs and a couple of servers my box now is an intel box and i've had no problems at all thanks to the commoditization of computer hardware these days you'll probably not be disappointed either way as long as you stick to the mid to high end processors and not the budget range duron and sempron for amd celeron for intel Pentium III Pentium M Xeon Athlon 64 Cyrix PC motherboard NVIDIA IBM PC compatible Duron CPU design Opteron AMD64 Overclocking PR rating X86 64-bit PowerPC Apple Intel transition Central processing unit Pentium VIA C3 VIA Technologies Clock rate X86 assembly language AMD K6-III Transmeta Symmetric multiprocessing Intel CPU electrical consumption AMD K6-2 ATI Technologies Sempron NX bit Wintel Windows XP Cell (microprocessor) Laptop Pentium II History of Microsoft Windows Linux kernel IBM PC Apple Macintosh Front side bus Benchmark (computing) Northbridge (computing) Am386 IA-64 Intel 80486 PlayStation 3 Radeon DEC Alpha Sun Microsystems Moore's law Computer IA-32 AMD 5x86 Athlon 64 X2 Pentium Pro Microsoft Windows Supercomputer Mac OS X FLOPS Itanium 2 GeForce 6 Series AMD K5 Bluetooth Motorola 68000 AMD K6 History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Montecito GeForce 4 Sequent Computer Systems Xbox Intel 80386 3dfx Stream processing AltiVec Zilog Z80 Sound Blaster Hewlett-Packard IBM POWER Digital Equipment Corporation Embedded system
