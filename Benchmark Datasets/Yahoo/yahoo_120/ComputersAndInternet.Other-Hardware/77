how can i permanently delete deleted files my problem started when i tried to put all my music onto itunes but my computer said that i didnt have enough room on the c drive for it to finish i have a storage drive with a lot of space on it and i was trying to put it onto that i tried to free up more space on the c drive deleted unwanted programs temp internet files etc but its still pretty much full theres really nothing else i can find to delete so im thinking maybe theres some things that werent really deleted whenever i see my computer scanning for spy ware viruses etc i see it scanning things like sims which took up a huge amount of space that i thought i deleted so im wondering if anyone knows how to do this or if this isnt even my problem is there another way to fix it lol im not very good with computers so i could defintely be wrong about it yup the storage drive is e sorry and i did all of these things but none of them work haha and i tried to delete the restore points but it hasnt even been saving any because there isnt enough room even though things don't really get deleted when you delete files etc they do not take up disk space becuase they simply get overwritten with any new data so thats not your problem you've already used uninstall now go into windows explorer and look for left over files file folders for programs you uninstalled deleted already then right click on your hard drive icon in my computer and choose the disk clean up option select everything and remove then download ccleaner and use it to clean all your temporary junk files then run disk defragmentor this should get you some more space but you may be coming to the point where you need to install a nd hard drive Computer virus Windows XP Macintosh Finder File system ITunes Windows 2000 Gmail Floppy disk IPod NTFS Virtual memory Computer security Hard disk Partition (computing) System 7 (Macintosh) Object Desktop Malware USB flash drive Computer storage System/36 Anti-virus software Macromedia Flash Steam (content delivery) Data remanence Plaintext Enterprise content management The Sims 2 Mozilla Firefox ALGOL 68 Mouse (computing) Rootkit Linux Library (computer science) Disk cloning Linked list Computer Windows Vista History of Microsoft Windows File Allocation Table Backup File format Trusted computing Microsoft Windows Windows Installer Uploading and downloading Disk formatting Computer forensics Trojan horse (computing) Diablo II: Lord of Destruction System/34 Emacs HyperCard Windows registry Redundant array of independent disks NeXT CPU cache Internet Explorer Files-11 Booting ZX Spectrum Apple Computer Stopping e-mail abuse Video game music NTFS junction point Bluetooth Kazaa Symbolic link Commodore DOS Memory (computers) MDAC Blue screen of death Embedded system Apple II family Page table Early IBM disk storage Knoppix MP3 Java programming language Data recovery Disk image Job Control Language Fragmentation WordStar Atari 8-bit family HP BASIC for OpenVMS Ebook Mac OS X PNG Opera (web browser)
