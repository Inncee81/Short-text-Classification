what is the best file type for a flash drive fat or fat and whats the difference between the two fat is the file system that was created for use with msdos back in the old days a fat is a more modern variation of fat which was introduced by microsoft in windows release b to address some issues with the way diskspace was allocated to files resulting in disks being full when in realitly they only had of the amount of data stored on them that their capacity allowed to understand this we need to look how the filesystems work fat fat work by reserving part of the disk for the directory structure and file allocation table the directory structure tells the pc where to find the start of the file on the disk while the file allocation table fat tells the pc which blocks are used by the file and tracks how many blocks are in use the basic difference between fat fat is how much of the disk they allocate to the file allocation table fat allocates more diskspace to the allocation table than fat one of the benefits of this is that it can handle bigger disks than fat withouth the need for partitioning this is because there is a limit on fat of gb imposed by the amount of disk allocated to the allocation table the other feature of the fat file system is that the allocation table is a fixed amojunt of disk space irrespective of whether the disk is mb or gb the result of this is that as disk size increases the size of the blocks that data is allocated in must increase because the number of entries in the file allocation table is fixed therefore a gb formatted fat disk will allocate blocks to files in multiples of k this means a k file will occupy k of disk space and k file will occupy k of disk space you can see how you can rapidly allocate diskspace as dead space due to the overheads of the file system as fat allots more disk space to the allocation table a gb formatted fat disk will allocate blocks to files in smaller multiple making more efficient use of the disk with the overhead of more disk reserved for file allocation tables which suits larger disks better the best way to format your flash drive depends on its size if its less than or equal to mb format fat if its more or than mb format fat formatting smaller drives with fat decreases the overhead of the file allocation tables on the disk and gives you more usable space for files formatting larger drives with fat gives you better use of you disk and the cost of the extra space taken up by the allocation tables becomes insignificant to the size of the disk Redundant array of independent disks Comparison of file systems Windows 2000 Virtual memory CPU cache Hard disk HFS Plus Linked list Library (computer science) Files-11 Hash table C programming language AmigaOS Hierarchical File System Page table DragonFly BSD Windows XP Apple II family Digital photography USB flash drive Flash memory Forth programming language Compact disc File format DVD Binary prefix Btrieve Compiler optimization System/36 ReiserFS IPod System/34 PNG Defragmentation Computer Mach kernel Atari 8-bit family Fragmentation Spring operating system Computer file Disk image XML Computer virus Disk cloning Filename extension RISC Master Control Program Disk formatting Commodore DOS PaX Amiga Old File System Paging CPU design Amiga Password RSTS/E MDAC NX bit Computer storage ZIP (file format) Cache Stream processing Novell NetWare DOS History of Microsoft Windows Backup MS-DOS Linux ITunes ALGOL 68 Embedded system Reference (computer science) BitTorrent Explosive material EIA-708 Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus MP3 Pretty Good Privacy Database management system Metadata Symbolic link Microsoft Windows
