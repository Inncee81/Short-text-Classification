i think my screen driver got ruined or something any ideas i was going to record the screen but this time an error message popped up i tried reinstalling but an error message popped up saying it cannot install the screen driver i recently downloaded a new theme but i don't think that has anything to do with it but if you know something about themes please correct me if i'm wrong i went to device manager display adapters and video graphics accelalator had a caution icon on it does anyone have any ideas what's wrong my graphic card is amd athlon the screen recorder is zd soft but i don't think that info will help i went to the driver website and downloaded updates same problem oh geez i looked at the wrong sticker it is nvadia there's not enough information in your description to know exactly what problem you are encountering so here's how to do either of what sound like could be your problem first you need to know what graphics card you have or if it is built in what graphics chip set it uses you will also need to know what monitor you have go to each piece of equipments manufacturer website and download the most current drivers if it's an nvidia based graphics card you can just get the most current drivers from nvidia start by running the installation on the drivers for nvidia if that is what you have and see if that corrects the problem if not then i would recommend you try to remove the device through device manager and restart the machine follow the prompts and reinstall your video card drivers that way if this still doesn't work then you might have a bad monitor driver and need to update it but that's unlikely you can update the driver through display settings under the advanced tab if none of this works i would need to know more information on the problem to help further good luck Windows XP NVIDIA ATI Technologies Blue screen of death Windows Vista AmigaOS Radeon Windows 2000 Graphics card ZX Spectrum History of Microsoft Windows OpenGL Apple IIGS GeForce 6 Series Commodore 64 IMac Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Floppy disk IBM PC compatible Atari 8-bit family AMD Linux Embedded system PlayStation 3 X Window System Microsoft Windows Screenshot Opera (web browser) 64-bit Object Desktop Spyware IPod Atari ST PC motherboard DirectX X86 Mac OS X Graphics processing unit MAME Common Unix Printing System 3dfx Apple Macintosh Knoppix Laptop Oscilloscope CPU design GeForce 4 MDAC Amiga Copy protection CPU cache Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Sound card Computer display Microprocessor Teletext Xbox Steam (content delivery) Device driver TRS-80 Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo OpenBSD Computer Surveillance Musical Instrument Digital Interface VIA Technologies Macromedia Flash Cheating in Counter-Strike Timeline of computing 1990-forward Rendering (computer graphics) Sega Dreamcast Doom 3 AOL Instant Messenger NForce4 DragonFly BSD PostScript Commodore 128 GeForce 7 Series Computer bus PlayStation 2 Pinball Modem Counter-Strike MSN Messenger Prank flash Stereoscopy Secure Digital card Amstrad CPC Computer display standard Slot machine Nintendo Entertainment System DDR2 SDRAM Trusted computing Mozilla Firefox QuickDraw
