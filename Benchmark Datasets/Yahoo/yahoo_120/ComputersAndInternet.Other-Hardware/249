radeonx pro radeonx pro plus and minus points cause i just bought it what are the pros and cons of the graphiccard it has mb memory and gddr pci express is it a good choice cause i just bought the card it has crosfire gigabyte proudly announced that they will be the first vga card maker to bundle sid meier's civilization iv edition with the radeon x pro for strategy game enthusiasts the package enables users to experience the thrilling challenge of creating the ultimate civilization while maintaining your pc cool with gigabyte's unique silent thermal solution slot space required slot port type pci express x system type pc connectivity and additional features functionality crossfire parent card dual dvi hdtv encoder multi monitor support interface type video pin high density d shell vga video pin mini din s video video dvi i digital analog graphics chipset ramdac speed mhz video chipset ati radeon x pro memory installed video memory mb memory technology gddr more info url www gigabyte usa com picture quality color depth at maximum resolution million colors bit grayscale mask bit resolution x quick glance functionality crossfire parent card dual dvi hdtv encoder multi monitor support installed memory interface type video pin high density d shell vga video pin mini din s video video dvi i digital analog slot type pci express x video chipset ati radeon x pro warranty warranty information day limited warranty this is yours this is my chioce and the difference between the better two on the market the main difference between geforce and geforce families is the adoption of directx on geforce family what this means is that they will support the next generation of games to be released starting this year it also means that instead of using separated shader units for each kind of shader processing pixel vertex physics and geometry video cards from this family use a unified shader architecture where the shader engines can process any one of these tasks on our nvidia geforce series architecture article you can find a more in depth explanation about this so far amd has announced their ati radeon hd family which also supports directx and uses unified shader architecture however mid range products will be only available in late june i e one month from now this leaves mid range cards from geforce family like geforce gts without real direct competitors we can find this model from msi costing around usd and at this price range there is no mid range video card from ati amd available we call mid range all video cards that use a bit memory interface and high end all video cards that use a bit memory interface or higher however there are entry level high end video cards at this price range like radeon x pro so we may somewhat consider radeon x pro to be a competitor to geforce gts as they are in the same price range even though geforce gts uses a bit memory interface and radeon x pro uses a bit one the basic difference between geforce gts and geforce gt is the clock used thus we can consider geforce gts a turbo geforce gt as both cards have processing engines the standard geforce gts runs at mhz and accesses its mb gddr memory at ghz ghz transferring two data per clock cycle thru a bit interface so it can access its memory at a maximum transfer rate of gb s this model from msi comes overclocked with the graphics chip running at mhz and its memory running at ghz with a maximum memory transfer rate of gb s so this video card has its gpu running faster than the standard geforce gts and it accesses its memory faster than the standard model so this overclocking is not that high also if you install the drivers that come with this video card you will have access to d o t or dynamic overclocking technology where you can overclock your video card simply checking a box on the video properties so this video card is a product targeted to users that want an overclocked video card to achieve a higher performance but don t want to go thru the hassle of overclocking the video card themselves geforce gts has shader processors running at ghz the same amount used on geforce gt on gt they are running at ghz though for a full comparison between geforce gts and other chips from nvidia please read our tutorial nvidia chips comparison table on ati chips comparison table you can compare them to competitors from ati amd
