what is raid and is it better to what is raid if i want gb in raid do i need two gb hdds or two gb hdds last question is it better to have hdds or gb hdd i'm not sure which raid config i would be using but if i use raid or raid would i need two gb hdds for raid or two gb hdds if i want gb of raid or would i need two gb hdds or two gb hdds i have room for seven hdds in my tower and it does have decent cooling raid is simply say the work structure of combination of more than hardisk you can make them work together assigning for backup purpose or simply adding more storage space it's just like how you want your hdd to work together there are some type of raid the most common for home user are raid basically adding hdd storage to the other so it means gb gb gb it is the most usual one but it have no backup so if there is some error on drives the data is cannot be retrieved anymore raid making a shadow of drive in this case gb gb gb however if there is an error the data is quite secure because there is always a backup available for you second question again see the explanation above which one do you need most storage space or data safety and reliability if you are a gamer or multimedia type of person a raid is better as it's offer more space but if you are a business user raid is much more reliable for the third question it depends on the space on your computer hdd's mean if one broken you only lost gb but the electricity and temperature inside you computer will certainly make some problem hdd's mean if broken you lost gb but its's more space efficient and possibly prolong the equipment ages so except you have a very good cooling system or leaving in north south pole i recommenc the x one Redundant array of independent disks Hard disk Floppy disk Enterprise content management Virtual memory Computer Expert system Windows XP Embedded system File system Datatype DVD NTFS Modchip Backup File Allocation Table Sharp Zaurus Windows Vista Mainframe computer Pointer CPU design Pebble bed reactor Solar power Database C programming language Unicode Computer science PlayStation Portable Linked list Transmission Control Protocol Computer forensics Thermal power station Password System/36 PlayStation 2 Expansion Bay XML MAME Compiler optimization Data center Reliability engineering Lisp programming language Copy protection Debugging Computer virus Central processing unit Hubble Space Telescope Error correction and detection Multics Files-11 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Compact disc Computer storage Federal Standard 1037C Transformer Apollo Guidance Computer Data recovery Nuclear weapon design Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting MMORPG Bicycle lighting CPU cache Personal rapid transit MDAC Gmail SCSI Power station Classified information Sega Saturn Dynamic random access memory Buffer overflow Amstrad CPC Class (computer science) IBM PC Algorithm Autonomous building Personal computer Oscilloscope USB flash drive Universal Serial Bus MySQL Python programming language Loudspeaker Laptop Domain Name System Spacecraft propulsion Shell (projectile) Page table Perl Password cracking Extreme Programming Data remanence
