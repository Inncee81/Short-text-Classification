core duo ulv or pentium i have laptops which is faster in the sense of which will compute a million digits of pi faster the core duo ulv processor u ghz mb l cache mhz front side bus or a pentium ghz a desktop processor hp threw into the zd laptop i now have one answer for each i am leaning toward the p but anyone else have an opinion also don't forget that the core duo is the ulv ultra low voltage which means it runs slower than a normal core duo i just don't know if it's slow enough to lag behind the p on raw processing power i would put my money on the p the core would just be better for multitasking ie running instances of the benchmark Pentium M Pentium 4 Athlon Xeon PowerPC CPU design Pentium D CPU cache Pentium II Microprocessor VIA C3 Front side bus Itanium 2 Overclocking Clock rate Cell (microprocessor) Pentium RISC AMD Pentium Pro Transmeta Athlon 64 64-bit PR rating Conroe Central processing unit IBM PC compatible Cyrix Laptop Timeline of computing 1990-forward Radeon ATI Technologies AMD K6-III Hard disk PowerBook Duron PC motherboard Opteron Mac OS PlayStation 3 NVIDIA Universal Serial Bus Personal computer Xbox 360 GeForce 6 Series Montecito AMD 5x86 Supercomputer X86 Moore's law Atari ST Benchmark (computing) PDP-8 INMOS Transputer Intel iAPX 432 Oscilloscope IBM POWER Computer architecture AMD K5 ThinkPad Windows XP Dual-core CPU electrical consumption Northbridge (computing) Transistor 3dfx History of Microsoft Windows FLOPS Computer EMac Power Macintosh G3 CDC 6600 Wintel Apple Intel transition VIA Technologies IA-32 Nintendo Revolution Data General Nova Radiation hardening Stream processing PlayStation 2 Wi-Fi Vector processor Xbox Mach kernel Novell NetWare Athlon 64 X2 Cyrix Cx5x86 ARM architecture Sun Microsystems
