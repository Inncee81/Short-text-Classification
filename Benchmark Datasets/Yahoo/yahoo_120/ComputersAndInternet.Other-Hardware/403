computer won't work after changing video cards and back hi i have a gateway ram with a 'g force ' video card i changed the video card with my mom's 'gforce ' from her dell to see if my computer would run better but it wouldn't work so i changed it back now my computer won't work anymore even with the old card does anyone know what's wrong any help would be appreciated thanks it problems could stem from multiple sources so let's check make sure you monitor is plugged in the power supply or your power socket check your monitor cable goes into the video card make sure the monitor cable goes to your geforce card not your integrated video card if your computer has one lastly when you open your computer listen to it if you hear beeping sounds this means your computer does boot up but has a problem before booting up if there's nothing no sound at all it could be caused by either a processor which hasn't been plugged in properly or loosed from it's slot or a dead motherboard ps some of the suggestions sound dumb but sometimes people neglect the simplest of things which is why you should check everything Personal computer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Commodore 64 Apple II family IBM PC compatible Atari ST Nintendo Entertainment System Desktop computer Universal Serial Bus PlayStation 3 NVIDIA IMac ATI Technologies Overclocking Computer bus IBM PC 3dfx Atari 8-bit family Sound card Graphics card Apple IIGS Graphics processing unit Computer hardware GeForce 6 Series Windows XP Power-On Self Test Computer and video games Debugging TRS-80 Color Computer Computer forensics Sinclair ZX81 MSX Slot machine Commodore 128 Federal Standard 1037C Laptop USB flash drive Modem ZX Spectrum Jack plug Cyrix AmigaOS System/36 Sega Saturn Embedded system Sound Blaster Linux IPod MicroATX Apple Macintosh Floppy disk Poker jargon Timeline of computing 1990-forward Power Macintosh G3 System/34 Acorn Electron TurboGrafx 16 Pirate decryption Domestic AC power plugs and sockets AMD PlayStation 2 Sega Dreamcast Game Boy Advanced Technology Attachment Hard disk TRS-80 Neopets Hearing aid Athlon Ethernet Musical Instrument Digital Interface Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Surveillance SCART CPU cache Amstrad CPC Television Video game music Nintendo Revolution Blackjack Trusted computing Oscilloscope SAM Coup__ Commodore International PC Engine BS 1363 Apple Computer Motherboard Nintendo DS MAME GeForce FX
