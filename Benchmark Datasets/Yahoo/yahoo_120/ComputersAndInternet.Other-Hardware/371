installing wireless pci adapter ok heres the sitch i built a computer a few years ago but i've forgotten most of what the specs are for the hardware that is inside it so if you ask i don't remember so i want to install a wireless networking card on my tower now my question is do i have to remove my old networking card and replace it with the wireless and are most pci cards going to be the same as far as the interface slots go should i remove my old card and compare it to one i am going to buy so i don't get the wrong size interface on the card any help out there it really depends on what wireless nic you are going to buy they are pretty much all the same as far as pci cards go how you install it depends on what brand you buy for example if you are buying a netgear wg wireless nic then you need to remove the old nic and then install the software for the netgear before installing the nic PCI Express Personal computer Peripheral Component Interconnect Universal Serial Bus Automatic teller machine Wi-Fi Bluetooth Computer bus Xbox Apple Macintosh PC card Sound Blaster Expansion card PlayStation 2 Ethernet Laptop Modem Radeon Mac OS X MAC address Floppy disk Windows XP Computer hardware PC motherboard PlayStation 3 Amiga Apple Computer Windows Vista GeForce 6 Series IBM PC IBM PC compatible IBook Cisco PIX Nintendo DS N-Gage USB flash drive IMac Nintendo Revolution Wi-Fi Protected Access NetBSD PowerPC Softmodem Nintendo GameCube Atari 8-bit family Router PlayStation Portable TCP Offload Engine 3dfx Wireless LAN Linux Hard disk Domain Name System Mac mini Windows 2000 Power Macintosh G3 Embedded system ATI Technologies Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Redundant array of independent disks Microsoft Windows Game Boy Advance Wireless Multimedia Card AirPort Mainframe computer ZX Spectrum NVIDIA IPod Industry Standard Architecture Computer and video games Knoppix Accelerated Graphics Port Protocol stack BIOS System 7 (Macintosh) IPAQ Surveillance Secure Digital card CPU cache Perl Palm OS OpenGL Cisco Systems AmigaOS HyperTransport Commodore International Computer network Federal Standard 1037C Sound card Mouse (computing) Radeon X Series Copy protection Timeline of computing 1990-forward MicroATX ISCSI History of Microsoft Windows Nintendo Entertainment System Computer
