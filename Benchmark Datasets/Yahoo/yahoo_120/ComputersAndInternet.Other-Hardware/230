what's the difference between intel processors intel processors come in all shapes and sizes so i'll try to be brief by discussing only the ones that are current on the market the market for intel processors are currently divided into sides one side if for single core processors while the other is for multi cores single cores pentium pentium m celeron core solo not very common these cpus are single cores meaning that they only have one processor they are relatively cheap compared to multicores the difference between these are clock values hyper threading bit support and fsb pentium and celerons are cores found in desktops while the m is found in laptops single cores generally have low fsb but high clock speeds think of it as having a lot of water pressure but only a straw to dispense it that's how fsb and clock values work so single cores should provide you with a lot of raq power but they're not good at multi tasking or jobs that requires it divide it's attention games like crysis will be better with multi cores because the pc has to generate so many different things at once while focusing on countless calculations and processes the hyperthreading support does help the single core pentium s with multi tasking but it's not as much as multicores so if you're just looking for something with a lot of raw power these are for you multi core core duo core duo core quad these are multi core processors developed by intel they are used in both laptops and desktops except for the quad it's used in desktops only the first processors are dual cores while the last is quad cored these processors have a high fsb rating and generally lower clock speed so you have to be careful when looking at these the high fsb means that the system does really really well with dividing and transferring it's processing power but if you get a low clock speed then there's not enough power to begin with for the assignment example you may have a large hose but if you have low water pressure it's useless that's why multi cores are great for the modern pc user who multitasks way too much but if it's under ghz in clock speed you should be worried about not having enough raw power to get you through intensive work multicores generally cost a lot more than single cores since they're relatively new technology btw the core duo is faster than the core duo by about meanwhile the quadcore is the ultimate in processor goodness but costs i hope these facts helped Xeon AMD X86 Dual-core Apple Macintosh Hyper-threading VIA C3 PowerPC Computer 64-bit ATI Technologies Laptop IBM PC compatible Pentium Opteron MIPS architecture Apple Intel transition Front side bus Clock rate Pentium II NVIDIA Cell (microprocessor) Pentium Pro Athlon 64 PR rating Cyrix IA-32 Overclocking Transmeta Duron Supercomputer Moore's law NX bit Mac OS X 3dfx Linux kernel Itanium 2 Personal computer X86 assembly language Burroughs B5000 Computer workstation VIA Technologies Timeline of computing 1990-forward PC motherboard Symmetric multiprocessing Conroe PowerPC G4 Thread (computer science) PlayStation 3 Mach kernel Northbridge (computing) History of Microsoft Windows MOS Technology 6502 Distributed computing Intel iAPX 432 Dynamic random access memory Mac OS X v10.4 CDC 6600 Mac OS Power Mac G5 Universal Serial Bus GeForce 6 Series PowerBook Multicore Process Atari ST Apple Computer Extreme Programming Windows Vista Sempron Redundant array of independent disks Embedded system Compiler optimization IMac INMOS Transputer Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Sun Microsystems History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Intel Montecito Bluetooth IBM PC Simultaneous multithreading Xbox Novell NetWare
