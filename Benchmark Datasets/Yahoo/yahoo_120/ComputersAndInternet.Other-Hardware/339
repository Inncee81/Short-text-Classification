to what extent are usb leads interchangeable if at all i have a freecom external drive with lots of my data on it it connects via a usb port but is no longer recognised on either my work or home pc windows helpfuly suggests i replace the device but do i have any other options i've loads of spare usb leads lying around are any of these likely to help my problem nb no drivers were required as i use winxp sp i know that often these devices are billed as driverless but what it really means is that it utilises the default windows drivers that are already present in your os my first suspicion is as the person above has suggested try different usb ports it sounds like you just have been plugging it into a port that no longer supplies sufficient current to run your device btw i have the freecom external drive too they are extremely great when they work second thing to try is if you know anyone with a powered usb hub try plugging your external drive through the powered usb hub to your computer that should solve any issues regarding quirky power requirements but i'm going to bet that the real problem is a misconfigured windows driver and if that is the case the solution is to plug your usb device in wait until windows detects it tries to install it and then reports that installation failed then you go to the device manager under system icon in control panel and you look for the external hardrive drivers that windows has tried to mount to read your hardisk remove those drivers unplug external hard drive and try plugging in again hopefully this time it will do a proper device detection and install the right set of drivers something similar happened to me for some reason my freecom hardrive when plugged in kept making windows load a faulty driver that would not allow me to access my drive fixing the issue was a matter of figuring which faulty driver was being loaded and getting rid of it Windows XP IPod AmigaOS History of Microsoft Windows IMac Windows 2000 Architecture of Windows 2000 Hard disk Redundant array of independent disks Computer bus Floppy disk Common Unix Printing System USB mass storage device class Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Atari 8-bit family Modchip RS-232 PlayStation 2 Linux IBM PC compatible X Window System Mouse (computing) Embedded system Digital photography Bluetooth Commodore 64 FreeDOS Advanced Technology Attachment Secure Digital card Xbox Apple Macintosh Windows 3.x Knoppix Computer hardware Loudspeaker Mozilla Firefox Device driver FireWire Laptop Modem Plug-and-play Virtual memory Personal computer Microsoft Windows Blue screen of death 64-bit NTFS Cheating in Counter-Strike Atari ST Sound card PlayStation 3 Btrieve Linux kernel Carburetor Spark plug Computer Computer forensics File system Serial ATA ReactOS Enigma machine Musical Instrument Digital Interface OpenBSD Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Novell NetWare File Allocation Table Windows Vista BS 1363 BIOS Residual-current device Sinclair ZX81 Apple Desktop Bus Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Flash memory Visual Basic CPU cache Disk cloning Desktop computer PowerPC DragonFly BSD The Sims 2 Apple IIGS Rootkit VMware Sega Dreamcast NX bit Power Macintosh G3 Digital rights management
