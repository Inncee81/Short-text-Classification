windows xp on a proliant server hi there i want to install windows xp on proliant ml g to use it as a normal pc so is there any performance issue or any issue related for using a desktop os on a server instead of use w server regards the only thing that i can think of is that you may run into driver issues for the hardware although windows xp and windows server are written very closely the may be some issues of drivers for one not working for the other i am especially thinking about motherboard drivers and if you are using any type of raid controller that may come with the system i would do some research on hp's website and see if there are drivers out there for windows xp if not try the w k drivers good luck Microsoft Windows Windows 2000 X Window System Redundant array of independent disks Architecture of Windows 2000 History of Microsoft Windows Windows XP Server Windows Server 2003 IBM PC compatible Windows Vista Mac OS X Linux ReactOS Personal computer Hard disk AmigaOS ATI Technologies Novell NetWare Kernel (computer science) 64-bit Operating system Common Unix Printing System MDAC Microprocessor Windows Me Blue screen of death Microsoft OS/2 Wintel Sun Microsystems Open Database Connectivity Windows Driver Model SUSE Linux OpenBSD WebObjects Thread (computer science) PowerPC Spring operating system Device driver Windows 3.x OpenGL Cooperative Linux Perl Windows CE Windows NT 4.0 Comparison of file systems Windows NT Free software Booting BIOS Silicon Graphics Supercomputer Common criticisms of Microsoft Windows registry Computer hardware Microsoft SQL Server Apple Macintosh Steam (content delivery) NeXT Computer virus Microsoft Jet Database Engine Novell ZENworks Windows 1.0 Modem Pretty Good Privacy Apple Computer Mach kernel Symbian OS NTFS Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing Ultrix Universal Serial Bus Computer software Windows 95 RISC NX bit Extensible Firmware Interface Btrieve Portable Document Format Microsoft Access Object Desktop Windows Update Internet Relay Chat Graphical Environment Manager OpenStep Proxy server Embedded system Screenshot Xerox Star FreeDOS File system DirectX Transmission Control Protocol World of Warcraft Control Panel (Windows) Patch (computing) Mac OS Windows Mobile
