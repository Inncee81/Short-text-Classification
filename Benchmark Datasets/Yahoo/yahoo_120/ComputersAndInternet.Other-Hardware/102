whats a good external hard drive i am looking to buy an external hard drive and they honestly dont make sense to me i see gb priced lower than gb with the same transfer rate whats a good brand and whats the difference between them my price range is and has anyone used a wireless external if so do i need wireless internet or would it just work with the wirless card on my laptop without an internet connection thanks never heard of a wireless external but it sounds relatively new meaning it might be more costly dont expect a faster transfer rate than usb or firewire either i bought a generic medion brand gb drive at christmas cheap at but its x x inches big and a pain to carry also it requires a power lead at all times if its not for carrying around i'd go for western digital models they have bulky devices some smaller ones too and pretty large holds terabyte is being solder under for portability sake look for something that doesnt require ac power its a real pain some drives that are albeit significantly smaller and only a little slower are powered solely via usb wd i recall has a gb one like that on their site somewheres also if you fins one with a sata port and you consider adding a sata card to your machine then make sure whether its esata or sata mine says sata on the box but when i got the card and cable i learned that it was actually esata on the back of it pain Universal Serial Bus Serial ATA Laptop Apple Macintosh IPod Floppy disk Computer bus PlayStation 2 FireWire Digital photography Digital audio player Xbox SCSI IBM PC compatible Secure Digital card Computer MicroATX Bluetooth IBook Musical Instrument Digital Interface Advanced Technology Attachment Nintendo GameCube Atari 8-bit family PowerBook Modem Loudspeaker Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Creative Zen Archos Xbox 360 Desktop computer Mouse (computing) PlayStation Portable Game Boy Wi-Fi Atari ST PlayStation 3 Computer hardware AirPort Xserve Ethernet Cable television DVD Nintendo Revolution Wireless LAN Mach kernel CompactFlash Creative Nomad Tungsten Handheld Broadband Internet access IEEE 802.11 Power Mac G4 Cube ZigBee Sound recording Digital camera Computer and video games Transistor Camcorder Mobile phone Sound card Wind turbine IBM PC Synthesizer Windows XP Telephone Television Nintendo DS Walkman Stereoscopy Amstrad CPC Sound Blaster PowerPC Universal Mobile Telecommunications System Digital video recorder TiVo Amateur radio Handheld game console Power Macintosh G3 Supercomputer Digital circuit Image scanner Telegraphy
