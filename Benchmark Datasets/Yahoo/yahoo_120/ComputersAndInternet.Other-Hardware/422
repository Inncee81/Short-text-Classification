is bloom or hdr better for gaming with a crt monitor i'm somewhat savvy about gaming and graphics but oblivion has different lighting options bloom and hdr and i've never seen these before and my buddy said it depends on the monitor can anyone set this straight thanks your buddy is unfortunately incorrect there is more than that to it it has to do with how your graphics card actually renders the lighting in the game not the monitor bloom lighting is based on the older shader model while hdr or high dynamic range lighting is based on the newer shader model and now with directx we'll soon have shader model some older cards like some agp cards even though still able to run games like oblivion lack support for sm ati x x if you have a newer graphics card like the ati x family or the nvidia g family you will have sm so if your card supports it and has a playable frame rate while gaming put it on hdr lighting if it gets a little slow put it on bloom since you say your graphics savvy hdr does look visually more realistic than bloom so hdr all the way ATI Technologies Radeon NVIDIA Far Cry GeForce 6 Series Xbox 360 Shader 3dfx Vertex and pixel shaders OpenGL Radeon X Series DirectX GeForce FX Graphics processing unit GeForce 7 Series Rendering (computer graphics) Xbox Counter-Strike Doom 3 GeForce Computer graphics 3D computer graphics High dynamic range imaging IMac Windows Vista Dawn (demo) Graphics card Cg programming language PlayStation 3 Nintendo GameCube Game programming GeForce 2 Apple Macintosh EMac Direct3D Atari 8-bit family Cathode ray tube Frame rate Source engine Game programmer Personal computer GeForce 256 Deus Ex: Invisible War Power Macintosh G3 GeForce 3 Half-Life 2 IBM PC compatible Scalable Link Interface Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis S3 Savage Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within RollerCoaster Tycoon DDR2 SDRAM Computer and video game genres Computer-aided design First-person shooter Autodesk Media and Entertainment Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic Formula One Grand Prix (Geoff Crammond) Windows XP ZX Spectrum PlayStation 2 Cheating in Counter-Strike In The Groove (game) Computer animation Visual Basic Computer display PowerBook Windows API Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories DirectShow Windows 2000 Stereoscopy Sega Dreamcast Microsoft Windows PC motherboard Digital Visual Interface First person shooter graphics engines Teletext Final Fantasy Amstrad CPC Computer and video games RenderMan PCI Express Amiga Vector graphics Laptop Gamut Ethernet QuickDraw 3D Mac OS X The Sims 2 GDI Motion capture
