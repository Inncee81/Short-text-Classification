how do i place important files on the edge of my hard disk what programs and where can i get them do i need in order to move some files to the edge of my hard disk for faster access sure it will as the system does not need to shearch the whole hard disk in order to find it ok drew u almost got the question i know i can do this but i forgot the long lost link to how there was a program that fragmented just like the windows defragmenter utility the much needed parts of the system to the edge of the hard disk for much faster access i'm just asking about the name of that program or something similar p s anyone can say you can't do it but not everyone can say how you can do it when i say faster access in terms of hard disks i mean faster access for the system aka windows to the hard disk not about desktop shortcuts btw colinc what if the edge of my hard disk is empty how could i move a special file there now we are getting there i have hdd and partitions windows partition programs files huge files the files i want to move are basically system files and maybe game files in the future p here is some clear up the question info correct me if i m wrong as we know windows writes information on the hard disk this information often becomes fragmented and disorganized the information is written in any way but still widows reads them fine slower but fine due to special files that redirect the system windows to the correct clusters of the file also as we know windows reads the hard disk from beginning to end and that if the file is located at the beginning of the hard disk and i mean the sequence of the magnetized dots on the hard disk so if the dots info is located at the start of the hard disk my pc will be able to find it significantly faster which will provide a better system user experience this means that i can move the magnetized dots on the hard disk to the edge of the hard disk so that it takes windows less time to find them while the information on the files location in windows explorer remains the same now the question how can i move the files magnetized dots and huge files i use a lot on the hard disk to the edge of the hard disk let me try again how do i move the files which are directly on the hard disk to the edge of the hard disk while windows explorer will not notice any difference in the files position how can i do this and or what program can do this as i have two had disk's one gb other gb i would prefer my most used programs windows and fav games to be at front i an a pc enthusiast becoming a pig question s i would really appreciate links to websites with step by step instructions or any relating info izzy hehehe yeah that might be an idea creating a separate partition just for a game as i already have one for windows but ill only do that when ill be reinstalling windows which will be in some time you are talking about a defragmentor windows includes one at start programs accessories system tools disk defragmentor you click defrag and it will do it for you there are alternatives such as o o defrag or diskkeeper edit defragmenting does this automatically for you it moves them so the files are not defragmented for faster file accessing most of the time unless it's huge files mb you won't notice it very much even if you do have it moved to the front Windows 2000 Hard disk Windows XP Defragmentation NTFS AmigaOS Redundant array of independent disks MS-DOS Mouse (computing) Computer virus IBM PC compatible Enterprise content management Computer Atari 8-bit family Linux Floppy disk System 7 (Macintosh) Forth programming language Object Desktop Windows 95 Partition (computing) RISC CPU design Spring operating system Windows registry Commodore 64 Macintosh Finder Windows 3.x CPU cache Defrag Mozilla Firefox Apple Macintosh Windows Vista Operating system Garbage collection (computer science) Library (computer science) Pretty Good Privacy Linked list Portable Document Format Microsoft Windows Emacs Amstrad CPC Apple IIGS X Window System FreeDOS Early IBM disk storage Atari ST MiniDisc Visual Basic NeXT USB flash drive MAME Spyware Symbolic link Minesweeper (computer game) HyperCard Computer file ZIP (file format) Files-11 Stardock Novell NetWare Cache OpenOffice.org MDAC History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Booting Database Logo programming language Extreme Programming Gmail System/36 C programming language Data recovery Disk cloning Microsoft Office TeX Thread (computer science) Knoppix ITunes Windows Server 2003 Disk formatting Personal computer Random access memory Nintendo Entertainment System Java programming language File format
