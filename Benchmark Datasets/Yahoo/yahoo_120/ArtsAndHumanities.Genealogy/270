how can i figure out my great grandfather's name my grandmother never knew who her dad was her mother had her out of wedlock which was very frowned upon back then i know that my grandmother's mom grew up in r county and i know that my grandmother also grew up in that same county however less than a month before my grandmother was born a census was done and shows that my grandmother's mom was living in p county with her sister and brother in law sometimes my grandmother would say she was born in r county and at other times she said it was p county i would assume that based on the fact that her mother was in p county less than a month before she was born that she was born there and then went to be raised in r county immediately afterwards i would guess that her mother just went there to sort of hide out while being pregnant i know that the father was a farm boy but everyone was a farmer then my aunt thinks his name may have been b but it is a very common name and she's not sure it was very common to ship an unwed mother off to a relative back then to try and save face where the family lived if your grandmother was living with her sister your mother probably was born in p county but if you know for a fact your grandmother was born in r county i'd make it a point to go there and hit the books at the court house plan on staying in that area for a few days so you can scrutinize death birth and will books along with land record books you can get copies of the pages of the books you need so be sure and take extra cash with you to cover the cost you might want to call them ahead of time and see what they charge so you are prepared you might want to try this at home first but if you have a digital camera try taking copies of books in a darker room to see how well they come out if it works ok take the camera with you and take pictures of the pages you need and save yourself the cost of copies unless you want the copies for your files be sure and record the letter number of the book and what page the information is on even record information you think might connect because you may connect some of it later i have done that before in va back when i had to hand write everything and still have the books in a box in the garage i was able to connect some of that information later when i got books with census records so was thankful i had gone ahead and recorded it even though i wasn't sure if they were kin or not also while you are there try to find family members who still live in that area and talk with them record your conversations for future reference and be sure and ask if that is ok with them first let them know you want to transcribe all the stories you gather for your records i have quite a few cassette tapes of my grandmother's cousins who shared stories and it was so neat to see the personality of each person and understand them a little better and what they went through take your digital camera wish we had had those when i started and take pictures of pictures they have so you will be able to put faces with names you might also try to get information at http www rootsweb com and see if you can gather as much information as possible before heading there remember this is just info others have recorded and may not always be accurate but it may still give you some leads and or connections enter the name you are looking for in the rootsweb area have to pay at ancestor then when you get to the next page click on worldconnect and see if anyone has entered your family information i have some lines i've not been able to connect either so i know how frustrating it can be but hope yours will be easier to locate just to give you some satisfaction and peace of mind have fun have lots of patience and don't give up too easily good
