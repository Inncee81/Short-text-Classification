lexmark x printer why wont it work as a stand alone i thought this model was supposed to work as a stand alone as well as via a keyboard command but mine doesnt what am i doing wrong yes sorry i meant to say that it is an all in one printer copier scanner and i cant get it to work as a stand alone photocopier i assume you mean as a copier since it doesn't have a card read for other media all i can suggest is that you read the manual again it may be that it uses the pc's memory as a cache for the copies so you will need it plugged into a pc that's actually running that seems to be implied in the specs copies when plugged into a pc look at functions if it was sold as able to do stand alone copying then you can demand a replacement money back as it isn't fit for purpose under the sale of good act providing it's less than months old jbv Photocopying Typewriter Copy protection Embedded system Computer printer Windows XP Inkjet printer System/36 Xerox Universal Serial Bus CPU cache Konica Minolta Digital photography Atari 8-bit family Multifunction printer Apple II family System/34 ZX Spectrum Laser printer Personal computer IPod Enigma machine Laptop Hewlett-Packard Xbox Computer Commodore 64 Apple Macintosh Cache CPU design Copyright infringement of software Windows 2000 Sinclair ZX81 Paper size Chester Carlson Killian documents Device driver Virtual memory Self-publishing IBM PC compatible TRS-80 Extreme Programming Floppy disk Copyleft Nintendo GameCube Common Unix Printing System Computer forensics CompactFlash IBM PC Trademark Public domain Telephone exchange Mac OS Computer hardware Intellivision Supply and demand Musical Instrument Digital Interface Publishing Spark plug Apple Newton Lexmark Law of value SCO-Linux controversies IMac Strap-on dildo Printing press TRS-80 Color Computer Photography PDP-8 IPAQ Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Redundant array of independent disks Business continuity planning PowerPC RISC Spring operating system Novell NetWare Vanity press Emacs Economics WebSphere Nintendo 64 PlayStation 3 No cloning theorem Friends Microeconomics Atomic Kitten Digital camera DVD Game Boy Celeron Modchip Burroughs B5000 Read-only memory Athlon Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Sega Dreamcast FireWire Mac OS X v10.4
