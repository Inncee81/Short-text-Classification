is it possible that computer printer ink will dry up in a printer if not used in a few years years i had this printer tucked away with its ink still in it for about years and im wondering if it will still work the ink that is they will dry up and block the nozzle of the ink cartridge you could clean it up but i don't think it would be worth it buying a new cartridge would be a smart way to go Computer printer Typewriter Cartridge (electronics) Laser printer Epson Seiko Corporation Dots per inch Printing press Dot matrix printer Fountain pen Printmaking Lexmark Razor and blades business model Magnetic ink character recognition Ink Konica Minolta Loss leader Commodore VIC-20 Ballpoint pen Digital rights management Screen-printing System/36 Commodore 64 Autograph Forensic identification Monopoly (game) Syringe Atari 8-bit family Staples, Inc.
