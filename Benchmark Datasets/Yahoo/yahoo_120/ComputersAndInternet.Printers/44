why is my printer not printing i have my hp c printer connected to my new hp desktop and when i try to print a document it never prints when i click the taskbar button that lists the jobs for the printer they all say error printing under 'status' the same thing happens when i connect the printer to my laptop i have the printer connected the exact same way as i did to my old pc when it worked just fine what could be wrong it could be that the old thing just wore out buy a new one this time get a canon new hp printer stink canon has better color better quality lower cost cartridges you really will love your new canon i know professional photographers that swear by them you see that old hp gave you a tri color cartridge so when yellow runs out you spend for a whole new cartridge but look at the canon it has a separate cartridge for each color so when yellow runs out you don't waste ink you would be surprise about how long some of the other colors last this saves a ton of money look for it at staples or other good retail store that offers a no hassle return policy check wal mart good luck and happy computing Computer printer Inkjet printer Windows XP Digital photography Mac OS X Laser printer Common Unix Printing System Dot matrix printer PostScript System/34 System/36 Game Boy Color Staples, Inc.
