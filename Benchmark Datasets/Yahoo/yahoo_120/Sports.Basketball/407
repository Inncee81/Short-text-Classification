denver nuggets will be playing the sixers at philedalphia will iverson get booed like how vince carter gets booed in toronto because he left the raptors i think iverson will get booed in philedalphia because he left the sixers but i guess you really cant blame the city's for hating the players that left them didnt dr j stay with the sixers unlike iverson he wanted to go don't compare iverson leaving philly to carter leaving toronto as far as i could tell iverson never mailed it in to force a trade where as carter would put up about pts a night and was outright beligerent about it mostly because the team moved his mother's preferred parking spot at the acc if iverson initiated the trade that sent him to denver he was at least quiet about it and still played his a game to enable the sixers to get fair value for him carter supplied raptor fans with plenty of reasons to give him the treatment he gets in toronto i remember seeing an interview with a couple portland players following one of carter's worse games where they said he tipped them off to the coming play near the end of a close game i doubt iverson would ever be accused of something like that so i hope not he deserves a round of applause for past efforts but then we are talking about philly fans here so who knows Rasheed Wallace Detroit Pistons NBA Finals New York Knicks Shaquille O'Neal 2005 NBA Finals New Jersey Nets 2004 NBA Finals Ben Wallace Toronto Raptors November 2004 in sports January 2005 in sports Steve Nash December 2004 in sports Yao Ming Chicago Bulls Dream Team Pittsburgh Steelers 1986 NBA Draft The Malice at The Palace Larry Bird Cleveland Browns Detroit Tigers National Basketball Association San Francisco Giants The NBA on ABC 2005 NBA Playoffs Utah Jazz June 2004 in sports International League Los Angeles Lakers 2005 World Series Kobe Bryant St. Louis Cardinals World Series Denver Nuggets Indianapolis Colts Emanuel Gin__bili Cleveland Indians Detroit Red Wings Pat Riley Ron Artest Minnesota Timberwolves Boston Red Sox San Antonio Spurs Michael Jordan ESPN25 Los Angeles Clippers Cincinnati Bengals Philadelphia 76ers Cleveland Cavaliers Grant Hill (basketball player) Miami Dolphins Larry Brown Knicks-Heat rivalry Water polo Tim Duncan September 2005 in sports Florida Marlins New England Patriots February 2005 in sports Continental Basketball Association Karl Malone Detroit Lions Bill Laimbeer NBA Draft Babe Ruth July 2004 in sports Super Bowl XVII Basketball Washington Wizards Free throw Miami Heat Houston Rockets Toronto Blue Jays Reggie Jackson Los Angeles Kings Joe Dumars Women's National Basketball Association Curse of the Bambino Phil Jackson Curse of the Billy Goat Cincinnati Reds Satchel Paige October 2004 in sports Super Bowl V Robert Horry 1957 World Series Portland Trail Blazers San Francisco 49ers October 4 in baseball National Football League Lore Playoff October 15 in baseball Toronto Maple Leafs Dennis Rodman New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets
