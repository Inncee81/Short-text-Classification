what current players in the nba do you think will be in the hall of fame tell at least note the nba does not have its own hall of fame as currently the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame is the only basketball hall of fame around with less than half of its member being nba basketball players maybe only rd of its members being retired nba basketball players something like players from every league of about hall of fame members so it is very very difficult for a nba player to get into the only basketball hall of fame so just being a many time nba all star will not get someone into the naismith memorial hall of fame without a very long and successful nba career full of nba championships nba scoring titles nba mvps etc as the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame is not a nba hall of fame and as the nba does not have a hall of fame your average many time nba all star without a very long career of over a dozen years without championships plural and scoring titles plural and mvps plural will not see the inside of the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame for many years if ever phil jackson coach to be inducted in sept nba referee mendy rudolph to be inducted in sept michael jordan karl malone tim duncan shaquille o neal hakeem olajuwon adrian dantley steve nash kevin garnett allen iverson jason kidd john stockton scottie pippen patrick ewing gary payton dennis johnson nba coach don nelson nba coach popovich nba referee earl strom nba commissioner david stern kobe bean bryant naismith hall of fame seems to be very good character conscious so it may take kobe until old age to be considered unless kobe wins a championship or two on his own and some mvps and maybe in time chris webber dirk reggie miller tim hardaway tracy mcgrady as there is no such thing as a nba hall of fame most likely the following will never be in the naismith memorial hall of fame at least based on present successes ben wallace not the type of player that the naismith hof honors being a shot blocker with nba title does not do it durant a long shot you need a long and very successful nba career to make this hall of fame robert horry no individual achievements no chance gilbert arenas a very long shot at this point needs a very successful nba career billups little to no chance at this point lebron needs a very successful long nba career carmelo needs a very successful long nba career ray allen without additional major achievements no paul pierce without additional major achievements no wade needs a very successful long nba career vince carter needs a championship or mvp living on a rep of being able to dunk will not get anyone into the hall of fame antawn jamison needs a very successful long nba career rasheed wallace no due to character issues and lack of individual achievements yao ming needs a very long and successful nba career grant hill not even close right now mutumbo not even close brent barry never bibby henry bibby or mike bibby neither never manu not even on the hall's radar screen probably too old at this point parker not on the hall's radar screen if parker can average over ppg win some more titles or win a mvp or two maybe marion not on the hall's radar screen jermaine o'neal not on the hall's radar screen derek fisher what but no dwight howard needs a very long successful nba career not on the hall of fame's radar screen josh smith needs a very long successful nba career not on the hall of fame's radar screen anfernee not really without a miracle comeback amare stoudemire needs a long and very successful nba career and more than just first team all nba not on the hall of fame's radar screen chris bosh needs a very long and successful nba career but at this point not on the hall of fame's radar screen vin baker not even on hall of fame's radar screen joe johnson never jason terry never carlos boozer needs a very long and very successful nba career deron williams needs a very long and very successful nba career
