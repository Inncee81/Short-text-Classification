will reggie miller be successful if he unretires with the celtics the game may have gotten too fast during the time he's been away from the game hopefully he still has shooting touch i watched reggie up close for wonderful seasons here in indy and watched him put this city on the map he opened the door for the colts to be successful fan wise in this city i also noticed in his last season that his interest level went down alot due to the young money hungry rookies and most of all the fights he wanted out and i didn't blame him when i first heard about him possibly coming back with the celtics their was only one explanation in my mind ring we got shot down by the lakers in and so did reggie can he help the celtics yes he is old but will never give up he will give the celtics every thing that he has even if its minutes he is by far the best clutch playoff performer of all time and will be a dynamite th man he can also help the young kids become men in the game reggie is good for this game and a perfect fit in boston just paul pierce ray allen and reggie miller can lead them to a championship in the weak east but you add in kev and its done kevin garnett is a top center if not the best center in the league and the atlantic division is getting weaker jason kidd and the nets are aging chris bosh cant handle garnett and both ny and philly are still going to be in the basement of the division the only division that can handle boston is the central and detroit showed that they are not the power any more i think cleveland is going to be a or seed next year not a or like they've been capable of bottom line reggie is the icing on bostons cake National Basketball Association New Jersey Nets Indiana Pacers New York Knicks Shaquille O'Neal NBA Draft Detroit Tigers Los Angeles Clippers Women's National Basketball Association Kobe Bryant Detroit Pistons Chris Webber Orlando Magic Utah Jazz NBA Finals Portland Trail Blazers January 2005 in sports 1992-93 NHL season 1986 NBA Draft Chicago Bulls July 2004 in sports Emanuel Gin__bili Minnesota Timberwolves The NBA on ABC Toronto Raptors Gary Payton (basketball) San Antonio Spurs December 2004 in sports Continental Basketball Association February 2005 in sports Ben Wallace 2005 NBA Playoffs Larry Bird Michael Jordan NBA Live series Jerry Krause Dream Team 2004 NBA Finals Steve Nash Wilt Chamberlain National Football League Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ESPN Los Angeles Kings Philadelphia 76ers Carlos Arroyo Charles Barkley EA Sports New York Giants Terrell Owens Toronto Blue Jays Rasheed Wallace Tracy McGrady The Malice at The Palace Stephon Marbury Chauncey Billups Philadelphia Flyers Pat Riley Jason Kidd Chicago White Sox November 2004 in sports Karl Malone Buck Williams Basketball Muggsy Bogues David Robinson (basketball player) Denver Nuggets Phoenix Suns August 2005 in sports Dikembe Mutombo Oakland Athletics Larry Brown David Thompson (basketball player) Houston Rockets Tim Duncan June 2004 in sports Robert Horry Cliff Robinson (basketball player born 1966) Grant Hill (basketball player) Wayne Gretzky Vince Carter History of baseball in the United States Julius Erving Jermaine O'Neal Dale Davis Golden State Warriors Manny Ram__rez 2005 NBA Finals Pittsburgh Pirates Isiah Thomas Tayshaun Prince Colorado Avalanche June 2005 in sports October 2004 in sports November 3 in baseball International League Moses Malone Reggie Miller
