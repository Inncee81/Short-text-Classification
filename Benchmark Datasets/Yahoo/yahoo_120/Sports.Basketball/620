most domenant of all time ok here's my question so many people say bill russell was the greatest center of all time cause of his rings not to take anything away from him granted he was a beast on d but if that were the case championship wise then rob horry would be the greatest power foreward of all time right he's got more rings then any other in my opinion when people say russell was better then wilt and shaq is the most domenant center of all time have either scored pts in a game or avg pts and rebs then when critics said all the big dipper was was a chucker the very next year he led the league in asst's name another that has done that so what i'm getting at is how can people think russle is the greatest of all time i'd like to know i think when he says most dominant he is talking about the most dominant center not the most dominant players but to answer your question i think russell is the most dominant center ever defensively i dont think he is the most dominant center overall that probably belongs to wilt i think your right russell gets more credit as a player because he was on such a stacked team wilt was always getting beat by russell's celtics that doesnt mean that russell was better just his team but russell still deserves alot of credit and is one of the best of all time still wilt was more dominant Boston Celtics NBA Finals Larry Bird National Basketball Association Kevin McHale Indiana Pacers New York Knicks Michael Jordan Houston Rockets Chicago Bulls Basketball Julius Erving Minnesota Timberwolves Dream Team San Antonio Spurs Ramon Rivas Tim Duncan New Jersey Nets Philadelphia 76ers Salary cap Women's National Basketball Association Toronto Raptors Continental Basketball Association 2005 NBA Finals Phoenix Suns Kobe Bryant Lakers-Celtics rivalry Playoff format Golden State Warriors NBA Live series NBA Draft Los Angeles Clippers Moses Malone Gary Payton (basketball) Dennis Rodman Charles Barkley Rasheed Wallace ESPN25 Bill Walton Los Angeles Lakers Larry Brown Detroit Pistons Playoff Orlando Magic Robert Parish Steve Nash Karl Malone 1986 NBA Draft San Diego Padres January 2005 in sports NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team Tag Yao Ming New Mexico Lobo Basketball Atlanta Hawks Allen Iverson Shaquille O'Neal Phil Jackson UEFA Champions League Isiah Thomas College basketball Bill Fitch Table tennis Flip Saunders University of Arizona February 2005 in sports Three-point field goal December 2004 in sports Hakeem Olajuwon National Hockey League Paul Westphal 2005 NBA Playoffs New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Norway national football team 2004 NBA Finals 2004 World Series David Robinson (basketball player) Home team November 2004 in sports Carlos Arroyo Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Tony Parker Bill Russell (basketball) Cleveland Cavaliers Football (soccer) June 2005 in sports Volleyball Magic Johnson World Series Danny Ainge San Francisco 49ers NBA Street LeBron James Portland Trail Blazers Rick Carlisle NBA Draft Lottery Los Angeles Kings Bobby Knight
