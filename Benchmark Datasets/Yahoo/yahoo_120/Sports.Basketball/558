gerald wallace or j rich i know they're on the same team but who would you rather have if i had a scorer on my team already i'd say g force g force isn't really known for his scoring but he can still put up some buckets he dropped against the wizards when i went to see him play a couple months ago most of them were hustle points fast break points and free throws but he did his thing we all know his defense is great now j rich is a far better shooter i can't really penalize the guy for playing with guys in similar roles and with the warriors style he couldn't really show his overall talent he was mainly a jump shooter and defense wasn't apart of anything oakland did last year anyway overall i'd say gerald but for example if my small forward was someone like a bruce bowen i'd choose jason richardson regardless i see this duo working very well together this up and coming season Wilt Chamberlain New York Knicks NBA Finals Philadelphia 76ers Golden State Warriors Chicago Bulls Larry Bird January 2005 in sports Julius Erving Jerry Lucas Michael Jordan Continental Basketball Association Los Angeles Clippers Allen Iverson Basketball NBA Rookie of the Year Award Toronto Raptors New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Reggie Miller Utah Jazz Tim Duncan Los Angeles Lakers Houston Rockets Orlando Magic National Basketball Association Magic Johnson Shaquille O'Neal NBA Draft Kareem Abdul-Jabbar New Jersey Nets George Mikan Steve Nash Moses Malone San Antonio Spurs Wayne Simien Isiah Thomas Bill Russell (basketball) Pat Garrity Knicks-Heat rivalry LeBron James December 2004 in sports Minnesota Timberwolves Nate Thurmond Yao Ming Tracy McGrady David Robinson (basketball player) Stephon Marbury Dream Team Tom Gola Playoff format February 2005 in sports Pete Maravich Jerry Krause Ben Wallace Charles Barkley Eddy Curry Danny Manning Women's National Basketball Association New Mexico Lobo Basketball Oscar Robertson Rasheed Wallace Lakers-Celtics rivalry The NBA on ABC Larry Brown Kobe Bryant Dwyane Wade Cliff Robinson (basketball player born 1966) Denver Nuggets Penny Hardaway 2004 NBA Finals David Thompson (basketball player) Dikembe Mutombo Phoenix Suns 2005 NBA Finals NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team Muggsy Bogues Kappa Alpha Psi John Starks Patrick Ewing Three-point field goal Dominoes Cincinnati Bengals Detroit Pistons Bill King Chris Webber American Basketball League 1961-63 New York Giants Luther Head November 2004 in sports Rod Strickland Walt Frazier Kevin McHale Jerome Williams Jeff Hornacek Toronto Maple Leafs Carlos Arroyo Harlem Globetrotters Jermaine O'Neal
