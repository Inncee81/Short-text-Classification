can boston dominate the east their stars don't have much experience with each other and they don't have playoff experience will they do good in the playoffs or just be like denver when they acquired a i as a celtic fan i still don't think they can dominate but they should definitely make a good run at the playoffs they have alot to do still but i think the big are already starting to gel and they will be able to work well with each other the main concern is whether rajon rondo and kendrick perkins will be able to hold up their end of the bargain and be productive players if they do then the finals aren't really out of reach but it will be a hard fought battle all the way p s celtics just signed f c scot pollard to a one year deal for the league vet min million New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Pittsburgh Steelers NBA Finals Los Angeles Clippers National Football League Philadelphia 76ers New York Giants Miami Dolphins New England Patriots Houston Rockets Playoff Los Angeles Kings Boston Celtics Cleveland Browns Oakland Athletics New Jersey Nets International League New York Jets Salary cap Orlando Magic San Antonio Spurs Boston Red Sox 2004-05 NHL lockout Buffalo Bills Nottingham Forest F.C.
