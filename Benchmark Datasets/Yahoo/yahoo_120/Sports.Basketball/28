what do you think about reggie miller possibly returning to the nba should players come back or move teams just so they can try to win a ring i mean isn't that what every team is doing every year anyway so what if year old reggie miller wants to come back year old charles oakley wants to come back too maybe the celtics could sign him larry bird isn't doing much but running the pacers into the ground maybe he wants to don the green and white again i think year old rober parish and year old kevin willis are available to be your backup centers and if that falls through beg bill walton to give up the commentary job he sucks at to be a celtic again it's funny because miller doesn't make them better or worse classic case of what happens when rich people get bored Indiana Pacers New York Knicks Boston Celtics Chicago Bulls Los Angeles Clippers Reggie Miller NBA Finals New Jersey Nets Philadelphia 76ers Dream Team Toronto Raptors Buffalo Bills Houston Rockets January 2005 in sports Continental Basketball Association 2005 NBA Finals Pittsburgh Steelers Bill Walton Three-point field goal Carolina Panthers The Malice at The Palace Reggie Jackson December 2004 in sports New York Jets Orlando Magic November 2004 in sports 1986 NBA Draft Cheryl Miller Kevin McHale Green Bay Packers ESPN25 World Series Phoenix Suns Detroit Pistons Detroit Tigers Charles Barkley Rick Carlisle Major League Baseball television contracts Cleveland Browns February 2005 in sports Celtic F.C.
