good tips in playing better defense in basketball just lost a game last night because of my bad defense disappointed the team and disappointed in myself keep your knees low and bent keep your arms wide apart like you're about to hug a pound wrestler keep your feet parallel to each other but always have one foot in a higher row than the other place one hand covering the ball where the player is dribbling use left hand to cover a player dribbling with their right hand use right hand to cover a player dribbling with their left hand use the opposite hand not covering the ball to cover the player's eyes to make sure he can't see the floor keep your head and eyes at a perpendicular angle to the player you're guarding so you can see a bigger picture instead of turning your head to the right and left just to catch a glimpse of every move the player you're defending makes do not look at the ball when defending but focus on the dribbler's body position and make adjustment to make sure your body is always perpendicular to their's force the player to go a direction they are not used to or dribble with the hand they aren't comfortable with if you're defending a player who likes to drive back down and give them enough space to shoot from outside if you're defending a player who likes to shoot move close to them and suffocate them with your defense so you can force them to put the ball on the court and drive that's all i can think of right now just work on this pointers and keep these techniques in mind the next you're on the court and you should be fine good luck Volleyball Basketball Professional wrestling holds Glossary of American football Personal foul Professional wrestling throws Baseball Field hockey Water polo Table tennis Rugby union positions Batting (cricket) Snooker Four square Rugby union Softball Professional wrestling attacks Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Pittsburgh Steelers Billiards American football Glossary of partner dance terms Swingout Mixed martial arts Professional wrestling aerial techniques Rugby league Norway national football team Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Mouse (computing) Tag Paintball Tennis New York Giants American football strategy Michael Jordan Canadian football Laws of cricket Racquetball Chick Hearn Marching band Wide receiver Badminton Harrow Football Skateboarding trick Pole vault Fielding (cricket) Football (soccer) Cleveland Browns Glossary of ballet terms Rasheed Wallace Curling Poker jargon Cricket Equine conformation Eight ball Anchor Squash (sport) Suplex Airsoft San Francisco 49ers Anatomical terms of location Fencing Beer Pong Parade (military) New York Knicks Boxing Three-point field goal National Football League Lore Golf Archery Toronto Raptors Carolina Panthers Shogi Chess strategy and tactics Salute National Football League Dominoes Stereoscopy Terminal ballistics New England Patriots Glossary of climbing terms Super Bowl IX Double bass Yao Ming Super Bowl XIV Tenshinhan Taikyoku shogi Piledriver (professional wrestling) Neckbreaker Pinball Professional wrestling slang
