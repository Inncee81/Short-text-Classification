why is everyone so jealous of kobe bryant he's the greatest ever by far and everyone knows it however people still talk as if jordan might have been better people should let kobe be and acknowledge him as the best athlete not only in basketball but in the history of sports i think people are just jealous because he has shown far superior character and athleticism i think it's the media's fault obviously the media was mad that kobe wouldn't sell out like jordan did so the media cuts him down every chance it gets jordan was a huge sellout and kobe has more character than to put his name on junk kobe did not even go to trial for anything and they call him a rapist that's stupid if we had an unbiased media then kobe would be regarded as the greatest basketball player ever Salary cap 2004-05 NHL lockout Flat tax Microeconomics Michael Jordan 1994 baseball strike Chicago Bulls Wheel of Fortune National Football League Knots Landing Jarom__r J__gr Supply and demand NBA Finals Capital accumulation Tax Warren Buffett Nike, Inc.
