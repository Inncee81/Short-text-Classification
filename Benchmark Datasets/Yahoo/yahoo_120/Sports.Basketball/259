lakers solution lets hear your opinion i think the best plan for the lakers is just to hold on this season and wait kobe can't opt out of his contract next summer so i say they just wait till when kwame brown's million dollar contract expires giving them cap room to sign a big free agent like gilbert arenas or shawn marion next trade off odom for key role players players such as robert horry brent barry chris duhon and boris diaw have a line up of something like gilbert arenas derek fisher kobe bryant brent barry robert horry luke walton boris diaw radmanovic chris mihm andrew bynum good plan huh this should provide kobe with a championship contender and satisfy him enough to sign a new contract since trading kobe seems like a bad idea he's never going to be happy anywhere else he needs a city like los angeles to put on his show he loves the spotlight too much and the city needs a player like him to draw a crowd and keep fan loyalty up plus after the fit he just had im not sure any other contending teams are going to want him on their team publicly bashing their players and front office or how about a line up like derek fisher jordan farmar kobe bryant brent barry shawn marion luke walton andrew bynum radmanovic alonzo mourning chris mihm i think we should wait till next year to make any trades all the good players are taken and nobody wants to let them go our best bet is have the lakers get along and play wiht passion all year and i mean the whole team we are a young team and i really think bynum will step up this year last year we were not suppost to make the playoffs according to everybody else and we did so there was an improvement i don't understand why people are talking smack kobe needs to be a better leader and help this guys grow because if he does that and then win the championship i would feel better and people will have more respect for him we could get another superstar or two then realy kobe did not lead us to the crown i know la is a demanding town but we will be ok go lakers Dallas Mavericks San Francisco 49ers Dallas Cowboys New England Patriots Pittsburgh Steelers Steve Nash Kansas City Chiefs Cleveland Browns New York Giants American Football League Rugby union positions Page Falkenberg Super Bowl XXVII Miami Dolphins Indianapolis Colts Baltimore Ravens Super Bowl X Super Bowl VI Dallas Stars Water polo Buffalo Bills Ravi Shastri Super Bowl XXI Indiana Pacers National Basketball Association Super Bowl XIV Super Bowl V High jump University of Texas at Arlington Super Bowl XII National Football League Lore Dirk Nowitzki Minnesota Vikings Mark Calaway Hank Stram 2005 NFL season Brian Close FC Rostov San Antonio Spurs Rugby union St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XIII Super Bowl XXVIII Dog agility GunBound Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXX History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) National Football League New York Knicks Super Bowl XXXI Cincinnati Bengals Michael Jordan Super Bowl I NBA Finals University of Texas at Dallas Vince Lombardi Super Bowl Norway national football team Detroit Lions Super Bowl XXV Cross site scripting Utah Jazz World Series Yao Ming Dallas Texans (NFL) Tampa Bay Buccaneers Toronto Raptors Dennis Rodman Arkansas Razorbacks Donovan McNabb Jack Charlton International cricket in 2005 Nickname Super Bowl VII Jerry Krause Pok__mon Trading Card Game Kapil Dev Clown Lance Hoyt Ice hockey All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship November 2 in baseball Mack Brown Super Bowl IX HTML element Oakland Athletics Karl Malone Grant Hill (basketball player) Super Bowl XXXVI Germ__n Figueroa Super Bowl XVII Texas Longhorn Athletics Pat Riley Badminton Atlanta Falcons ESPN25 1957 World Series Florida Marlins Ra (board game)
