i believe the clippers will do good next season here's why i have a good feeling they will make it into the playoffs this year although elton brand injured his achilles he will be percent better around month into the season which isn't to bad al thornton will be able to contribute right away and will defintely help the clippers with his athleticism and potential they also just recently signed brevin knight he was an underrated point guard and averages about assists for game he was exactly who the clippers needed so their lineup would be elton brand pf sam cassell brevin knight pg corey maggette sf al thornton backup sf chris kaman c cuttin mobely sg frequently used bench players tim thomas quintin ros the clippers have picked up a great point guard for their needs and picked a future star in al thornton i think the clippers made excellent moves considering their salary i hope the best for the clippers next season and for those who hate on the clippers don't be hatin i don't think the clippers will rush brand back into the season after he has his surgery because he nba season is a marathon not a sprint they'll probably keep him out for months to give the injured achilles tendon some time to heal i injured my tendon playing b ball and it took me at least months get off a boot and crutches but in brand's case he also has to deal with his achilles so it may take a little longer the reason why the clippers won't rush him back is because why would they want to jeopardize their playoff hopes just to win a few more games at the beginning of the season but you do bring up a valid point now that they've signed point man brevin knight it should be a perfect fit on a team full of scorers mobley maggette brand t thomas and thornton knight should have no problems finding a scorers and he should have a career year in the assists categroy next season they have a decent bench and a fomidable starting lineup the one downside to this team is the age declining in performance factor cassell mobley t thomas brand and even maggette most of the key players on this team are either in their prime or declining in performance adding thornton gave the clippers some youth to build upon while brevin knight supply some leadership in the absence of livingston and cassell but the question still remains whether this groups still has enough in the tank to compete in a tough western conference that question will ride heavily on the shoulders of elton brand Chicago Bulls New York Knicks Indiana Pacers Toronto Raptors Orlando Magic International League Houston Rockets Minnesota Timberwolves New York Giants NBA Finals Boston Bruins Mario Lemieux National Football League Pittsburgh Steelers Carolina Panthers New York Jets New England Patriots New Jersey Nets Cincinnati Bengals Steve Nash Toronto Blue Jays New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Utah Jazz 1986 NBA Draft Buffalo Bills San Francisco 49ers Cleveland Browns Michael Jordan Los Angeles Kings Detroit Red Wings Yao Ming Kobe Bryant Luther Head January 2005 in sports National Basketball Association 1957 World Series Super Bowl XXVII Playoff Miami Dolphins Wayne Gretzky Rodney Rogers Baseball Hartford Whalers December 2004 in sports LeBron James Larry Bird Women's National Basketball Association NBA Draft Bobby Knight Philadelphia 76ers Continental Basketball Association West Bromwich Albion F.C.
