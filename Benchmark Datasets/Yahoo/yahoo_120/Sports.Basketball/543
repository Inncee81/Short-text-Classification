my very very early division predictions so much more could still happen as far as trades and what not but right now here are my predictions for the division races this upcoming season east new jersey boston toronto new york philly cleveland detroit chicago milwaukee indiana miami washington orlando charlotte atlanta west phoenix golden state lakers kings clippers with brand out for awhile utah denver portland seattle minnesota san antonio dallas houston new orleans memphis comments agree disagree nice work but i like boston and toronto over new jersey still if new jersey develops chemistry finds a way to get jefferson more involved and if just one post player steps up you could be right on there i like chicago over detroit and must stress that i think miami has a good chance to take their division but the three top teams there will all win less than games but all three might make the playoffs anyway in the west dallas may have a better record than san antonio but again i expect san antonio to be a better playoff team golden state and the lakers should run neck and neck again this year but i do have the warriors over the lakers the dark horse is houston as they gear up to be an up tempo team they could present real problems even for the spurs and dallas still i agree with you but would like to add that those three teams could have three of the top four records in the regular season and if phoenix falters maybe even the three best Chicago Bulls Toronto Raptors Charles Oakley NBA Finals New York Knicks Shaggy dog story Charles Barkley The Simpsons San Francisco 49ers Salary cap Professional wrestling slang Lady Bouvier's Lover Nike, Inc. 2005 NBA Finals New Jersey Nets NBA Jam Bulls-Knicks Rivalry Poker jargon Philadelphia 76ers Redundant array of independent disks Doomsday argument The Amazing Race Airport Chess strategy and tactics Scottie Pippen Backstreet Boys 1957 World Series Theory of conduct Pinball Futurama (TV series - season 5) Frederick Forsyth Cheap Trick Buck Williams Watch Playoff format ESPN25 Strap-on dildo The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Annie Oakley Aerial (dance move) Coming of Age (TNG episode) The Allman Brothers Band Escape from New York Embedded system Who Shot Mr. Burns?
