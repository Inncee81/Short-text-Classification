why american players go to college why american soccer players go to college and not instead club youth etc similar to system in other countries i e england brazil that is a good question this question goes beyond soccer and is really more a question for america football basketball and to a certain extent baseball soccer is small time in this realm but is still partially in the realm of college athletics why are professional developmental athletic competitions affiliated with universities on the one hand there is entertainment sometimes very expensive many coaches make over a million dollars per year there are huge tv contracts for college basketball and college football perhaps in the billions of dollars there is probably more money and attendance in american college athletics than there is in most international soccer leagues the stadiums in michigan ohio tennessee and pennsylvania seat over people and they nearly always are filled to capacity for games in many cases the educational aspect is manipulated to fit the often lesser academic capability of many athletes lessening the integrity of the universities the players are not given salaries just scholarships for tuition room and board it is common knowledge that big time college athletes get large under the table payments though there are anecdotes of how families of big time college athletes are often given jobs by college boosters as an incentive to get the athlete to go to a specific college las vegas has active wagering on college athletics since these athletes technically are not paid wages to pay despite often huge revenues for what they do the athletes are likely very prone to being approached by gamblers or organized crime figures for manipulating game results this is likely a domain that has more problems than people are aware of but that people would rather not know about while many people are very aware of abuses in college athletics they tend to turn a blind eye to what is the reality there much like how they once did with steroids at some point in the future there may be change in the status of having a form of professional athletics affiliated directly with colleges there is a unique situation at a college in utah byu that i could see replicated in other college sports byu would not sanction ncaa soccer there was an active and successful soccer club there that wanted to enhance it's status this college club team actually joined a small soccer minor league the pdl technically these athletes could be paid to play perhaps a percentage if anyone paid to see a game perhaps a percentage of any media revinue to meet the standards of their league they do not actually have students playing on the team and there is not a strict year requirement for playing eligibility i think that college sports should evolve to such a status there would be more integrity for the academics and for the athletics then American football Brigham Young University National Football League Salary cap Major League Soccer Football (soccer) Baseball Education in the United States University of Michigan College soccer Oakland Athletics Sports betting Minor league baseball College football Ivy League University of Notre Dame Sport in the United Kingdom University of Houston College basketball Major League Baseball Major professional sports league Sport in Ireland University of Alabama Middle Tennessee State University Football Playoff Amateurism San Diego State University Culture of the United States St. John's University, New York University of Florida Big East Conference Indiana University Bloomington Professional sports Basketball Sport Atlantic Coast Conference University of Central Florida Match fixing Syracuse University Orange University of Arizona Gambling Texas Longhorn Athletics West Virginia University Tulane University University of Maryland, College Park Slot machine 2004-05 NHL lockout University of Texas at Austin Big Ten Conference Microeconomics Jim Thorpe Washington State University Michigan Wolverines Joe Paterno Duke University Cornell University Playoff format Georgetown University History of rugby league Water polo Heidelberg College International League Rugby union Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania University of Virginia History of baseball in the United States Affirmative action University of San Diego Auburn University New Mexico Lobo Basketball University of San Francisco National Collegiate Athletic Association National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines) University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus University of Pretoria University of Connecticut Blackjack Rugby football University of Tennessee Satchel Paige Yale University University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Clemson University Boise State University College Georgia Institute of Technology
