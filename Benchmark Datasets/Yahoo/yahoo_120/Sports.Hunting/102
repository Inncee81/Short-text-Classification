does anyone own a cz pistol what do you like about it any dislikes what holster do you carry it in thanks i like the b model i had a cz p tactical version and i loved it i loved it so much that i sold it to my fiancee's brother so there was at least one gun in the house in case there was a burglary or badguy outside i think cz makes an amazing product which is vastly underrated armalite has just begun selling pistols which are based on the cz design and as you can see they're pretty expensive and very reliable i bought a cz for my father and a cz sp for myself this year now the cz is almost identical to my gun except for the sw caliber which is quickly becoming my favorite in terms of performance and accuracy the only gripe i have with the cz is the availability of magazines which i couldn't find many of i have mags for my cz sp since the cz 's are easier to find anyway the price should be around or less and i'd definitely pick one up if you like how it feels they're very nice guns and are very very reliable as far as holsters i carry mine in a don hume yaqui slide holster for a glock it'll also fit in other glock holsters but will have to break into them because of the position of the slide release since yours doesn't have the light rail there should be other holsters designed specifically for your pistol GLOCK Beretta 92F/FS Pistol Cartridge (firearms) Carbine Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Airsoft Five-seveN M240 Firearm GLOCK 23 Internal ballistics M60 machine gun 10 mm Auto .357 SIG Revolver Heckler & Koch USP Machine gun M82 (rifle) GLOCK 19 Mauser .22 Long Rifle Submachine gun Messerschmitt Bf 109 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Shotgun U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Rifle Air gun M1 Carbine .40 S&W Makarov PM SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Medium machine gun Terminal ballistics .45 ACP M249 Counter-Strike M4 Sherman Punisher Nambu pistol P-51 Mustang Guns N' Roses Saturday night special Heckler & Koch G3 Sten Sniper rifle B-47 Stratojet Battlefield 2 Gun politics Halo: Combat Evolved Smith & Wesson Suppressor Microeconomics Colt's Manufacturing Company RoboCop AR-18 Combine (Half-Life 2) .44 Magnum Day of Defeat Assault rifle Heckler & Koch MP5 Steyr Mannlicher M1901 Desert Eagle Federal assault weapons ban Beretta 8000 Cougar F Inox Heinkel He 112 Jericho 941 Beretta 8000F Cougar L Type P Sex Pistols Cessna T-37 Krag-J__rgensen Chevrolet Camaro Beretta 92FS Vertec M3 Grease Gun Steyr Mannlicher M1894 F-16 Fighting Falcon Tank Beretta 92 Combat Marathon (computer game) Kammerlader M4 Carbine Light gun Beretta 92SB Gun control in the United States (by state) SA80 Saiga-12 Ammunition .45 GAP Mini-14 Beretta 92 Stock Holster Wildcat cartridge
