finally proof that not hunting makes you gay http www worldnetdaily com news article asp article id in this article the writer who is actually a health food pinko go figure speaks against soy based products of any kind and seeks to ensure real protein is a consistant part of everones diet since soy is one of the primary ways that the health food types get their protein does that mean that eventually all vegans become gay really i'm going huntin' actually i really want to hear from people who are all the above concerning this issue i will get some very nasty replies but i want to see what people think of the article my apologies if i offend you but i am not afraid to speak or act as necessary cheers you know other than zeebya the gays and vegans had far more intellectual responses to this question i think it is legitimite though the words may have been poorly chosen initially for this forum as we have had several discussions on the value of protein and hunting to deliver it boker i wont even waste words on your enlightened smirk intellect this question was designed clearly to outline the dumbassery of the author and his right wing approach to encapsulate all things misunderstood i like soy i have been having sex with women for over years now this article wont change any of that zeebya in response to your edit also when it comes to my position on gays i could give a shi i place my value on the human and not their sexual preferences frankly i think the guy is a complete quack and deserves the ridicule he has recieved from these questions i used the entry question to pis people off and get them to respond it worked my real reason for generating the question was that my son is months old and due to unfortunate circumstances can only drink soy formula i would really like to know the truth about the impact of estrogen on a male infant thanks for the feedback folks i will leave it open for a while if you want to continue snapper head is that the best you can do that was just a cheap shot with no substance or thought at least think about it and get back to me trust me my son is the most normal person in my family good at least we know where you stand if not how yeah i added hotsauce to my crow too thanks for all the input good bad indifferent hey i'm gay and i'm not a vegan and i enjoy hunting and fishing i am also pro gun possession and i'm fully capable of beating the crap out of bigoted homophobes any other stupid questions you'd like to post and in response to your further edit you sound like you're talking out of both sides of your mouth what's your point are you for this article or against it are you pro gay or anti gay by the way i read the article and i think the author is a jerk soy causes males to be homosexual sh it i've been gay all my life yes from the time i was i knew and i've never touched any soy products other than the occasional soy sauce on my chinese food where does this idiot get his facts from i also know plenty of men who consume large amounts of soy products that are perfectly heterosexual as to hunting being the playground of males look at african lions it's almost always the female who brings down a kill i don't think the author is a pinko but rather another homophobe i am living proof that gay men can be very macho a lot of people think i remind them of indiana jones i'd say that's pretty macho and to shon below you wanna take a shot at me it better be a good one the first time because if it ain't i'll handle you like the coward you are sir i'm sorry to hear of your son's health issues but at least you have a handle on his needs i make no claims to know about whether overdoses of estrogen can somehow cause a tendency toward homosexuality i would say it's not terribly likely but again i'm not a biologist i will say that just as it's possible for me to be openly gay while not using soy products it should be just as possible for someone using soy products to be heterosexual maybe this is racist but look at how many asians use soy as a basic staple in their diet i don't think they have any higher or lower instance of homosexuality than any other racial or cultural group sorry if i seemed snappish but you said it yourself you posted the question the way you did in order to get a rise out of people well i rose to the bait guess i should look before i leap huh besides i
