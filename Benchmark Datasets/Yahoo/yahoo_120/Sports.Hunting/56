how much is my s w magnum revolver worth i bought it a year ago and have only fired about rounds with it it is in great condition and has zero problems i want to sell it fast probably to a gun shop how much can i expect to get for it and will a gun shop even buy it i don't care if i get a little below what it is worth i'd rather sell it fast will a gun shop buy it from me if you take it to a gun shop you can expect to be offered about of what you paid for it if you are lucky if you take it to a pawnshop they will offer about of what you paid for it if you pawn it and maybe if you sell it outright your best bet is to take it to a gun show or post it in a local advertiser and ask about the same thing you paid for it be willing to knock off a hundred or so to make it move fast good luck i've had to sell guns to pay bills so i know it is no fun doc Pawnbroker Craps Poker jargon Neopets Wheel of Fortune Blackjack Airsoft Insurance Guns N' Roses Best Buy Anti-aircraft warfare The Amazing Race Revolver $ale of the Century Betting (poker) Dirty Harry Make money fast Social rule Mortgage GunZ The Duel The Apprentice 2 Microeconomics Mauser Health insurance Retailer Monopoly (game) Carbine Shopping British Home Guard Animal Crossing One Piece minor characters Amazon.com Luck Electronic commerce T-34 Machine gun Oakland Athletics Arbitrage Outsourcing Leasing Marathon (computer game) Major League Baseball television contracts .44 Magnum The Man with the Golden Gun Tenshinhan Dot-com Temasek Holdings CBS Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters YuYu Hakusho Warren Buffett Computer chess Chess strategy and tactics Internal ballistics Ammunition Gun show Arianne ITV About a Boy Pulp Fiction Cable television Short selling Wan Chai Broadband Internet access Billboard Hot 100 Advance Wars: Dual Strike Adam Worth M4 Sherman Gold as an investment Marilyn Monroe Cheating in Counter-Strike Battle of Tarawa Desert Eagle Paintball Ethical consumerism Economics Surveillance Advanced Squad Leader Wal-Mart Endgame Money Wyatt Earp Bond OV-10 Bronco UK Singles Chart Handloading The Care Bears (television series) History of the Beatles Dairy Opportunity cost Deflation (economics) Reservoir Dogs GLOCK Capitalism Dodge Charger Battle of Worth Great Depression Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Jarmann M1884
