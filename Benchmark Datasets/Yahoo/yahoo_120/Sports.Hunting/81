looking to fire a gun that i am not sure if its ever been fired my father has a reproduction of a steyr mannlicher m that i would like to take out and shoot for fun i do not know if it has ever been fired my father told me he got it at a gun show and has never fired it himself i am no expert but it seems to be working all the parts move smoothly and look solid and the barrel looks strait and clear what do i need to do to make sure it is in working order and around how much will it cost i honestly don't know much about the different ways to measure caliber and only know what i found doing research on the gun i am pretty sure that it uses the x r or mm rounds this is where i looked up the history and the specs of the gun http world guns ru rifle rfl e htm i know its the earlier long version as its over foot long it wouldn't be a reproduction of a steyr m it would be a real one there are lots of those rifles on the market right now and most all of them have seen very little use ammo is available and most gun stores will have it or can get it while you wait for the ammo to get to you have a gunsmith check the headspace and do a good safety check on the action for you be aware that you will need the clips that hold the cartridges for this model or it will not work also it is a straight pull bolt not a lift and pull bolt make sure the bolt is 'all the way' seated when you load the first cartridge in it and clean it well before you shoot it especially the bolt recesses where the bolt lugs cam out by the way use a shoulder pad these steel butt plate rifle's kick like a mule Krag-J__rgensen M16 (rifle) Internal ballistics Rifle Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Mauser Shotgun Machine gun AK-47 Firearm Handloading Heckler & Koch G3 7.62 __ 51 mm NATO Repeating rifle Sniper rifle Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Ammunition Springfield 1903 rifle AK-74 Steyr Mannlicher M1901 Lee-Enfield Firearm action Revolver M82 (rifle) M60 machine gun Carbine FN FAL GLOCK Kammerlader Carcano MG42 Mossberg 500 Air gun M4 Carbine Sniper Assault rifle Bullet Wildcat cartridge Steyr AUG .22 Long Rifle M1 Garand M2 machine gun Jarmann M1884 SA80 M1 Carbine M249 Personal weapon Paintball marker Heckler & Koch USP Crossbow Winchester Model 70 Suppressor Heckler & Koch G36 Beretta 92F/FS Heckler & Koch MP5 Terminal ballistics GunZ The Duel Gatling gun Mini-14 .357 SIG 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Sturmgewehr 44 Karabiner 98k Paintball .30-06 Springfield M1911 Day of Defeat Field Artillery in the American Civil War Punisher Krag-Petersson Advanced Combat Rifle Shotgun shell Flintlock Trap shooting Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Resident Evil 4 Gun safety SOCOM II: U.S. Navy SEALs Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Saiga-12 M40 (rifle) Equine conformation Federal assault weapons ban 10 mm Auto Unreal 9 mm Luger Unreal Tournament 2004 Gun barrel
