how to removed a small screw with a damaged screw head hi i'm trying to remove a really small philips head screw the screw's about mm across and the thread seems to have been blunted a fair amount and because it's so small i'm unable to get a chisel in there any clue's thanks sorry i forgot to add the screw is attached to a cell phone it's sunk about mm into the phone housing so i can't get underneath it and i'm weary of drilling into it incase i damage the phone i tried having a go at the hammer method menioned but the screw is too small thanks for the help you can purchase extracting bits that go in to a drill they have tips that go into the stripped head of a screw and will grip enough to take them out they look like the ends of drill bits you do not have to drill a hole in the middle of the head for these to work they are a little spendy for the one time use however they are invaluable when you have that stripped screw head i have only used my set a couple of times but when i used them i thanked god that i had them if the screw is not recessed it should still work even though they are small Window Mattress De Lorean DMC-12 Vinyl roof Drill bit Diving suit Glass Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Gramophone record Plastic Solar cell Straw-bale construction Spark plug Strap-on dildo Screw Electrical wiring Epoxy Xanadu House Autonomous building Skateboarding trick Siding Construction Log cabin IPod Lighting Apollo Command/Service Module Linux Molding (decorative) Geodesic dome Rugby union positions Printed circuit board Solar panel Windows 2000 Windows Server 2003 Casting STS-114 Corrosion Tent Insulation Microsoft Basement Roof Ford Thunderbird Dog agility Dodge Neon Car body style Radio masts and towers Porsche 911 Apple Macintosh Toyota Camry Light-frame construction London Underground Mercury Cougar Skin Chevrolet Caprice Seismic retrofit Elevator Window blind Eraser Space Shuttle external tank Oscilloscope Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina McMansion Hubble Space Telescope Timber framing Ford Cortina Passive solar USB flash drive Far side (Moon) Circuit design Transformer Plane (tool) Arcade cabinet Knife Plasma display UK Singles Chart Rail terminology Passenger car Unusual types of gramophone record Vacuum tube Station wagon Port Authority Trans-Hudson Gas metal arc welding West Side Highway Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence) Glossary of firefighting equipment Tibia Poker jargon Woodworking Mac OS X Coaxial cable Wood carving Billboard (advertising) Lincoln Continental Mark III Stairway RISC Apollo spacecraft Humerus
