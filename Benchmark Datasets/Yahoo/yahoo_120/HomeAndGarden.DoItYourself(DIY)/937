how can i make a really old city basement safe to live in my friend just moved into a new place and i promised i'd help him out he plans on living in the basement but right now it's pretty bad news down there and i'm having trouble finding info on the internets about how to make the area safe and usable for music stuff and couchsleeping the house is old old and in dc and features an enormous hole in the wall that opens into the crawlspace and weird dusty air that you can taste after awhile it doesn't need to be super nice or anything close to finished but what are some good precautions against mold and other toxins and what are important things to be on the lookout for thanks much first invest in a dehumidifier these things are awesome they're easy to move around and you won't believe how much water it gets outta the air this will help the weird taste in the air if it's not that humid you might just want to get an air purifier also get some febreeze or odorcide and use it religiously if you can buy some kilz at your home improvement or hardware store and paint the walls with it most kilz is white but this will make the room look bigger along with the air purifier dehumidifier this will help resist mold and mildew be sure and clean everything really well and patch any holes that are in the walls by using wood putty depending on how big the hole is beyond this you can go to your hardware store and ask them they should have plenty of ideas and you could tell them more details of your situation in person than you can't tell us on here good luck p s don't pay attention to kristin d you've got better luck in tornadoes p p s you'll also want to spray for bugs and allow it to air out good afterwards so the stuff won't get in your lungs too much Glossary of climbing terms Drill bit Bulldozer Seismic retrofit Table saw Rigging Lawn mower Welding Sin City Screw Poker jargon Knife Skateboard Campfire Glossary of wildland fire terms Woodworking Naval mine Upholstery Garbage truck Anchor Waste management Naruto jutsu Combine (Half-Life 2) Climbing equipment Elevator Bong Robot Master Rail tracks Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Violin Equine conformation Professional wrestling match types Rail terminology Parachute Pittsburgh Steelers Laws of cricket Volleyball Chainsaw Wood Paintball Hemp Glossary of nautical terms Boat building Suspension bridge Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Lathe Diving Nuclear power Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Plane (tool) USS West Virginia (BB-48) Surveillance IPod Cincinnati Bengals 1957 World Series Plastic Lightning Plough Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Dustbin Professional wrestling holds Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Comanche RuneScape quests Tire Electrical wiring Shaggy dog story M60 machine gun Sub-Zero Pebble bed reactor USS Vestal (AR-4) Gas metal arc welding Arc welding Ammunition Pottery Landfill Skateboarding trick Softball 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Aerial (dance move) Professional wrestling throws Swimming pool Tank Air-raid shelter Portsmouth Block Mills Battle of the Bulge The Legend of Zelda series enemies Windows XP Clothing
