integrated fridge freezer ok i've searched the net and found nothing so i need an expert to tell me what to do here i've just fitted an entire kitchen and feel like a complete fool that something which seems so trivial is stopping me completing it but we've bought an integrated fridge and freezer which has the little screw points on the front door which look like they are supposed to act as spacers i've also got doors the right size to fit so how do i fix the door to the fridge there has to be a better way than just glueing it hi you should have with the appliance a set of plastic probably fittings one part fits to the appliance door and the other to the unit door this allows the appliance door to open at the same time as you open the unit door this way you dont have to open two doors to access the fridge obviously you don't want to fit this assembly to the freezer section if the appliance is combined fridge freezer otherwise everytime you open the fridge then the freezer door opens also if it is a separate fridge and freezer then the process is the same for both the part that fits to the appliance door is static fixed and it slots into andslides along the part fitted to the unit door it is imporatnt to ensure that appliances are properly positioned in relation to the doors and units otherwise the appliance door can sometimes fail to seal properly i hope this is clear Refrigerator Screw BS 1363 Glossary of firefighting equipment Hash table Bong Spontaneous human combustion Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Floppy disk Freezer Sento CPU design Dental brace Poker jargon Drill bit Violin National Electrical Code (US) RISC Thermostat Manifold Domain Name System Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Carburetor Appliance Fuse (electrical) The Brady Bunch Vehicular cycling Sears Holdings Corporation Species Upholstery Genericized trademark Electrical wiring (UK) Tire John Bull (locomotive) Domestic water system Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Seismic retrofit Washing machine Dentures Ground and neutral Station wagon Elevator Construction Natural Selection (computer game) De Lorean DMC-12 Stage lighting Integrated circuit Black Mesa Research Facility Artificial neural network Common electrical adaptors in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom Redundant array of independent disks Cross-country skiing Badminton Lock picking Burglar alarm Basement Screwdriver Weight training Window Combine (Half-Life 2) Glossary of climbing terms Boat building RuneScape quests Betting (poker) M60 machine gun Unicode Protoss Strap-on dildo Internal ballistics Atari 8-bit family Patent Field-programmable gate array Product Lifecycle Management Bike lane debate Radio controlled airplane Bristol Grammar School Java programming language Plastic Dairy School bus Virtual memory Circuit design View camera Freezing The Star Wars Holiday Special Carnivorous plant Visual Basic TARDIS The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Food processor Sailing Fuzzy logic Wrench Burglary Enterprise application integration Organic food Clinker (boat building)
