how do you kill spiders that seem to be living in one particular room of a house i used the bug spray thing where you spray the room close the door and leave for about hours but now its been weeks and there back anyone i kill them everytime i see them but there inside my computer on my bed on the ceiling on the walls its really frusterating your best bet is to spray insecticide around the exits of your home all window and outer doors as soon as it wears off insects will find their way back so it must be reapplied periodically to keep them away spider traps can be placed by the baseboards in the vicinity of doors that open to the outside to catch the ones that make it inside if the task of exterminating is too much think about the fact that you are never more than ft away from a spider anyway so just relax Typeface PostScript Apple typography Portable Document Format Unicode Dot matrix printer Notepad TrueType Windows 3.x TeX HTML element Screenplay Mimeograph machine Adobe Type Manager EIA-708 OpenType Killian documents Ligature (typography) Cascading Style Sheets Typewriter Atari 8-bit family Ebook Text editor Arabic alphabet Punch card ASCII art Printer Control Language Floppy disk OpenOffice.org Windows XP Quotation mark METAFONT Display PostScript Adobe Systems 2D computer graphics Topology Kerning Paper size Greek alphabet Adobe Illustrator Hangul Graphical Environment Manager Web design OS/2 TRS-80 Punctuation Verdana Printed circuit board System 7 (Macintosh) Speech balloon Pixel Roman numerals Control character Common Unix Printing System LaserWriter Free software Unicode fonts Serif Screen-printing P__li Emphasis (typography) Text figures Markup language QuickDraw GX Susan Kare Compact disc Dash Raster graphics The National ALGOL 68 Windows Vista Adrian Frutiger StarOffice AmigaOS Word processor Keyboard layout Heraldry John Day (printer) Laser engraving Character (computing) Mac OS X Braille Logo File Allocation Table Planet Bravo (software) Han unification Euro Digital photography Windows 2000 Glagolitic alphabet Stellar evolution Minesweeper (computer game) System/36 OpenDocument Newline Slashed zero Library (computer science) WYSIWYG Tab
