how can i make a deadbolt mechanism that locks the front door from outside via a key fob remote hello i'm interested in either making or buying a device i can add to the inside of my front door which allows me to deadbolt it when i leave the automated deadbolt mechanism would be activated by a remote control and ideally be dual powered battery adapter plugged into the wall i'm looking for a solution that does as little damage to the door as possible and allows me to keep the existing lock deadbolt basically a remote control deadbolt that can only be unlocked from inside or with the remote thank you david m negative the risk is still the same as when you leave your house and lock the regular door your deadbolt remains unlocked if no one inside is there to lock it this is actually extra security even if someone scanned it they'd still be only to unlock the deadbolt not the regular lock so its still a net loss for said bad guy this is also the case w garage door openers but i don't see insurance companies having anti garage door penalties or saying the house is somehow more vulnerable schlage and kwikset both make residential duty remote deadbolts they are not very expensive and will use the same holes as your existing deadbolt no doubt home depot and lowes sell then or you can order one from a locksmith if you go with a locksmith he should be able to key it alike with your knobset if you like i don't recommend any electronic lock without a key over ride sooner or later a battery will be jarred loose or the remote will get wet or some other unforseeable pitfall will cause a lockout you don't want to rely exclusivly on a cheap remote i've seen too many car alarms that couldn't be disarmed on a rainy day Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Spark plug Fuse (electrical) Electrical wiring Volt Residual-current device National Electrical Code (US) Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis High-voltage hazards Three-phase electric power Leasehold estate Plasma (physics) X10 (industry standard) Toyota Prius Universal Serial Bus Electricity CompactFlash Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Battery (electricity) Vacuum cleaner Spark gap Distribution board Kitchen Laptop Extension Cord Cruising (maritime) Lighting Nintendo GameCube Electricity meter Battery electric vehicle Alcohol fuel Hybrid vehicle Ground and neutral Mains electricity Electrical engineering Electrical wiring (UK) Circuit breaker Renewable energy Waste (law) Membrane potential Ampere Monopoly (game) Computer bus Circuit design Transformer Glossary of firefighting equipment Thermal power station NEC Corporation Ceramics Fan (implement) Bass guitar Solar power Microcontroller Diesel engine Jack plug Voltage drop Tire Operational amplifier Piezoelectricity Lineman (occupation) Oscilloscope Vacuum tube Resistor Power supply Electricity Supply Board Leasing Power cable Electricity distribution Electrical generator Electricity generation Fossil fuel power plant Strap-on dildo Carburetor Locomotive Carbon nanotube Spacecraft propulsion Incandescent light bulb Digital circuit Eviction Microwave oven Electric potential Japanese toilet Adapter Jon Secada Enigma machine DVD Printed circuit board Copyleft Power line communication Plastic Electrician Electricity pylon Internal combustion engine Breathing gas Electrical resistance Carbon dioxide Energy development Water Casting
