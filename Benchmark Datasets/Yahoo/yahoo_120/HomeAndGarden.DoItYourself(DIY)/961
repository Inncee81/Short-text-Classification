adhesive screw head remover hi i'm trying to remove a small mm diameter philips head screw from a cell phone i'm trying to re house i remember hearing a few years ago about a material that acts like a glue between a screw driver and a screw something along the lines of putting a bit of this adhesive stuff on the head of the screw putting the screw driver in this stuff and an amount of time later the screw driver is stuck to the screw head and you're able to unscrew the screw easily enough anyone know if this stuff is real or if so what's it called or would any metal to metal super glue do the same job thanks for the help don't use gorilla glue as it sort of expands as it dries and will glue your screwdriver to the phone as well just try the super glue Lumber Plane (tool) Drill bit Betting (poker) Screw Woodworking Poker jargon Logging Saw Rigging Portsmouth Block Mills Sawmill Violin Skateboard Montana Dimension George W.
