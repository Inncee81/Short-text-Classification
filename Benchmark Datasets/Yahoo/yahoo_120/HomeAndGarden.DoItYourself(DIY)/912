how do i paint an outdated ordinary wooden dining room set without sanding it i want a new look without the hours of sanding note the table top is very shiny like it has extra coating of a pretective something on it as some other people have said you pretty much have to do a little sanding so the paint will be able to stick you don't have to remove all of the existing finish just roughen the surface i would use or grit sandpaper go over the surface just enough so that it doesn't have any shine left it won't take very long don't worry next and very importantly apply primer the primer is designed to stick like crazy and will enable the paint to stick to the furniture without it the paint will peel right off in no time kilz is the brand that's common around here but any latex based primer from a hardware store should do it's available in cans or spray on next paint i'd recomment a good quality semi gloss medium shine latex paint for durability also use a quality brush to avoid ending up with bristle marks that will detract from your finished project oil based would be even more durable than latex but it's much nastier and harder to work with so i'd avoid it Domestic water system Plumbing fixture Bong Sewage treatment Basement Hydrochloric acid Thermal power station Irrigation Diving suit Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bathroom Plastic Sewer Flush toilet Drainage Lighting Autonomous building Carburetor Motor oil Spark plug Carbon dioxide Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Casting Naval mine Seismic retrofit Siphon Haloalkane Japanese toilet Air conditioning Polyvinyl chloride Toilet humour Solar power Dairy Diving regulator Welding Lake Internal ballistics Glossary of firefighting equipment Brewery Automobile emissions control BS 1363 Fire fighting Water supply Sento Bullet E85 Roof Central heating Sulfuric acid Fossil fuel power plant Toilet Kitchen Disaster Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Coffee Aluminium Renewable energy Electrical wiring River Boy's surface Neutrino Coppersmith Hydrogen sulfide Cannabis cultivation Bathing Dam Severe weather terminology (United States) Desert Water Poker jargon Screw Climate of the United Kingdom Toilet paper Thermostat Hyperthermia Wire Heat Two-stroke cycle Iowa class battleship Tofu Land mine Tap (valve) Soldering Swimming Copper extraction Catalytic converter Incineration Effects of global warming Urinal Top-bar hive Passive solar Incandescent light bulb Geodesic dome Energy development M16 (rifle) Trapped in the Closet Deforestation Furnace
