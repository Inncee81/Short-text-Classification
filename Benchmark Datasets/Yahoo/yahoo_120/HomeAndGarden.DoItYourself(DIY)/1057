how can i fasten a strip of wood to a cement floor the wood pieces are a half inch thick i ve already tried inch screws but they kept breaking i need to put the wood down to hold together two adjacent pieces of wood oops i meant its for two adjoining pieces of linoleum not two pieces of wood buy some tapcon screws you drill a pilot hole in through the wood and into the concrete and then you screw the tapcons right into the hole the tapcons thread themselves right into the concrete take two nails and find a masonry drill bit that is just slightly under the width of the nails jammed side by side drill a hole through the wood and mark the floor then using a masonry bit drill a hole in the concrete just a deeper than the length of the nail minus the thickness of your wood now place wood on floor and line up the holes in the wood with the holes in the concrete drop one nail in the hole then place the second nail next to the first one and push it in as far as you can with your hand then pick up your hammer and drive it in the hole Personal digital assistant Palm OS Ballpoint pen Ocean's Twelve Tungsten Handheld Best Buy Symbian OS Pencil Laptop Handwriting recognition Drawing Pen Smartphone Columbine High School massacre Ebook Windows Mobile Fountain pen Palm Pilot Knife Textile manufacturing Boy Scouts of America CPU cache IPAQ 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Magic (illusion) Philmont Scout Ranch Poker jargon Houseplant Microsoft Office Cruising (maritime) IPod Palm, Inc.
