how do you whitewash a hardwood floor i am a year experienced painter we have whitewashed pickled many cabinets ash panelling and floors actually instead of buying prepackaged pickling you can make your own simply take a latex paint of the color you want mix it with water walla you have it apply areas the whole length or width of the floor depending on which way the flooring runs you can apply with a paint roller then let set for about minutes then take clean rags wipe over the surface with the grain remove as much as you want some prfer to leave a white film all over the entire surface and some like it wiped down to where it is just in the grain let dry over night apply one coat of polyurethane let dry sand it with grit sand paper just buff lightly to remove the raised grain vacuum then apply another coat of polyurethane etc you can do this also with oil based paint but the drying time odor and clean up is terrible alot here get confused when some people say whitewash for in the old days we mixed lime and water together to whitewash or paint exterior beams wood etc now days the term whitewash relates to staining wood etc or also calleed pickling you can also delute your paint of choice if you want it deeper colored practice on some scrap wood of the same flooring you are usuing here is a link also http alsnetbiz com homeimprovement pickling html Tobacco Bong Cigarette Smoking pipe Hookah Tobacco smoking Nicotine Cocaine Camel (cigarette) Hard disk Tobacco advertising Cannabis (drug) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Air pollution Kryptonite Hand grenade Bob and George Poison Textile manufacturing Nicotine gum Cigar Snus Smoking ban Cigarette Smoking Man M16 (rifle) Kitchen Lighter Movie projector Late Night with Conan O'Brien Ultraviolet Floppy disk Places in the Wheel of Time series Carburetor Professional wrestling throws Screw Syphon Filter Kretek Asbestos Dairy Drill bit Smoke detector Perl Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga characters Firefighter Imperial Tobacco Computer virus Brewery Pneumonia Chewing gum Condom Glossary of nautical terms Messerschmitt Bf 109 Asthma Stage lighting Jet engine Health issues and the effects of cannabis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Magic (illusion) Polarization Sin City Hashish Causality Tobacco industry Hardware random number generator Cyanide Mattress Glossary of firefighting equipment Compact disc Traffic light Professional wrestling holds Drug test Marlboro (cigarette) Arguments for and against drug prohibition Radiation hardening Items in the Metroid series Nuclear fallout Door Dioxin Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Unix Gas mask Surveillance Mojave people Digital photography Sento Vacuum cleaner Spliff Illegal drug trade Textile manufacturing terminology Modem Courtyard Marine aquarium Motor oil Hamster Laramie Cigarettes StarCraft: Uprising Pinball
