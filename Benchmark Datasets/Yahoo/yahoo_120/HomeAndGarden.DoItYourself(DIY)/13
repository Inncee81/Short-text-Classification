another laminant question i need to know how prepared does my tabletop need to be prior to re laminating it with the pre glued heat activated new laminant this table is probably pre and appears to have had the orig laminant applied with hide glue i have removed this original laminant but there is still a bit of the laminant backing firmly attached and i have made several minor gouges in the table surface when removing the orig laminant i plan to use wood filler on the deeper gouges and to lightly sand with a hand sander or perhaps by hand the surface of the table prior to re laminating now my question is this just how smooth ie perfect does this table top need to be keeping in mind that the laminant i will be using will most probably not have a very thick backing i really want to do this right and i'm willing to work on the table top until it is as smooth as the perverbable baby's butt but if i really don't need to expend this energy i'd rather not recommendations please thanks if you sand it too smooth then the glue wont adhere properly hide glue is some nasty stuff heat will soften it but it does cool quickly maybe try using a solvent based thinner like lacquer thinner or acetone the easiest thing to do i think is to put some gt sand paper on a sander either a jitter bug or an orbital grind it off with the digs and divots the best thing to use is bondo it drys hard and stays hard using putty wont work cause it cracks and its brittle when you apply the new laminate make sure your iron is hot and press firmly and use a laminate roller to get it smooth you can purchase at home depot happy laminating Woodworking Drill bit Glass Casting Brazing Pottery Upholstery Welding Printed circuit board Table tennis Plastic Seismic retrofit Leather Radio controlled airplane Equine conformation Table saw Knife Mattress Volleyball Paint Explosive material Hamster Cast iron Soldering Sand casting Manifold Japanese tea ceremony Parquetry Horseshoe Printmaking Stucco Boat building Adhesive Drawing Hand grenade Friction Guqin Nacre Piano Opportunity rover Combine (Half-Life 2) Tofu Sphenoid bone Repouss__ and chasing Strap-on dildo Coffee Cello Iron Textile manufacturing Sandpaper Cross-country skiing Tire Carnivorous plant Transformer Brewery Fire fighting Manicure Gas metal arc welding Campfire Screw Internal ballistics Enceladus (moon) Dairy Ramen Impact crater Laser engraving Aerial (dance move) Powder metallurgy Aluminium Spark plug Skin Chisel Disc brake Metallurgy Poker jargon Frontal bone Solar cell Tank Steel Spider The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Water M16 (rifle) Lacquer Electrophysiology Guitar Mouse (computing)
