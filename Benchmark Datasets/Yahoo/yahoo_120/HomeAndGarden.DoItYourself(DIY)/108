how to drain a flooding lawn i in dfw tx we get a lot of rain so much that the ground cannot soak up water for days so we a small lake in our back yard i need a good drainage system i had this problem at a previous residence and believe it or not the city came out and fixed it even though it was on private property so give them a call first and see what they can and will do the street department in this area handles things like that but not sure who in your are would i had to pay for the pipe but they covered the cost of labor and the equipment to do it and would have provided any additional dirt that may have been needed which we didn't need it ended up costing about to have a drain put in and then a pipe running from the drain to the city sewer system about feet far cheaper than hiring a private contractor who had quoted around and too cheap for me to even consider doing it myself if your home is relatively new construction the call your builder or the developer for the neighborhood if it is a problem with how they graded the lot then they are responsible for fixing it if you have a neighbor who has recently changed the grade of their lot then they may be causing part of it part of my problem came about after a neighbor put in a pool they had the low spot well they built up the yard in order for the rainwater not to run off into their pool and that then made my yard the low spot in the neighborhood Kitchen Tessellation Tile King Khalid International Airport The Brady Bunch Pittsburgh Steelers Queensbridge Acquire Ra (board game) Wallpaper group Basement Husky Stadium Home improvement Mosaic Hogwarts Floor Directory McMansion Dundas Square Union Station (Los Angeles) St Albans Cathedral The Shining (film) Mahjong tiles Carcassonne (board game) Islamic architecture Vacuum cleaner The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Arlington House Architecture of the California missions Zoo Keeper Waffle House Masonry University of Connecticut Upholstery New York Giants Bathroom Knife Sydney Opera House Jan Smuts Columbine High School massacre Seismic retrofit Combine (Half-Life 2) Professional wrestling attacks Nacre Warhammer 40,000 Drill bit Beavis and Butt-head Drywall Professional wrestling holds Mahjong Autonomous robot Fredensborg Palace Peterhouse, Cambridge Sento University of Oregon Train station Death Valley National Park Pai Gow Reservoir Dogs Christiansborg Palace Scissors Professional wrestling aerial techniques Sengkang Jackass: The Movie STS-114 Blood Simple PowerVR Sears Holdings Corporation Holly Lodge Estate Eddie Guerrero San Francisco 49ers Granite Drainage Clown Luck Quake III Arena Bonnie Tyler Wilton House Toilet paper Chatsworth House Casting Toilet humour National Statuary Hall Board game Ramen Little Britain Buckingham Palace Fire extinguisher 2005 Belgian Grand Prix Initial D Chesterfield, Missouri Supply-side economics The Home Depot Alhambra (board game) Great Depression Mission San Juan Capistrano Fancy Crane Animal Crossing Avenue Q 2000 Australian Grand Prix
