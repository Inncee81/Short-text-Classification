what is the difference between mortar and grout good question i had to pull some books off my shelf because this one peaked my curiosity there is a fair amount of ambiguity with these terms and i ve heard them used interchangeably all of the above responses seem right but from an engineering perspective i pulled this information from one of my books mortar is used for the following functions bonding masonry units together serving as a seating material for the units leveling and seating the units and providing aesthetic quality of the structure grout is used to fill the cores or voids in hollow masonry units for the purpose of bonding the masonry units bonding the reinforcing steel to the masonry increasing the bearing area increasing the fire resistance and improving the overturning resistance by increasing the weight using these definitions grout uses fine gravel in addition to the sand both mixes use the other ingredients seem similar with minor portioning differences Portland cement Mortar (masonry) Concrete Stucco Pavement (material) Cement Calcium Aggregate (composite) Pozzolana Sand Concrete mixer Building material Gravel Fly ash Ceramics Caliche Natural building Asphalt concrete Plaster Viscosity Desert Rammed earth Shotcrete Hydraulic conductivity Lincoln Highway Roman road Architecture of the California missions Pozzolanic ash Cliffe-at-Hoo Incineration Aquifer Casting Sedimentary rock Bonsai Tile Dune Fr__d__ric Chopin Volcanic ash Erosion Graveler Silicon Reinforced concrete Trinidad and Tobago Alkane Sediment Iligan City Dorset Sandstone London Clay Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area Opportunity rover Silicon dioxide Steel Clastic Arch bridge Geography of Lithuania Tuff Paul Muldoon Bar (landform) Misi__n San Miguel Arc__ngel de la Frontera Gold mining Japanese garden Dam Placer mining Armor-piercing shot and shell Sand Martin Sandbag Pachypodium habitats Cemex Wellingborough Glacier Pottery Open-pit mining Geology of Hertfordshire Petroleum Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Fire extinguisher Ferrofluid Atlantic Ocean Geology of the Alps Quartzite Flea Greywacke Maya civilization River delta Geography of the United Kingdom Plutonium Geology of the British Isles Pisco Paint Geodesic dome Motor oil Sulfur Athabasca Oil Sands Carburetor A151 road Titanium Till Carbon dioxide
