is this a cool design idea for a baby girl's room i didn't know what category to put this in well i had tripets two boys and one girl three weeks ago and right now they are all in one room in a few weeks we're going to move our girl tallon into her own room and let the boy's merrick and chandler share i thought it would be really cool to do a really girly theme so my mom made a purple comforter i can't remember what it's called i'm a little brain dead thing for her crib and we have pink sheets but i wanted to paint the walls light pink with clouds and little jets going in between clocks real clocks with the times the actual times from some of the major fashion capitols of the world with the city's name by them and for pictures i have some swatches and patterns and other sewing things framed the boy's room is panted like under water themed the walls are blue and then there's sand colored with seaweed and shells and things at the bottom and there's fish the ceiling has like the bottom of a boat and then more blue with lighter blue to make it look like the sun is shining on it and some of the fish and things come off the wall they are velcrow ed on so a fashion design themed room and an under water room yay or neigh their rooms are connected by a door so we can leave it open and they can still hear each other and whatever in tallon's room we are going to put a full length mirror on the door to camoflage no clue how to spell that it and in the boy's room we just painted it blue and it blends in pretty well cool what's wrong with her putting this question in the diy category she is decorating it herself so it would fit into either category just fine to haillynn congrats i think your fashion themed room sounds adorable a little baby fashion diva your boys' room sounds adorable as well good luck Thermal power station Two-stroke cycle Explosive material Fire fighting Jet engine Knife Glass Pottery Solar power Spark plug Solar cell Electrical wiring Seismic retrofit Insulation Drill bit Kitchen Loudspeaker Basement Ice core Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Sewage treatment Great Pyramid of Giza Violin William Murdoch Carburetor Carbon dioxide Semiconductor Siphon HyperText Transfer Protocol Vacuum Wood carving Anchor Ceramics Transformer Textile manufacturing CPU design Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Glossary of firefighting equipment Heat Upholstery Hydrogen economy Spark gap Tobacco Paint Asbestos Gas turbine Brewery Condom Haloalkane Handloading Screw Fuel cell Christmas tree Straw-bale construction Volleyball Wankel engine High-voltage hazards Tire Stairway Polystyrene Autonomous building Titanium Welding Floppy disk Technology The Ark in Space Tesla coil Cannabis (drug) Audiophile Ocean thermal energy conversion Cyclotron Steam engine Radiation hardening Expansion chamber Stirling engine Vacuum tube Dam Masonry Canoe Circuit breaker Pile Reading spark plugs for racing Hamster Equine conformation Saw II Stone Age Bookbinding Ion implantation Dairy Printed circuit board Electrophysiology Epoxy Helium Supply-side economics Fort Ashby, West Virginia Fire Fuel injection Cadillac Eldorado
