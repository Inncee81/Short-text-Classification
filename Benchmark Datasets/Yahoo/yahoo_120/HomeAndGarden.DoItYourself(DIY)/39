does anybody know how to use timber sleepers for decking g'day i am planning on using timber sleepers to create a walkway around my pool however i am not to sure how to go about it ie how to prepare the surface to lay the timber and the best type of oil to use to prevent the wood from rotting thanks the hardest thing about laying down sleeper is to create a level finished surface it requires a solid and level surface this is done by excavating down to the clay using a tamper to compress the clay and a layer of loose gravel raked and levelled place down some landscape cloth to prevent grass and weeds from growing up through you walkway and lay down the sleepers it might be a good idea to drill holes through the timbers and drive spikes or rebar through the holes into the ground to limit movement then work down the walkway and level the timbers on both sides using shims its a detailed process which will be significantly easier with a laser level or transit but an ordinary straight edge and level will work a little pl on the shims should suffice as a way of securing the shims to the timbers the final stage is the cutting and placement of the decking material for all exterior wood projects pressure treated lumber is the best choice however any wood which comes in contact with the earth needs to be pressure treated most pressure treated lumber has a life span of years when exposed to the weather non treated lumber has a life expectancy of about half as long you can extend the life of your walkway by using a thick tar like sealant on the bottom and sides of the timbers but it makes for a messy job Seismic retrofit Drill bit Wood Deck (ship) Rail tracks Anchor Glacier Lumber Upholstery Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Professional wrestling holds Masonry Knife Poker jargon Sewage treatment Equine conformation Coal Volleyball Suspension bridge Construction Timber framing San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Solar cell Ice core Naval mine Deforestation Tire Screw Welding Diamond Waste management Opportunity rover Plane (tool) Escalator Logging Ship Campfire Desert Dam Diving suit Erosion Hemp Glass Woodworking Drawing A151 road Geology of the British Isles Babbitt metal Brewery Carbon dioxide Textile manufacturing Geodesic dome Flood geology Rail terminology Spark plug Straw-bale construction Dairy Lock picking Geothermal areas of Yellowstone Dundas Square Radio controlled airplane Swiss plateau Petroleum Drainage Saw Pavement (material) Psoriasis Reinforced concrete Rigging Powder metallurgy Sutherland Shire Billiards Stonehenge Nuclear weapon design Floppy disk Lawn mower Professional wrestling throws Vacuum Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey Tooth Pok__mon Abilities Cricket Microphone Land mine Wood fuel Table tennis Clinker (boat building) Black hole Mars Exploration Rover Laserdisc Geology of the Alps
