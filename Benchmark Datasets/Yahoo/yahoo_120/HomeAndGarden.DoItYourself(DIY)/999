how long do you have to wait to 'seal' a block paved drive and how long does it take to dry how much is the sealant to buy and if you know of any good makes to buy would also be of help also any advice on how this should be done thanks sealants should not be applied to any pavement that is less than months old and not before all traces of effloresence have disappeared there's no point paying good money to seal in the effloresence recent research suggests that sealing could take place as soon as weeks after laying if the paving is treated to remove all calcium carbonate from the surface is allowed to thoroughly dry and then sealed with a low viscosity moisture cured cross linking pre polymer a polyurethane sealant to me and thee power washing is recommended before applying the sealant although this should be done at least days before sealing to enable the bedding layer and sub base to dry and allow for any reactive effloresence to appear and the lance must be kept at a shallow angle to minimise loss of jointing sand prior to any sealing the pavement should be thoroughly inspected for minor faults and to ensure the jointing is complete ie there is no jointing sand missing from the joints make sure there is no chance of rain over the next hours and that the pavement is completely dry by raking out a couple of joints and checking the jointing sand mm or mm deep if that's dry the whole pavement can be considered dry Knife Saw Equine conformation Canoe Fencing Floppy disk Sport rowing Butterfly stroke Backstroke Batting (cricket) Wind turbine Table tennis Katana Blade Front crawl Professional wrestling throws Table saw Horizontal bar Golf Woodworking Aerial (dance move) Violin Shaper Global Gillette Professional wrestling holds Figure skating Breaststroke Drill bit Kris Textile manufacturing Helicopter PlayStation 3 The Strokes Snooker Welding Razor Diving Backsaw Internal ballistics Naval mine Golf club (equipment) Lightsaber Staple (fastener) Lawn mower Fabrication (metal) Ninja Supply and demand Dog training Perl Universal Century Technology Punt (boat) Shaving Twisted Sister Sword Pottery Lathe Boat building Yari Microeconomics Casting Frogman Bong Strap-on dildo Time Out of Mind Leaf Radio controlled airplane Sword making Swingout Mouse (computing) Bowie knife Windsurfing Professional wrestling slang Heat Railroad switch Glossary of ballet terms Fecal incontinence Simplified Chinese character Gramophone record Laser engraving Trigun B-47 Stratojet Robot Master DDT (professional wrestling) Kayak Harmonica Seppuku United States dollar Scissors Spark plug Floyd Rose Esperanto as an international language VHF omnidirectional range Trapping Fictitious force Jian Resident Evil (video game) Blacksmith Hydraulic machinery Chisel Heraldry
