before starting to pave what steps should be undertakento ensure the area is paved is completed correctly for example the paving area is all level enough oavers are ordered to allow for any breaking etc what to do if some concrete mix is left any other concerns with all due respect you have loose pavers that you want to set in concrete why not just pour concrete you've already stated the most obvious important step assuming that the area is near level to begin with leveling hardly applies to terraced paving unless at each individual point or on graded property it might be ludicrous to attempt leveling i'm not at all ignorant but certainly confused about loose pavers combined with concrete unless your suggestion relates to the area ending up more as if it was tiled certainly any loose pavers i've ever installed have often been on an area that's been graded or leveled has weed barrier laid often crushed limerock not sand and then set the pavers taking measurements would aid in solving issues with the last on your list determine the area size in question versus the size of the pavers and do the math ie in an area ft wide one should assume that three inch pavers would span the width i never allow less than waste for any job with regard to the concrete the math would determine in you knowing any base slab footer depth width length how much concrete to buy then and as with the above suggestion you determine whether or not the pavers will butt each other or be separated by whatever space certainly if you attempt this with bagged product the bag will state the coverage if you order a mix delivered the supplier would need to know the size of the area in question the formulas for coverage are easily available in the www using a general search steven wolf Termite Numbat Termite Terrace Insect Maurice Watkins Echidna Timon and Pumbaa Animation Self-organization Brood (honeybee) Natural gas Banjo-Kazooie Elephant Freddy Fender Aardvark Tex Avery ___Iolani Palace The Buzz on Maggie Cockroach Neoptera Helter Shelter Alfredo Escalera Viva La Bam Emergence Bob Clampett Pangolin Chuck Jones Philadelphi Route Pop punk Saoul Mamby Tiny Toon Adventures Pesticide toxicity to bees Ant Pickfair Anteater Psychic surgery Frank Tashlin Maurice Maeterlinck Hurricane proof building Tuareg Jane Goodall 101 Dalmatians: The Series Diseases of the honeybee Luke Danes Home repair Bugs Bunny Donkey Kong Country (TV series) English plural Islam and anti-Semitism Biologically-inspired computing Triathlon Waste Artificial life Iron Warriors House Mouse Animaniacs 22 Short Films About Springfield Bart chalkboard gags Qiu Chuji Crowded House Kitchen Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Civil engineering Havanese PGA Championship Goanna Don Budge Bodybuilding Pterygota Japanese toilet Emergent democracy Remote procedure call Cellulose Advocacy journalism One Hundred Years of Solitude Merrie Melodies As the World Turns Hotel California Polysaccharide Ruminant Cricket pitch Hazardous waste Geonosis Cretaceous Tom Coburn Donald Bradman Teak Nitrogen fixation Priesthood (Mormonism) Magnetite Alma Cogan Hyena University of San Francisco Radioactive waste Craps Bloody Stupid Johnson Don Muraco Bovid George Bernard Shaw Time Out of Mind
