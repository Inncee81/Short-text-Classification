how do you build a flying fox in your backyard we have a large garden with a treehouse high up and another large tree which has some lower branches roughly metres away how would we build a flying fox between the two trees what would we need to do it where could we get the equipment and how much would it cost depending on how long the equipment is going to be left in place permanent temperary also depending on your budget best first using a nylon sling of sufficient length to fit around the tree where you are fixing the attachment points this is preferable to be flat webbed strapping so as not to cut into the tree and preferable to have manufactured loops at either end the sling is shackled together at the loops with galvanised d shackle of approxiamately mm or greater if the strap is wound around the tree trunk limb once first before the ends are shackled then this will assist in the strap from moving too much on the tree to these shackle points you fit a rope that is to be the main runner of the flying fox preferably made of silver nylon or better check with rope supplier this should be of say mm or better rope rope is measured in cicumference the best way of fitting this rope is to splice both ends in a loop so as to fit into a shackle the rope is then tensioned at the top end with a large turnbuckle galvanised of at least mm note this turnbuckle should be loosened after each day period of use so as not to put undue strain on the trees and or removed in a storm situation as it could help in moving the tree purchase a suitable snap block stainless steel is better this is usually from a ships chandeler etc should be the correct size for the main rope and of capable weight loading for more than kg depending on the sling arrangement for the seat etc it is better to have a loop or ringed pulley than a hooked type this will not allow the drop rope sling to fall of any hook in general only have a slight downward slope gradient on the main rope do not have the snap block pulley within reach of little fingers do have a safety rope or breaking system for the rider so as not to hit the lower of the support trees etc in all construction make sure safety is paramount use helmets and gloves hope this helps later jim Teen Girl Squad Shen Gong Wu The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Jon Secada Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling attacks Bomberman Cincinnati Bengals RuneScape quests Poker jargon Escape from New York Bob and George Shaggy dog story The Time Machine Professional wrestling holds New York Giants Tank GunZ The Duel Treehouse of Horror III Toyota Prius Social rule Eye Final Fantasy magic Autostereogram Volleyball Castle Wars Items in the Metroid series Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara Equine conformation Stereoscopy Midnight Run Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Motorcycle helmet The Inside Whose Line Is It Anyway?
