how to fix miter saw blade guard and is the blade too loose my miter saw was in storage for the last few months and when i took it out to give it a test run i noticed that when you lower the blade the guard does not lift up the guard can be moved with my hand so its not stuck how can i fix this any ideas also the blade itself seems to be a little loose like swaying from side to side but only a very tiny tiny bit it doesn't seem to bother cutting any wood but i was afraid it might loose too much this i can lookup in my manual the blade guard is what i am trouble with the most the guard issue is difficult to address there are several ways that these can be configured without a model or even a manufacturer it is hard to guess there is some kind of linkage between the guard and the pivot point of the saw part of this is loose again hard to know where to tell you to look more specifically the loose blade is a different story a few possibilities there could be the wrong blade there are different sizes and shapes of arbors and holes in the center of the blade putting the wrong blade on the saw will cause a problem i doubt that this is your problem could simply be that the nut that holds the blade on is a bit loose if this is the case it is hazardous to operate the saw you need to check this before you operate the saw again sometimes the bolt or nut holding the blade will become a bit rusted and feel tight before it is so remove it clean if needed and reinstall this should not come loose from storage if it is loose it probably was loose when you put it in storage last possibility is a bearing problem as the bearings in the saw wear they will allow the spindle to wobble a bit if you can wiggle the spindle a bit with no blade on the saw this is your problem it should take a bit of use to wear the bearings but they can go early if you try to cut material that is too heavy for the saw or try to cut too fast cheaper saws will tend to wear faster than a more expensive saw this will cause your cuts to be a bit less accurate but you can use the saw with a bit of wear once it starts to wobble it will get worse quickly so plan to repair or replace soon Drill bit Table saw Knife Floppy disk Gramophone record Internal ballistics Hard disk Wind turbine M16 (rifle) Radio controlled airplane Screw Motorcycle Equine conformation Textile manufacturing Violin M60 machine gun Lawn mower Lathe Glossary of climbing terms Heinkel He 112 Carburetor Woodworking Miter saw Mattress Upholstery Oxy-fuel welding and cutting CPU design Tire Helicopter Rifle Electrophysiology Windows XP Poker jargon Central processing unit Table tennis Bicycle brake systems Strap-on dildo Hash table USB flash drive Drill Rail tracks Virtual memory Computer virus IBM PC Space Shuttle program 2000 Australian Grand Prix Floyd Rose Car handling Computer Katana Axe Bullet Mach kernel E85 DVD Manual transmission Chainsaw Figure skating Fast bowling Mouse (computing) Seismic retrofit Extreme Programming Keynesian economics Laserdisc Loudspeaker B-47 Stratojet Clinker (boat building) Phonograph cylinder Fecal incontinence Plane (tool) Digital photography Operation Market Garden Glossary of partner dance terms Bicycle lighting Circular saw Linked list Anchor Second Battle of the Atlantic Lathe (metal) Wood router Modem Parachute Bicycle frame Welding Space elevator Motor oil Menstrual cup IBM PC compatible Redundant array of independent disks Jet engine Tariff
