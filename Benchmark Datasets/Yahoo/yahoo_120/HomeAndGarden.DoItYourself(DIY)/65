i want to change the tile in my kitchen i live in an apartment so i have the standard white linoluem sp in the kitchen i'm guessing i can't just pull it up so i was wondering if anyone knew of a way i could cover it with something else or the best way to take it up and replace it without geting in trouble from the manager the only real way would be to paint it and you would get in trouble with the management i would just let it go it's not worth the fight ask the apartment if you can paint the walls but forgo the fight to change your tile Leaf Wood Flowering plant Wisteria Knife Maxilla Brewery Molding (decorative) Temporal bone Sailing Glossary of climbing terms Oscilloscope Equine conformation Horseshoe map Plant Pea Palatine bone Textile manufacturing Ethmoid bone Abdomen Seismic retrofit Table saw Hamster Carpet Sugar beet Conifer cones Stage lighting Fixed-wing aircraft Frontal bone Fiberglass Root Stairway Apple Lemmings 2: The Tribes View camera Geodesy Bicycle frame Mattress Antenna (radio) Masonry Sundial GunZ The Duel Bamboo Bladderwort Weight training Solar power Station wagon Floodgate M60 machine gun Sphenoid bone Polyomino Scapula Tobacco Engineering drawing Window Shawn Michaels Retaining wall Backstroke Barbed wire Ubykh language Space elevator R-Type Pachypodium brevicaule Bassoon Perfume Professional wrestling throws Fancy rat Acacia Suspension bridge Lawn mower Date Palm Sweet potato Drill bit Drawing Passive solar Alkane Parts of a sail Stoma Mandible Digital photography Cable-stayed bridge Kudzu 19-inch rack Doom engine Crane (machine) Irrigation Pine Chlorophyta Orchidaceae Yosemite National Park Vegetation Thermal power station Old growth forest Fruit Mario Bicycle brake systems Ladder
