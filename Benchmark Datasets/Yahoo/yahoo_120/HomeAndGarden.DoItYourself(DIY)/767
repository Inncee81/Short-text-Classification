any suggestions on how to fix a gap left between door jambs and wood laminate we installed wood laminate flooring throughout an entire floor of our house it looks great the only thing wrong is that the instructions failed to mention cutting the door jamb and sliding the laminte underneath now that it's done it seems obvious but we now have to deal with gap between every door jamb or entry way which we left for expansion quarter round won't work in these areas and caulk makes the floor look sloppy anybody else ever encounter this problem and find a clean solution thanks with all due respect and after installing thousands of sq ft of various flooring knowledge is often attained after we need it the issue could have been lessened with a few methods a saw specific to molding cuts for flooring setting a piece of flooring and underlayment against any molding for more accurate cuts lined with a pencil and then even using a back saw obviously those two suggestions are too late expansion issues relate to high humidity and or a floor that floods on a regular basis laminate is already designed to give but no manufacturer could stay in business selling a product that swells expands and contract in any percentage as you suggest you have a daunting task no matter certainly if you can you might find the same molding and cut inch pieces to be glued in or do that for the jambs at this point you might not ever be satisfied Mouse (computing) Vacuum cleaner Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Universal Serial Bus Carburetor James Dyson Floppy disk Upholstery Poker jargon Relay USB flash drive Cheating in Counter-Strike Toyota Prius Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Violin Elevator Fan (implement) Harmonica Airsoft Bong BS 1363 TGV Wrench Glossary of climbing terms Professional wrestling throws Die (manufacturing) Guitar Atari 8-bit family Glossary of American football Semiconductor device Sega Dreamcast Plane (tool) Oscilloscope Diode Printed circuit board Strap-on dildo Jack plug Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Aerial (dance move) Diving regulator Rail terminology Cartridge (firearms) Archery Internal ballistics Undergarment Hand grenade Chevrolet Camaro Zippo STS-61 Mattress Vacuum Lawn mower Windows XP Embedded system ZX Spectrum Knife Earring Electric motor Vise (tool) Switch Cathode ray tube Spark gap Disc brake Dyson (appliances) Roomba Screwdriver Light rail Hard disk Advertising Object Desktop Drill Light switch National Football League Lore CPU design Secure Digital card Windows 2000 Spark plug Eggerland series Soldering 2000 Australian Grand Prix De Lorean DMC-12 Cruise control The Tomb of the Cybermen Floyd Rose Tungsten Handheld Computer case Opera (web browser) Thermostat Wire wrap Tooth enamel GLOCK P-n junction Steyr Mannlicher M1901 Worms weapons and tools Woodworking ATX Curling
