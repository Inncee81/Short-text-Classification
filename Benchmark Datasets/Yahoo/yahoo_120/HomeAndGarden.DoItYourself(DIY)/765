damp smell in bathroom a few weeks ago i noticed my toilet cistern had been leaking it soaked into the skirting board and soaked the laminate flooring at the back of the toilet i got it fixed as soon as i discovered the problem but now there is a really overpowering damp smell in the bathroom apart from ripping up the floor which i really dont want to do can you suggest any ways to get rid of the smell i keep the windows and doors open all the time already hi groid lots of other things i'd need to know before i can 'reliably' answer your question but i'll make a few guesses and possibly provide a solution my guess is that the cistern had been leaking for some time and the water has worked through the gaps in the laminate flooring and has soaked the material underneath guess no is that you have chipboard flooring as opposed to traditional floorboards made of solid wood chipboard is often used in modern houses or conversions as it's cheaper chipboard soaks in water like a sponge and takes ages to dry out quite often it needs to be replaced now the gross bit the area at the back of the toilet is usually a bit smelly as over time the area can be splashed with urine from men using the toilet in a standing position hope that's not too graphic this urine can also soak into the material under the laminate the smell is probably the water mixing with the residual urine unfortunately the only way to find out is to lift the laminate floor the chipboard will take months to dry out on it's own honest groid lifting the laminate floor is not as difficult as it seems unless it's been laid under the toilet remove one of the edging strips that runs parallel to the laminate nearest the area it will just be held in with panel pins use a wallpaper scraper to prise it off once you've done that the sheet of laminate underneath should just lift out they literally just click into each other remove or lengths keep them in order so you can put them back the right way you should be able to see very quickly if the area underneath is damp dry chipboard is almost warm to the touch damp chipboard will be cold if the chipboard is as i suspect damp the cheapest thing to do would be to hire a dehumidifier from a tool hire shop should cost around a day remove as much of the laminate as you can and run the dehumidifier for at least days ps don't run it when you have a shower it will have a nervous breakdown dehumidifiers suck a huge amount of moisture out of the area just might do the trick good luck boris Bubble Bobble Spirit level Rainbow Islands Bubble Symphony Soap bubble Siphon Sonoluminescence Mario Bros.
