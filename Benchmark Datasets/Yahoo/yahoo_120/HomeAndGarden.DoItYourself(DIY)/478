how do i remove the ceiling fan i actually want to keep the fan but remove the extension arm and have the fan flush against the ceiling i don't know where to start do i have to shut the power off am i going to electricute myself do the blades have to come off too not all fans can be switched from down rod mount to flush mount look at the top of the fan where the down rod attaches then look at the canopy plate on the ceiling where the rod comes out to go down if there are screw holes in the canopy that will match up with screw holes on the top of the fan then it probably will flush mount if not you can shorten the down rod by replacing buying a shorter rod to take a fan down i always take the blades off if there is no light fixture you might get by with leaving the blades on but if the blades hit on something on the way down the blade bracket is very easily bent they're made of soft metal yes turn the light switch off at the wall go to the ceiling and see how the canopy is attached usually it has screws up close to the ceiling that have to be removed once it is loose it will slide down the drop rod and rest on the top of the fan now you can see how the fan is hung in the bracket attached to the ceiling electrical box you will probably be able to see the wires and wire nuts also making sure the power is off take the wire nuts off and separate the wires the wires from the ceiling should be solid copper and the wires from the fan will be stranded wires put the wire nuts or electrical tape over the bare ends of the black and white ceiling wires and push them back up into the ceiling box that way if anyone comes in and turns on the switch the wires cannot short out your circuit remove the screws holding the fan mounting bracket from the ceiling box the fan will be heavy especially if you didn't take off the blades by the way take off the blades at the motor it's much easier that way use a drill with a phillips bit to remove the blade motor screws once the fan is down then see what you have to do to make the down drop shorter and reverse the process to re install the fan Glossary of partner dance terms Car body style Skateboarding trick Volleyball Exponentiation Geographic coordinate system Shotgun house Potton British national grid reference system Professional wrestling throws Leicester City Centre Vowel Wilton House Contredanse Bringing It All Back Home National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam Abbey Grand Forks, North Dakota New York City Subway nomenclature Window Vehicular cycling Polarization Anatomical terms of location Architecture of Cambodia Assonet, Massachusetts Cardinal directions Central London Coordinates (mathematics) McMansion Professional wrestling holds Manhattan Hogwarts Floor Directory Vector (spatial) North Magnet Heat St. Stephen's Green Butterfly stroke Sento Battle of Berlin Stairway Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey The Jeffersons (South Park) Grace Cossington Smith Essex County, New Jersey Buckingham Palace Equine conformation Microphone 3D projection Theater terms Egyptian language Angkor Wat U.S. Highway 1 Milwaukee, Wisconsin North America Western Front (World War II) Poker jargon Kedleston Hall Xiangqi The Time Machine The House of the Seven Gables Property tax Maxilla Strap-on dildo Operation Market Garden Korean Demilitarized Zone Chess strategy and tactics U.S. twenty-dollar bill Mongoloid Chatsworth House Dai shogi Bristol Grammar School Monticello Blood Simple Lower Manhattan Suburbs of Johannesburg Israeli settlement Rail terminology Piledriver (professional wrestling) Real estate broker North Wessex Downs AONB Kitchen English Country Dance Four wheel drive Anemometer Judkins shogi Battle of Stones River Glossary of ballet terms Cardston-Taber-Warner Glossary of American football Near North Side, Chicago Third World Transportation in Salt Lake City Anglo-Saxons Rwandese Patriotic Front Canadian House of Commons Charleston (dance move) Wayne Corporation
