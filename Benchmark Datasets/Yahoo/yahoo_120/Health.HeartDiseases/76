diagnosed with hocm in new consultant says it's not it is concentric hypertrophy is that better or worse ladywoodboy well neither i'm afraid now you don't say just where the enlargement is let me assume that it's on the left side of the heart ok both tend to have some obstruction to them the hocm generally has the wall of the septum between the ventricles doing the obstruction and the concentric has a downstream obstruction of the outflow from the ventricle doing the obstructing often in concentric hypertrophy the aortic valve has narrowed raising the pressure inside the ventricle and causing the enlargement but that means that even generalized high blood pressure can cause the concentric hypertrophy how is your blood pressure by the way how far into the diagnosis and treatment are you your new consultant did an echocardiogram to confirm concentric right how's your ejection fraction are you on calcium channel blockers doctors have to know the precise reason for the hypertrophy in order to treat it if it's aortic valve narrowing that's causing it a valve replacement can be very helpful your doc will walk youthrough all this good luck to you Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Aortic insufficiency Aortic dissection Mitral regurgitation Atrial septal defect Cardiology Heart Heart sounds Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Heart valve Cardiac cycle Atherosclerosis Coronary circulation Turner syndrome Mitral stenosis Aortic valve Cirrhosis Tetralogy of Fallot Pulmonary hypertension Cardiomyopathy Shock Stroke Intracranial pressure Aortic aneurysm Cardiovascular disease Aneurysm Circulatory system Asthma Echocardiography Atrial flutter Patent ductus arteriosus Traumatic brain injury Ventricular fibrillation Hydrocephalus Acute renal failure Urinary incontinence Sickle-cell disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Colorectal cancer Cephalic disorder Long QT syndrome Artery Inferior vena cava Sleep apnea Ventricular septal defect Marfan syndrome Angina Tobacco smoking Cardiac output Cardiac pacemaker Hydronephrosis Hirschsprung's disease Flecainide Benign prostatic hyperplasia Reptile Paget's disease of bone Prostate cancer Coronary heart disease Anabolic steroid Constrictive pericarditis Cardiac arrest Alzheimer's disease Heyde's syndrome Coeliac disease Transposition of the Great Arteries Calcium channel blocker Prolactinoma Pneumonia Dam Electrophysiology Syringomyelia Stomach cancer Radiation therapy Physical examination Siphon Carburetor Psoriasis Lupus erythematosus Thermal power station Kidney Spark plug Antihypertensive Apoplexy Emphysema Cancer Fetus Mesothelioma Maprotiline
