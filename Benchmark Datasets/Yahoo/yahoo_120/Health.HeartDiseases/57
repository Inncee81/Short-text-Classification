what kind of heart murmur do i have link to audio file provided is there a cardiologist in the house i am interested in and have made recording my heartbeat a hobby at age i was diagnosed with an innocent murmur an ekg and an echo found nothing to worry about it took two doctors listening intently with their stethoscopes to detect the murmor i'm now and visited a different doctor for a checkup recently he detected the murmor immediately am i worried about nothing or should i ask to see a cardiologist i am curious if a doctor or cardiologist can tell from this mp recording what kind of murmur i might have this recording was made with a homemade stethoscope microphone and was recorded at the tricuspid valve area here is a link to the mp file http mercenary fileave com tricuspidvalvearea sec mp i think it's a pretty good recording but you may have to turn up your computer's volume to hear it thanks i'm impressed at the quality of your recording given that you used a homemade stethoscope microphone i would differ with eman somewhat in that your murmur is more of an early to midsystolic murmur i would add that it is crescendo decrescendo in nature and that there appears to be a gap between the first heart sound s and the onset of the murmur it also sounds like s splits physiologically with respiration but that is difficult to tell without physically examining you i disagree with eman that the murmur sounds like a mitral regurgitant or tricuspid regurgitant murmur these murmurs unless they are acute or associated with a noncompliant ventricle fill in the entire space between s and s neither does it sound like a vsd although it sounds like you were listening in the right area for one because those murmurs typically start at the same time as s your murmur sounds to me like an outflow murmur which can be due to turbulent flow across the aortic or pulmonic valve or simply due to high volume a bicuspid aortic valve is one possibility although you can usually see that on echo it can also be an innocent murmur in general echocardiograms are quite good at picking up causes for abnormal systolic murmurs so if you have had no symptoms and a normal echocardiogram at age it's probably not anything bad on the other hand it is never wrong to ask for a second opinion all we have to go on here is a single recording of your heart sounds from one location it requires a full history physical and appropriate testing to be able to confidently tell you that you have nothing to worry about hope that helps good luck Mitral regurgitation Cardiac cycle Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Turner syndrome Heart Blood pressure Aortic valve Hypertension Mitral valve prolapse Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia Coronary circulation Electrocardiogram Cardiology diagnostic tests and procedures Cardiac arrhythmia Medicine Mitral stenosis Prostate cancer Myocardial infarction Atrial fibrillation MP3 Pneumonia Endocarditis Physical examination Heart rate Medical ultrasonography Stethoscope Asthma Tetralogy of Fallot Doppler effect Stroke G-Man (Half-Life) Vacuum tube Urinary incontinence Hypoglycemia Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Echocardiography Theory of conduct CPU cache Lupus erythematosus Anxiety Sound effect Binaural recording Milton H.
