i need to re install software but one disc is missing i have an emac computer and need to reinstall the software however it says i need discs i have installed the first successfully but it asking for the second which i do not have is there any way i can download this from somewhere or is there anything else anyone could suggest please ps it's an emac with mac os x version i'm sorry but i'm not very good with computers and although this may sound silly i really need the answers to be in simple terms sorry you can only do this if the software is not copyrighted download a torrent client like bittorrent find a torrent site like torrentspy find the program you are looking for once you find the program look at the files there should either be a rar or zip archive or image files iso img nrg if the files are image files skip the next step once you download the file if it is a rar or zip you need to open it with winrar extract the files these should be image files to a folder you can find download a virtual drive manager like poweriso either mount the cd to your cd drive right click the iso you downloaded but make sure you don't have a cd in the drive and you don't insert a cd before you unmount the drive or burn the iso to a disk Windows Vista IBM PC compatible Windows XP Mac OS X History of Microsoft Windows Personal computer Microsoft Windows Apple Macintosh Radeon Laptop Windows Server 2003 PowerPC Nintendo Revolution PC Engine Microsoft Office ATI Technologies PowerBook DirectX Apple II family PlayStation 3 TRS-80 IBM PC Atari ST OpenGL X86 Xbox 360 Atari 8-bit family ZX Spectrum MSX Windows 2000 Commodore 64 Microprocessor Windows 3.x Windows API 64-bit PlayStation 2 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Apple Computer IMac IBook TRS-80 Color Computer Floppy disk Acorn Archimedes Microsoft System 7 (Macintosh) Amiga Mac OS RISC Sinclair ZX81 Amstrad CPC BBC Micro Desktop computer AMD64 Computer History of computing hardware (1960s-present) Acorn Electron Acorn Computers IPAQ Neverwinter Nights Blue screen of death Object Desktop Graphics processing unit Kernel (computer science) Visual Basic The Sims 2 MIPS architecture Random access memory DOS In The Groove (game) 3dfx History of operating systems Wintel MS-DOS Windows 95 SAM Coup__ Sun Microsystems Sound Blaster Game Boy Advance Computer and video games OS/2 Commodore Plus/4 Screenshot Commodore 128 Sega Saturn Nintendo DS IA-32 Xbox Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis NX bit History of the graphical user interface TI-83 series Online music store MAME PlayStation Portable Commodore VIC-20
