photoshop and corel paint keygens not trying to pirate recently lost my hard drive and had to get a new one i have no idea where the boxes are containing the keygens to these products are i had already bought both programs what do i do i rely on these programs but now i cant use them because i dont have the keygens anyone know where i can get them im not pirating because like i said i had already bought the copies and i really dont feel like paying another couple hundred to get them again if you purchased electronic copies no cd download only versions or if you ordered through the companies' sites they may have your information on file email their support departments for assistance in obtaining your correct registration key codes you will need all the information from when you purchased version numbers your email address at the time of purchase and likely the method of payment possibly complete card info i suggest that if this is not a workable solution some companies have a clause in the license for electronic delivery software that says you are out of luck if you lose the purchase verification if you have a webmail address look to make sure you have not archived the purchase receipt emails yahoo and gmail both allow you to keep mail which will probably be instrumental in regaining legitimate copies of your software using a keygen program even if you own the software legitimately is the same as stealing legally speaking you must use the key that you paid for to activate the software or it is still pirated good luck GIMP GIMP Toolkit Microsoft .NET Windows 2000 Wget Btrieve Knoppix Common Unix Printing System PHP Mandriva Linux .NET assemblies Windows registry Uniform Resource Locator HTTP cookie Domain Name System Dialer Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing Mozilla Firefox GNU EMule BitTorrent Windows API User agent MegaMan Battle Network C Sharp Blue screen of death MDAC MSH (shell) MegaMan NT Warrior LiteStep IPod Qt (toolkit) MegaMan Battle Network (video game) Installer Digital audio workstation SUSE Linux BZFlag Multiple document interface Rootkit World Wide Web MSN Messenger Windows Mobile Screenshot System 7 (Macintosh) XSL Transformations Damn Small Linux MIRC Minesweeper (computer game) Session Initiation Protocol Kazaa WiX Anti-virus software Scheme programming language Web crawler HyperText Transfer Protocol Lazarus (software) CPAN Slapt-get Hello world program AOL Instant Messenger Linux Python programming language Subversion (software) WAMP Trojan horse (computing) MediaMax CD-3 Internet censorship in mainland China Internet Microsoft Windows SAML Windows Vista Mozilla Application Suite OpenOffice.org Widget toolkit Tux Paint Representational State Transfer Concurrent Versions System TikiWiki WASTE FFmpeg Windows Server 2003 Adobe Photoshop MegaMan.EXE Advanced Packaging Tool Unicode StepMania Patch (computing) ReactOS Windows XP VirtualDub NetNavi Proxy server KDE Website Warez Open-source software Apache HTTP Server Windows Installer
