why is windows vista needed for photoshop cs is there a way around this because all i want to do is do the free trial of cs and i'm not going to shell out bucks for a program that i heard sucks just for days if not where can i find photoshop cs i would assume it's at a somewhat discount price since there is a newer version thanks i downloaded the trial and i can't install it because i don't have vista according to a pop up so i don't know what the hell is going on i'm not sure who told you that but i downloaded and installed photoshop cs on my computer and i have windows xp vista isn't needed if it were than adobe and windows would have to create a contract between the two of them only because as people buy adobe for pc they'd have to buy windows vista also sorry but someone gave you misleading information Library (computer science) Visual Basic Component Object Model Dynamic-Link Library MDAC Mac OS X Windows 2000 Internet Explorer Perl NPAPI AmigaOS BASIC programming language Mozilla Firefox Microsoft Microsoft Access Windows API Macromedia Flash Emacs Windows Vista System 7 (Macintosh) .NET assemblies Linux OpenOffice.org Spyware Microsoft Excel Blue screen of death Virtual memory Mouse (computing) Linux distribution Windows registry Windows Server 2003 File system Konqueror File Allocation Table DLL hell Unix Wine (software) History of Microsoft Windows Computer OS/2 Bluetooth Domain Name System 64-bit Xcode Portable Document Format Computer virus ITunes Steam (content delivery) Object Desktop CPAN Master Control Program Windows Explorer C plus plus Cocoa (API) USB flash drive Opera (web browser) System/36 WebObjects Public domain Mach kernel Wget Pretty Good Privacy C Sharp CPU cache Windows 3.x Forth programming language Microsoft Windows FreeBSD Microsoft Jet Database Engine Hello world program X86 Revision control Software testing Objective-C Gmail PHP DirectShow WordPerfect Stardock Netscape Communications Corporation World Wide Web XML C programming language OpenBSD Microsoft Office Comparison of web browsers Macintosh Finder IBM 1620
