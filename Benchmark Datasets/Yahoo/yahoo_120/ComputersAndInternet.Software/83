the gimp is messing with me so i got the gimp and set it up and it asked what files to associate with it i accidently selected png and now gimp opens my pngs which i dont want so i went into the file explorer of my xp and tools folder options file types tab and associated pngs to the program of my choice paint net i did this because the gimp file association program wouldn't let me uncheck the files i had checked and associated with the gimp during the installation so now all my pngs have a gimp file icon but are opened with paint net and this is confusing and annoying my question is how do i make make my pngs look like paint net files and not gimp files because they are opened with paint net i tried uninstalling but that still kept the record of which files my comp associated with gimp and on re installation it wouldn't let me uncheck anything i had checked on my previous installation i'm thinking this requires a registry hack and i appreciate any help thanks the ccleaner is a great idea thx i already have it i'll give it a try to imadoofus i want to associate all my pngs to paint net not just a few i have many pngs i need a permanent solution i dont think you read my question all the way my pngs look like gimp files but are opened with paint net this is confusing me get ccleaner do an 'issues' scan and save or delete whats found that will remove anything in the registry thats obsolete uninstall gimp first though http www ccleaner com download its free HTML element Stopping e-mail abuse OpenDocument P__li TikiWiki Graphical user interface Chemical formula Menu (computing) Unicode HTML Hyperlink Wiki Archy Macromedia Flash IPod Secretion Mouse (computing) Unicode and e-mail Opera (web browser) Click consonant Google Desktop Gmail Curry-Howard Microsoft Office OpenOffice.org Ebook IBM PC keyboard Managed learning environment Microsoft Paint Online advertising AmigaOS AppleScript E-mail spam NaturallySpeaking Lotus 1-2-3 Quantification E-mail Website Windows Mobile Cut and paste Computer virus Multiple document interface Laws of Form America Online Ajax (programming) Spam (electronic) Vim (text editor) Sudoku PHP Cross site scripting Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test Encarta Hypertext Emacs Double-click (computing) Klik C plus plus Geographic information system Lotus Notes E-learning LR parser Mathematics Fitts' law Direct marketing International Phonetic Alphabet Start Menu Internet Message Access Protocol XML Viral marketing Wikipedia Mozilla Firefox World Wide Web Markup language Binary and text files Cmd.exe Slot machine Lotus Improv T cell Macintosh Finder Prostate cancer Pocket PC Common Lisp WordStar Cell (biology) Steely Dan Combo box Verizon Wireless Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMIX DOM Events Pie menu Emoticon ICalendar Human skin color WordPerfect Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Eye Linked list Gene therapy
