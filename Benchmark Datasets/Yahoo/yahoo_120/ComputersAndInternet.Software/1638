mcaffe and norton rubbish when i installed mcaffe and norton product but not togeather it slowed down my pc to a crawl and it frozen my pc so i formatted the hard drive and upgrated my memory and got a mate to install mb ram which inproved a lot but i unistalled mcaffe and installed avg anti virus and zone alarm for firewell which i am happy with when i checked my pc for what memory it has got it displayed mb of ram when i asked the installer he told me the graphics card took that up is this true your total ram is about right usually your system will set aside a little bit for background essential operations and it won't show up so if you had gig of ram you might only show gig your graphics card has nothing to do with it it actually has its own memory on board the card which it uses to crunch graphics numbers i have had similar results with both of these programs slowing my computer to a crawl i would suggest solely running an antivirus and spyware program usually norton and mcaffee have a suite of programs that run in the background and bog down slower computers i also went with avg and haven't had a problem since hope this helps Computer software Windows API Eiffel programming language Java programming language AmigaOS Computer program C plus plus Python programming language Computer programming Free software Public domain Text editor Apple Computer Mouse (computing) Unicode Software engineering GNOME Linux kernel Compiler optimization Microsoft .NET Extreme Programming Computer JADE programming language Richard Stallman Macromedia Flash Integrated development environment Visual Basic Mac OS history Objective-C COBOL Application programming interface Source code Quake III Arena Windows 2000 Programming language Cocoa (API) Software architecture Debugging Buffer overflow Delphi programming language Software development process Visual Basic .NET C programming language Compiler Common Lisp CPU cache Aspect-oriented programming Computer virus Turbo Pascal OpenOffice.org MBASIC AMD64 Java platform Embedded system Dylan programming language Unix Virtual machine History of the graphical user interface Ocaml AS/400 Carbon (API) Mac OS X Microsoft Windows Emacs Perl Cascading Style Sheets IBM PC compatible Make Datatype Domain-specific programming language OpenDocument Library (computer science) Debian Sun Microsystems Short message service Commodore Plus/4 Requirements analysis OpenGL PIC microcontroller Mach kernel LiveJournal DBASE Comment ALGOL 68 Linux System/36 Timeline of computing Fortran Software bug Optimization (computer science) Inheritance (computer science) GNU Apple II family MDAC Hungarian notation Game programmer Ada programming language Icon (computing)
