is there a way to rearrange the order of posted tracks in the itunes library without altering the song titles for example say i put an album into the itunes music library but the tracks came out in the wrong order one way of rearranging the order of tracks is by changing the name of the song so if a song that came first in the track order is actually fourth on the list you could place a number preceding the song title so that it would be first on the list usually this works but not always so all im asking is there another way to rearrange the tracks in the order you want them in click on the song then click file get info or ctrl i under the info tab there is a place to type in the song number put in click next put in click next etc E-mail Stopping e-mail abuse E-mail spam Gmail Anonymous remailer Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Pretty Good Privacy Computer forensics Spam (electronic) United States Postal Service HTML Spam Prevention Early Warning System SpamAssassin Bayesian filtering Opera (web browser) Usenet Viral marketing Yahoo!
