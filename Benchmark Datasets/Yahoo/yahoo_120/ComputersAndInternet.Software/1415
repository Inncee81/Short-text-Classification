i would like to use excel to create address labels that can be printed on stickers how to do it avery j or similar paper usually this is done by creating a mailing list in excel and using word's mail merge feature to print the labels far too much to go through here so i'll just give a few tips for the most flexibility with the mail merge fields in word keep first and last names in separate cells ditto for the parts of the address street address city state zip word's mail merge can be found in the tools letters and mailings menu item before wasting pages of labels run tests on regular paper and hold the sheets up against the labels to check the layout don't leave the setting up to the last minute mail merge can be frustrating and take more time to set up than one would think for test runs use only enough names to be sure you're not losing any a little over a page should do skipping every other name is really easy to do keep a sense of humor while you're wrestling with it CD recorder CD-R Greatest (Duran Duran) CD and DVD packaging Videocassette recorder DVD-RAM DVD Knoppix Laserdisc The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (film) Copy protection Jet engine Compact disc DeCSS Disk image HD DVD Digital rights management Online DVD rental Modchip Batman Forever Led Zeppelin (DVD) DVD plus RW The Ultimate Matrix Collection Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In DVD-R VHS Pok__mon Chronicles Single (music) Apollo 8 Nintendo Revolution Regional lockout Dallas (TV series) Unreal Tournament 2004 Sex Machineguns DVD region code Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events Sega Dreamcast Optical disc Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Blu-ray Disc Def Leppard H.264/MPEG-4 AVC DualDisc DVD recorder And All That Could Have Been The Adventures of Tintin (TV series) The Simpsons Laser Invader Zim Video CD Mudvayne Have I Got News For You Macrovision Pop Art: Pet Shop Boys - The Hits Scramjet Audio commentary (DVD) PlayStation 2 Calexico Citizen Kane Resident Evil: Apocalypse A-ha Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory Gold album Netflix Supagroup Ren and Stimpy CD-ROM Who Framed Roger Rabbit Dream Theater The Smashing Pumpkins Easter egg (virtual) DVD-Audio Quatermass II Comparison of media players Machine Head (band) DIVX Super Video CD M4 Sherman Oasis (band) Locations in the Warcraft Universe High-definition television Star Wars: Clone Wars Blank (cartridge) Pioneer Corporation Refused String Cheese Incident USS Brill (SS-330) ITunes Why Do You Love Me R30 Live In Frankfurt Solid rocket Enhanced Versatile Disc MP3 Modesty Blaise Mary Poppins Rammstein Shakespear's Sister Dolby Digital Lamb of God (band) The O.C.
