on shut down i receive error message mccwsawindow and have to end program to shut down mccwsawindow seems to be dependent on operation of bthelpnotifier exe if you've got bthelpnotifier exe running click on the processes tab in with windows task manager ctrl alt del you'll see that bthelpnotifier exe is responsible for slight but constant cpu usage as this is a non essential process that is using up system resources and as it's not necessary to run at startup it's best to disable it and in so doing resolve the non terminating mccwsawindow annoyance click on run via the start button and type in msconfig not the quotes click on the startup tab uncheck bthelpnotifier then re boot you will still have to manually end mccwsawindow on this re boot of course because bthelpnotifier is still running but subsequent re boots will not be hampered by mccwsawindow's failure to terminate then reboot you will get a popup saying you have changed the way windows starts just put a tick in the box do not show this again Microsoft Office Windows Vista Microsoft Microsoft Windows Windows XP Outlook Express History of Microsoft Windows OpenOffice.org Computer virus Mac OS X IBM PC compatible Gmail OpenGL Windows Server 2003 Visual Basic BASIC programming language Macromedia Flash Pocket PC Pretty Good Privacy Microsoft Outlook AmigaOS Apple Macintosh Windows Mobile Windows 2000 Google Desktop Mouse (computing) Microsoft PowerPoint Emacs Apple II family WordPerfect Hotmail Blue screen of death Stopping e-mail abuse Atari ST Stardock Radeon Mozilla Thunderbird USB flash drive HyperCard Object Desktop IPod Bulletin board system Microsoft Excel Portable Document Format History of the graphical user interface Perl Mac OS X v10.4 ITunes Windows 95 Browser wars Linux Linspire Ajax (programming) Visual Basic .NET Opera (web browser) Virtual memory OS/2 System 7 (Macintosh) Steam (content delivery) Mach kernel E-mail spam Personal computer WordStar WindowBlinds Timeline of computing 1990-forward X Window System Mozilla Firefox Windows API PLATO Internet Explorer Internet forum ZX Spectrum Modem Mozilla Application Suite Python programming language Netscape Navigator Server BIOS Domain Name System Free software Poker jargon Palm OS Amiga Computer software Common criticisms of Microsoft Theory of conduct Operating system Floppy disk Apple Computer Vista Way Fritz-chip CP/M TRS-80 Color Computer Btrieve
