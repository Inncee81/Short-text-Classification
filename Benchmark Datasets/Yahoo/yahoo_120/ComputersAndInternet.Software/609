why does the text color change to red and also underlined in microsoft word i just opened a simple word document with tables and autoshapes in it when i opened it the letterhead and autoshapes were missing and whenever i type the letters are red and underlined i did not change the font nor underline how do i get it back to basic black no underline i've gone to format and font but it doesn't show that the color has changed and is underlined sounds to me like you've accidentally turned on track changes try this for word xp and possibly right click on any menu and see if the reviewing toolbar is checked if not i'm done but if it is deselect it and watch which toolbar disappears then select it again to bring it back hover over each button on the reviewing toolbar to find the one labeled track changes it's usually near the right end and has a bunch of red lines surprise on a page as its icon it should look selected deselect it try adding some text to your document and see if this cured the problem it should now to get rid of the stuff you already have in red again on the reviewing toolbar find the button that says accept changes it's usually in the middle and has a check mark as its icon click the down arrow for this list box and select accept all changes in document you may have to give a yes or ok click to something but this should do it good luck Commodore 64 Atari ST File Allocation Table Linux USB flash drive NeXT BIOS Sony NTFS DOS Hard disk Apple Macintosh Redundant array of independent disks Knoppix Commodore International ZX Spectrum Apple II family IBM PC AmigaOS File system Secure Digital card Bootable business card Alcoholics Anonymous Linux distribution Western Digital Drive letter assignment Atari 8-bit family Floppy disk Commodore DOS Copy protection Computer virus Blue screen of death Apple IIGS Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories Wintel Image Warez Slackware MS-DOS Data recovery BASIC programming language X86 DOS Comparison Amiga Game demo Netscape Navigator System 7 (Macintosh) Microsoft Office Data remanence Dyne:bolic King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow Commodore 1581 Dd (Unix) History of computer and video games A4000 SAM Coup__ Covermount Backup Boot image control Vi DNA Password Game development IMac Xerox Star Windows 2000 Electronic Arts Windows XP Bungie Studios Atari TT030 Advertising Marshall Plan Copland Finnish language Amstrad PCW Zip drive Digital photography Amway WordStar Disk formatting Amstrad CPC Macromedia Flash ZIP (file format) Wealth Type-in program SuperDisk PHP Famicom Disk System Botulism Commodore SX-64 TRS-80 X-COM: UFO Defense Aster CT-80 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Device driver GRand Unified Bootloader Digital rights management Strap-on dildo Numerical control History of the graphical user interface
