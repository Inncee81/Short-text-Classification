do guys like vegan girls do typical guys think vegan girls are weird or do they think theyre cool because theyre dedicated to generalize boys isn't a good basis guys like different things some guys like blondes other like brunettes some like thin girls and others like a girl with some meat on her it depends on the guy i'd say a lot of the guys that try to prove they are macho wouldn't give a vegan girl the time of day much like the first poster on here guys that are secure with themselves probably would be more open to a vegan girl my boyfriend is a meat eater but he supports my decision and even tests a lot of the food i make and really enjoys it but before i met him i would have guys come up and hit on me and as soon as they heard me order food that didn't contain meat in it they immediately started making jokes and insulting me i guess you can say it depends on their maturity level if anything Veganism The Ashlee Simpson Show Blood on the Tracks Friends Avenue Q Kodocha Teen Girl Squad Blonde on Blonde Reservoir Dogs About a Boy Little Britain Totally Spies!
