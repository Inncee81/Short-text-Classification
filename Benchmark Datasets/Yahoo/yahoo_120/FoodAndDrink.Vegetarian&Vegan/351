how do you cope when people try to force meat upon you i have my grandparents staying with me at the moment and they are being almost impossible when it comes to meal times i told them i was on a diet that my gym instructor had put me on which was to abstain from animal products for a few months except fish thought they might listen if it came from a professional my nan tells me that i need meat when i say i eat fish she tells me that isn't meat arghh i told them to not worry about my eating habits as i am perfectly healthy and a grown women that can make her own decisions and asked them what they would like to eat for the week as i dont mind cooking thier food and i'll just work around what they chose at meal times but my nanna has started cooking meat soups roast etc when i am at work then gets offended when i refuse to eat it she is even packing my lunch for work and i have to just throw it out when i get there arghh what can i do she is driving me insane and literally trying to force me to eat meat i dont want to be rude to her as i know she will take it the wrong way but i'm really almost about to snap plus i still have them for another weeks yet this sounds more like a relationship and respect issue than a vegetarian issue especially since eating fish is not vegetarian Vegetarianism Veganism Hamburger Food Taboo food and drink Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kashrut Tofu Korean cuisine Bengali cuisine Egg (food) Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler British cuisine Chinese cuisine Whaling Jewish cuisine Meal Buddhist cuisine Cuisine of Africa Vegetarian cuisine Lisa the Vegetarian Pork Healthy eating German cuisine Cuisine of Laos Cuisine of the Southern United States Tlingit Ramen Cheese Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Fasting French cuisine Chicken Bento Breakfast McDonald's Sausage Cat Meat analogue Chopsticks Sandwich Domesticated turkey Cuisine of the Philippines Animal rights Little Britain Meat Japanese cuisine The Two Doctors Korban Acorn Social rule Environmental vegetarianism Super Size Me Punk ideology 613 mitzvot Fugu Swedish cuisine Japanese tea ceremony Cantonese cuisine Roman eating and drinking Dog Cuisine of Thailand Raw food diet Shaggy dog story MRE Guinea pig Kosher foods Albert Fish EastEnders Tomato Serbian cuisine Garfield Vegetarian nutrition Sauerkraut Minestrone Fiddler on the Roof Cuisine of Vietnam Eating Anorexia nervosa Treehouse of Horror V Fish and chips Kodocha Meat Loaf Unclean animals Oily fish Food storage Russian cuisine Food Not Bombs Cassava
