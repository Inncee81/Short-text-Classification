where is this elusive evidence recently i have been witness to a number of answers in the vegetarian vegan category stating that there is scientific proof that a vegetarian diet is nutritionally lacking i myself am a vegetarian and after exhaustive research have come to the conclusion that a thoughtful healthy vegetarian diet rich in fruits vegetables and whole grains is not only nutritionally complete but actually more healthful than a diet rich in meat i am however interested in this evidence as well as its scientific validity please don't waste my time with answers such as meat is good god made animals so we could eat them etc if you have real solid evidence please enlighten me with it i am well aware that there are no legitimate answers to this question i merely asked it to make a point if i need to spell it out for you please go shoot yourself for your foolishness personally i have not seen any over whelming evidence that meat is good for you there are a lot of people on this forum who bag vegan vegetarian diet they make these silly statements that we have have to eat meat and that is an essential protein it actually isn't the ex evegetarians who state the vegetarian diet made them sick and there are a few and they say they went to the doctor and was advised to eat meat if you read what they say they lived on candy bread crisp sandwiches and sweet coffee they did not not have a balanced diet but ate a variety of rubbish and often skipped meals being vegan is healthier than any other diet possible and that isn't even touch the hormones and antibiotics used in raising animals and the possibilities and realities of meat borne illness mad cow disease etc better for your heart proven to reduce heart disease and even reverse coronary heart disease automatically lower s your cholesterol levels the only foods that contain cholesterol are animal products like meat and dairy and since a three decade long study found that not a single subject with a cholesterol level below has ever developed heart disease that's hard to ignore vegans have lower rates of obesity coronary heart disease high blood pressure large bowel disorders cancers and gallstones reduces stroke risks and coronary artery disease reduces symptoms of fibromyalgia reduces food poisoning of food poisoning is linked to animal products your bowels will work much better therefore keeping your whole system healthier live longer healthier lives one year long study that compared meat eaters and vegetarians showed that the greater the meat consumption the greater the death rate from all causes combined increased vegetable and fruit intake reduces your need for taking a multi vitamin plus increases your antioxidant intake there is no proof what so ever that a person must eat animal flesh or any by products of animals to be healthy yet there is overwhelming proof that it truely is best not to these die hard meat eaters talk utter nonsense and are constantly making up these radical stories about vegetarians being unhealth and it real nonsense Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cancer Food guide pyramid Egg (food) Soybean Hypercholesterolemia Coeliac disease Brain Healthy eating Anemia Livestock Word of Wisdom Growth hormone treatment Breastfeeding Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Soy milk Animal rights Stomach cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Guinea pig Organic farming Factory farming Tobacco smoking Anorexia nervosa Alcohol consumption and health Insulin Chicken Domestic rabbit Aspartame Diarrhea Tooth Dairy Cyanocobalamin Acne Protein Taboo food and drink Tofu Case-control Vegetarianism and religion Cat Oily fish Common cold Low density lipoprotein Fancy rat Vitamin D Myocardial infarction Natural Hygiene Osteoporosis Coffee Traditional Chinese medicine Hamster Escherichia coli O157:H7 Environmental vegetarianism Adjustable gastric band Stroke Alcoholism Hamburger Binge eating disorder Oral contraceptive
