how do i deal with people who dont approve of me being a vegatarian my mom is one also but im talking about others some that i dont even know i mean my mom is a vegetarian laugh when they say something stupid just laugh don't do it at them or even in their general direction completely ignore them with your body language but make sure they are aware that you think what they are saying is funny if they call on the phone and say something about it laugh i don't know what is wrong with them but if you act like a happy person that is confident in her choices they will probably not get their childish kicks out of opening their ignorant mouths their lack of respect is funny how can someone be so dumb and rude it's hilarious you are right and they are wrong not because they eat meat but because they can't let you be different and make your own choices even though you are making a choice of compassion and wisdom keep your chin up and keep your face bright and smiling and they can't touch you there is a japanese analogy proverb that goes like this the nail that sticks up is the one that gets hammered down people are like this everywhere when you tell people that it is your personal belief that animals should not be eaten they take a look at themselves and it can be subconsciously translated into what you do is wrong and i choose to be right many people have probably been taught a huge amount of misinformation by their parents and their teachers while growing up the meat industry has a lot of money and uses it to spread propaganda that makes others view us as irrational just ignore them if they have no ability to receive new information with an open mind Buddhism Social rule Theory of conduct Joke Shaggy dog story Treehouse of Horror V Koan Lisa the Vegetarian Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Original sin Vegetarianism Poker jargon Milton H.
