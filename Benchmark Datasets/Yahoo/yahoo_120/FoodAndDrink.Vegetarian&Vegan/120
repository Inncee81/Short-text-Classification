is it hard to date someone who is not a vegan or vegetarian well i was reading an article last night and i saw some shocking statements from vegans and vegetarians a couple stated that it is gross just thinking that their partners body is like a cemementary for animals whats your view on that and yes i am a proud vegetarian cemetery lol sorry a survey in new zealand identified vegansexuals definition no sex with carnivores sample quotes from respondents i would not want to be intimate with someone whose body is literally made up from the bodies of others who have died for their sustenance non vegetarian bodies smell different to me they are after all literally sustained through carcasses i believe we are what we consume so i really struggle with bodily fluids especially sexually i couldn't think of kissing lips that allow dead animal pieces to pass between them when you are vegan or vegetarian you are very aware that when people eat a meaty diet they are kind of a graveyard for animals most people prefer to date others with similar views and veg ns are no exception the people quoted in the article had the most nutball sounding reasons though because for the vast majority of us it's about practical concerns not what people ate and absorbed into their body years ago sheesh and the inventor of the term vegansexual needs to get a grip because it's as silly as coming up with conservativesexual liberalsexual or christiansexual since those are all examples where they are likely to only date within their group it's funny you mention this though because another vegan group was just discussing how ridiculous this article is http community livejournal com veganism html nc Vegetarianism Veganism Oral sex Kashrut Human sexual behavior Raw food diet Environmental vegetarianism Hindu Dieting Shit Sexual orientation Pesco/pollo vegetarianism People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Teen Girl Squad Vegetarian nutrition Punk ideology Food Priestly Code Prostate cancer Person Resurrection of Jesus Vegetarianism and religion Masturbation Abrahamic religion Tasmanian Devil Child sexuality Buddhist cuisine Cat HTML element Hard-line Peter Singer Atheism Heterosexuality Human Animal communication Condom Autism rights movement Transgender Species Death Anal sex Zoophilia Polyamory Domestic violence Kosher foods Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Tofu Puberty Hinduism Cremation Straight edge Lawrence v.
