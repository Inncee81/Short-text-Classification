cheese in yo food have you ever gone out of your way to order a vegan dish at a restaurant only to receive it with one little strand of cheese in it this always happens to me at this mexican restaurant i ordered a wet burrito without cheese meat or the like so i got it and it looked all fine after my initial inspection i ate it and when i was almost done i flipped over a piece of broccoli and wham there was a golden strand of cheese grr it was the only piece i saw i always look at every bite do they do this just to spite me yeah it was kind of screwed up it didnt have any beans in it it was just a warm tortilla with broccoli water chestnuts and iceberg lettuce yuck hey hey im over it girl dont get sassy with me but i was just wondering how common this was it has happened to me several times cs why dont you c s yourself off of this page just goes to show i've been talking the truth for months on this site no mixed food resturant serves vegetarian food its all cross contaminated because the staff have no clue that its morally objectionable to mix cutlery pans pots and hands and further more most chefs have no clue that veggies do not want stuff with slaughter by products in it so they do not even consider vegetarian cheese for vegetarians nor vegan cheese substitutes for vegans fair enough its up to them but they shouldn't pretend they serve vegetarian food its worth noting why they offer a vegetarian option in most resturants its not because they want the veggie custom its because the standards body states in thier compulsary basic standards that they have to offer at least one veggie option before they get any star rating they do it because they have to so have no clue about the morals nor how important it is i know this is true because we're a star veggie vegan place and regularly try to send veggies to lesser places all without success including michelin starred resturants who really couldn't give a toss i suspect one day some rich and bored vegetarian will see them in court then trading standards will have to act Hamburger Vegetarianism Vegetarian cuisine Breakfast Veganism McDonald's Tofu Cheese MRE Restaurant Japanese cuisine Kashrut Pizza Food Cuisine of Brazil Sandwich Korean cuisine People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Kosher foods Buddhist cuisine In-N-Out Burger Cuisine of the Philippines Jewish cuisine Hot dog Dieting French fries Animal rights Lisa the Vegetarian American Chinese cuisine Hamster Cajun cuisine Barbecue Fish and chips Peruvian cuisine Dairy Cuisine of Denmark Bread Burrito Burger Halaal Burger King German cuisine Recipe Theory of conduct Chinese cuisine Roman eating and drinking Cuisine of Singapore Worcestershire sauce Food guide pyramid Meat analogue Bengali cuisine Sausage Japanese tea ceremony Chipotle Mexican Grill Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Environmental vegetarianism Cuisine of the Southern United States Cuisine of Argentina Egg (food) Soybean Yum cha Philadelphia, Pennsylvania British cuisine D__ner kebab Omega-3 fatty acid Gelatin Kitchen Cincinnati chili Street food Aerial (dance move) Vegetarian nutrition Taco Quesadilla Jiaozi Camp Lazlo Sushi Salad Common bean Buddhism Escherichia coli O157:H7 Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 New Haven, Connecticut Raw food diet Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Customs and etiquette of Japan Cha chaan teng Iron Chef The League of Gentlemen (comedy) Cuisine of Norway
