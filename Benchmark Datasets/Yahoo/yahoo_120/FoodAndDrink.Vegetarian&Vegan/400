vegans what do you put on your cooked veggies http www olivioproducts com product overview buttery spray html i have been using this product i think it is a little questionable but i don't know what else to flavor cooked veggies with i really like the buttery flavor any good suggestions btw i'm a new vegan and this is the only product i'm using that i don't think is vegan well it definitely isn't vegan i am in love with earth balance it's vegan and has no trans fats or hydrogenated oils it's also not made from genetically modified ingredients and it's expeller pressed meaning they don't use heat to extract oils thereby changing the nature of the oil it tastes buttery and delicious they even have stick butter and shortening that's vegan and non hydrogenated it has calories but at least they're healthy calories that do something good for your body provide the good fat that you need to keep your cholesterol levels healthy besides butter i like to use tomato sauces on my veggies or i saute a little garlic with olive oil and other spices and toss the veggies in that olive oil also is a good fat p s now that you're vegan be prepared for lame coments like that bf skinner kook to just make statements putting down your diet without any kind of backing it up whatsoever it is true that many vegans don't eat properly so please be sure to get a book like becoming vegan i so highly recommend it and make sure you're getting enough calories from a wide variety of food if you eat the asame things all the time you might be missing some important nutrients and make sure you are getting enough b good luck Veganism Vegetarianism Tofu Cuisine of Brazil Margarine Omega-3 fatty acid Trans fat Olive oil Egg (food) Dieting French fries Hamburger Milk French cuisine Cuisine of the Philippines Food Breakfast Curry Ramen Atkins Nutritional Approach Nutrition Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Mayonnaise Butter Cheese Healthy eating Pizza Recipe Raw food diet Pasta Obesity Soybean Hot dog MRE Apple Chili con carne Soy milk Bacon Ketchup Organic food Garlic Bengali cuisine Food guide pyramid Peanut butter Coffee Cantonese cuisine Cookware and bakeware Peruvian cuisine Barbecue Tocopherol Food preservation Korean cuisine Japanese cuisine Vegetarian nutrition Saturated fat Domesticated turkey Cuisine of Malaysia South Beach diet Cooking oil Sushi Sausage Potassium Chicken soup Vitamin C Cajun cuisine D__ner kebab Paleolithic diet Grape seed oil Rum Breastfeeding Chile pepper McDonald's Calorie Peanut Rice Nutmeg Cyanocobalamin Cuisine of the Southern United States In-N-Out Burger Dietary fiber Idli Cake Calorie restriction Cuisine of Laos Hypercholesterolemia Kosher foods
