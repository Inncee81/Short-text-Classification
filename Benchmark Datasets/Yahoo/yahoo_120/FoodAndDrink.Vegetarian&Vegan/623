vegetarian chef my very young son has expressed an interest in becoming a chef however he is a vegetarian he was watching top chef today and saw the contestants digging out clams etc and cooking lamb and pork he said how can i become a chef if i don't want to cook meat i said i really don't have any idea about that i'll ask on yahoo answers he smiled real big so anyone have feedback for him someone ask a few questions so here are some answers i have been a vegetarian on and off during my life i am not at the moment my kids refer to it as if i have embarrassingly fallen off the wagon none of my children have ever tasted meat and i can't imagine that this son would ever be willing to cook meat even fish nothing with eyes except potatoes my son always helps me cook and is great with flexibility and adaption he is a very creative little guy thanks for all your answers i told him i had posted and he was really excited to the poster talking about texas it is true we are sort of an oddity in new braunfels but he actually has several vegetarian friends it is possible here one just has to be a little flexible a decade ago i would have screamed over refried beans whose ingredients i wasn't sure about but these days are different thanks to everyone for their fabulous contributions i'm assuming you aren't veg how young is very young pre school high school he needs to start out by learning how to cook in your kitchen are you teaching him cooking as a veg he needs to know how to cook anyway as an important survival skill for living veg in texas g if he's old enough to read get him a fannie farmer cookbook and also a copy of the new farm vegetarian cookbook fannie will get him familiar with all the basics of cooking the farm will get both of you familiar with 'down home' veg cookery the skills he builds now will help him later on whether or not he sticks with the idea of being a chef his options for 'professional' schooling in texas are limited esp since it seems y'all are around new braunfels but don't sweat that if he's already a good cook by the time he's ready to work in a restaurant or better yet start his own g not having that piece of paper won't matter this next part is going to get me slammed but it really is important for coping in a meatish industry and world sigh but it's important because the most successful veg restaurants are the ones that attract more than just the veg market knowing what and how omni's eat are important skills arg he won't like it i sure didn't but he does at some point need to be familiar with cooking carrion animals no need to start with it and he most certainly does not need to taste it if he learns what goes into cooking the stuff and pays attention to what it looks and smells like he won't have to taste it to know when it's done 'correctly' cooked animals are never correct but you get the idea i hope g but it'll also teach him to cook by feel which is a skill that school trained chefs almost never develop it's an instant edge over anyone else in a kitchen and classmates if he does eventually go to culinary school one other thing if he's old enough drag him over to one of those two decent veg friendly health food stores in town g they've got a lot of the ingredients you need to do good veg cooking edit to the folks upset that i suggest teaching the kid about carrion this family is in texas not oregon california new york new hampshire united kingdom or any other relatively veg friendly place and they aren't even in houston dallas or austin the best of the worst in an anti veg state this boy is growing up in an area where meat is ubiquitous and if he learns about how it's cooked he'll never be put in the spot of having to taste the dreck to know it's prepared the way some omni wants it cooked it's a matter of knowing your 'enemy' and not selling out edit it is much easier to be a 'tex veg' than when i was a kid and nowhere near as odd g you can avoid the 'tex mex' problems by heading up to casa de luz in austin even though that does mean fighting i lol and call ahead they might be willing to talk to him a bit about running a veg restaurant in texas or at least show off the kitchen since he's already helping out in the kitchen work him up to leading in the kitchen that also gets you a break from the kitchen g drag him to the library for cookbooks and n b s used bookstore book in time if it's still there for cookbooks also abebooks com or amazon once he gets the option he should take home ec in school good way to meet girls too g when he hits his teens he should also start taking business and marketing courses most chefs never develop business and marketing skills and that's a big part of why most restaurants fail within years Chili con carne Barbecue Vegetarianism Shaggy dog story Cajun cuisine Veganism Kitchen Food Sushi Cuisine of Denmark Tofu Iron Chef Cuisine of Brazil French fries Friends Milton H.
