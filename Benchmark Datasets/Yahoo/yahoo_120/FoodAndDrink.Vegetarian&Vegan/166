vegetarian vegan stereo type i think it is ridiculous how meat eaters claim that vegetarians vegans are always trying to force them to not eat meat i think is the complete opposite everytime someone realizes that i don't eat meat immediately they start saying why how do you do that thats not healthy meat is good they are going to kill it anyway and i just stand there silently saying because i feel like as do most of the other vegetarians i know i have never met a meat eater who is ok with someone who doesn't eat meat or atleast who doesn't have some rude comment to state i think it is the complete opposite and that they are the ones who try and conform our beliefs who is with me it gets to the stage i try hard not to say anything about my food choices because i am told oh thats why you are so pale women need to eat red meat' you will make yourself sick oh are you a greenie saving the ducks are we you a tree hugger or the best one yet animals were put on this earth to feed us what else would we eat without meat and it must get boring eating all that lettuce i also find when people say this they dont want to hear anything else like meat is bad for you if eaten in excess or no a vegetarian diet is not about just eating lettuce now i just dont say anything as an older person nobody feels the need to lecture but as a younger girl it was awful but you know whats really interesting i dont say these things to meat eaters yeah sure not killing animals is a bonus but its more about maintaing weight and being healthy and i dont like the taste of meat i like vegetables and beans buts it the meat eaters that carry on bizzare i am with you Veganism Hamburger Vegetarian cuisine Kashrut Dieting Vegetarianism and religion People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Raw food diet Animal rights Egg (food) Tofu Buddhist cuisine Meat Vegetarianism of Adolf Hitler Sausage Lisa the Vegetarian Food guide pyramid Vegetarian nutrition McDonald's Buddhism Meat analogue Punk ideology Korean cuisine Fasting Hot dog In-N-Out Burger Dim sum Cat Hunting Pesco/pollo vegetarianism Chili con carne Cheese Environmental vegetarianism Soybean Coronary heart disease French cuisine Yoda Domestic rabbit Domesticated turkey Food Mojave people Whaling Peruvian cuisine Dog Ron Weasley Burger Little Britain Joke Binge eating disorder Jewish cuisine Chicken Factory farming Piccolo Junior Saga Ramen Protein Theory of conduct Invader Zim Chinese cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Teen Girl Squad Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Kosher foods Comanche 613 mitzvot Salad Fingers The Young Ones (TV series) The Catcher in the Rye Cuisine of Vietnam MyPyramid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Foodborne illness Friends Goat Curry Meat Loaf Cat food Cuisine of the Southern United States Peter Singer Fugu Nicomachean Ethics Cuisine of the Philippines Gray Wolf Vitamin C Simone Weil Anemia Fecal incontinence Cuisine of Malaysia Red meat Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Omega-3 fatty acid
