how much do you care about fair trade an earlier question made me wonder if other vegans and vegetarians go out of their way to get fair trade chocolate and coffee if they consider it part of their veg nism to not support human slavery as well or what other products practices you guys know of that contribute to awful human rights violations also interested in hearing responses from non veg people who support the fair trade initiatives i don't give a damn because i know someone in the coffee business as a wholesaler and the told me straight up that fair trade is a scam a total scam and the farmers are not getting very much more money out of it if any at all he does what he calls direct trade direct from the farm in s america to him he directly gives them his money no middlemen see even with fair trade there all sorts of middlemen sure it may be a bit better but not much at all from what i've been told direct trade is what we need to focus on totally completely get rid of the middle men between the farm and the local wholesaler farm to wholesaler to coffee shop the end unless you are a coffee chain then you can be your own wholesaler from the farm to your coffee shops Veganism Fair trade Chocolate and slavery Local food People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals Family farm Theory of conduct Ethical consumerism Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Sweatshop Animal rights Starbucks Slavery Wal-Mart Fairtrade labelling Food Tesco Trade Wall Street Livestock Free trade Simone Weil Organic food History of Brazil (1889-1930) Ribeir__o Preto Farmers' Alliance Illegal drug trade American individualist anarchism Economy of Haiti Coffee Coffeehouse Bulk vending Democratic Party (United States) RuneScape cheats Agriculture in Australia Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Retailer Advance fee fraud Agriculture Economy of the United States Corporation Kashrut Microeconomics Milton H.
