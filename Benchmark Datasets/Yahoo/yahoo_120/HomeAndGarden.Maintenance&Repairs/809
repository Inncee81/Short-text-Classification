i just noticed some gold wires sticking out the cord to my crock pot i have dinner in it want to know if it's safe to have it on while i'm gone or will it start a fire i had it on for a few hours went to move the cord when i touched it i felt a teeny tiny zap didn't hurt at all but still is it safe to leave it on thank you all i definitely will not use it i figured if it wasn't making sparks it would be okay as long as i didn't touch it but i guess that's not the case better safe than sorry no no no if you see any bare wire showing it is not safe you need to replace the cord or throw out the crock pot and buy a new one one dinner isn't worth burning down the whole house Poker jargon Slow cooker Winning Streak Domestic AC power plugs and sockets St. Elmo's Fire (film) Softball Rosa Parks Baseball Tag Baldrick Fuse (electrical) Violin Incandescent light bulb Humphrey Bogart Professional wrestling match types Wheel of Fortune Texas hold 'em Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Big Brother (USA TV series) Hindenburg disaster Kitchen Piccolo Junior Saga Krusty the Clown King Piccolo Saga The Shining (film) Firearm Married... with Children Apollo 1 Pitaten Campfire Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
