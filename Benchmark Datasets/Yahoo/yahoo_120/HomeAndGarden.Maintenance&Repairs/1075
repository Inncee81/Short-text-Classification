i need to install a satellite dish on my roof using inch bolts will this cause any structural damage if you have new roof i would assume that you should be able to install the satellite dish with no structural damage i would use some thing longer than a inch bolt because i would recommend that you install the dish so it is fastened to a trust under the roof this way wind will not cause you any sort of problem if you have an old roof and an old house i would apply the same sort of logic use longer bolts and attach the dish to the x or x trust and you should have no concerns about any structural damage i don't understand why you only want to use a inch bolt Screw Roof Seismic retrofit Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Air-raid shelter Apollo Command/Service Module Morphology (linguistics) Logic Hurricane Wilma Solar power Lightning rod Autonomous building Kremlin towers Drill bit Geodesic dome Hard disk Epistemology Satellite dish STS-61 Elevator Clinker (boat building) Roof and tunnel hacking Transformer Straw-bale construction Vinyl roof Basement Presuppositional apologetics Law of value Rail terminology Hurricane proof building Broadband Internet access Theory of conduct General Dynamics F-111 John Wycliffe Philosophical skepticism Space Shuttle external tank Truss Glossary of climbing terms Scientific method Expert system Terminal ballistics Ontological argument Hamster Lightning safety Lionel Corporation Asbestos Stairway Intellectual capital San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Active Directory Light-frame construction Plumbing fixture Mobile home Mathematics Horsepower Modem Metaphysics Optical fiber Space shuttle main engine Ethics Knife Space Needle Diving Sniper Japanese battleship Yamato Extreme Programming Philosophy of language Connecting rod Dymaxion house Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Plame affair Earthquake construction The Championships, Wimbledon Pretty Good Privacy 19-inch rack Environmental concerns with electricity generation 2004 Atlantic hurricane season Bolted joint Skateboard Rigging Electrical wiring Space Shuttle program Eyepiece Tire XML Mossberg 500 Mission San Juan Capistrano Spacecraft propulsion Turbo-Hydramatic Sewage treatment Polyamory M60 machine gun Sun Natural deduction British Satellite Broadcasting Western philosophy
