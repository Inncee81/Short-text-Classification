how much does it cost to switch from fuses to circuit breakers i'm assuming the actual supplies wouldn't be too expensive but the labor would be the killer you are correct a amp homeline breaker panel with a few breakers will cost you about if the electrician is able to just pull out the old fuse box and swing the wires into the new breaker panel you would have about hours labor more or less if he has to add a junction box and extend wires to reach the breaker panel you will have to add more time your bill will depend on the electrician's rate per hour and if he charges a service call give a few electricians a call in your area and take bids let them know you are contacting other electricians and you will get the best bang for your buck make sure they are licensed BS 1363 Fuse (electrical) Circuit breaker Residual-current device Electrician Distribution board Solar cell Electrical wiring (UK) Relay Three-phase electric power Circuit design Oscilloscope Ring circuit National Electrical Code (US) Gas metal arc welding Switch Vacuum tube Apollo Command/Service Module Incandescent light bulb Transformer Professional wrestling throws Digital circuit Solar power Loudspeaker Armored Core Electrical wiring Dimmer Transistor Capacitor Operational amplifier Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Electric motor Power strip Ground and neutral Ampere Contact breaker Oplan Bojinka Voice over IP Baseball Telephone numbering plan Welding Telephone exchange Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Cable television Electrical breakdown Perl Labor theory of value Alternating current High-voltage direct current Diode Earthing system Apollo Guidance Computer Solar power satellite Inflation Electricity meter Electrophysiology Telegraphy Florida East Coast Railway Ground (electricity) Gliding Killian documents Labour economics Solar panel Cray-1 Apollo 13 Naval mine Hall effect Ignition system Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Construction Home Box Office Programmable logic controller Lineman (occupation) Microeconomics Arcade cabinet CMOS Split phase Battery (electricity) Liquid crystal display Action potential Nuclear fusion North American Numbering Plan Elevator Tesla coil Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Europlug Altair 8800 Poker jargon Battery electric vehicle Submarine communications cable Citizens' band radio Voltage drop Nuclear power Pyramid (game show) Overhead lines Switched-mode power supply Wire wrap Rebreather Supply and demand
