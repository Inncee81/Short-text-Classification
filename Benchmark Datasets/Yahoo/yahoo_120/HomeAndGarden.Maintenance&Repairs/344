what could be wrong with my domestic water pressure pump connected to tank hi i have a water pressure pump connected to a large water tank on a holiday shack it runs from a w w modified square wave inverter when i plug it in i can hear the motor running but it is not pumping any water this is a pump that has a pressure bladder sitting on top of it the noise it makes is quite loud but i can't see that anything is moving when looking at the end there is some kind of cooling fan that looks to be connected to the main drive that is stationary it looks like it wants to move but isnt getting anywhere the tank is full and on the same level as the pump shack without the pump running i can turn on a tape and water dribbles out so i am thinking this is not an issue with priming etc from what i understand the modified square wave input should be fine too any ideas as to what i should check what may be wrong any traps to look out for if i get a qualified peron to fix it am thinking i may be better of replacing with a cheap pump my water pressure was low as yours and luckily i had a handyman talk me thru the procedure via phone i have a different system as i have a well but the problem turned out to be a pressure regulator switch every time ya turn water on off this activates the switch sits on top of the pressure tank you wouldn't believe how many guys tried to get me to believe my tank itself was shot and more so anyways it may be just a switch i would lean towards a person that services sump pumps rather than your whole system as well companies are hard to come by in my area you may need a pump but it may only be the switch itself Thermal power station Solar power Carburetor Thermostat Transformer Vacuum Electric motor Hydraulic machinery Loudspeaker Embedded system E85 Aircraft engine controls Gas compressor Diesel engine Pump Programmable logic controller Steam engine Apollo Command/Service Module Toyota Prius Locomotive Motor oil Space shuttle main engine Wave power Three Mile Island Professional wrestling holds Professional wrestling throws Irrigation Renewable energy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Rail terminology Hydrogen economy Glossary of firefighting equipment Brewery Motorcycle Heinkel He 100 B-47 Stratojet Naval mine Electrical generator Switch Combine harvester Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Windows 2000 Debugging Air conditioning Novelty (locomotive) Glossary of firefighting terms Water supply Blood pressure Stirling engine Dialysis Sewage treatment Fossil fuel power plant Commodore 64 2003 North America blackout Internal combustion engine Mooney M20 Pump It Up Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Glossary of wildland fire terms Dimmer Phase-locked loop Federal Standard 1037C Dairy Hard disk STS-61 Tank Two-stroke cycle Transmission (mechanics) Solar cell Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Urinary incontinence Hydropneumatic Switched-mode power supply Autonomous building ALGOL 68 ZX Spectrum Hydropower Three-phase electric power Uninterruptible power supply Cavitation Dundas Square Vacuum cleaner Pebble bed reactor Sonar Musical Instrument Digital Interface Scuba set Time Out of Mind
