thank you mutantalbino exactly what i thought after the fact by the way i used a slightly wet rag to wipe those coils not even knowing they were coils and they turned from black to shiny metallic color somehow it occurred to me to take a closer look at them and that's when i realized i had closed most of the coils by mistake i just ran another rag over the coils in the opposite direction to open them up but without any success please help me with tips to open 'em back also you mentioned the condenser i hope i didn't screw that one up too all i did was to take the filter out i do know how to clean that one and like i said ran a rag over the coils i certainly hope i didn't accidentally touch or mess with the condenser thanks again you are welcome i modified my last post putting in some more details the evaporator is inside and the condenser is the unit outside a fin comb would likely be a good thing to try i frankly didn't know such a thing existed i have spent hours with a toothpick working on coils where i had hit it with a weed whacker if you have trouble finding a fin comb i suggest that you contact an hvac supply house some will sell to individuals you might check to see if they have a spray on solution for coil cleaning be sure your condensate drain is open water drain from the evaporator gunk from cleaning could cause problems and they stop up anyway Thermal power station Air conditioning Incandescent light bulb Mattress Magnet Furnace Carburetor Soldering Heinkel He 100 Microphone Bong Textile manufacturing Heat exchanger Opportunity rover Electric motor HVAC Ocean thermal energy conversion Tesla coil Gas absorption refrigerator Dialysis Toilet paper Fossil fuel power plant Social rule Hard disk Fire fighting Swamp cooler E85 Laserdisc Solar power Phase (matter) Apollo 13 Violin Hey Jude Brewery Snooker Instant coffee Hydrogen vehicle Dry cleaning M16 (rifle) Poker jargon Blood on the Tracks Newcomen steam engine Naval mine Roswell UFO incident Black hole Tai shogi Frogman Operation Market Garden Steam engine Water Circuit design Thermostat Cannabis cultivation Glossary of firefighting equipment Refrigerator 2000 Australian Grand Prix USS Yorktown (CV-5) Kasparov versus The World 1957 World Series Dairy Spark plug Irrigation Electrophysiology Collision detection Coil (band) Ladder logic Upholstery Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Ecco the Dolphin Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Battery (electricity) Ammonite Obsessive-compulsive disorder Mercury (element) Sento Color Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Nuclear fallout One Tree Hill (TV series) Solar system Motor oil Inertial guidance system Cubic zirconia Diode Water purification The Amber Spyglass Iron Full Metal Panic?
