there is black 'stuff' on my deck that sort of follows the wood grain line could this be mold i have used the armor deck cleaner on it and it did not wash off it can be scrubbed off but it is on much but not all of my sq ft deck and the steps what can i do about this i am repainting the deck tomorrow so i have to have it all clean today so it will be dry tomorrow it was just painted years ago but i am wondering if the man who did it made sure it was completely dry he used a very expensive deck paint that was supposed to last years and the employee at sherwin williams said he'd never seen that paint fail before now yeah i hate setting those kinds of records first a question for you if the guy who did it said it would last for five years why isn't he refinishing the deck anyway mix up a c water c laundry bleach and tablespoons dish detergent scrub this solution into some of the black spots don't be stingy and let it sit for minutes then rinse if it's mold or mildew the stain will come off or at least really really lighten and here's the rest of the story from an answer i previously posted clean the deck thoroughly use a liquid laundry detergent it has non bleach additives that'll clean the wood better than just soap water solution of one cup laundry detergent to one gallon of warm water broom the solution onto the deck wood let sit for minutes and then rinse rinse rinse try to do the cleaning early in the day when the deck is in shade if there are any mold mildew stains treat them w a bleach water solution after cleaning the rest of the deck area per above instruction if this doesn't work use a tsp trisodium phosphate solution of one cup tsp one cup household bleach and one gallon water broom solution onto deck wait minutes then scrub rinse the solution off with a broom then let the wood dry i can't stress the rinsing drying too much applying anything over detergenty and or damp wood will reduce it's staying power by about oh say to refinish the deck decide if a wood stain or paint is preferred if the wood isn't terrific paint it use an exterior paint made for decks or a marine grade deck paint for safety's sake consider adding an anti slip agent to the paint paints will typically require at least two coats if the deck is made of good to great grained wood a penetrating stain is usually preferable you can choose a natural wood stain or a colored stain you can get away w one coat of stain but it'll last longer and look tons better if you use two coats no matter what you choose for the deck's finish it must have the following three characteristics else you're gonna be doing this job every year the stain paint has to be water repellent or water proof not just water resistant the stain paint has to have uv ultraviolet protection the paint stain should contain a mildewicide if it doesn't you can buy a mildewicide separately and add it to the stain paint if there's trees shrubbery overhanging the deck consider cutting it back to avoid water dripping onto the deck while also allowing sun to get to the deck do allllllllllllllll of this and the deck should be good to go for at least three years and upwards of five hope this helps tx griff Upholstery Laundry detergent Textile manufacturing Casting Dry cleaning Paint Trisodium phosphate Car washing techniques Hydrogen peroxide Dishwasher Soap Vinegar Menstrual cup Water purification Staining (biology) Fire extinguisher Detergent Seismic retrofit Japanese tea ceremony Laundry Wok Plastic Washing machine Sento Sodium hypochlorite Psoriasis Dairy Manicure Hamster Mattress Poker jargon Soap bubble Dinghy Sulfuric acid Hard water Sewage treatment Sterilization (microbiology) Wood Bong Wood carving Western blot Coffee Motor oil Solar power Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hand washing Violin Diaper Shampoo Woodworking Bread Dialysis Lionel Corporation Air pollution Primer (paint) Volleyball Drill bit Cooking weights and measures Gypsy moth Wood pulp Carpet Strap-on dildo Kosher foods Carbon dioxide Microeconomics Electrophysiology Theory of conduct Extreme Programming Gram staining Body piercing Plating Agarose gel electrophoresis Cheese Sodium percarbonate Rice Pottery Gas metal arc welding Vanilla Wind turbine Contact lens Tooth enamel Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game Explosive material Brush The Human Stain Disinfection Alcohol fuel Fire fighting Hemp Citric acid Diamond enhancement
