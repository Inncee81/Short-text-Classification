what can i add to latex paint to make it adhere better when i paint steel barrels i clean and wire brush them and wipe off any dust or dirt the paint will not adhere well for more than months the paint will blister peel and chip easily i have to repaint every year i need something to add for better adherence i know a few years ago there was a additive available thru the paint stores but today no one seems to know about any additives please help thank you the problem is not the paint the problem i think and in my opinion is that you are not using a primer the chemical aspects of the primer are numerous the top reasons to use a primer is that it will not stick immediately if there is a presence of oil and acts as a adhesive for the paint if that is the problem along with rust try navel jelly the navy uses it to paint their ships and address rust issues you can get this product at most ace stores or lowes or home depot or true value stores when using the primer it will act as a bonding agent for the primer and chemically bond the paint to the metal using the primer as the catalyst good luck jim Paint Primer (paint) Epoxy Plastic Knife Explosive material Cartridge (firearms) Handloading Aluminium Internal ballistics Hydrochloric acid Organic peroxide Painter and decorator Titanium Stainless steel Welding Hand grenade Ammonium nitrate Lionel Corporation Adhesive Polymerase chain reaction Bulk vending Mattress Springfield 1903 rifle Energy development Steel Printed circuit board Acne Ammonia Union Pacific Railroad Hydrogen economy Poker jargon Iron Firearm Drill bit GoldenEye Pottery Motor oil Upholstery Fire extinguisher Fuel injection Carburetor Friction Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Violin Brush Money Carbon nanotube Casting Tin Gesso Lead paint Fire 64-bit Loudspeaker Hydrogen vehicle Industrial wastewater treatment Carbon dioxide Technetium Tattoo Computer Sulfuric acid Olive oil Wok Food preservation Bullet Gas metal arc welding Manicure IPod Raney nickel Soldering Mercury (element) Plame affair Benzene Soap Paint stripper Rifle Gasoline Haloalkane Alcohol fuel Cast iron Galvanization Gun safety CPU cache PlayStation 2 Adhesion Enzyme Redox Gilding Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Primer (molecular biology) Rust Pennsylvania Vermicompost Hard disk Manganese
