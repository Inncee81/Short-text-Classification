if we get a new hvac can it use the freon pipe of the old one our three bedroom house is built on a concrete slab and the pipes go through it that makes it very hard to replace pipes if we replace the hvac central unit and outside unit will they most likely use the old pipe how likely is that to be a good option if we do it that way how much is it likely to cost the cost of the new central unit the new outside unit and the labor the a c is electric and the heat is gas we wouldn't mind converting to all electric because our electricity is cheaper than our gas but if we did that would it have any effect on what pipes are needed the present system is years old and doesn't do a very good job of air conditioning the piping between the condensor compressor and the evapourator are usually designed for the matched set this is a question to ask the companies you get estimates from it may affect the warranty there is no real way to know the condition of the pipes in the slab they may last for another years or fail the day after the new a c unit is installed i do not think any company will guarantee the existing piping is your house insulated well enough for electric heat does your electric service have the capacity if you are located in canada or the united states northern states you will require at least a amp volt electric service do you have an attic if you do does it have an access door if it has an access door the piping and wiring can be routed through the attic here is some things to ponder when hiring contractors selecting contractors do this for each job required hvac and electric service if one contractor will be doing both make sure they have qualified hvac techs and qualified electrician and the qualified trades persons will be the ones doing the work look up local contractors first work out form the closest to your location if some you trust has had work done similar to yours ask them about the contractor they used if they were completely satisfied with their contractor s ask for their telephone number select at least your are interested in giving you an estimate do a google yahoo search on each of the contractors you are interested in look for praises check who is writing the praises to see if they have any connection to the contractor scam artists and coffident persons often work in groups google yahoo search the people giving the praise or references when you are satisfied with at least contractors have the give you written estimates with details of work to be done terms guarantee s cost of extras how much do they charge if they find something not covered by the contract paymant schedules if necessary make sure they are fully licenced and insured and whatever else you can think of to protect yourself if the contractor tries to pressure you into signing the contract immediately with a high deposit more than reject that contractor be careful high pressure can be someone who sounds very convincing but has many reasons why you should sign on the dotted line now it is always good to have another adult with you when a contractor inspects the work to be done if you do not get at least written estimates signed by the contractor not you do not sign yet go back to do this until you have selected at least contractors read over the estimates and have someone check the who has some knowledge of this type of work this may take longer than you thought do not rush into it research resaerch research helps then make your decision when you are more informed good luck Electrical wiring Air conditioning HVAC Solar power Contract
