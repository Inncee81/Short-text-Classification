washing machine broken my washing machine won't spin or drain water out now we can't even get it to agitate by hand we drained the water out by taking the drain hose off and held it down into a bucket any ideas on what we need to do to repair it just wanted to add husband says the belt is still good your problem is most likely the lid closed switch if the lid is open it will fill but not agitate or drain if this switch is broken the machine thinks the lid is open i have rentals and have seen this often because tennants dont care and slam the lid down on the washing machine one time i discovered they had been intimate on the washing machine and it broke the switch this is not hard to fix and a parts house will have this part because i have bought them before for different brands if the belt is ok and it wont spin or drain this is your problem Textile manufacturing Washing machine Fire fighting Robot Wars RuneScape Mini-Games Phonograph cylinder Enigma machine Dairy Pinball Happy Tree Friends Table tennis Laundry Philosophy of space and time Rotor machine Dishwasher Thermal power station Siphon Bong World Championship Wrestling Dry cleaning Houseplant Japanese toilet Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Cruising (maritime) Windows XP Fujian tea ceremony Dialysis Sento Digital circuit Beer Pong Professional wrestling match types Toilet paper Customs and etiquette of Japan Electrophysiology Menstrual cup RuneScape quests Poker jargon Paintball marker Tractor Atomic Kitten Dishwashing Coriolis effect Black hole Industrial Revolution Hash table Rose (Doctor Who) Wheel of Fortune Car washing techniques Domestic water system Kurt Angle Lathe Laundry detergent Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Weaving Toilet Fire hydrant Sears Holdings Corporation Bj__rn Borg Biuro Szyfr__w Casting Traumatic brain injury Agar plate The Championships, Wimbledon Tire Chris Benoit Polymerase chain reaction Water wheel Hydraulic machinery Roger Federer Bulk vending Professional wrestling holds Garbage disposal Motorcycle The Price Is Right Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Time travel Kevin and Kell Slot machine Switch Tea Grand Slam (tennis) War of the Worlds (2005 film) GunBound Toilet humour Futurama (TV series - season 5) M60 machine gun Tenshinhan Champagne (beverage) Home repair Electrical generator The Time Machine The Matrix Revolutions 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain Maceration (bone) GunZ The Duel Characters in the Smurfs Priesthood (Mormonism) Pringles
