is there any way to get my bathtub plug out hey everyone i have been trying to figure this out for the longest time our bathtub in the house is running very slow and we cant get in there to clean it out or anything because we have what looks like a built in metal plug stopper whatever its called all we can do is pop it up about a centimeter to let the water out but we cant actually remove it i have tried twisting it and pulling it every way i can think of is there anything that can be done hi cassien what you have is called a captive plug the reason you can't get it out is that it is retained by a nut underneath as you are turning the plug the nut is turning with it so you could carry on 'till domesday and nothing would happen you need to take off the side panel of the bath to get access to the waste pipe unscrew the trap remove the waste fitting complete replace it with a normal waste outlet normally inch half obtainable at places like b q or other diy stores watch your back when you are crawling under the bath good luck Sento Domestic water system Spark plug Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Japanese toilet Tire Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Bong BS 1363 Textile manufacturing Carburetor Thermal power station Stairway Professional wrestling holds Reading spark plugs for racing Samovar Tag Butterfly stroke Tobacco Energy development Hamster Flush toilet Dairy Residual-current device Customs and etiquette of Japan Screw View camera Saw II Climbing equipment Ammunition Diving Poker jargon Punt (boat) Drill bit The Inside Universal Serial Bus Breaststroke Dialysis Basement Brazing Columbine High School massacre Enigma machine Plumbing fixture Kitchen Backstroke Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Toilet Masturbation Apollo Command/Service Module Drag racing Irrigation Heinkel He 100 Earring Glossary of firefighting equipment Professional wrestling throws Firefighter Internal ballistics USB flash drive Caving Hydraulic machinery Carbon dioxide Dog agility Vacuum cleaner Solar cell Coriolis effect Distribution board Eifel Aqueduct Hard water Bathing Swingout Menstrual cup Novelty (locomotive) Fossil fuel power plant Computer virus Solar power S-mine Fast bowling Guqin Bathroom Computer forensics Glossary of climbing terms Bournemouth Membrane potential Sydney Harbour Bridge Comanche Rigging Fuse (electrical) Sewer Dundas Square Ethernet SCART Front crawl Futurama (TV series - season 5) Fountain pen Glacier Naval mine
