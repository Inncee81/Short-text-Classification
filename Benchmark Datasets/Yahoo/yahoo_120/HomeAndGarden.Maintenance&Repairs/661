is there any way i fix my ac power cord that my dog chewed on my dog chewed a few litte holes in it u can see the wires that is in it the cord goes to my laptop and it loses connection alot what can i use to fix this the idea is to make the electricity make a complete circuit to the laptop and back those holes where you can see the wires need to be repaired if for no other reason than to avoid getting shocked if the holes are very small and the wires don't appear to be damaged you can wrap black electrician's tape tightly around it to fix the holes if you suspect the wires are damaged you'll need to repair or replace the wire repair means cut the bad part out and reconnect the ends making sure you match the colors and that the wires are tightly twisted together and taped might be worth it to just replace the wire if it's badly damaged Electrical wiring Wire wrap Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Knife Wire Transformer Drill bit Printed circuit board Laptop Jack plug Tire IPod Electrician Tesla coil D-subminiature Climbing equipment Naval mine PCB layout guidelines Stopping power BS 1363 Circuit design National Electrical Code (US) Fuse (electrical) Residual-current device Transistor Aluminium Electrical wiring (UK) Computer forensics Lineman (occupation) Spark plug Seismic retrofit Poker jargon Overhead lines Textile manufacturing terminology Welding Barbed wire Fancy rat Solar cell Thermostat Impedance matching Punch card Potentiometer Floppy disk Sound recording Power cable Liquid crystal display Universal Serial Bus Ground and neutral Computer bus Antenna (radio) Electric motor Three-phase electric power Ethernet Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Veroboard Key punch Screw Chewing gum Digital circuit Color Electrical generator Bassoon Professional wrestling match types Surveillance Switch Action potential Trapping Dog agility Overhead powerline Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Oscilloscope Hamster Inertial guidance system Tooth Dimmer Resistor Seismometer Geomagnetic storm Babe Ruth Galileo spacecraft Point-to-point construction Extension Cord Harp Ring circuit Enigma machine Computer Blasting cap Guitar Magnet Tobacco Internal ballistics Windows XP Hearing aid Disc brake Ferret Telephone Battery (electricity) Atari 8-bit family Loudspeaker
