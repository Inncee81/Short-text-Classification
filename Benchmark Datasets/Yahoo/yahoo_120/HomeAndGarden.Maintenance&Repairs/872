toliet why won't it stop running i know it sound like not much of a problem and it hasn't been but tonight my yr old son put to much tp in it and i wasn't paying attention to the noise cuz of the washer and flooded our bathroom not so good so this is a top problem now does anyone know how to fix this lol hopefully the plugged toilet was just too much tp and not a toy jammed somewhere in the toilet drain or trap the problem of the toilet running all the time is probably one of four things the water pressure is too high and forces the ballcock flush valve to open periodically water is coming up over the overflow tube because it is too short has slipped down or the float is damaged or not adjusted properly and not shutting off the flush valve and letting too much water refill the tank the tank ball flapper is not seating properly the flush valve is damaged or leaking and is not shutting off when the tank is full the most likely problem is either or so i will start with them a website like http www toiletology com can provide diagrams and instructions on how to address these and various other toilet issues the least expensive repair is to replace the flapper you can look at the flapper and see if it is torn or rotted and replace it if it is if the flapper looks o k but water level in the tank drops slowly and you hear the flush valve open and let more water in the tank then the flapper isn't sealing if the seat the one under the flapper at the bottom of the tank feels smooth then the flapper may be damaged or become hard with age and should be replaced if the seat is rough or damaged then it needs to be replaced if the water level in the tank slowly rises even though the float stops rising and water goes over the overflow tube then the flush valve may not be closing off the water flow and it needs to be replaced there are repair kits for some flush valve assemblies but it's usually easier to just replace the whole assembly another possible cause if the tank doesn't stop filling and water goes into the overflow tube is either because the float ball is damaged and not floating well or sinks or it is not adjusted correctly keeps on rising and not shutting off the water flow at the right time if the water level in the tank is about the same as it usually is usually there are stains on the tank wall that show where the usual water level is but the water goes into the overflow tube then the tube may have slipped down or broken off and needs to be replaced finally chances are the water pressure isn't too high unless something has happened with the municipal water supply or your pump if on a well again this is rare so if it appears to be the problem then i would recheck the other possible problems before i called a plumber or the water supplier this answer is pretty long but hopefully something here proves helpful again checkout the website http www toiletology com for lots of good toilet tips and repair instructions Siphon Thermal power station Plumbing fixture Rebreather Vacuum tube Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Seismic retrofit Sewage treatment Urinary incontinence Poker jargon Naval mine Home repair Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Hydraulic machinery Tire Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Japanese toilet Toilet humour Bong Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Autonomous building Urinal Electrophysiology Toilet Diving regulator Brewery Trombone USS Tunny (SS-282) E85 Scuba set Spark plug Steam engine Irrigation Menstrual cup Thermostat Domestic water system Cruising (maritime) Motorcycle Space shuttle main engine Combine (Half-Life 2) Dam Fast bowling Carnivorous plant Fecal incontinence Strap-on dildo USS Albacore (SS-218) Condom CPU cache Dialysis Toilet paper Diesel engine Shaggy dog story Equine conformation Safety engineering Drill bit Trumpet Panama Canal Diving suit Programmable logic controller Oscilloscope Tank Four-stroke cycle Pump M16 (rifle) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Turbocharger Three Mile Island Heinkel He 100 Team Fortress Classic Basement Novelty (locomotive) Autogyro PID controller Eye Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Fire fighting Tap (valve) Glossary of firefighting equipment Water hammer USS Yorktown (CV-5) Diving Central processing unit Tampon B-47 Stratojet Fuel injection Buffer overflow Soldering Indianapolis 500 Heart valve Gasoline USS Trigger (SS-237) Diving cylinder
