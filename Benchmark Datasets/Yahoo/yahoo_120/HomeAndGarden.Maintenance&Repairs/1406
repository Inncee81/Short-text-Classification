window a c loud squealing noise we have a large kenmore window a c in our living room it has worked fine over the past summers however a few days ago it started making a god awful squealing noise the unit fan still blows strong and still blows cold but the loud squealing noise in too much to deal with not to mention at night it is very loud and i know it must be echoing down the street and disturbing everyone around we try to turn it off when it starts making the noise but with temps pushing degrees and this being an older home it gets unbearably hot in the house the sound is similar to metal scraping on metal when you turn on the unit it might not make the sound but sometimes does for a while it will not but then it reappears it goes from a short scrape squeal every seconds or so to a constant one that just forces us to shut it off i would like it if someone could provide me with possible problems this may be and how hard or expensive it is to fix ps tried wd already didnt change anything hope you have some mechanical and electrical experience start by removing the cover and visualy looking for anything rubbing look close at both fan blades if you don't see anything turn the unit on fan and listen to try to locate the problem you probably have a fan blade rubbing may be a bad bearing on one or both sides of the fan motor could be something else too but the problems i mentioned are the most likely causes be aware that the capacitor s can deliver a nasty shock even when the unit is unplugged Electric motor Jet engine Thermal power station Drill bit Axial compressor Sound effect Knife Explosive material Helicopter Gramophone record Loudspeaker Time Out of Mind Solar power Microphone Fan (implement) Nirvana (band) Internal ballistics Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Capacitor Circuit design Transformer Equine conformation Naval mine Propeller Mouse (computing) Roxette Carburetor Radar Babe Ruth Sound Rail tracks The Legend of Zelda series enemies Sub-Zero Combine (Half-Life 2) Jam (TV series) Bong Decibel Memorial Stadium, Clemson Movie projector Electronic amplifier Sin City Wind turbine Drag racing Gothic rock Piano Rose (Doctor Who) Hard disk Grunge music Indianapolis 500 Hearing impairment Lawn mower Action potential Electrophysiology KISS (band) Eggerland series Gilding Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sound recording Alanis Morissette Heavy metal music John Cage Mercury Atlas 6 Turbofan Table saw Haloalkane Dishwasher Welding Professional wrestling slang PID controller Tesla coil Vacuum Prank flash The Ashlee Simpson Show Bicycle brake systems Judas Priest SR-71 Blackbird Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Wind power Motor oil Green Line (MBTA) Steam engine Acoustics Renewable energy Impedance matching Capacitor plague Sento Railgun Audiophile Full Metal Panic?
