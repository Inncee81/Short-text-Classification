mastercool evaporative coolers i have two mastercoool units atop the roof of my year old house these things are a constant problem on one unit the pulley set screw keeps backing off and when it is off the pulley no longer turns the shaft the other unit has a lot of mineral buildup in the water holes that feed the cooling pads on that unit it seems to make a lot of noise like vibrating noises other unit is quiet when it runs belts are new and everything seems to be in order i do notice on the noisy unit if you have one of the sheet metal panels off to work on the inside mechanics the unit becomes quiet so i assume it is a vibration of some sort on one of these panels ideas to fix the set screw drill a small hole into the shaft and then put a new larger set screw into that hole if it still loosens use some locktite on the screw the vibration may be because the unit was not installed perfectly level Drill bit Screw Drill Carburetor Fan (implement) Lathe Wind turbine Propeller Tire Elevator Motorcycle Internal ballistics Thermal power station Transformer Timpani Glossary of firefighting equipment Swamp cooler Motor oil Pile Glossary of climbing terms Welding Lathe (metal) Printed circuit board Seismic retrofit Microphone Mercury 4 Floppy disk Bong Spark plug Mechanical advantage Screwdriver Portsmouth Block Mills Renewable energy Thermostat Strap-on dildo Helicopter Table saw Chevrolet Corvair engine Crane (machine) Jet engine Screw thread Solar power Guitar Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Cruising (maritime) Loudspeaker Continuously variable transmission Window Hydraulic machinery Wire wrap Balance shaft Woodworking Brewery Electric motor The Dalek Invasion of Earth Violin Fuse (electrical) Overhead lines Floyd Rose Great Pyramid of Giza Gravity Wind power Internal combustion engine Vise (tool) Gas compressor Amateur telescope making Tractor Electrical wiring Incandescent light bulb Diving regulator Combine harvester Vacuum Piccolo Junior Saga Stirling engine Combine (Half-Life 2) Irrigation Dither Gear ratio Textile manufacturing Microeconomics Oral sex Suppressor Turbocharger Energy development Temperature Wankel engine Metalworking Car handling Aluminium Mattress Casting Electrical generator USS Sea Dog (SS-401) Diesel engine Battle of Lissa (1866) Mouse (computing) Rail tracks
