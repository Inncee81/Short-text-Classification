is it better to leave an immersion heater on or use it only when needed we have a heater for hot water do we use more electricity by letting it top up the heat or by switching off and switching on each morning do as anthony said if you leave it on you will have a constant supply of hot water the thermostat will then decide when to turn the electric on and off usually about mins every hours if you switch on only when you need water you will have to heat from cold which takes about to hours each time also turn thermostat down about ten degrees to save a small amount of money Thermostat Apollo 13 Heat Solar power HVAC Refrigerator Autonomous building Ironing Fossil fuel power plant Water heater Energy development Solar panel Process control Slow cooker Bi-metal Samovar Hot air balloon Diesel engine Thermal power station Energy Coffee Carburetor Renewable energy Transformer Welding Electricity meter Spacecraft propulsion Gas metal arc welding Hysteresis Temperature Peltier-Seebeck effect Radiator Explosive material Daylight saving time Environmental concerns with electricity generation Aquarium Carbon dioxide Incandescent light bulb Fire fighting Oscilloscope Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Wind power Rail terminology Vacuum tube Sauna Fusion power Stove Cold fusion Gas absorption refrigerator Scuba set Alcohol fuel Water Steam engine Elevator Dialysis Thermocouple Torpedo Cruising (maritime) Green-Kubo relations Electronic amplifier Deep lake water cooling Venus Hydropower Electric motor Washing machine Personal rapid transit Heat capacity Thermistor Mercury Atlas 6 Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Apollo Command/Service Module Town gas Rice cooker CPU design Waterbed Transistor Water (molecule) Professional wrestling slang Bathing Heating element Plasma (physics) Embedded system Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Ocean thermal energy conversion Axial compressor Bread Three-phase electric power Air conditioning Phase change heat pump Equation of time Thermoregulation Internal combustion engine Central processing unit Water supply Fuel cell Marine aquarium Negative feedback Wire wrap
