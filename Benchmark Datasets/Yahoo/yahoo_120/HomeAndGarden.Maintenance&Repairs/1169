what does a water softener do month after month i dump bags of salt into our water softner i started to wonder a where does all that salt go and are we consuming it b where do all the minerals go that are supposedly removed to soften the water c why does soft water always leave you feel like you cannot get the soap off the salt you add is for you cation exchange column hardness in the water is due to minerals calcium and magnesium in your water with hard water you need to use more soap to clean your clothes dishes etc it also leaves a residue on sinks tubs dishes glasses your clothes and in your water heater cation exchange works on a give an take the salt dissolves and sodium na ions attach themselves to little beads in your resin bed cation exchange column as your hard water flows through the bed the calcium ca and magnesium mg ions push the sodium ions off the beads the resin prefers ca and mg ions once most of the sodium is replaced with calcium and magnesium the bed needs to regenerated usually established by a timer during regeneration the bed is flushed with concentrated salt water and sodium ions push the ca and mg ions off the beads the ca and mg ions are released as waste water usually this water goes to the sewer with your other waste water sometimes it discharges to peoples yard which is not preferred since the concentrated hardness can damage your plants or grass as for your last question if you feel like you can't get the soap off you might want to get your system checked since that is usually a result of hard water it sounds like your exchange system might need new resin or perhaps you need to adjust your regeneration schedule Water purification Ion exchange resin Hydrochloric acid Soil pH Water (molecule) Thermal power station Salt Sewage treatment Soap Sodium chloride Sodium sulfate Industrial wastewater treatment Citric acid Sulfuric acid Tofu Sodium Sodium carbonate Mineral Chromatography Aluminium Electrolyte Sulfur Pyroxene Dialysis Corrosion Dead Sea Action potential Water Magnesium Carbon dioxide Edible salt Mattress Chlorine Casting Weathering Base (chemistry) Ion selective electrode Hydrogen chloride Membrane potential Hamster Brewery Fluoride Resin Nuclear power Ion Fossil fuel power plant Soldering Ammonia Sodium hydroxide Laundry detergent Fire extinguisher Autonomous building Potassium Dry cleaning Illegal drug trade Rebreather Fecal incontinence Lithium Sea water Textile manufacturing Glycerin Hardpan Japanese toilet Montmorillonite Leblanc process Alcohol Cannabis cultivation Haloalkane Electrophysiology Hydroponics Flue gas desulfurization Desert Nuclear reactor Acid mine drainage Kidney Urine Milk Systematic name Bong Cyanide Calcium Alum Steel Strap-on dildo Sodium percarbonate Alkane Borax Acetic acid Caliche Calcium chloride Ammonium Dairy Garnet Glass
