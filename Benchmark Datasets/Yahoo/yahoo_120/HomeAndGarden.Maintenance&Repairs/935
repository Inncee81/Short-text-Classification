no cold air in the house came home from work last night it was hot in the house blower was on thermostat works no blown fuse switched off and on the breakers no clogged air filter replaced anyways compressor tries to turn on but doens't am i just low or out of freon if the compressor attempts to start but just hums the starting capacitor is likely defective capacitors are not all that expensive this is the least cost way to check your compressor turn off the power at the circuit breaker and remove the capacitor mark the wires if there is more than take the capacitor to a heating supply and purchase a new one replace and turn on the circuit breaker if the compressor runs you have fixed the problem if the compressor still just hums it could be the compressor relay or the compressor have a reputable qualified hvac service technician repair it good luck Thermostat Capacitor Circuit design Circuit breaker Air conditioning Transformer Capacitor plague Electric motor Axial compressor Supercharger Vacuum tube Turbocharger Fluorescent lamp HVAC Relay Carburetor Residual-current device Solar power Switched-mode power supply Oscilloscope Refrigerator Switch Thermal power station X10 (industry standard) Cray-1 Three-phase electric power Fan (implement) Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Incandescent light bulb Autonomous building Heinkel He 100 Welding Turbojet Tesla coil Dodge Neon Printed circuit board Apollo 13 Low-pass filter BS 1363 Computer Electrical breakdown Furnace Audiophile Hydrogen economy Gas turbine Nonblocking minimal spanning switch Logic gate Haloalkane Energy development Diving cylinder Static inverter plant Phase change heat pump Alternating current Spark plug Swamp cooler SR-71 Blackbird Transistor Frank Whittle History of computing hardware Two-stroke cycle PCB layout guidelines Ocean thermal energy conversion Central processing unit High-voltage direct current Breathing gas MRAM Digital circuit Soldering Control system Diesel engine Gliding R46 (New York City Subway car) Power factor correction Operational amplifier Embedded system Hall effect Turbofan Integrated circuit Ford Ranger EV Diode Power strip Motor oil Spark gap Battery (electricity) Diving air compressor Electric power transmission Gas turbine-electric locomotive Transmitter Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Phase-locked loop Armored Core Bass guitar Wind power Stirling engine
