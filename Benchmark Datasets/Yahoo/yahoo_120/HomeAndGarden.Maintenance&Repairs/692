how to remove stubborn screw in heater element on electric water heater i've tried removing it with the usually screwdriver socket combo using a screwdriver on both sides like a t handle and it still wont budge i went through this a few months ago and actually broke the end of the element trying to get it off with a plumbers wrench that also had the t handle lol i ended up having to order a new element from sears online and when it arrived a few days later i was surprised to see on a list of recommended parts a tool made for removing the element i would suggest that you try your local plumbing supply for the right tool and you should probably spray the old element with some penetrating oil i am sure you have drained the water heater already if you are trying to remove the element Screw Wrench BS 1363 Socket Thermal power station Screwdriver Domestic water system Drill bit Home repair Autonomous building Glossary of firefighting equipment Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Knife Drill Tap wrench Motor oil Genericized trademark Fountain Samovar Soldering Refrigerator Thermostat Siphon 1973 oil crisis D-subminiature Drill bit shank Vacuum tube Seismic retrofit Toilet paper Apollo 13 Dialysis Fuse (electrical) Basement Casting Fire fighting Water heater Tool Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Planet of the Daleks Anchor Dundas Square Floyd Rose Sonic screwdriver Pliers Dishwasher Woodworking Manicure Marine aquarium Diesel engine Water supply Furnace Solar power Metalworking HVAC M16 (rifle) Fossil fuel power plant Fan (implement) Tamper resistance Aquarium Burma Campaign Iron Bolted joint Washing machine Fire extinguisher Plumbing fixture Smoke-screen Dollar store Transistor Sulfuric acid Radiator Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Oscilloscope Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans National Electrical Code (US) Sears Holdings Corporation Fire hydrant Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Python programming language Windows XP USS Wichita (CA-45) Injection moulding Just In Time Chevrolet Corvair Swiss Army knife Torque wrench Hard water Pinball Vise (tool) Town gas Cruising (maritime) Ammunition Tunisia Campaign Bathroom Mosquito Carbon dioxide Hydrochloric acid Stage lighting Electricity meter Glossary of firefighting terms
