how can i tell how many hours per day my fridge runs i want to verify the power bill and check the house for leaks i don't know how good you are at working with electricity but here is an idea find the compressor motor and look at the wiring take an electric clock and cut the plug off of it wire the hot wire to the hot leg of the clock and tie the neutrals together set the clock to then when the motor starts running the time on the clock will move after hours take a reading on the clock then you will know the total time that the fridge ran if you aren't familiar with working with electricity then don't try this good luck Residual-current device Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Electric motor Electricity meter Refrigerator Thermostat Spark plug Split phase Daylight saving time Computer bus Cray-1 STS-61 Reading spark plugs for racing Auto racing Central processing unit Magnetic field Elevator Axial compressor Rail terminology Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina RISC Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Toyota Prius Carburetor Alternating current Air conditioning Incandescent light bulb Vacuum tube Clock Fuel cell Time dilation Solar power Internal combustion engine Bombe Stirling engine Galileo spacecraft Baroque chess Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest USS S-37 (SS-142) Fan (implement) USS Tunny (SS-282) Frank Whittle Overhead lines Computer CPU design Perpetual motion Railway electrification system The Amazing Race Digital circuit 24-hour clock Diesel engine Mains electricity Hour Sundial Enigma machine National Electrical Code (US) Apollo 13 Equation of time Electric power Billboard Hot 100 Cruising (maritime) Honda B engine Ethernet Apollo Guidance Computer X10 (industry standard) Hydraulic machinery Wire wrap Digital Visual Interface Game clock Jet engine Paintball Gas compressor Ground and neutral Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Polyphase system RS-232 Electrical wiring (UK) Electrical generator Single-phase electric power Welding SMPTE time code Marian Rejewski Ground (electricity) Tire Advanced Technology Attachment Cable car (railway) New York Giants Lawn mower Railway signal Termina Hydrogen economy Ice hockey Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Automobile self starter CPU cache BS 1363 Baseball Battery electric vehicle
