should the level of water in my septic tank rise when it rains a lot we've been having problems with our septic tank filling and backing into the basement we found a toilet that had been leaking for months and once we turned the toilet off and conserved water the water level in the septic tank went back to normal for the past month my husband and i have only let water from flushing the toilets and from the dishwasher which i only run once week go down the drain everything else bathwater kitchen sink washing machine we take outside in buckets to give the leach bed time to dry out in the past week we started letting some bathwater go down the drain and the tank didn't seem to have any problems with it then yesterday we had a series of storms that dropped about inches of rain when i checked the tank this morning the water level was of the way up the height of the inlet pipe is this normal or should i be concerned that something is clogged or that the water table is too high when this first happened june i did have a professional come out and look he pumped it jetted it and in days it was full again he did say after he jetted it the leach bed was taking water but he saw water coming in the tank when no one was home the leaking toilet we had the septic enforcement agency come out and look and she said our next step would be to cautiously dig around the tank and look for cracks but since the water level didn't rise again before today we thought the problem was fixed i hate to dig the whole tank up and inspect it if the problem is just a saturated drain field from the rain that's why i was just wondering if the water level going up after a lot of rain was normal also i do not have a sump pump no construction in the area and the reason i know the level is that there is an access pipe coming up from the tank where the pumper accesses the tank the water is not backing into the basement yet well you should have it pumped and checked to make sure that everything is ok we had the same problem and yes water from rain will go in there the problem is most likely what you said the leach fields are drenched and there is no where for the water to go if there has been some construction in your area or a bunch of trees were cut down this could be your problem as well the leach fields are being stripped away and are completely useless when there is not enough room for the water to go where it needs to we found that by planting a few trees in the yard and starting a small garden it helps tomatos love to live by a septic tank however you should have it checked to make sure that there are not cracks and that the places where the water leaves the tank are not clogged we are getting onto public sewers soon it is just becoming available to us so we are trying to make this tank last until they have the plant up and running because they will charge us to connect to the main lines good luck you should be able to let all of your water go out there so something is wrong and calling in a service man may be your best bet Autonomous building Thermal power station Basement Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Siphon Flush toilet Drainage Domestic water system Toilet paper Cruising (maritime) Sewer Toilet Irrigation Carburetor Dairy Kitchen Japanese toilet Poker jargon Home repair Dialysis Pit toilet Energy development Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans Bong Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Water purification USS Tunny (SS-282) E85 Water supply Sento CPU cache RuneScape Mini-Games The Fens Brewery Plumbing fixture Menstrual cup Urinary incontinence Operation Market Garden Zuiderzee Works Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Borehole Eutrophication Betting (poker) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jet engine Chatsworth House USS Trigger (SS-237) Carbon dioxide Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Dishwasher Wildfire Elis Prefecture Transformer Las Vegas metropolitan area RuneScape quests Glossary of firefighting terms 2003 North America blackout Naval mine Hydroponics Nuclear power Hamster King City, Ontario The Star Wars Holiday Special Sewage collection and disposal Toilet humour Sin City Hydrogen economy Three Mile Island Married... with Children Draw poker Chernobyl accident 2005 Maharashtra floods Composting toilet 2005 Atlantic hurricane season Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Opportunity rover Fossil fuel power plant Lake Burley Griffin Eifel Aqueduct Vacuum Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 USS S-35 (SS-140) Blood on the Tracks Tobacco Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Dam Desert USS Aylwin (DD-355)
