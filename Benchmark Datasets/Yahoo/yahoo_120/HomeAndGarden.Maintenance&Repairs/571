can i connect copper wire to my metal wire to continue an electrical current on my pasture fencing the wire on your pasturing fence will need to be insulated otherwise the current from the copper wire will ground out and trip the breaker are you trying to install an electrified fence to keep the cattle contained this requires a special transformer it should not be done with home current as you might kill yourself or someone else if you are just trying to patch a broken link in the existing line dissimilar metals that have current flowing through them create a condition called electrolysis it corrodes the metals and they build up resistance to electromotive transfer Electrical wiring Ground and neutral Spark plug Aluminium Transformer Circuit design Circuit breaker Overhead lines Earthing system Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Battery (electricity) Welding Corrosion High-voltage direct current Solar power Antenna (radio) Barbed wire Resistor Residual-current device Conductor (material) Soldering Three-phase electric power Switch Alternating current Naval mine Ground (electricity) Peltier-Seebeck effect Printed circuit board Current (electricity) Inductor Hydrogen economy Relay Capacitor Seismic retrofit Integrated circuit Electric motor Lineman (occupation) Overhead powerline Short circuit Gas metal arc welding Vacuum tube Galvanic cell Volt Electrical element Electric power transmission Coaxial cable Electrical resistance Lightning rod Electrical generator MOSFET Electricity Electrophysiology Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Solar cell Electricity distribution Metallurgy National Electrical Code (US) BS 1363 Railway electrification system Copper Superconductivity Diode TGV Hall effect Agricultural fencing Heat Flux Telephone exchange Electrical breakdown Magnetism RS-232 Wardenclyffe Tower Gas tungsten arc welding Copper-based chips Ring circuit Ethernet Electromotive force Power cable Wind power Maxwell's equations Energy development Submarine communications cable Livestock Action potential Railgun Charles Wheatstone Skin effect High-voltage hazards Ceramics Anode Electromigration Rail transport modelling Coulometry Third rail Burglar alarm Impedance matching
