re starting an empty swimming pool we recently moved into a house that has an inground swimming pool the pool hasn't been used in about years we drained the pool and were looking to re open it with new water and equipment we don't really know anything about pools the pool is about ft deep at the deep end about how much do you think it would cost to open this pool for the remainder of the season and is it worth it well first things first some of the equipment might still be usable if your pool motor starts when you turn it on then it should be ok dont fix it if it aint broke new motor pump is probably going to cost you at least bucks without even considering size of the pump you need if you have a foot deep pool you might as well consider that you have thousand gallons of water check your filter if you have a diatomaceous earth filter or d e as it is known you will most likely want to replace the filter grid media as the nylon fabric is probably going to have holes throughout the fabric which means your water will not filter properly if you have a sand filter you are going to want to change the sand that sand is probably dirty to begin with and could have mold and or other growths in it from sitting for so long now the most important thing is this your inground pool is like a boat if you do not fill the pool with water you risk the pool floating on the groundwater in spring or fall etc i cant say definitively that this will happen but this is one reason why an inground pool is never completely drained for long periods of time if this does happen your pool could come up inches from your decking almost as if your pool decking has sunken around the pool and it might only happen on one end which means that you are going to have uneven water so if your pool only has a skimmer and its on the end that lifts and raises you could have plumbing problems and also that your pool on the lower end will probably need to be filled almost to the brim of the coping stones just to give your skimmer enough water to supply your pump being foot deep i would have to assume that there is a main drain in the bottom but i have seen them without on occasions now if your pool is empty and you have cleaned it out you wont get every little bit and cranny of debris out but if you have hosed it down and gotten rid of almost all the water in the deep end you can start filling it anytime if you have a main drain and you have a shut off for the skimmers in the pump area you can run the pool once y ou get about feet of water in the deep end and this way your water will filter as you fill it this will speed up the process of cleaning the water once your pool is filled open the skimmers and let the skimmers work as well after a day of running hours since you have had the water filtering with the main drain take a ounce soda bottle nad about elbows length with the bottle upside down with air filling the bottle turn the bottle over to fill make sure you rinse this bottle in the water a few times you dont want any soda contamination in your sample take this to your pool store and yes they are going to sell you every chemical you can think of but remember its new water and hasnt been treated for swimming pool use yet you are going to need lots of things to get it pool ready the advantage of doing all of this now is that when you open the pool in the spring unless you live in an area where you keep it open all year you wont have to do too much to balance the water just make sure that when you take your water sample in tell them its new water as the pool was empty so they can test for everything especially iron copper or manganese you dont want to add any chlorine to the water if these metals are present and once you get this done you should be good to go hope
