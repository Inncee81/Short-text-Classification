my electrical outlet was set too far in the wall are there any spacers i can get to bring it forward when i plug something in i have to physically hold on to the outlet because it moves in our son's room i was able to tighten up the screws that hold the actual plug in the box and it was fixed however i tried it in my kitchen and the plug ended up being flush with the wall itself instead of replacing box and repositioning it is there any such thing as spacers or washers i can safely use to bring the plug forward without replacing all yes the home centers carry different kinds get one that goes all the way around box extension or plastic ones are sturdy and a little safer turn off the power to the box and unscrew the receptacle feed it through the extension ring and put screws through the holes and screw it all back into the box turn the power back on and you're done don't forget the cover plate good luck Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Screw Drill bit BS 1363 Spark plug Motor oil Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Universal Serial Bus Carburetor Tire Professional wrestling throws Fuse (electrical) Clinker (boat building) Poker jargon Residual-current device Strap-on dildo Kitchen Floyd Rose Common electrical adaptors in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom National Electrical Code (US) Extension Cord Drill Distribution board Earring Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Seismic retrofit Solar power Japanese toilet Anchor Light switch Solar cell Upholstery Gender of connectors and fasteners Knife Ammunition Socket Brewery Thermal power station Sewage treatment Toilet IPod M60 machine gun Stove Professional wrestling holds Equine conformation Glossary of partner dance terms Cruising (maritime) Wire wrap Private branch exchange Fixed-gear bicycle Hydraulic machinery Piccolo Junior Saga Glossary of American football Enigma machine Ship Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program Power strip Electrical wiring (UK) RCA connector Skateboarding trick M16 (rifle) Wood carving Boxing Wrench Lathe Baroque chess Jack plug Armored Core Screwdriver Electrical wiring Backgammon Softball Baseball Harmonica Diving regulator Lighting Glass Table saw Flush toilet Transistor Box Motility Light-emitting diode D-subminiature Eggerland series Shaggy dog story Samovar Bolted joint Jumpstart 3rd Grade Basement Screw thread Computer case 1957 World Series Glossary of climbing terms Machine tapers Swingout Sail-plan Characters in the Smurfs
