how can you measure the electricity used in a single room and not the whole house there are devices available that can measure the electricity usage that you simply plug into the wall and then plug your lamp or appliance into the devise is called kill a watt it will then record the amount of energy used as well as allow you to calculate the current cost of electricity connect your appliances into the p kill a watt meter and assess how efficient they are the kill a watt features a large lcd display that counts consumption by the kilowatt hour just like utility companies kill a watt meter allows you to figure out your electrical expenses by the hour day week month even an entire year the kill a watt will monitor the quality of your power by displaying voltage line frequency and power factor Transformer Electricity meter Incandescent light bulb Wind power Solar cell Liquid crystal display Alternating current Light-emitting diode Solar power Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Power (physics) Volt Battery (electricity) Loudspeaker X10 (industry standard) Electric motor Electrical generator Vacuum tube Transmitter Circuit design Electric power transmission Wind turbine Audiophile Electric power Transistor Solar panel Three-phase electric power Decibel Power line communication High-voltage direct current Bicycle lighting Tesla coil Electronic amplifier Horsepower Electrical resistance Mains electricity Oscilloscope Laptop Fuel injection Diode Resistor Welding Nuclear power Universal Serial Bus Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Manitoba Hydro Compact fluorescent lamp Electricity distribution War of Currents Switched-mode power supply Digital circuit Gross domestic product Impedance George Westinghouse Wi-Fi Central processing unit Spacecraft propulsion Capacitor Energy development IMac Voltage source Hydropower Superconductivity Cathode ray tube Antenna (radio) Impedance matching Microphone Lighting Future energy development Digital-to-analog converter High-definition television Amateur radio CPU design AC power Electrodeless lamp Fuel cell Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Gas metal arc welding Konica Minolta Aluminium High-voltage hazards Spark plug Circuit breaker Hydroelectricity Gender of connectors and fasteners Phase-locked loop Electronics Air conditioning Power factor Energy conservation Television Wardenclyffe Tower Thermal power station
