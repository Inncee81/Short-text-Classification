a c draining water inside our air conditioner is clogged somewhere and it leaks water onto the carpet of our bedroom my husband won't be home until tomorrow to fix it is it safe to turn it on it's extrememly hot in here and just put towels down to catch the water until it's fixed it only leaks about a cup or two full of water i'm willing to clean up the mess in order to keep it cool in here it's about degrees in here it's a brand new model we just bought it last year doesn't have ice just water coming in and it's tipped as far back in the window as it will go safe to turn it on it really depends on what kind of model it is the older models used to have the circuitry board under the water recipient that comes build in with them when they licked water it was dangerous for these units to cause a short circuit somewhere along the way somebody figured out this problem and switched things around they put the circuitry on top of the water pan so you got to see where it is don't touch it just to avoid problems also see if it's got ice around it if it's got ice it can be that a c gas is escaping through somewhere i hope this helps sounds like it's safe to turn it on just keep your ears close to it in case you hear electric sounds which if it's new you will most likely not hear the sounds which means it's safe Fire fighting Thermal power station Sento Menstrual cup Hearing aid Air conditioning Heinkel He 100 Toyota Prius Vacuum tube Solar power Refrigerator Sailing Transformer Rebreather Water Electrophysiology Circuit breaker Microwave oven Energy development Gas metal arc welding Social rule Dairy Nuclear power Diving Ice Carbon dioxide M16 (rifle) Skateboarding trick Baseball Seismic retrofit Home repair Mountaineering GunZ The Duel Spark plug Basement Glossary of firefighting terms Naruto jutsu True Crime: Streets of LA Hydrogen peroxide Floppy disk Aerial (dance move) Hearing impairment Magical objects in Harry Potter Circuit design Microphone Soldering Johnny 5 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Cruising (maritime) Dialysis Poker jargon Space disaster West Bromwich Albion F.C.
