flies in the house this is nasty i have found tons of flies flying in my kitchen window back door and up by the attic how do i get rid of them my house is immaculate what are they from and how do i rid them from my house mmm you know it's termite breeding season they mate on the fly and loose their wings when they start a new colony when's the last time you had the place tented they usually pop out from only one specific area if it's regular flies you may have loose screens somewhere some animal may have pried it's way into the attic and died there leaving the way in for the flies and a breeding ground for more i probably don't need to remind you to keep the garbage disposal and trash can free of food waste so see about screens and maybe take a real good look in the attic for something gross there might also be a hole going from there to somewhere else i'd get some bug bombs at least and maybe call in an exterminator to tell you about the bugs for future reference you can also help to keep bugs out by spraying insect repellent around door frames and windows if you have pictures some of us might be able to tell you more aobut them Insect Bedbug Mosquito Dustbin The Dalek Invasion of Earth Termite Ant Computer virus Treehouse of Horror VII Textile manufacturing A Bug's Life Bugs Bunny The Haunted Mansion (film) Kakapo Computer animation The Parting of the Ways Landfill Vermicompost Housefly Chatsworth House The Brady Bunch Animal Crossing Waste management Kitchen Mouse (computing) Looney Tunes: Back In Action Buckingham Palace Colony in Space RuneScape quests Cockroach American Black Bear Chicken Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland G-Man (Half-Life) Diseases of the honeybee Glossary of firefighting equipment Futurama (TV series - season 5) Poker jargon Tiny Toon Adventures Jumpstart 3rd Grade The Diary of Anne Frank (film) Greek language Glitch City Bat Software bug Agriculture Attic calendar Who Framed Roger Rabbit Banjo-Kazooie Polish September Campaign Pok__mon types B-47 Stratojet X Window System Collyer brothers Back to the Future Part II Dairy Cat Bee Capercaillie The Sims 2 Mario Bros.
