i have a new home but one room smells like body odor bo i can't find the source could it be mold brand new house brand new carpet gets worse when the room is warmer it's not me either i where deorderant a room in the music wing of my highschool many years ago had this problem even when it was brand new it smelled like a hamster cage as the temperature went up it turned out that a worker had accidentally left a sandwich in the wall when they sealed it up i haven't come across a mold that specifically smelled like body odor generally it's a bacterium micrococcus that causes that smell but it doesn't mean that there can't be growth somewhere of some sort if you wanted to know whether it's mold specifically there are devices used by home inspectors that suck in a certain amount of air in the room and scientists analyse it to determine the types of things floating around either way an experienced home inspector may be able to pinpoint the smell they may have come across it before i don't suggest looking into the walls yourself as a lot of damage can be done that way Hamster Honeybee Bong Ozone Bacteria Guinea pig Olfaction Cat Trademark The Young Ones (TV series) Thermal power station Diseases of the honeybee Sin City Iraq and weapons of mass destruction Sulfur Toxic mold Insurance Sense Straw-bale construction Animal testing Stroke Fan death Meaning Natt__ Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Sake Cell (biology) Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Polyethylene terephthalate Naruto jutsu Dualism (philosophy of mind) Prostate cancer Fancy rat Perfume Carburetor Sauna Menstrual cup Hearing aid Plastic Tissue engineering The Visitation Carbon disulfide Hydrogen sulfide Buckingham Palace Battery (electricity) Tofu Milk Gamma ray burst Puberty Fire fighting John Cage Flatulence Atomism Kitchen Vermicompost Carbon dioxide Arthur Laffer Timeline of the Universe Hide and Seek (Stargate Atlantis) Vacuum cleaner The Subtle Knife The Death Gate Cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) McMansion Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
