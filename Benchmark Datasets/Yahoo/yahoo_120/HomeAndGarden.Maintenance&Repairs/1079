flickering security light there is a security light on my house with a photo cell that comes on for seconds then goes off day and night any ideas would be helpful it could be things replace the light itself replace the photo cell light control or adjust any variable switches here's info from the smarthome site do you find that you forget to turn on certain lights at dusk or to turn them off during the day timers can be helpful in scheduling lights to turn on and off at regular times but they can be difficult to install and program for easy installation and control the dusk to dawn photocell light control screws into a lamp base and its built in photocell will automatically turn the attached light on at dusk and off at dawn no additional wiring is required the dusk to dawn photocell light control is for use with candelabra base bulbs sold separately by screwing this sensor into your light socket and then screwing your light bulb directly into this sensor your light will only turn on in the dark use the sensitivity ring to control how sensitive you want the sensor to be if you feel your light is turning on at a time that you don't need it you can adjust the sensitivity ring so that the sensor is less sensitive to the light coming in and wont turn on as easy if you want your light turning on regardless of the light coming in you can completely cover the sensor to ensure that your light stays on at all times should not be used with cfl compact fluorescent lights Incandescent light bulb Compact fluorescent lamp Fluorescent lamp Traffic light Lighting Street light X10 (industry standard) Oxygen sensor Carburetor Headlight Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Seismometer Digital photography Light-emitting diode Sensor Canon T90 Thermostat Burglar alarm Light pollution Rotor machine Eye Mouse (computing) Oscilloscope Solar cell Vacuum tube Manual transmission Japanese toilet Surveillance Semiconductor device Electric motor Security lighting Windows XP Dimmer Automotive lighting BS 1363 Screw Color Photography Propeller Cannabis cultivation Programmable logic controller Saturn V STS-114 Hubble Space Telescope Transducer Radiation hardening Relay Fuse (electrical) Bluetooth STS-62 Strap-on dildo Washroom Movie projector Ethernet Drill bit Switch Leica Mercedes-Benz A-Class Light switch Wrench Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Color temperature Railway signal Naval mine Aurora (astronomy) Enigma machine INSTEON Musical Instrument Digital Interface Lightsaber Television Elevator Danger Hiptop TGV Atomic clock Mercury-vapor lamp Apollo Guidance Computer Radar Houseplant Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Magnetic core memory Visual Basic Microscopy Macro photography Solar power Ultraviolet Apollo Command/Service Module Embedded system Mattress Electrical wiring Inertial guidance system Photoresistor Sail-plan USS Tunny (SS-282) Items in the Metroid series
