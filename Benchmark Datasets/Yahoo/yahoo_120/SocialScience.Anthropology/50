real archaeologists how is it really being one i know the pay isnt wonderful unless your a curator or professor but ive read all the google information but hows it really whats the most interestign thing you've found i work as a crm archaeologist in the private sector like some ninety percent of archaeologists in the us i'm on the bottom rung too alas it's huh it's intense i technically still live at my mom's house because i travel so much there's no point in getting an apartment i'll be at maybe for a month or two each year i usually live in hotels and not often in the best areas we're usually out in the boonies you're thrown into a situation where you basically live work and socialize with a fairly small group of people for a few weeks or months and then you leave them all to go elsewhere it's kinda like really short college in that way you are also almost never sure where you'll be in a week or a month which can get stressful as for work well it's nothing like what you see on tv it's days and days of not finding much at all toiling in the hot sun or freezing in the wind and snow or rain there's also a lot of paperwork that's the bad the good is that you're going to be around people with similar interests all the time you do get to see a lot of the country especially if you're willing to drive around a bit on your days off the pay isn't great but it's not dire either you work outside you do actual physical labor a plus for me but not for everyone and you meet some real characters you get instant cool points whenever you tell anyone what you do for a living although you then have to explain to them that you don't find dinosaur bones you also sometimes get those sites that make all the tedium well worth it and we get to play with fun expensive surveying equipment and do sciency stuff dealing with people if you like science hard work and people it's awesome i worked on a paleo site once where we were pulling up year old tools that was pretty kick ss i'm still looking for my jewel encrusted monkey skull or whatever the north american equivalent will be ooh bad archaeologist i messed this one up archaic site year old tools see you don't even have to be particularly smart heh Archaeology Social rule Unemployment Theory of conduct Treehouse of Horror V Written Cantonese Rich Mullins Neanderthal Beavis and Butt-head Cruising (maritime) Archaeological field survey Avalanche Steel Poker jargon The Ashlee Simpson Show Satchel Paige Gross domestic product Pitaten True Crime: Streets of LA Education in the People's Republic of China Blood (computer game) Climate of the United Kingdom Blood on the Tracks Land use forecasting 2000 Australian Grand Prix Naruto jutsu Mountaineering Microeconomics Kodocha Law of value Discworld gods Prehistoric Britain Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Saved by the Bell Futurama (TV series - season 2) Education in Romania Dinosaur Cro Humphrey Bogart Sant Thakar Singh Make money fast W.
