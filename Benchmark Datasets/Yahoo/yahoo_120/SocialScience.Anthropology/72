what are the general characateristics of man i mean in nature and behavior motives and all man has desires man searches for power fame status wealth excel man always has fears doubts virtue love companions it is constant for man to have that and man always wants more i need to other aspects and information basis im confused pls enlighten me what you are refering to is the anthropological field of human evolutionary ecology which essentially states that our human genes dictate our behaviours and motives and whichever behaviours and motives enable the enactor to have the best reproductive success will become more prominent within the overall gene pool these traits therefore become the general characteristics of man and all mankind for that matter i have only done survey courses on this material and therefore i would not be able to give you as good an aswer as some others especially when dealing only with the limited context of man but i can provide you with the few examples that i can remember but these examples are not unique to men alright lets see the grandmother hypothesis stipulates that grandmothers who are genetically hardwired to want to take care of their grandchildren allow their own offspring more time to find success in life and produce more children the trivers willard hypothesis states that low income families favour daughters where as high income families will favour their sons this is because no matter the income level daugters are virtually guaranteed reproductive success but poor families want their daughters to attract a man of a higher social standard where as boys typically have better chances in their reproductive success if they attain a better economic and social standing another study has shown that alturism has more success over many generations then only acting for ones self interests apparently our culture creates mechanisms whereby altruists gain allies and in times of need garnish support where as cheaters alienate themselves and then when times are bad they're really bad anyways all of these examples that i have described have been scientifically studied and have shown to have some truths within the empirical data a human evolutionary ecologist therefore could take any characteristic which defines the behaviour and motives of man and then define this in terms of genetics and how these charateristics are selected for or against in terms of reproductive success for all men i hope that this helps Sociobiology Species Science Human Ethics Biology and sexual orientation Sociocultural evolution Meme Evolutionary psychology Reproduction Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Gene Price equation Genetics Biodiversity Race and intelligence Patriotism Evolutionism Human nature Capitalism Macroevolution Behavioral ecology Artificial selection Franz Boas Natural selection Sociology Eugenics Ecology Physical attractiveness History of science Dog Anthropology Psychology Culture Social sciences Charles Darwin Morality Coercion Race Second language acquisition Sexual selection Scientific method Reciprocal altruism Economic inequality Capital accumulation Memetics Free will Nicomachean Ethics Medicine Economic anthropology Archaeology Nature versus nurture Conservatism History of evolutionary thought Happiness The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Divorce Corporate governance Molecular evolution Wealth Religion Goodness and value theory Sexual orientation Extinction Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Political economy Sigmund Freud Motivation Simone Weil Randomness Sex Creationism Behaviorism Color Transsexuality Atheism Evil Democracy Occam's Razor Abortion debate Empathy Cultural relativism Genetic algorithm Efficiency wages Parthenogenesis Autism Sexual attraction Genetic engineering Rudolf Hermann Lotze Human sexual behavior Social justice
