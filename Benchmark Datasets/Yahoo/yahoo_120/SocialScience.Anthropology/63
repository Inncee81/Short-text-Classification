after generations of humans strength training will we eventually become naturally stronger since human evolve to be stronger when we require strength from other tough physical work would our bodies know the difference and evolve to become stronger naturally this only applies to the people who strength train and their kids strength train and on and on etc your example is not how evolution operates first of all when someone's muscles become larger due to being subjected to physically demanding circumstances this is not evolution this individual already has the traits to build muscle and the influence of weight lifting or intense physical labour is not actually enhancing these traits such that they experience a selective advantage in terms of reproductive success even if their children and grandchildren etc etc all continue this physical regime that promotes their own musculature development their is still no selective pressure that is causing a reproductive success and natural selection towards an increased strength in subsequent generations after many generations of such activities if one generation neglected to continue this physical regime then their muscles and skeletal robustness would only develop to their natural level of activity so all the work of their ancestors would have no residual effect towards them being stronger naturally now how does evolution work to actually achieve what you are asking about well within the human population there is already a natural variance where some people are toned with very little activity and others can weight train endlessly but experience only nominal gains an evolution towards a natural strength in our human offspring would not actually require any strength training but would only require that these naturally toned individuals who are able to build muscle quickly are able to achieve a heightened reproductive success and that those who tend to be physically weaker do not experience as high a reproductive success there are a few ways that this could happen the first would be a change in our human selective environment where a natural strength or a denser body type would become preferential to our species reproductive success lets say for instance that our planet shifted into a lengthy ice age and somehow our cultural structure disintegrated such that we had to deal with this environment in terms of our physiques morphological expression dense strong body types are much more successful in colder environments so if this became our selective environment then weaker skinnier individuals would experience more frostbite and muscle seizures such that they would not look as desirable to potential mates and or become physically disabled or dead because of this environment so that they were not as reproductively successful in this environment after even a few generations of such a differential reproductive rate the natural frequency of genes that promoted this dense strong body type would be selected for and as more distinct genes which promote this body type matched up from separate parents well their offspring would then stand the chance of acquiring two separate genes which promote this characteristic and be even more prone to a natural strength then their parents another way that this same selective pressure could occur is because of sexual selection some might jump on this quickly and say of course many women prefer a well toned man but to just look at it from this perspective is to miss half of the equation for a natural strength to be selected for over many generations then you would also need sexual selection in the other direction as well you would need a continued preference not only towards men of a dense strong musculature but these same men would have to be attracted to women of a dense strong musculature then this couple and those like them would have to produce more offspring then the average and their children would also have to be attracted to similar body types to continue this sexual selection over many generations as it turns out in the majority of people who have the required body type to perpetuate such a sexual selection are not typically choosing mate choices that would cause such a change by either combining genetic traits or in increasing their frequency within the overall gene pool by having more children the least frequent type of evolutionary change is that of mutation but it should also be addressed in the terms of your question since natural strength is not being overly selected for in either our selective environment or through mate choice then if a mutation that caused a greater natural strength were to occur then it would also not be selected for or against and would only maintain a nominal frequency in the population if this gene which increases natural strength however also had another characteristic that allowed those who carried it to experience a greater reproductive success then depending on how preferential to the reproductive success of it's carriers that this other characteristic was it would permit this gene to increase in frequency either be gradually or quite rapidly now usually the genes expression would be related so lets say that the gene acted as a pain suppressant such that muscle mass could build more readily because those who carried this gene were able to do more reps more frequently then those who did not carry this gene perhaps this natural pain suppression also made the pregnancy process more comfortable in those women who carried this gene and because pregnancy is less physically and psychologically demanding these women are able to have lower ibr's inter birth ratios and thus have the ability to have a higher reproductive success in their lifetime anyways the importance of what i'm getting at is that a mutated gene that only promotes natural strength is not enough it would also have to give some other secondary characteristic which would allow a greater reproductive success Autism Molecular evolution Transsexuality Sociocultural evolution Human sexual behavior Explosive material Water (molecule) Genetic algorithm Urinary
