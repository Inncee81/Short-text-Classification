who can brief me about axumite civilization the kingdom of aksum or axum was an important trading nation in northeastern africa growing from the proto aksumite period ca th century bc to achieve prominence by the st century ad history located in northern ethiopia and eritrea aksum was deeply involved in the trade from india and the east to the mediterranean aksum is mentioned in the st century ce periplus of the erythraean sea as an important market place for ivory which was exported throughout the ancient world from that place to the city of the people called auxumites there is a five days' journey more to that place all the ivory is brought from the country beyond the nile through the district called cyeneum and thence to adulis periplus of the erythraean sea chap according to the periplus the ruler of aksum in the st century ce was zoscales who besides ruling in aksum also held under his sway two habours on the red sea adulis near massawa and avalites assab he is also said to have been familiar with greek litterature these places from the calf eaters to the other berber country are governed by zoscales who is miserly in his ways and always striving for more but otherwise upright and acquainted with greek literature periplus of the erythraean sea chap in the rd century aksum began interfering in south arabian affairs controlling at times the western tihama region among other areas by the late rd century it had begun minting its own currency and was named by mani as one of the four great powers of his time along with persia rome and china it converted to christianity in or under king ezana and was the first state ever to use the image of the cross on its coins at its height aksum controlled northern ethiopia eritrea northern sudan southern egypt djibouti western somaliland yemen and southern saudi arabia totalling million km aksum was in important participant to international trade from the st century ce periplus of the erythraean sea it was a quasi ally of byzantium against the persian empire of the day and declined after the th century due to unknown reasons but informed speculation suggests the rise of islam heavily impacted its ability to trade with the far east in the era when shipping was limited to coastal navigation as well as cut it off from its principal markets in alexandria byzantium and southern europe after a second golden age in the early th century the kingdom began to decline eventually ceasing its production of coins in the early th century it finally dissolved with the invasion of the pagan or jewish queen gudit in the th or th century resulting in a dark age about which little is known until the rise of the zagwe dynasty origins aksum was previously thought to have been founded by semitic speaking sabaeans who crossed the red sea from south arabia modern yemen on the basis of conti rossini's theories and prolific work on ethiopian history but most scholars now agree that it was an indigenous development scholars like stuart munro hay point to the existence of an older d mt or da'amot kingdom prior to any sabaean migration ca th or th c bc as well as to evidence of sabaean immigrants having resided in ethiopia for little more than a few decades furthermore ge'ez the ancient semitic language of ethiopia is now known to not have derived from sabaean and there is evidence of a semitic speaking presence in ethiopia and eritrea at least as early as bc sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor limited to a few localities and disappearing after a few decades or a century perhaps representing a trading or military colony in some sort of symbiosis or military alliance with the ethiopian civilization of d mt or some proto aksumite state adding more to the confusion there existed an ethiopian city called saba in the ancient period that does not seem to have been a sabaean settlement geography the kingdom of aksum at its height extended across portions of present day eritrea northern ethiopia yemen southern saudi arabia northern somalia djibouti and northern sudan the capital city of the kingdom was aksum now in northern ethiopia other important cities included yeha hawulti matara adulis and qohaito the last three of which are now in eritrea British Empire Djibouti History of Sudan History of the Middle East History of Buddhism Ethiopian
