scared of pysicals going into seventh grade have to have a physical in two days what exactly do they do i don't want any shots ughhhh just thinking about blood totally creeps me out anyone had their physicals so i know what to expect i'm a girl ugh did i forget to mention that and i've heard from others that you might get a shot but thats all i was worried about thanx spunky girl i think u mean shots not shorts lol i just found that somewhat funny and i had my tetnus shot in november of so do i need another one they are pretty easy just long uusually the doc just has you get at least partially undressed with a johnny on and checks your lungs heart blood pressure heigfht weight reflexes etc they ask you if yuo have any probs with anything and just basically check you over for basic stuff its kind of like a baseline to compare you to when you get sick throughout the year they can look back at your physical and see what your normal answers responses are so they can tell the extent of any sickness you might get you are old enough though that they may do a breast exam i'm not suer when they start thopse but be prepared if they do they basically would have you lay down and would put pressure all over your breasts to see if you have any lumps anywhere just look at the ceiling and try to relax if you don't get this at this appointment you probably will in the next few years as you get older you should preform breast self exams to watch out for cancer so this is a part of that as for shots i believe tetnus is only once every years you might have to get mmr or something i remember at that age i had to show my school proof that i was immune to measles and that's why i didn't have to get that shot just don't look and relax your arm it hurts less if you relax good luck Prostate cancer Cancer Social rule Shaggy dog story Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Milton H.
