is a lcd tv too extravagant for my yo son my son does chores gets all a's reads tons of books plays sports and is the kindest hearted soul i know he has saved over from dog walking and cleaning his sister's room for he wants a lcd tv for his computer and occas dvd viewing i told him i might match his and buy it for him i don't want to spoil him with new electronics and it might be a good gift for christmas my first instinct was yes it is but after reading about your son i would say no it isn't if he has worked and saved he has shown tremendous fiscal responsibility for an year old if he is shown that hard work and saving pays then hopefully he will continue to do it i think you are better off matching his so he has a stake in it than to give it to him as a gift more of an entitlement Liquid crystal display The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Handheld game console Poker jargon Liquid crystal display television The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Doug Sumo Shaggy dog story Wheel of Fortune Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Computer and video games Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Television Digital photography Stereoscopy The Catcher in the Rye The Ashes Surveillance Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban YuYu Hakusho Family Guy Cathode ray tube Animal Crossing Daria Transactional analysis Professional wrestling slang UK Singles Chart IMac Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Eddie Guerrero Humphrey Bogart Leigh Richmond Roose Fishfinder James T.
