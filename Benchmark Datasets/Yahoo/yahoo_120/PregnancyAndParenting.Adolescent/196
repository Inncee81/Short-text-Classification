i'm and i think i might be pregnant i kinda had sex we didn't go all the way in and we didn't have a condom he didn't cum or anything but i know i could still be pregnant i'm due for my period i'm praying that its just a little late i'm scarred to death does anybody have any idea what the chances of me being pregnant are believe it or not i'm a christian girl i have values the whole thing was a mistake i was in love with him so i let it happen just once but i guess thats all it takes i can't talk to either of my parents about it they would lose all trust in me for that matter i really can't tell anyone anybody in the same boat want to talk or have any adivce well hunny it's important that you be calm because sometimes when females are anxious about the possibility of pregnancy they see some or all the signs and symptoms of pregnancy just go to a drug store and pick up an e p t home pregnancy test and take it and if you want to be even more sure go see a doctor at a hospital clinic planned parenthood etc also i'd like to mention that there's no need for you to explain why you did it or your character because no one's perfect people make mistakes and your choice is your own to live with you're not a bad person for what you did just be more careful and take proper precautions when making decisions as this one good luck with everything sweetie and i'll keep you in my prayers hope this helps Pregnancy Abortion debate Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fertility awareness Pitaten Stomach cancer Roe v.
