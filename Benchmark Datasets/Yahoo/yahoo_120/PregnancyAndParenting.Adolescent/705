talking to my mom about birth control prefer girls answer and probably moms i know some of you may be tired of my questions about my mother but i'm clueless when it comes to her anyway the reason i have been thinking about trying birth control is because i have weird periods heavy flows and unbearable cramps i have had sex i don't currently but it would still be a good idea if it happens the thing with my mom is we don't talk much we don't get along she likes to assume and yell i was molested as a child she never talked to me about it because it would have made her uncomfortable we don't talk about sex drugs alcohol anything i don't do any of those things and i'm an honor roll student and that is another thing she doesn't pay attention to it's usually a yep good job and she leaves the room i don't want her to get all upset and angry i just want it because of my periods and nothing else seems to work for me my doctor told me it was an option but my mom made that decision for me that was a couple years ago wow first of all i feel for you sweetie because i have been in both places first as a teenage girl with a very old fashioned mother who was seriously old school and then as a single parent raising three daughters they are now and and finally finally after many years of screaming crying fighting and general major drama we have come full circle and have come friends but there was a time when none of us got along and it felt like it was against me i feel sad that you were molested and that your mom couldn't talk about it with you but for what it's worth and not to stand up for your mom but it's a hard gig to be the parent of a teen girl she might feel horribly guilty because she wasn't there to protect you and maybe by ignoring it although she is hurting your relationship that's the way she keeps from going crazy from the guilt you don't say if she is a single mom or an overworked mom but those things have a lot to do with keeping a parent's mind preoccupied and worried like about the bills and how they'll get paid and how your job is going etc i am also sorry to say that there are very few parents who don't assume and yell we try to protect our children the best we can and sometimes unfortunately we overdo it and forget to listen or communicate i don't know if you know how she was brought up but if she was brought up by a parent who yelled and was generally uncommunicative she may be just imitating what she grew up with you sound like a super young lady and i would love to have a daughter like you you seem to have a level head on your shoulders as well please have patience with your mom one day you may be a parent and you can look back at this as a learning experience a hard one but a necessary one that said you don't need your mom's permission to go to a local planned parenthood and get on the pill at least not in california if that is really why you are going to get the pill then you should do it but know that they don't always work the first time you have to try several god bless you and keep doing well in school we all have to go through these trials while growing up One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Knots Landing EastEnders Shaggy dog story About a Boy Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Piccolo Junior Saga Kodocha Little Britain The Inside She Loves You Kurt Cobain Humphrey Bogart The Marshall Mathers LP Social rule Charmed Abortion debate The Catcher in the Rye Cindy Sheehan Laura Schlessinger Avenue Q Recurring South Park characters Infantilism Kim Possible Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Time Out of Mind Daria Le Malade imaginaire Transactional analysis God Emperor of Dune Sin City Sex education Great Teacher Onizuka Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Dawson's Creek The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Marilyn Monroe Good Times Child sexuality Theodicy The O.C.
