i need help with my yr old she has been through a lot in her young life but here it goes i am years old and i married her father who i had been with for six years he went into the air force and he hit me and our relationship went bad we are seperated and i have now been with my current bf for years i have a month old with him and my five year old still wets her pants i have tried everything to help her i have a college degree and a great job a really great job one most would dream about i am at the end of my rope i feel horrible that her father doesn't want her to live with him and won t take her he barely calls her but when he does see her he's a great dad she insists on living with her father and i don't know what to do or how to make her better please help any rude comments on my parenting will be flagged i have done the very best that i can and for being only and still getting my college degree and having a great job and living on my own without welfare so nothing rude first i want to thank everyone for their kind answers but here is a bit more info i have taken her to her doctor and he suggested that she is very constipated which she is and somehow that will help her as her bladder and bowel work together and help each other so she is on a mild laxitive that is safe for children i'm not worried about the wetting of the pants as much as i worry about the impact her father has on her all she wants to do is be with her father who clearly doesn't want her to live with him he lives in arkansas and i live in mass he won't take her to live with him and i can't seem to make her understand without talking badly about him so i have avoided the whole subject this is so hard i have no misgivings regarding her father he was young when he hit me and had not yet gone to boot camp since coming back he has been very controlled and very reserved he has totally changed he hit me once or twice before that and i decided to leave for many other reasons also besides that he is a good father to her but he is also extremely young i feel bad for him in a way but that does not excuse him from being a parent he also pays support regularly and i am defensive because i do not like or appreciate hearing how i am too young to be a mother and everyone who is pro abortion and all of that i also do not like being categorized as a young mother on welfare which most people decide to put me in i am not on welfare and i have a degree this is why i am defensive i do not like the horrible comments on how i am too young and i cannot provide for my daughter not at all so forgive me for being defensive being a mother is about prioritizing even for year old women this is still a feat so don't feel behind or ahead i can see that you're trying to live up to all the ideals that others would suggest ie get a good job be supportive of her father's skills include her in family etc you second guess yourself and think that the circumstances and choice you've made are somehow delaying or disturbing her true children are psychologically impacted by divorce and sometime exhibit physical manafestations of those types of impacts ie sass mouth whining bed wetting defication insomnia etc however not always are the circumstances the cause take her to her doctor she may have a small bladder she may have an infection or some other medical problem that is beyond her control at that point would you stop blaming yourself i know it's our tendancy as mothers truth is if you keep blaming yourself your daughter will learn how to blame you too thus not taking responsibility for her own actions how do you think we have this society of blamers do the best you can but don't bare the burden of someone else's actions we can sympathize with our children understand them and even help them cope but to take on the blame is a whole nother facet Urinary incontinence Prostate cancer Hillary Rodham Clinton Unemployment Abortion debate EastEnders Abortion Divorce Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Autism Breastfeeding Goodness and value theory Theory of conduct Fathers' rights Pitaten Avenue Q About a Boy Knots Landing Kodocha Rape God Emperor of Dune Friends Charles Darwin's illness Abortion in the United States Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Milton H.
