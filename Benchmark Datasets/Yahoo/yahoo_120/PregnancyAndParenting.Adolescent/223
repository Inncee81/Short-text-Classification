how can parents kick kids out as soon as they turn i have teens they have both brought home stray kids to stay for a few days these kids arrive with a backpack of change of clothes and sometimes not even that i feed em buy toiletries and help them search for alternatives in our community these are not bad kids we have house rules and they abide i think i will open a shelter for year olds it breaks my heart my parents kicked me out when i was years old a full time college student and i worked full time i paid room and board and did chores around the house they began remodeling their home when i was and my father told me i wasn't included in their remodeling plans they literally removed my bedroom from their floorplans well the good thing is that i survived i'm now a mother of amazing children and a returning college student i was never a bad kid i never smoked or drank i was home at pm curfew and i never did anything to bring shame to my name i hated my parents for the longest time because i felt they were just selfish and they felt they had done their job and it was over it was hard on me i really think their 'reason' was because my grandparents became very ill and i moved in with them for a little while to help take care of them putting my college dreams on hold because my parents didn't make the time to help with my grandparents they passed that responsibility on to me both my grandparents became very ill and i moved out but still stopped in and took care of them ran them to the doctors and hospital appointments for years shortly after i moved in months later with my boyfriend who is now my husband to whom i became engaged to at the time we're about to celebrate our year wedding anniversary i've been with my husband for years and over the years i've learned a valuable lesson my children are my world i would let them live home forever i could never kick one of my children out when you become a mother it isn't a job that you retire from when your child turns a certain age it is a job for life you are wonderful person to help these young folks out and let me tell you those kids will always have respect for you being there for them and they will never forget that in their eyes you and your family were their guardian angels i've had quite a few of those people in my life and i take in strays as well family isn't just biological family is those who you love and love you back with no question over the years i've learned to forgive my parents and i truly love them i thank god for what had happened because i learned a lot of life lessons and i met my husband and had amazing children and even though it was a very hard thing to go through i'd do it all over again the same however i find it ironic that my younger brother who is is still living home and doesn't contribute a dime to the food or shelter fund i just have to laugh when i think about it but i love my brother unconditionally and tell him stay home as long as you can and don't budge guess i still harbour a little anger inside afterall o lol Pitaten Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Kodocha Knots Landing Humphrey Bogart Friends About a Boy Jon Secada Avenue Q Phoebe Halliwell Everwood Marilyn Monroe The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Theory of conduct Kimi Finster W.I.T.C.H.
