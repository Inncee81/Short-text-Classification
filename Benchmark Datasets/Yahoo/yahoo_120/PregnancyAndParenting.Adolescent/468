have you ever heard a year old girl say this i need a man not a boy i need somebody who's gonna pay my bills i don't want nobody who plays games i have a year old cousin and all she can ever say is the boys she go to school with play games what why is she worried about this at her age shouldn't she have her head in a book trying to learn something by the way i told her this bills what bills i don't call rentals from blockbuster or that cell phone your mama bought you a bill that's the problem these little fast girls out here growing up to fast that's why they're having babies in high school you'd think their parents are teaching them something but i guess not they're always running into older men's faces looking for a free ride could be the music the videos i don't know they can't add but they know every dance that comes out they know every lyric in a song i guess the parents or guardians just don't care where i'm from and year old girls having babies is the norm what a shame lol you made me laugh while reading your post i giggled a little yes those girls are getting a little fast i'm and i truly don't need no man to pays my bills cause soon or later they going to want a little pay back but its society some are just growing up to fast and the music is another thing i've been tutoring and grades for a year now and last week one of the little boys called some girl a gold digging h i asked him why he said that and he said well i heard it on bet music videos and when i told his parents to control what he watch they just shrugs it off so yeah sometimes its the parents fault and sometimes its not Jon Secada Jennifer Lopez Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Friends Humphrey Bogart Kylie Minogue Billboard Hot 100 Missy Elliott The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll Joke Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Empire Burlesque Usher (entertainer) EastEnders Hip hop collaborations Single certification The Beach Boys Sharon Tate AFI 100 Years series She Loves You Little Britain Hall & Oates Great Teacher Onizuka The Inside The Beatles discography Russian joke Gwen Stefani Milton H.
