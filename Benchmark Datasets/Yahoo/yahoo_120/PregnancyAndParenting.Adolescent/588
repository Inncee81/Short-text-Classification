do you know anything about this my year old daughter came in from school today and her arm was really red i asked her what had happened and she said that she had been digging her fingernails into her skin i asked her why she would do that and she said because i am half emo i dont know if that is spelled right i have never heard of that before so i asked her what is half an emo she said that it is people that like to cut their selves i ve never heard of it being called emo ive always heard it being called cutters anyway she said that she has some friends that are emo and that she is falling into peer pressure but she said that she would never cut her self with anything but im worried her going from scratching to actually cutting her dad and i sat her down and had a long talk with her about peer pressure she said that she would never do it again but im worried that she may actually end up cutting any advice would be appreciated sorry this was so long but i wanted to explain everything thanks for reading the term 'emo' basically lost it's entire meaning it used to represent unique now it represents gothic black hair teenagers who cut themselves grow their hair long listen to gothic music write sad poems about how they want to die etc that's not very unique is it she shouldn't have friends that are like that in the first place definately friends who fall into peer pressure and maybe she should consider talking to them on what that pressure is doing to her her friends i'll give you a thumbs up for discovering that in the first place so she considers herself a half emo i know someone who calls themself an emo she's really happy all the time and i'm not sure if she cuts but she follows the whole black nail polish and mascara thing i guess kind of unique so i consider them a half emo if she says that she'll never do it again i think i'd trust her on that just do some check ups on her if she decides to cut again look for places such as the bottom of her wrist common well that's basically all i know sorry if it wasn't enough you can check more out here http en wikipedia org wiki emo slang best wishes to your daughter Emo Shaggy dog story Hair Social rule The Inside High school subcultures Theory of conduct Kodocha 21st Century Emo One Tree Hill (TV series) House of M Singlish Time Out of Mind Milton H.
