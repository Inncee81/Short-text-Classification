what is raising a bipolar adhd teenager like kids answer too my year old son has bipolar and adhd as he gets older some characteristics improve others worsen the past few years have been rough can anyone tell me their experiences with teeneagers with either both disorders i would love to hear from kids too i had add growing up and my mom had me on rytalin for years and it caused severe depression and muscle spasms in my neck that even today cause problems medication should be a short term thing to help kids adjust to focusing techniques and not as a permanent solution i remember getting made fun of at school not only by kids but by teachers one girl in rd grade refused to sit next to me because i made a noise when my muscles would spasm and the teacher told her i know she sounds like a pig grunting but you have to deal with it that was years ago and i sill remember it clear as day my older brother and sister finally told my mom she needed to take me off the medication and she finally did by this time i was so used to not having friends that all i could do was focus on my school work eventually i got friends and i was making decent grades but no one not even my teachers thought i would amount to anything i proved them wrong and became a military working dog handler in the usaf i have an a s in criminal justice and i'm working towards my b a in biology there ae certain thing that i do now that take me back to my horrible child hood and i think about if i would have done those minor things if i didn't suffer from add i know it will never go away completely but i have found ways to deal with it my best advice would be to see a therapist and see about a group therapy session so that your son knows he isn't alone it also helps for a kid to have someone to relate to don't give up and don't rely solely on medications Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Stuttering Medicine Transsexuality Neighbours Adult attention-deficit disorder Milton H.
