please help how can i get a shot of my son jumping off the diving board last weekend we went to my husband's family reuion which was on a college campus my nine year old son jumped off the diving board into feet i was able to take pictures on my cell phone camera but could not get any on my digital camera i could only get ones of the water splash with my son already in the water please help our neighborhood pool does not have a diving board but if you can help me i would like to take him to a nearby pool that does to get some pictures of him jumping off the diving board your problem comes about because of the way the camera works when you press the shutter the camera assesses the light and sets the exposure guesses what the best white balance is focuses and then takes the shot on older cheaper cameras this process could take as much as a second whilst a second doesn't seem like much as you are no doubt learning an energetic young child can do a lot in a second and your shot can be gone the newer cameras are getting faster but this delay can still prevent you getting the shot how do we fix this one approach involves doing as much as you can for the camera before taking the shot if your camera allows try to set the exposure yourself and also pre focus the camera this will involve using those scary manual modes and perhaps reading the manual another approach is to pre time the shot this involves hold the camera still and pressing the shutter a second too early it's difficult at first but with a little practice you will get the hang of it even with very high speed slr cameras there is still a small delay and professional sports photographers have this delay down to a fine art either way you have a little reading and or practice to do you are now moving off the ground level with your photography into a more advanced mode enjoy the ride Digital photography Photography Canon T90 Camera Single-lens reflex camera Leica View camera Digital single-lens reflex cameras Konica Minolta Panoramic photography Diving Stereoscopy Parachuting Movie projector Shutter speed Street photography Cinematography Skateboarding trick Quake III Arena Rangefinder camera Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Mouse (computing) Floppy disk GunZ The Duel Surveillance Drowning Film Nikon FM2 Photographic lens Camcorder Point and shoot camera Contax Oscilloscope RISC Professional wrestling aerial techniques Swimming pool Time-lapse Volleyball Macro photography Nikon FA Road-rule enforcement camera Rebreather Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Modem Central processing unit Twin-lens reflex camera Professional wrestling attacks Nikon FE Digital cinema Nikon FE2 Pinhole camera Bluetooth Solar power Apollo 8 Bullet time Amateur astronomy The Sims 2 Decompression sickness Electrophysiology Automatic number plate recognition Photographic film Photojournalism Charge-coupled device Enlarger CPU design F-number Nikon Corporation Technicolor Equine conformation Nikon FM Welding Henri Cartier-Bresson Weight training Natural Selection (computer game) Air traffic control Prostate cancer Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Deep Impact (space mission) Atari 8-bit family USS Tunny (SS-282) Motion capture Blood (computer game) Photograph Telephone exchange National Football League Canon T70 Computer and video game genres Digital cinematography
