digital cameras so i'm about to purchase my first digital camera yea i know i'm behind the times but i am unsure which one to buy i know i want a smaller one that i can fit in my purse what kind of digital cameras that you have and enjoy any you avoid what is a good brand here is the one i'll looking at http www polaroid com global detail jsp product c eprd id folder c efolder id bmuid bmlocale en us i want a decent one and am willing to spend around maybe more thanks for your help first of all i'd buy a camera from a camera maker not an electronics company camera makers understand how photographers operate and they usually provide the tools you need not only to get outstanding pictures but also to set the camera quickly frankly casio sucks they're into electronics and gadgets not photography camera makers that are around include nikon canon pentax olympus polaroid and kodak these companies understand cameras and photographers however kodak builds only simple cameras that have limited functionality and reliability problems i've known many with a kodak digital and they all replaced them eventually if you look through all the questions here you'll also find more about inoperative kodaks than any other brand kodak is great if you want to spend as little money as possible and don't mind getting only a year of average pictures out of it their strengths are simplicity and low price nothing else olympus reliability isn't that good either and they use proprietary products so when you buy their memory cards you can't use those cards in any other camera except an olympus this is not usually a good situation to be in you may eventually want to replace it with another brand so you don't want to have to buy your memory cards all over again polaroid makes reasonably good cameras but i have no idea what their reliability is like or their overall quality they tend to be like kodak in terms of price and like pentax in terms of functionality pentax builds a relatively good camera and offers the best bundled software available for handling your images pentax too though isn't as reliable as one would like however it's certainly better than olympus and kodak nikon and canon build the best point and shoot cameras and both use standard memory cards they're reliable and produce outstanding pictures i use a canon point shoot a powershot g which is an amazing camera that is highly reliable and incredibly well built in addition to being replete with features i also use a nikon d slr which is also an incredible camera you really can't go wrong with either of these brands looking at the one you're choosing the polaroid it looks ok when you price it though you'll need to include a charger and some nimh aa batteries rated at mah or more the two aa batteries it comes with won't last long and it will cost you a fortune to keep buying batteries i'd also include a memory card in the mb to gb range with that combination you'll have a nice camera that won't cost you an arm and a leg to use the other thing i'd stress is that you go and hold the camera in a store people can get very personal about cameras and often the decision isn't what someone recommended but rather how it feels in the hand when you're in the store hold a few canons and nikons too and maybe a pentax you'll find many will feel different and some will be really uncomfortable to hold depending on the size of your hands i hope that helps a little Computer View camera Camera Digital camera Konica Minolta Secure Digital card Eastman Kodak Single-lens reflex camera Pentax Canon T90 Nikon Corporation CPU design IBM PC compatible Canon EOS Nikon FM2 Nikon FE2 Nikon FA Photographic film Camcorder Central processing unit Windows Vista Medium format Digital camera back Floppy disk Hubble Space Telescope Nikon FM Bluetooth IPod Oscilloscope Nikon FE Embedded system Photographic lens Microeconomics Gross domestic product Olympus (company) Credit card Topps CPU cache Atari ST Windows 2000 Electronic commerce Windows XP Atari 8-bit family Mac OS X RFID Enterprise content management Sears Holdings Corporation Extreme Programming Canon Inc.
