help with settings on canon s is please i have a canon s is and we bought it before my son was born months ago i still don't know how to use it and the pics always come out blurry the manual is way over my head and i feel really bad that i have this great camera and my pics come out so bad anyone have a way that they can give me the canon s is for dummies version what should the settings be i really don't know why all your photos are blurry because if you are using auto then most of your photos should generally be fine plus your camera has an image stabilizer which means less likelihood of blurred photos some reasons why your photos might be blurred you are not giving the camera time to pre focus always make sure you half press the shutter button till the little square turns green then press the shutter button down fully always making sure you keep the camera still make sure the image stabilizer is turned on and make sure it's in shoot only mode for best results if you are trying to take photos of your young son who is obviously not staying still for very long then you need to use a faster shutter speed tv on the mode dial remember that your camera isn't smart enough to know that your subject is moving so you have to 'tell' it to use a faster shutter speed to try to capture any action or movement e g sec to a much faster shutter speed you can select where you want your camera to auto focus af i generally prefer to have my af frame in the centre so i can focus more accurately on my subject and you can also select how your camera focuses continuous or single i much prefer single so you should try both settings continuous focusing will consume more battery power don't forget to raise the flash when the lighting is low i suggest you try and spend some time going through the user guide step by step because it will help you understand your camera more i really like canon's user guides because they are very user friendly mostly good luck and check out the two links below which might be helpful Photography Leica Canon T90 View camera Shutter speed Stereoscopy Automatic number plate recognition Canon EOS Movie projector Camera Single-lens reflex camera Canon T70 GunZ The Duel Time-lapse PlayStation Portable Eye Frame rate IBM PC compatible Oscilloscope Embedded system Canon PowerShot G Beatmania IIDX Panoramic photography Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Depth of field Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Shutter (photography) Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Cinematography Welding Street photography Bluetooth Nikon Corporation Amateur astronomy Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME (North America) Quake III Arena Binoculars Canon EF lens mount Nikon FM2 Poker jargon Redundant array of independent disks Rangefinder camera Toyota Prius Macro photography DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution 7thMIX Dance Dance Revolution Digital camera Drill bit Pump It Up Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Persistence of vision Prank flash Professional video camera Screenshot IPod Shutter angle F-number Wind turbine Motion capture Nikon FE2 HTML element GunBound Walkman Photographic lens Nikon FA Modem Knight Rider Motion blur Equine conformation Nikon FE Digital single-lens reflex cameras Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Sonic the Hedgehog Bicycle lighting M16 (rifle) Closed-circuit television Weight training BZFlag Gradius Rendering (computer graphics) Mars Exploration Rover Resident Evil 4 Mattress Cheating in Counter-Strike Danger Hiptop DDRMAX2: Dance Dance Revolution Windows XP Tank Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
