how do i display the date and time on the pics i take on my casio qv r some cameras are preset to automatically put the date on the pictures some do but you have to set it to do so and some cameras don't do that at all if yours does have the ability to put the date on the picture it would probably be under the camera's display or set up menu if there is no such option you could always put it on the picture yourself using your favorite image editing software or go to a kodak picture center kiosk at wal mart or wherever Digital photography Windows Vista Windows XP IPod PlayStation Portable Camera Photography Screenshot Mouse (computing) Control Panel (Windows) Bluetooth Nintendo DS ITunes Casio Laserdisc Image file formats Movie projector Oscilloscope AmigaOS Patricia Ford Pinhole camera Object Desktop Computer wallpaper Ebook MSN Messenger Digital camera Gradius Movie camera Windows 2000 Machinima Wal-Mart Instant camera Hubble Space Telescope 35 mm film Super 8 mm film Panoramic photography Canon EOS Photographic film Road-rule enforcement camera Danger Hiptop Gmail Calculator NTSC Digital single-lens reflex cameras Digital video Adobe Photoshop HTML element High-definition television Xbox 360 IPhoto Enterprise content management Eastman Kodak Pixel Game Boy Camera Single-lens reflex camera Secure Digital card Television Raw image format Window Maker Pornography TRS-80 Geographic information system Automatic teller machine Automatic number plate recognition Technicolor Autostereogram Anamorphic widescreen MSX Hello world program Camera phone Rangefinder camera Closed-circuit television Konica Minolta Internet forum Digital image editing IMAX Daria Mac OS X v10.4 Digital cinematography Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February ZX Spectrum Cinematography 135 film Microsoft Paint Image Digital cinema Atari 8-bit family Medium format Unicode Slot machine Stereoscopy Computer animation Pie menu Goatse.cx 3D computer graphics 50 First Dates Resident Evil 2 Computer vision
