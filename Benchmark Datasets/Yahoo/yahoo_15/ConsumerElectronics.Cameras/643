trying to pick out my first dslr i work with horses and enjoy taking pictures at competitions but shutter lag with my current camera makes it difficult to get good shots not to mention the lack of zoom i'd like to upgrade to a dslr but don't want to spend more than i've heard a lot about the nikon d but wanted to get others opinion i have no real preference to brand although i've mainly had canons in the past here's more about the d i think that the nikon d is a great little camera very easy to use and quite reasonably priced it has a few consumer friendly totally automatic modes that make it very easy to use including a child photo mode but still offers total photographic control when you are ready to take charge it will get you in the nikon family which is a great place to be if you buy accessories and lenses you will be able to use everything on any nikon that you might upgrade to later on check out nikon's picturetown promotion where they handed out d 's in georgetown sc http www stunningnikon com picturetown here are a few reviews in case you have not read them yet be sure to note that they are several pages long and some of the reviews also have some sample images that you can look at http www dpreview com reviews nikond http www steves digicams com reviews nikon d html http www popphoto com cameras camera test nikon d html http www kenrockwell com nikon d d recommendations htm i hate to see people slam the camera because it can't autofocus with older nikon lenses it is true that there is a slight problem with older nikon lenses not autofocusing on the d but if you do not own a bag full of older lenses it is not going to be a problem it is barely a problem anyhow if you check www nikonusa com for af s lenses which are all compatible with the d you will find lenses including vr vibration reduction lenses and one true macro lens with vr there are another plus lenses in the current catalog that provide all functions except autofocus as well as many possibly dozens out of print lenses that will work just as well in addition although these lens will not autofocus most of them will still give focus confirmation from the d manual if the lens has a maximum aperture of f of faster the viewfinder focus indicator can be used to confirm whether the portion of the subject in the selected focus area is in focus after positioning the subject in the active focus area press the shutter release button halfway and rotate the lens focusing ring until the in focus indicator is displayed see http www members aol com swf nikonafs txt for a list of af s lenses or see http www nikonians org cgi bin dcforum dcboard cgi az read count om forum dcforumid for even more the d only has autofocus zones arranged horizontally at the center o'clock and o'clock positions this might be considered a limitation but realistically most people will find this perfectly adequate especially if you are moving up from a point and shoot with only a center zone there is no status lcd on top of the camera but nikon chose to use the rear lcd for this information this is actually a nice move as the display is bigger than the top display and you aren't using the read lcd for anything before you take the picture anyway this is not a step backwards and it actually makes sense to me you can get the d with the kit lens at b h photo available through yahoo shopping or at for june add a lexar platinum x speed card for or gb for or get the d with lens and gb lexar card for this is a decent lens and it is very versatile you will find it suitable for pretty much anything you want to do other than really long telephoto shots it will let you explore the range of focal lengths to decide where to start filling in your lens collection if you don't want to buy any more lenses this one will carry you through pretty much everything b h also have used d 's with the lens from now if you like the feel of the canon xt or xti better that's the camera for you it's excellent i prefer the d but you might like the canon's lots of people use canon and nikon quite successfully Nikon FM2 Rangefinder camera Floppy disk Nikon FE Cinematography Mouse (computing)
