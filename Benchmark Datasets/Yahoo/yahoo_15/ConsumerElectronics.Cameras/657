i have the nikon d camera i need a flash for it can i buy any brand flash like sigma ect and it'll st i wonder the same about macro lenses as well what brand will work well with my d if i can't afford the nikon brand this is a rare occasion but i will disagree with fhotoace you do not need to buy a nikon flash to use on your camera but you would prefer to buy a nikon flash to take advantage of the many interlinked functions between the flash and camera if you are buying a modern flash that specifies that it is for digital cameras and the and the manufacturer of the flash specifies compatibility with your d you will not harm your camera you just won't be getting all that you could be getting in the way of features i'd rather see you get the relatively cheap nikon sb instead of another maker's unit if you want to save some money it costs just over if you need something cheaper please stick to your on camera flash while you save at least it is designed with the nikon in mind you may not see the sb listed in your owner's manual because it is relatively new as far as the lenses yes you can buy any lens with a nikon mount there are many if you want a true macro lens there are not so many to choose from none of the zoom macro's go to i am looking at b h now you should only be interested in a prime macro meaning a non zoom single focal length lens i see a couple of sigma prime macro's for but only the sigma normal mm f ex dg macro autofocus lens for nikon af goes to the other one isn't even it's almost okay it's technically a macro lens but you are going to be disappointed if you can't get ditto for the mm sigma it costs and only goes to for a few dollars more you can have a new imported nikon normal macro mm f d af micro nikkor autofocus lens bear in mind the warranty issues with a grey market item but this lens is built like a tank and should last years without a warranty problem read b h's explanation about grey market items the next aftermarket macro lens i see costs which is the same as the usa nikon mm macro the way i see it you can choose between the mm sigma or the mm nikon import either one will work since macro can be very detailed and technical i think you will always wonder if the nikon is really better than the sigma so hold out for the nikon in the end i am not disagreeing with the ace after all the answer to your question is that yes you can use other maker's products on your camera but he is right in thinking that anyone who has made the leap and sacrifice to buy a d will not be satisfied with the results of those products View camera Leica Contax Digital single-lens reflex cameras Canon EOS Canon EF lens mount Macro photography Nikon FA Photography Canon T90 Photographic lens Nikon FE Nikon FM2 Binoculars Nikon FE2 Nikon FM Panavision Schneider Kreuznach USB flash drive Economics Floppy disk Nikon D70 Secure Digital card IPod Camcorder Camera Mouse (computing) Point and shoot camera Olympus (company) Depth of field Advanced Photo System Bicycle lighting Atari 8-bit family Digital camera back AMD Zeiss Normal distribution Labor theory of value Canon FD MMORPG Nintendo 64 Microeconomics Cinematography Gramophone record Eyepiece Computer virus C programming language IBM PC compatible CPU design Commodore International Wal-Mart ATI Technologies Cosina Panoramic photography Pentax Television Film Canon EOS-300D DVD Law of value Wayne Corporation C plus plus Acorn Computers Stereoscopy Telescope Gross domestic product Emacs Global System for Mobile Communications Strap-on dildo Stage lighting Computer B3ta Ford Motor Company Four Thirds System School bus RuneScape cheats Asian financial crisis Nintendo DS Labour economics Bulk vending United States dollar F-number Headlight RISC Flash memory Xbox Aberration in optical systems Land use forecasting Laserdisc
