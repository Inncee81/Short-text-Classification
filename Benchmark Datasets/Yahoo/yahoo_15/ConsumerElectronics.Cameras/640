canon rebel xti question about lightning with this camera can someone tell me how it'd be possible to take a picture in a really low light place or at night without using flash while getting a semi decent photo i know you can change something to get more light in but i must be doing it wrong because every picture i take blurrs i went to the zoo yesterday and there were some dark inside areas where monkeys where and i couldn't get a shot of them couldn't use flash because they were behind glass my shutter stayed open longer i think it changed itself to automatically but the monkeys always blurred since they were moving can someone teach me how to do this better the only suggestion i have is to raise the iso setting you will get a little grainier pictures maybe one of the other gentlemen will have better advice for you if you don't get an answer soon repost the question in a couple of hours Digital photography Film speed Photography Shen Gong Wu Stereoscopy Canon T90 Macro photography Camera Single-lens reflex camera Shutter speed Floppy disk Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Lightning Milton H.
