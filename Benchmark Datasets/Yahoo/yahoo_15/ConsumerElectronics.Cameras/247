should i buy a dslr or a good rangefinder camera i have one main question and one secondary question i don't like slr's because they're too big have shutter vibration make loud sounds that distract people even animals for nature photos i'm looking into a higher end rangefinder range can anyone give me a reason why i should think otherwise i'm not all that impressed that when you aim an slr you see the exact parameters of your shot second question is do you think the large size of an slr makes people automatically think the camera must be better and take better photos than a smaller format camera i'm assuming by rangefinder you are talking about digital point and shoot p s like the canon g it has a classic rangefinder look and feel if i had a choice between the g or the xti for my main camera i would have to go with the g i think it goes without saying that the g is smaller and less obtrusive and will be more friendly to carry around and get less noticed than the dslr therefore i can use it in lots of situations people do act differently around the larger cameras i think people feel more self concious when they have a big telephoto zoom lens pointed right at them than say a small p s camera it's psychological and it is somewhat conditioned in people that they expect a photographer who uses a dslr will shoot a picture of them in a more critical way than if the photographer used a p s which is viewed as fun and informal you would use a dslr when you want the best image quality and a versatile camera for all lighting conditions for professionals they must have the best equipment for their work so they almost always use dslrs and not p s Rangefinder camera Digital camera View camera Konica Minolta Photographic lens Nikon Corporation Photography Contax Macro photography Cinematography Medium format Street photography Binoculars Digital camera back Camera Canon EOS Panoramic photography Canon T90 Full frame digital SLR Nikon FM2 Advanced Photo System Canon EF lens mount Four Thirds System Anamorphic widescreen Schneider Kreuznach Photographic film Shutter speed IMAX Zoom lens Cinerama Camcorder Nikon FE Aperture Nikon FM Image file formats Widescreen Canon FD Olympus (company) Electronic journalism Digital cinematography Canon EOS-300D Floppy disk Amateur astronomy Twin-lens reflex camera Secure Digital card NTSC Road-rule enforcement camera Circle of confusion Autostereogram Apollo moon landing hoax accusations Photojournalism Pentax Traditional animation Digital cinema Determinism Wind turbine Charge-coupled device Cosina Photograph Nikon FA Reflecting telescope Sniper Nikon D70 Computer vision Surveillance Film Closed-circuit television Clarinet Henri Cartier-Bresson Panavision PNG Enlarger Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Astronomical seeing Computer Psychology Aberration in optical systems Canon Inc.
