digital camera sd card format error can ya help me with this one my dad is trying to fix this over the phone with me and i haven't experienced it so i'm throwing it to the wolves he has an older model hp digital camera with a gig sd card he has pictures on the card as viewable by playing them on the camera's lcd however when he connects the camera to the pc to transfer the pictures and clear his sd card he gets an error on the pc that simply says not formatted and he can't go any further obviously the sd card is not formatted it has pictures on it is this something anyone has experienced at all he's had the camera forever but the sd card is an upgrade from what he had and it's the first time he's tried to upload the photos to the computer with said card if he needed to format that card within the software on the pc before using it how can he get those pictures now after talking to him again suggesting he just go to my computer and search the removable drive files he said that when he clicks on the camera drive it gives him the not formatted error again the problem is the hp software because he didn't know the card had to be formatted beforehand in order to get the pictures he's not interested in removing the software i recommended he connect the camera to another pc without the software and just choosing his options that pop up once the camera is connected oh he has about pictures to get off that card very important pictures of the new grandson my first son so he can't just erase the pictures from the camera and start again do not ever try to format using the computers operating system mac's will destroy the card and in some cases so will windows to format the card use only the format feature that is on your camera sometimes even a card formatted on one camera will not work on another the only way to be sure to get all the image files from the card is to use a card reader some printers and computers have these built in but if he doesn't have that option then he will have to spend and buy one it connects to a usb port and the card goes in it then all he has to do is use the file manager to drag and drop the images on the card to a folder on his computer that he has pre named so he knows what is in the file IPod Windows XP Windows Vista Mac OS X ITunes Universal Serial Bus Bluetooth Floppy disk Secure Digital card Digital camera Mouse (computing) Atari 8-bit family Computer USB flash drive Apple Macintosh Object Desktop Common Unix Printing System Atari ST ZX Spectrum IMac USB mass storage device class File Allocation Table Macintosh Finder PlayStation 2 Digital rights management System 7 (Macintosh) PlayStation Portable System/36 Mach kernel Computer virus Hard disk Screenshot Musical Instrument Digital Interface IBM PC compatible DVD Digital audio player Photography Apple II family Game Boy Enterprise content management Creative Zen Television FireWire File system SonicStage Gmail PlayStation 3 Mac OS History of Microsoft Windows Amiga Flash memory Konica Minolta Mac OS X v10.4 Linux Sony Windows 2000 Nintendo DS Warez Unicode Blue screen of death Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis X Window System Dither High-definition television Redundant array of independent disks Apple IIGS Tungsten Handheld Apple typography Mozilla Firefox Btrieve HyperCard Commodore 64 Sharp Zaurus Mac OS history Spyware Knoppix PNG OS/2 Pixel Computer forensics TRS-80 Computer hardware Raw image format Opera (web browser) Portable Document Format Laptop AirPort Sound Blaster Oscilloscope Novell NetWare MSN Messenger Xbox 360 Ebook XD-Picture Card Danger Hiptop TRS-80 Color Computer
