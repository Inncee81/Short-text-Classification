is it possible for a linksys router that isnt online to send out a signal perhaps send out a signal with shared files i'm hoping to find a way to send files from my pc to my psp without having to save them on the memory stick or have it be directly connected to the pc my computer is part of a home network internet it certainly is possible depends on a few things if you're using xp win k or whatever on your pc you have to have file sharing turned on make sure you have a username and password set for the sharing and only share the things you intend to just in case someone else is listening next it's down to the connection method a if it's a usb connected modem router the psp can only use an over the air wifi connection e g a bg you can also do this with an ethernet connected router that has wifi make sure you turn on encryption for your safety and that your sharing psp has the same wifi passphrase or key for access b if it's a modem that has ethernet connection they usually have a mini hub with two or local lan connections in which case you can also use psp ethernet docking for sharing files if you have the ethernet dock expansion for your psp of course this can be faster and is a lot more secure but does need that extra bit of hardware finally make sure that both pcs or whatever have tcp ip addresses in the same basic range like typically y z where y and z are generally numbers in the ranges if you use dhcp addressing the default on linksys routers with ethernet or wifi this will be sorted out for you good luck Router Password Wireless LAN PlayStation Portable Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Bluetooth PlayStation 3 AppleTalk Modem Digital Subscriber Line Novell NetWare Local area network Windows XP Voice over IP Transmission Control Protocol Internet Group Management Protocol Federal Standard 1037C Computer bus PlayStation 2 PowerPC Asynchronous Transfer Mode Cisco Systems MAC address Apple Macintosh Network address translation Streaming media Internet protocol suite Broadband Internet access AirPort Computer Denial-of-service attack IEEE 802.11 Commodore 64 Password cracking ALOHAnet Atari 8-bit family Communications protocol Wireless access point Musical Instrument Digital Interface Nintendo Revolution Token ring Apple Open Collaboration Environment Windows 2000 Copy protection Network switch IPod Uniform Resource Locator History of Microsoft Windows OSI model Storage area network IP Multimedia Subsystem E-mail IP address Computer network Passphrase IMac File Transfer Protocol CPU cache Domain Name System Linux kernel Computer security Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection FireWire General Packet Radio Service Netfilter/iptables NSA encryption systems 3Com Corporation Telnet Microsoft Windows PaX Desktop computer Floppy disk Dongle MP3 Telegraphy Internet Computer hardware Virtual Network Computing Cryptography Laptop HomePNA DECnet Computer networking device IBM PC compatible Internet Relay Chat OpenVPN Hotspot (wifi) OpenVMS
