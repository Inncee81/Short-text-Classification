how do i set up xbox live through a wirelessly connected laptop connected with an ethernet from laptop to xbox ok i am trying to use xbox live i call xbox but they just tell me nonsense i am using windstream for an internet provider and netgear as a router i dont know if that info is needed i am running a wireless internet connection from my router to laptop i dont have a wireless adapter for my so i have to use an ethernet cable i know i could use my ethernet cable from my router to xbox but my ethernet cable isnt long enough i try to connect to xbox live it says i am wired but my ip address failed i tried to put in my ip address manually but it still failed so i put everything on automatic but it still fails so what do i have to do to get my xbox live working do i have to manually put all info in because i am not at home and im not using the same connection this is at someones house if i need to manually put stuff incan someone direct me to where i can find my dns pppoe settings etc if i can even get that on the net so if anybody can help it would be appreciated you should log in to the router you are trying to use to determine the proper settings for dns gateway etc also the ethernet connection on most laptops is not designed to be a pass through connection it is meant for the laptop to connect to the internet it is not designed to allow an outside device to connect to the internet get a longer ethernet cable as you need to connect the xbox directly to the router Wi-Fi Router Xbox Bluetooth Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Wireless LAN MAC address PowerPC Universal Serial Bus AppleTalk Wireless access point Cisco Systems Domain Name System Digital Subscriber Line Network address translation Telegraphy GSM services Laptop Password TIA-568A/B Windows XP PlayStation 3 Internet Group Management Protocol Voice over IP Multiprotocol Label Switching Routing WiMAX Wireless mesh network Musical Instrument Digital Interface Denial-of-service attack Wireless Application Protocol PlayStation 2 OSI model MDAC IEEE 802.11 Modem Local area network Windows 2000 SCART Computer bus Hard disk Desktop computer 10-gigabit Ethernet Computer LAN party Asynchronous Transfer Mode Network switch Federal Standard 1037C Nintendo GameCube Embedded system Universal Plug and Play Electrical wiring IPod Seismometer IMac Modchip Halo: Combat Evolved Mouse (computing) 3Com Corporation Email authentication HomePNA Category 5 cable Forwarding Telephone Power line communication IBM PC compatible Fiber distributed data interface Transmission Control Protocol AirPort IP address Differentiated services DECnet USB flash drive Telephone exchange Token ring Point-to-Point Protocol Computer and video games Common Unix Printing System Closed-circuit television Broadband Internet access Cable television Mobile ad-hoc network ATI Technologies Secure Digital card Wardriving Border Gateway Protocol Communications protocol
