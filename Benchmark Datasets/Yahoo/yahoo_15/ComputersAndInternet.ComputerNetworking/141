making a wireless connection sorry to ask so many questions but you have all helped me get this far now so now i am online using the router just it still has the entranet cable connected as there is no wireless connection available it worked perfectly with my old laptop just cant remember how i done it it is kind of hard to diagnose your problem is your wireless router connected to your modem via ethernet cable your cable coming from the modem needs to plug into the console port of the wireless router which is obvious there should be open ports next to each other and then open one by itself the console port then you need an ethernet going from your router to your pc if you have a desktop that is you need to maybe go through the setup on the cd that came with the router to set it up again another note your laptop may need to have zero wireless configuration services disabled because it may cause conflicts with intel's built in wireless Wi-Fi Universal Serial Bus Xbox Ethernet Wireless LAN Bluetooth Nintendo Revolution Modem Embedded system Laptop PlayStation 3 Desktop computer Router PlayStation 2 PowerPC IBook Xbox 360 Digital Subscriber Line Wireless access point IEEE 802.11 Personal computer IMac Windows XP Computer bus Cisco Systems AirPort RS-232 MAC address Local area network Network address translation Password Denial-of-service attack WiMAX GSM services Voice over IP Broadband Internet access Border Gateway Protocol ThinkPad Commodore 64 Musical Instrument Digital Interface Atari 8-bit family Nintendo GameCube Differentiated services Game Boy Advance Dongle Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Mouse (computing) IPod Windows Server 2003 Atari ST Linux HyperTransport Hewlett-Packard Sega Dreamcast Hotspot (wifi) Internet service provider PowerBook Quality of service Power Macintosh G3 Windows 2000 USB flash drive Apple Macintosh Internet protocol suite HomePNA Nintendo Entertainment System DOCSIS FireWire Power line communication Secure Digital card Mobile ad-hoc network MIPS architecture Internet IBM PC compatible Cable television Microprocessor Multiplayer Distributed computing Telegraphy Broadcom Netfilter/iptables Cisco PIX Wireless mesh network ALOHAnet Hard disk Windows Vista Integrated Services Digital Network Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection PCI Express Novell NetWare Television Floppy disk Computer network 3Com Corporation Internet Group Management Protocol Bus network TIA-568A/B ATI Technologies
