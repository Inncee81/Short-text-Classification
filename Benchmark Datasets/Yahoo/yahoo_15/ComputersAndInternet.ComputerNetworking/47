relocating router and computer at the moment i have my pc running off a router upstairs the walls in my house are quite thin due to the need for more space upstairs i want to put my desktop downstairs i am also runnning two laptops wirelessly off the router which also connect to the router wirelessly upstairs would moving the router downstairs reduce wireless signal quality this is hard to predict the best answer is to try it and see often if the router is on the top floor and if the signal filters all the way to the bottom floor without an issue you would be ok reversing the situation however sometimes this does not work out i suggest you try using a long patch cable rather than go through the work of installing a hard wire solution and find after doing all that labor that you have a problem if it works with a long patch cable you can then hard wire if needed Wi-Fi Hard disk Bluetooth Ethernet Universal Serial Bus Wireless access point Windows XP AppleTalk Drill bit USB flash drive Wireless LAN Nintendo Revolution Laptop Xbox Telegraphy Cable television Coaxial cable PowerPC Electrical wiring Loudspeaker Television RS-232 Linux Differentiated services Electrophysiology Computer bus Stairway IPod Category 5 cable Voice over IP Wardenclyffe Tower Embedded system Wireless Hearing aid Denial-of-service attack Closed-circuit television Seismic retrofit Floppy disk Federal Standard 1037C OpenBSD Internet Dimmer Serial ATA Windows Server 2003 Password Amateur radio IEEE 802.11 DVD Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Morse Code Sound recording Cellular network University of Scranton Barbed wire Oscilloscope Advanced Technology Attachment Telephone McMansion Serial communications Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis X10 (industry standard) Redundant array of independent disks Network address translation Email authentication X Window System Internet protocol suite IBook Ionosphere Antenna (radio) Apple Macintosh Tungsten Handheld Musical Instrument Digital Interface Enhanced 911 Mouse (computing) Mobile ad-hoc network Hewlett-Packard Local area network Action potential History of Microsoft Windows Cisco Systems PCI Express Brewery Telephone exchange Steam (content delivery) Burglar alarm Upstairs, Downstairs Color Xbox 360 Autonomous building HomePNA S-Video Dither Audiophile Pirate decryption MAC address Solar power
