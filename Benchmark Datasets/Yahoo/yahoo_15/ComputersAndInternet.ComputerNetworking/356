what is the point of a 'terminators' on the end of bus networks and how do they work when you try to use a bus network you cant if you dont have terminators why is that even when you do have a correct terminal for data to be sent to terminators are used on the end of bus connectors to prevent any signal loss they just keep the signal travelling in the network they act as absorbers and they also prevent signals from bouncing back into the bus otherwise would lead to collisions and data loss Ethernet SCSI Universal Serial Bus Antenna (radio) Computer bus ITU-T Time-domain reflectometer Token ring Optical fiber Federal Standard 1037C FireWire RS-232 VMEbus Modem SCART Transmission line Rail terminology Transmission Control Protocol New World First Bus IEEE 802.11 London Underground Switch Computer networking device Integrated Services Digital Network Coaxial cable Serial port DMX (lighting) PDP-11 Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) PCI Express Bus stop Atari 8-bit family CityRail Global Positioning System George Westinghouse Sinclair ZX81 DVD Sengkang Central processing unit Serial ATA Micro Channel architecture Reading railway station Commodore 64 HyperTransport Communications protocol Fibre Channel Oyster card Advanced Technology Attachment Physical layer Impedance matching Network topology Air traffic control TIA-568A/B Ionosphere Musical Instrument Digital Interface Diode Radio Oscilloscope TRS-80 Railway signalling Hong Kong International Airport Broadband Networks Bus network Mass transit in New York City Apollo Guidance Computer Parallel port Bay Area Rapid Transit Peripheral Component Interconnect Traffic light Radar Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing Hard disk F-V (New York City Subway service) Apple Desktop Bus Time-division multiplexing Internet protocol suite Car safety Accelerated Graphics Port Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Ultra high frequency Videotex ARCNET Transportation in Richmond, Virginia Altair 8800 Computer network OSI model Controller Area Network Motorola 68000 Wi-Fi Wireless access point Hiawatha Line Transportation to New York City area airports PlayStation 2 Very Long Baseline Interferometry Loudspeaker Toronto Transit Commission Spark plug TransLink (Brisbane) Personal rapid transit
