i need some artists out there to help me wiht this one this may sound very odd of a problem but here goes i love to draw mainly caricatures but when i draw them i hate the way they come out i guess i want them to look professional right away now how do i overcome this odd problem and continue on my journey to drawing caricatures any advice anyone has or anything that will make me enjoy my drawings ad keep them drawing a caricature is suposed to be fun for me its just frustrating this is not an odd problem grasshopper you have a picture in your head of what you want them to look like but they just arn't hitting the mark why nine times outa ten you're skills aren't up to what you want to put out this isn't a bust on you allow me to elaborate it's like drawing anything take the people you want to do even though you are exagerating the features you still have to be able to make the face look like a face start with the basics and try drawing it the way it is first it doesn't have to be super detailed but everything has to be there if you can't do this you can't caracterize it do studies of just eyes draw them realistic same with noses ears everything once you feel you have that down pretty well look at what you've done i don't mean just look but i mean really study what you have in front of you look at the curves of an ear the bridge of a nose study what you are doing i know you may be thinking i wanted to do characitures not portraits baby steps you have to walk before you can run doing things this way will give you understanding of what you want to draw later now think about ways to exagerate these things and do studies on them doing different versions of the same thing once you feel you're doing well try putting them all together get some pictures of people and give it a shot always keep in mind that you're looking for features that stand out these will be the things that will still make them resemble who the person is it's a lot of work but if this what you want to do it's worth the effort rome wasn't built in a day and niether will this i know you said they're supposed to be fun and with time they can be but just like anything else in life you have to work before you can have fun you just have to get your brain and hands on the same page before you know it you'll be making everyone look silly good luck Theory of conduct Humphrey Bogart Diving Time Out of Mind Social rule Jon Secada Shaggy dog story Game show Norway national football team Craps The Ashlee Simpson Show Care Bears Skateboarding trick About a Boy Kodocha EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an W.
