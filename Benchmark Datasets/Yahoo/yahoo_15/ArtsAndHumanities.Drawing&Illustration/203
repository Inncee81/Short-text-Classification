how do i draw a straight clean line say for instance you are drawing a line and you want it to be very clean without the line being shaky or off course how do i go about that i've already tried using my whole arm to draw but somehow my arm is even more shaky i only use my whole arm when i am doing a rough pencil sketch please note i do not intend to use straight lines for design purposes but illustration purposes i draw cartoons not plans for houses i assume you mean freehand commitment is what it takes you draw the line quickly and from point a to point b practice practice practice and thenit will happen you have to feel the line before it can be drawn just as the archer feels the target before he lets fly the shaft Drawing Archery Ammunition Perspective (graphical) Knife Comics Wassily Kandinsky Strap-on dildo Extreme Programming Cartoon Heraldry Sin City Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Poker jargon Textile manufacturing Racetrack (game) Volleyball Computer and video game genres Paranoia Agent Dr. Seuss Jam (TV series) Nuclear weapon Ron Weasley Draw poker Kyudo Battle of Agincourt Wind turbine Adobe Illustrator Whose Line Is It Anyway?
