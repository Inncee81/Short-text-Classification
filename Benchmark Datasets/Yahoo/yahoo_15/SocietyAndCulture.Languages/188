american canadian and austrailian dialects americans canadians and austrailians all speak a dialect of the english language but how long would it have taken for the dialects to become distinct from the mother tongue in other words when did american settlers colonists stop speaking in an english english accent and start to speak in an american english accent for example this isn't as complex as you might believe yet it's also not as simple first of all american english isn't uniform just as british english isn't as well the different parts of the country were influenced by different dialects of british english for example the southern dialects were influences by slaves who were brought over and they also have scotch irish influence which was heavy there in the north it was more influenced by the puritians who settled in that area that's why they drop some of their r s just as some dialects of british does still i pahked my cah in havahd yahd in my own state of pennsylvania just west of my area philly there is a german influence especially since there is the pennsylvanian dutch dialect of german but it shows up in some phrases in english i know other regionally dialects are affected by who settled there so remember that now australia has a heavy cockney influence so that even now both accents have the shift from aj the sound like ie in tie to oj the oy in boy as well as the shift from ej to aj and others consult my fair lady or a dialect book or me for more info on their vowel shifts remember that australia was a prision colony and many of the prisioners were irish or cockney sometimes more low class people of britian canada has a lot of influences like from the states and from other settlements from the british but here is another thing in recent years the dialects are possibly moving together into a new standard the reason for the change away from it was the isolation well with the media today there is less and less isolation so children in all the english speaking countries are hearing british irish american australian and other accents and there is a change they might merge and become a standard again German language Regional accents of English speakers English English American English Hiberno-English Dutch language Germanic languages Non-native pronunciations of English Southern American English Finnish language New Zealand English Old Norse language Portuguese language Hangul Vowel Japanese language Chinese language Swedish language Danish language Spanish language Languages in the United States French language Irish language Australia Standard Cantonese Inuktitut Received Pronunciation Hebrew language Inuit language Slovenian language Phoneme Welsh language Sesotho language Canadian English Proto-Germanic language Spanish dialects and varieties Korean language Tone (linguistics) French people African American Vernacular English History of the English language Greek language M__ori language Dialect Sindarin Cockney Occitan language Singlish Australian English phonology Sanskrit Taiwanese (linguistics) General American Old French High German consonant shift Swiss German Romance languages Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Vowel length Russian language International English Newfoundland Old English language Aramaic language Japanese dialects Standard Mandarin Diacritic English-language vowel changes before historic r South Slavic languages Serbo-Croatian language Indonesian language England Quebec French Hong Kong English Cot-caught merger Languages in the United Kingdom Indian English Romanian language Cantonese (linguistics) Shibboleth Swahili language Spelling reform British colonization of the Americas Bulgarian language Yoruba language
