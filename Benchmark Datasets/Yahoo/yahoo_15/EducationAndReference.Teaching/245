advice for a new first grade teacher i am fresh out of texas a m and ready to start my first year teaching in just two short weeks i will be teaching first grade which i do not have much experience with i'm hoping to get some good advice for the first couple of weeks of school and especially the first day any ideas for parent communication classroom organization activities classroom management etc will be greatly appreciated i'm starting my fourth year with st graders the beginning of the year is hard with them because they are still fresh out of kindergarten and really can't work too independently on a lot of things yet getting out homework and tearing out workbook pages will seem like such a chore at first be patient of course with practice they get better toward the end of the year you'll actually get a little bored waiting for someone to ask for help because they grow and mature so much during that year and they'll be much more independent so keep that in mind when you start to get frustrated weekly or bi weekly newsletters are great when communicatiing with parents i hate phone calls with parents so this seems to do the trick you may or may not want to give out your home email address i did my first year and luckily i wasn't bothered at home too much but i haven't any other year because i want school related issues to stay in school anyway parents love the newsletters and it helps them know what's coming up so they and their kids can be prepared always post homework buy a magnetic dry erase board and put it in front of the kids i abbreviate a lot of it so they can write it down too and it doesn't take an hour to do it like practice book pages and would be pb they understand it after a few short weeks put pencil sharpeners in your room and make sure they sharpen at least every morning they'll want to get up and blow their nose all the time so make sure you tell them unless there is snot running down their faces in better words of course hehe they are not allowed up when you are in the middle of teaching make sure though they know that if it is an emergency they can just quietly get up and do it or else you'll have can i get a kleenex questions interrupting the class it's distracting and st graders get distracted easily keep desks away from windows and doors if possible for the same reason i just mentioned give them jobs they love it messenger pencil patrol empties pencil sharpeners book patrol calendar plant patrol line leaders etc add it as part of their morning routines give new jobs every week put up lots of colors in your classroom keep plants in the room go on quick drink breaks once in a while have them get up after long mornings and do stretches with them play quiet music during private reading time play classical music while they're working when you say something to them go through with it whether it's a punishment or a reward they remember things and this can be a bad thing johnny i'm going to talk to your mother about your behavior then you don't do it and he sees he got away with it never never email parents about problems with their children call or meet face to face always first talk about the good qualities of their children stay organized it's so much easier to know where everything is take advice from your colleagues if they give you stuff and they will take it store it away for later if you don't need it right away they want to help i still get things from them create a cozy reading area i have a cozy book nook in my room that i reward quiet readers with it's for serious readers only and they know it read to them once in a while my st graders love the judy blume fudge series always have sponge activities for those minutes or so between classes activities when you don't have time to start a new lesson these can be as simple as drilling math facts playing a spelling review game but you can google a ton of these i live by them always have back up plans because nothing will ever run as smoothly as you hope laugh with them when it is appropriate but don't let it get out of hand if something silly happens don't get mad giggle it off then move on be an actress they love enthusiasm use voices gestures etc to get them interested and most importantly respect them and they will respect you Shaggy dog story Kodocha Dog training Little Britain Education in the United States Great Teacher Onizuka Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Extreme Programming Theory of conduct The Catcher in the Rye Calvin and Hobbes Avenue Q The Adventures of Pete & Pete Pitaten A Course In Miracles Spidey Super Stories Time Out of Mind Milton H.
