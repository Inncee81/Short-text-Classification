art museum and art teachers i need help okay so i need to create lesson plans math related which has to do with a museum school trip i'm not a teacher but this is for one of the prereq clasess for the credential program it's an art museum how can i possibly relate this to math help i was thinking maybe something abou tthe architecture or i dunno no clue o k so there are basically four directions you can take with this you can get the students to collect information about the trip themselves on the trip or things they saw on the trip and then graph it statistics you can help them to identify or record patterns of shapes sizes of shapes or colours within the architecture or artwork at the art museum patterns you could also use this information in your graphing you could have the students identify recreate through drawing or other means or measure those shapes sizes or distances between objects in the artwork or architecture within the museum geometry you can have them collect and use this information in their patterning and or statistics you could have the students record the information above using pictures numbers and words and calculate answers using addition subtraction multiplication or division to answers questions like how many are there or how much did you find in the numbers seeing that you're not a teacher yet i'd probably recommend choosing to do statistics and measuring activities as they are fun and don't require a huge amount of background knowledge to get started successfully with students google for lesson activities at the grade level s you need using keywords from the scenarios i've listed above look for activities that are easily moved outside of the classroom then take a trip to your museum to scope out what the possibilities are for this which artwork exhibits parts of the building are you going to have your students focus upon then plan the activity around what's available there remember to include in your plan what are the things you'll need to teach your students in the classroom before you take them on the field trip e g names of shapes how to graph using graphing paper etc also include what types of activities you might want them to do after they return from the field trip e g creating posters to show what they learned also plan for the students to work in partners on this activity in groups of supervised by a teacher teacher's assistant and or volunteering parent this helps to keep everyone on task and to not get lost hope that this helps Mathematics No Child Left Behind Act GED Jumpstart 3rd Grade Education in Romania Extreme Programming Education in the United States Homeschooling Economics Dyslexia Experiential education Glossary of graph theory C plus plus Nurse Intelligent design movement Education SAT Princeton University Sudoku Statistics Graph theory Education in Portugal Teach the Controversy Pointer Librarian Massachusetts Institute of Technology M.C.
