what are some ways to improve teacher parent relations assuming you are a classroom teacher start the year off right make a no secrets atmosphere in your classroom try to make contact in some form with every parent from your class as often as possible send a weekly e mail with classroom news send notes home about the positive things johnny did invite parents in for an author's tea student presentations or to show off other student work and so on i send a postcard to each of my students about weeks before school starts letting them know what i have done over the summer and that i look forward to meeting them the first day of school eventually when you need to contact a parent about the terrible thing that johnny did you will have already built some rapport and shown the parents that you do care about johnny and that you are worried not nagging do you use data notebooks i do it is a ring binder for each student with test scores work samples student goals copies of progress reports report cards awards and so on that i send home periodically for parents to review this helps keep parents in the loop even if they are unable to come into the classroom also remember that many parents work during the day and would like to be a part of their child's educational process but can't always make time in the middle of the day to do so be flexible offer parents the option of coming in to chat first thing in the morning or in the evening in my district parent teacher conferences are scheduled in the middle of the week from which does not make it very appealing for working parents i have always offered meetings from a m to p m on conference days and the parents are always very greatful to have that option i guess the biggest word of advice is to put yourself in their shoes how would you like to be treated approached informed and so on No Child Left Behind Act Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Education in the United States Education in Romania Homeschooling Graduate school Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 School choice Columbine High School massacre Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Lynbrook High School Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Primary education Shaggy dog story Teach the Controversy Kindergarten Gmail Student loan Reiki Hogwarts subjects Education GED Call centre Community High School, Ann Arbor, Michigan Danish Folkeskole Education Boston Public Public-key cryptography Neopets Extreme Programming Intelligent design movement Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Japanese tea ceremony Education in Japan National Football League Melbourne High School Glenbrook North High School Password Prostate cancer 1957 World Series Philosophical skepticism SAT Contract Yearbook Floppy disk Pyramid (game show) Internet fraud Stopping e-mail abuse Volleyball Cornell University Second language acquisition Center for Science and Culture Kodocha James Ruse Agricultural High School Bristol Grammar School A Course In Miracles Montessori method Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Windows Vista School discipline Education in Hong Kong Tutor Independent school (UK) Secondary education in France Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Community emergency response team Customs and etiquette of Japan The Critic Winning Streak Simple Mail Transfer Protocol Pennsylvania State University Ludwig Wittgenstein PLATO Dick Cavett Software engineering School violence Infantilism Morse Code Daria Pledge of Allegiance Steller Secondary School Objective-C E-mail Boy Scouts of America Hearing impairment Laura Schlessinger Computer Hopkins School Psychological testing
