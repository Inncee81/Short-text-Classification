teachers do you accept late work if so what's your policy i only accept it from my th graders one day late but take off i figure it doesn't ruin their grade that way but they still fail the assignment in reply to elizabeth s all the other th grade teachers don't accept late work at all and we're on a block schedule so i only see them every other day if students turn it in one day late they get two extra days to work on it or three if assigned on a friday in responce to apbanpos and others it's th grade math and they are daily assignments the other class i teach is drama where late work is almost impossible to make up especially group performances but just so you know i also have homework credit cards used sparingly which can get you off the hook from an assignment i am a older student who is currently working on her teaching degree i think that is a very fair policy even the best of students can forget to do their homework once on that note maybe give all your students one 'free pass' where they can turn in their homework day late without plently as far as your policy goes you are still giving them a chance to get some credit for their late work which is very good because it encourages them to still do it if you just say late work zero students will be less likely to do all the work for the class as other users have mentioned i also think their are 'circumstances' where flexiability with late work is a must Grade (education) Education in Romania Education in the People's Republic of China Bristol Grammar School Homework Education in the United States Education in Germany Education Hunter College High School Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Education in Taiwan No Child Left Behind Act Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Jumpstart 3rd Grade University of Massachusetts Amherst Hogwarts A-level Lynbrook High School Standardized testing College admissions Credit card Theory of conduct Education in Malaysia Bart chalkboard gags Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Boston Public Beatmania IIDX Columbia University Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Advanced Placement Program Affirmative action Master's degree MetroCard Asperger syndrome Great Teacher Onizuka FoxTrot A Course In Miracles Hopkins School Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints James Ruse Agricultural High School Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban YuYu Hakusho Irish Republicanism Stuyvesant High School Shreveport, Louisiana Extreme Programming Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Education in Japan Secondary education in France Phillips Exeter Academy Shaggy dog story Brown University Social rule Calvin and Hobbes Independent school (UK) SAT Experiential education German student movement Murdock-Portal Elementary School President (game) Teen Girl Squad Past teachings of Prem Rawat Glen Ridge, New Jersey Education in Portugal French Second Republic Education in Australia DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Franklin W.
