are teachers allowed to take the mick of students i was in science once doing a test and this lad who everyone suspects to be gay had finished his test and our teacher said he could read so this lad got out a copy of bridget jones' diary and are teacher started to luagh and call him gay and all that lot are teachers allowed to do that he does it every lesson as well i'll make it clear i'm not that kid i don't like him much not because of what people think about him he's just some one who i don't get along with yeah the uk has student counsilors not just the us and before you say i'm wrong i used to see one no teachers are not allowed to make fun of their students based on their sexual orientation or suspected sexual orientation in this case just as if peers were to make fun of someone in front of their face it's not right however incidences like these always occur and no one ends up reporting it the boy should have reported the incident to the principal especially since the teacher did it every lesson and especially if the boy is being bothered by it if you continue to see this problem occur maybe you'll be brave enough to stand up for the guy by going to the principal yourself and reporting it even if he was gay one cannot just assume that from making assumptions sexual orientation has nothing to do with how one talks dresses which book one chooses to read etc Transsexuality Human sexual behavior Sexual orientation Biology and sexual orientation Columbine High School massacre Reparative therapy Great Teacher Onizuka Gay rights Shaggy dog story Boston Public Little Britain Springfield Elementary School Big Brother UK series 6 Recurring South Park characters Landmark decision Avenue Q French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Ex-gay The Ashlee Simpson Show Asperger syndrome Kyle Broflovski Anglican views of homosexuality History of subcultures in the 20th century Social rule Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Heterosexuality Homeschooling Brian Jones (musician) Graduate school Herbert Garrison Gender role Teachers (film) Extreme Programming Education in Romania Randomness Infantilism Alexander Technique Theory of conduct Child sexuality Grade (education) Chuck Palahniuk Bisexuality The Fairly OddParents Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Treehouse of Horror V Androgen insensitivity syndrome September 11, 2001 attacks timeline for the day of the attacks Whose Line Is It Anyway?
