can anyone do correction for me in the following composition why would you be a good teacher of english as a foreign language the most important thing is that i am very much interested in english language and i have also taken english language courses at the british council another thing is that i never stop learning i am still planning to take more english language courses and i think this is the best sign of a good teacher a good teacher is someone who is always eager to learn and in search of more knowledge as i have also been an english language student so i also know what are the understanding and misunderstandings of the english language learner therefore i will be able to understand their problems and try my best to solve them i think you could express the sentences in a more elevated way for example you finished a sentence with 'good teacher' and you started the next one with the same words you should emphasize your passion for english language and more so your interest for the english speaking countries culture history etc try and compose longer sentences not too long though and use various synonyms English language English as an additional language Propaedeutic value of Esperanto Second language acquisition Chinese language Esperanto as an international language German language Past teachings of Prem Rawat Language education Ludwig Wittgenstein Greek language American and British English differences International English Scientology beliefs and practices Latin American Sign Language Finnish language African American Vernacular English Manually Coded English Education in the People's Republic of China Slovak language Dictionary Standard Cantonese Pleonasm French language Singlish Experiential education Asperger syndrome Multilingual Mathematics Education in Hong Kong Translation Logic R__maji Languages of Hong Kong Hindi Thai language Foreign language Cornish language Cultural relativism Literacy Socrates Education Current teachings of Prem Rawat Scottish Gaelic language Michel Foucault Indonesian language Spanish language Noam Chomsky Australian English Tone (linguistics) English grammar Hong Kong English TOEFL Hearing impairment Czech language Ido Philosophy of education Hungarian language Swahili language Esperanto Gender-neutral language Non-native pronunciations of English Education in Germany German grammar Arabic language Anthropology Copula Grammatical gender Autism Tagalog language Spanish verbs Intelligent design movement Tamil language Signing Exact English Bilingual education Crossword Hiberno-English New Zealand English Graduate school Truth Bah__'__ Faith and Education Teaching English as a Foreign Language Philosophical Investigations Aristotle Newfoundland English Irish language Welsh language Cantonese (linguistics) Music Poetry Formal written English - regional differences Okay Sapir-Whorf hypothesis Auslan
