power of memory education today spends too much time in terms of increasing memory skills i am in favor of memory because there are things that simply need to be memorized however i see beyond the memorization process for example as a math major i needed to literally memorize hundreds of formulas for trig calculus differential equations abstract algebra differential geometry and the list goes on i took time however to learn how to derive formulas not just memorize them math teachers love to say memorize this and you should be fine for the upcoming test what about after the test what about if i ever see those questions again are you following i believe that education should not solely forcus on memory but in actual learning your view i don't want to tell you how old i am but i took calc stats before graphing calculators i don't think my kids understand as well as i did at their age it's easier to memorize and promptly forget or learn how to plug things into a calculator and have everything magically appear i agree i think school should be about learning too much emphasis has been on testing well whether it is standardized or in class Mathematics Calculus Derivative Polynomial Algebraic geometry Manifold Function (mathematics) Special relativity Mathematics education Education Tensor Complex number Trigonometric function Explosive material Pi Geometry Ordinary differential equation Integral Mnemonic Slope TI-89 series Logic Arthur Cayley Finite element method Calculator Curve Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Gross domestic product Stuyvesant High School Numerical analysis Axiom Leonhard Euler Laws of Form Memory Trigonometric identity Formal power series Philosophy of mathematics Education in Taiwan William Rowan Hamilton Where Mathematics Comes From Supply and demand Mathematics of general relativity Aberration in optical systems Joseph Louis Lagrange Homeschooling Test (student assessment) Category theory Microeconomics Exponentiation Exponential function Education in Romania Model (economics) G__del's incompleteness theorem Education in the People's Republic of China Black-Scholes Vector (spatial) Physics Dyslexia Infinity Algebra Logarithm Richard Feynman Elliptic curve Burkhard Heim TI-92 series No Child Left Behind Act Model (abstract) Combinatorial species Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) UBASIC The Princeton Review Computer numbering formats Probability Differential geometry and topology Timeline of mathematics General relativity TI-83 series Differential geometry of curves Astrodynamics Jaime Escalante Group theory Gauge theory Normal distribution Determinant Scientific method New math Computer algebra system Economics Tangent space Covariance and contravariance Graph theory Expert system Convergence of Fourier series Graphing calculator Differential operator Areas of mathematics
