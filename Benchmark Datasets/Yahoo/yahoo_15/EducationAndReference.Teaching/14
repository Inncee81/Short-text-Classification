accountant vs teacher which one would you pick and why and why not the other i am a teacher and there are aspects i love about my job however the discipline issues are driving me away from my profession i am in the process of re examining my life and trying to decide whether to leave teaching as the discipline problems will only get worse since children are disciplined less and less at home although teachers can influence a child's life i do think this is over played and over romanticised in a class of kids with the demands of the curriculum there is little time to make a positive impact in a child's life my problem is that teaching is all i know i am highly competent and i am in my early 's if i had my time back knowing what i now know i would probably opt for accounting however as a mother there are definite advantages to being in teaching school holidays being one of them accountant and teaching are on opposite ends of the spectrum dealing with people versus dealing with figures i would imagine accounting to be as stressful and demanding as teaching but with less headaches and frustrations Education in the People's Republic of China Education Homeschooling Secondary education in Japan Software engineering Graduate school Education in Germany Beavis and Butt-head Asperger syndrome Pitaten Medicine No Child Left Behind Act Boston Public Education in the United States Teacher Aikido Education in Portugal Alexander Technique A-level Second language acquisition Martial art Tai Chi Chuan Education in the Republic of Ireland Hogwarts subjects Economics Tripartite System Psychology Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Teaching English as a Foreign Language Infantilism Karate Transsexuality Education in Malaysia Past teachings of Prem Rawat Education in France Secondary education in France Jehovah's Witnesses Waldorf Education Drama Literacy For Better or For Worse 1957 World Series Experiential education French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools Education in Romania Standardized testing Education in Hong Kong Narcissism Danish Folkeskole Education A Course In Miracles Reiki Church of Christ, Scientist Education reform Justification (theology) Profession Philosophy of education Chiropractic Academia Separation of church and state Education in Singapore Creationism Socrates Scientology beliefs and practices Philosophy of language School choice Charles William Eliot Sociology Music Instant-runoff voting Class in the contemporary United States Afrocentrism Marshall McLuhan Creation-evolution controversy The nature of God in Western theology Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Charter school Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Logic Geography Professor Hikikomori Kodocha Church of Christ Tariff Franklin W.
