year old can't remember multiplication facts my brother has add and was always a slow learner but he is going to be in th grade and he can't remember his multiplication fatcs off the top of his head he has books flash cards and other things but he just can't memorize them i have been helping him practice all summer but i was wondering if there is a better method of teaching him and helping him remember thanks you are doing a great job to help him he might find it helpful to listen to multiplication rap or other versions of songs as a math teacher every year i have students who benefit from having a multiplication chart handy on their desk for example when we are working on long multiplication using decimals i'm making sure they know the steps to lead to the final answer some students need help with their basic facts but know exactly what to do to add the zero place holders put in the decimal point etc i'm not going to let a student who is hung up on the basic facts sit there and struggle through it he she can use a chart and show me they know the lesson the facts will come when he's ready your at home practice is helpful in making this happen Whose Line Is It Anyway?
