teachers and social security why is it that teachers are not eligible to receive social security i worked for twenty years before i became a teacher and now i learn that all of those contributions i made to ss are useless to me because teachers can't receive ss benefits and to add to this i teach at a private university in the evenings am still required to contribute to social security even though they tell me i can't recevie any benefits if i've contributed why can't i receive benefits if i can't receive benefits why am i still required to contribute it doesn't make sense to me there are new rules about double dipping but you can possibly get around them if you retire from teaching with full pay and don't have to give anything back if you work then you can work a straight job you know door greeter at wal mart for years and qualify for minimuma ss in most instances it might be worth while talking with a cpa or attorney to find out your legal options i have friends who were in the military and got military retirement then worked post office and got post office retirement and then worked a warehouse job and got ss but as i said the double dipping rules have changed now double dipping my not apply to year olds so talk with a cpa retirement planner or attorney it's worth to find out what your legal options are and what the loop holes are i know people right now who are and and on pensions and working at wal mart and they will get ss at it won't be much mind you maybe a month but they will get it they will also get a wal mart k Wal-Mart Social Security (United States) Taxation in the United States Poker jargon Professor Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Unemployment benefit 401(k) Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Ponzi scheme National Insurance Pension Graduate school Plame affair Social Security debate (United States) Warren Buffett Social security United Kingdom corporation tax Israeli Arab Life insurance Unemployment Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Germany Elections in the United States Tax Juris Doctor Annuity Gross domestic product Enron Corporation Retirement plan Social rule American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Microeconomics Tai Chi Chuan Flat tax Florida Central Voter File Hogwarts subjects Blackjack Slot machine Same-sex marriage in New York Gay rights Barbara Boxer Education in Portugal Medal of Honor Augustus De Morgan Hearts (game) Watergate scandal Driver's license Glossary of American football Alexander Technique Centrelink Volleyball Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution Publicly funded medicine Lawyer Health insurance Enneagram Food Stamp Program Current teachings of Prem Rawat Social welfare Article One of the United States Constitution Unlawful combatant Education in Japan Betting (poker) Canadian House of Commons Edith Nourse Rogers Past teachings of Prem Rawat Post-invasion Iraq, 2003___2005 Hartz concept Education in the United States Teacher President (game) Karl Rove United States presidential line of succession No Child Left Behind Act Stud poker Minimum wage Same-sex marriage in Canada Wheel of Fortune Satchel Paige Trade union Table tennis Politics of Hong Kong Winning Streak Social Security Administration Supreme Court of the United States Information warfare Education in Romania Shoppers Drug Mart Rules of the road Labor theory of value Professional wrestling match types Ocean's Twelve Bruce Johnson Anarchism and capitalism Immigration to the United States Same-sex marriage Coalition Provisional Authority Affirmative action
