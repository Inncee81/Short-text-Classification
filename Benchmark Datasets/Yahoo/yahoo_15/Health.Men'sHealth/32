masturbation i mean years old and i nowadays i masturbate a lot probably once in days and it makes me feel really good but nowadays i have been thinking that i am masturbating a lot soi was thinking that will be there any problem if i continue doing this should i stop doing this first realize that your genitals are among your body's most sensitive parts their skin is the thinnest of any the younger you are the more sensitive it seems to be but it's easy for anyone to irritate or damage that skin there are types of injury that you risk temperature burns chemical burns abrasion scuffing or chafing the skin and for males damaging the circulation system in your genitals if you heat anything in a microwave oven or on a stove intending to put your penis into it or put it into your vagina test it first on your cheek or the inside of your wrist realize that anything such as vapo rub or alcohol that mildly stimulates the thicker skin on your hands arms or legs especially if it contains alcohol or menthol is likely to burn your genitals a surface that may feel smooth to the touch of a finger still could be rough enough to scrape the skin of an erect penis or the membranes that line a vagina tying a string or putting a rubber band around the base of your penis or scrotum if drawn tightly can easily damage the blood vessels inside you need those blood vessels to get and keep an erection although rare it's possible to twist a testicle around inside your scrotum so the testicle's blood supply is cut off the only fix is to go immediately to the emergency room where the scrotum is cut open and the testicle physically untwisted so as to restore blood flow there are normally no bacteria in urine semen or pre cum but your anus abounds in bacteria take great care to keep anything you use for anal stimulation away from other body parts particularly your or a friend's vagina until you can clean it absolutely do not trade anal toys with anyone furthermore understand that although not everyone enjoys anal stimulation people who do can be heterosexual homosexual or bisexual liking anal stimulation is not an indicator of sexual orientation safe lubricants commonly available at home include baby oil kitchen cooking oil vaseline and k y jelly often better when supplemented with water enjoy your body's responses to sexual stimulation but do so responsibly and with respect so you can continue to enjoy that response throughout your life Prostate cancer Personal lubricant Gay slang Intersex surgery Safe sex Puberty Orgasm Anal masturbation Methamphetamine Human sexual response cycle Erectile dysfunction Fecal incontinence Sexual intercourse Fisting Child sexuality Female genital cutting Violin Erogenous zone Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sex organ Human sexuality Traumatic brain injury Penis enlargement Bondage (BDSM) Intravenous therapy Domestic violence Drill bit Medical analysis of circumcision Transmission (medicine) Cryptorchidism Diving suit Menstrual cup Sexual differentiation Testicle Pneumonia Vagina Acne Herpes simplex virus Dildo Stroke Urinary incontinence Human anatomy Male reproductive system (human) Cancer Psoriasis Body piercing Scrotum Vulva Salad Fingers Skin Cat Genital wart 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Physical intimacy Massage Foreskin restoration Erection History of intersex surgery Butt plug Gonorrhoea Bleeding Cookware and bakeware Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pain Knife Castration Brewery Plastic Equine conformation Penis removal First aid Pubic hair Breastfeeding Hazing Eczema Intersexuality Unsafe sexual practices Foreskin Circumcision AIDS Carbon dioxide Sexual orientation Smegma Portable stove
