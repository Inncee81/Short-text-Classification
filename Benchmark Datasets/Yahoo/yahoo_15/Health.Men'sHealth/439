a good starting weight for dumbbells i'm a year old male up until last year i worked as a nursing assistant for a few years and all the physical labor kept my arms pretty tone now that i've been working a computer job for a year and getting little exercise i can tell quite clearly that my arms don't have the strength they used to been doing tae bo to improve my physical shape in general but it's not doing much for my arms i am interested in dumbbells but don't know what is a good weight to start with is a good weight something you can lift quite easily or something that will tire you out quite fast or something from between lbs seems kind of nice i can feel the weight well but it's not so much that i wouldn't be able to do repeated sets of exercises i am new to all this stuff i suggest you buy the kind of dumbbell that is adjustable and not the kind that has a pre fixed weight in that way if you feel that you are not improving with the current weight that you are using you can purchase weight disks to add to them so you can start with the smaller one if i may add buy two lbs and two lbs disks as starters you can use these dumbbells for biceps triceps deltoids trapezius chest and back with different exercises thus you can prepare yourself with these two different weights you can use the smaller one if you think the bigger ones are more difficult to handle in a specific exercise like the one handed tricep press hey you can even purchase pounders just in case with some of these exercises you can handle heavier weights and with others lighter weights are advisable do not try to push yourself and use heavy weights immediately or you'll risk injury you know that your exercise needs a little push if after three sets of repetitions your arms are still not tired you can purchase a complete set but it will be expensive it is cheaper to canvas those that give cheaper weights for the disks since you will still use the same weight only the price and slightly the quality of the disks differ regarding the exercises you can buy some mens health fitness magazine or just google the exercises too many websites offer suggestions on every body part thus it is not difficult to find one it is advisable to have several exercise on a specific body part your body can easily adjust to the stress that you give to it so be able to change your exercise say after two months of doing such it is better to keep your body guessing so to speak goodluck exercise is always good for the body Bench press Equine conformation M16 (rifle) Dumbbell Inflation Car handling Scapula Physical attractiveness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Mattress Tai Chi Chuan Elbow-joint Violin Digital photography Microeconomics Internal ballistics Gross domestic product F-16 Fighting Falcon Breastfeeding Alexander Technique Anchor Chair Phonograph Mitsubishi 3000GT Toyota MR2 Atari 8-bit family Helicopter Hard disk Bicycle brake systems Pound Volleyball Childbirth Redundant array of independent disks Overclocking Stuttering Repetitive strain injury Sport utility vehicle Aerial (dance move) Floppy disk Bruce Lee Social rule Anorexia nervosa Knife Airsoft Bicycle frame Virtual memory Table saw Handloading MS-06 Zaku II $ale of the Century Amstrad CPC Puberty Heinkel He 112 Supply and demand Back injury CPU cache Swingout Professional wrestling holds View camera Extreme Programming Butterfly stroke CPU design Turbocharger Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Casualty lifting Brassiere Heinkel He 100 M60 machine gun Windows 2000 Computer Urinary incontinence Obesity Deadlift Mouse (computing) Debugging Professional wrestling throws Wing Chun MAME Free trade Drag racing Sport rowing Fast bowling Unemployment Scientology beliefs and practices IPod Gramophone record Tire Theory of conduct Binoculars Ford Thunderbird NeXT
