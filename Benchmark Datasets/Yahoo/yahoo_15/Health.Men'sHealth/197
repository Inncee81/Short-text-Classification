men's health question ok my last question had something to do with bacterial vaginosis that i had since before i had sex and i think my bf has it so people told me he needs to get checked out to but here is the thing i have insurence but he dosent so he dosent go to the doctors or anything but i want him to go because this infection is annoying and i want to clear it up for good so what are some places he can go to be checked and treated for it i feel so bad that i gave it to him but like i said i have had it for a loong time and didnt know what it was can someone please help please and thank you i also had this and was told by my doctor that men don't get it i know i took some antibiotics and it cleared up this is not a std by the way it says it is because it can be spread to other woman if you boyfriend sleeps with another woman after he has been with you she can get it although bv will sometimes clear up without treatment all women with symptoms of bv should be treated to avoid such complications as pid male partners generally do not need to be treated however bv may spread between female sex partners look here http www cdc gov std bv stdfact bacterial vaginosis htm howget Gonorrhoea Sexually-transmitted infection Pelvic inflammatory disease AIDS Pneumonia Stomach cancer Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Prostate cancer Medical analysis of circumcision Hepatitis C Malaria Lymphogranuloma venereum Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Sexual intercourse Chronic fatigue syndrome Common cold Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Oral sex Diarrhea HIV test Anal sex Syphilis Gender identity Conjunctivitis Condom Traumatic brain injury Cirrhosis Herpes simplex virus Health insurance Sexual abstinence Lyme disease Meningitis Human sexual behavior Toxic shock syndrome Psoriasis Urinary tract infection Gender-neutral language Homosexuality and transgender Anxiety Group A streptococcal infection Antibiotic Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Safe sex Smallpox Gastroparesis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Childbirth Virus Foodborne illness Ebola Rabies Clostridium difficile Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Tuberculosis Escherichia coli O157:H7 Anthrax Cancer Asthma Monogamy Chiropractic Sickle-cell disease First aid Medicine Crohn's disease Little Britain Social rule Dysentery Transsexuality Sex education Theory of conduct Ciprofloxacin Aspergillosis History of intersex surgery Leptospirosis Cervical cancer Infectious mononucleosis AIDS in Africa Influenza Genital wart Gender role Bubonic plague Epilepsy Prostitution Sexual orientation Rocky Mountain spotted fever Chlamydia Cancer of the larynx Pharyngitis Inhibited sexual desire Homeopathy AIDS reappraisal Crystal methamphetamine and sex Dissociative identity disorder Gay bathhouse Colorectal cancer Obsessive-compulsive disorder Bacterial meningitis Insomnia Ulcerative colitis
