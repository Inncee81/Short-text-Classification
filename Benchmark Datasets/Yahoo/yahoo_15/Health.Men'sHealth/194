why those uncircumcised guy can do that but i can't why those uncircumcised guys can do that but i can't i'm uncircumcised too i know how to pull down my foreskin but some guys they just like can pull their foreskin down a lot's n mine are like just can pull down to the ''head'' it sounds like you might have a condition called phimosis where your foreskin is too tight narrow for you to easily pull your foreskin back and expose the entire glans penis head fortunately this is usually pretty easy to treat and cure the first thing you should try are stretching exercises see link for good and detailed instructions on what to do you should do those exercises for a few minutes each day for a few weeks to a month preferably right after a shower bath when the skin's most flexible if after a month and there's little no progress you should ask a doctor about certain prescription creams that'll help loosen the foreskin in one study these creams are the most cost effective treatment a doctor can provide link names of creams in one of the tables be aware that the cream s may take up to a month or more to get the full effect but you can usually speed things up a little by combining them with the stretching exercises in almost all cases of phimosis the above two treatments or a combination of the two are all that's necessary rarely will any kind of surgical intervention be needed so you should disregard any comments opinions that circumcision is the first only option as it's probably overkill and should be considered a last resort see the remaining links for some more info on phimosis and good luck with whatever you try Medical analysis of circumcision Foreskin Penis Circumcision History of male circumcision Foreskin restoration Balanitis xerotica obliterans Balanitis Smegma Penile cancer Erection Brit milah Masturbation Gliding action Psoriasis Hypospadias Urinary incontinence Ridged band Glans penis Circumcision advocacy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Oral sex Stomach cancer Massage Childbirth Circumcision in the Bible Fecal incontinence Frenulum Prostate cancer Strap-on dildo Textile manufacturing Intersex surgery Acne Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Plastic surgery Body modification Bipolar disorder Sleep apnea Genital modification and mutilation Erectile dysfunction Medicine Weight training Pharmaceutical company Androgen insensitivity syndrome Human penis size Nudity Eczema Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Urticaria Radiation therapy David Reimer Stuttering Herpes simplex virus Multiple sclerosis AIDS Orgasm Dialysis Osteoarthritis Iliotibial band syndrome Equine conformation Drowning Human sexuality Condom Timpani Social rule Chancroid Carpal tunnel syndrome Chronic fatigue syndrome Canon (fiction) Wart Penis enlargement Gay slang Birth control Doxepin Epilepsy Dermatology Cancer Medical prescription Breastfeeding Triage Penis removal Fast bowling Computer Prince Albert piercing Swimming Dog training Graduate school Parkinson's disease Common cold Vulva Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female Endometriosis Anorexia nervosa Abortion Chlorpromazine Microeconomics
