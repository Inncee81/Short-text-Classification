um last nite when we were doing ana l my bf mentiond tht he wanted to pee in my but has any other guys donl actually a lot of the guys around here have a saying that goes yeah you like her but do you like her enough to pee in her butt they say it as a joke however if you and your boyfriend might like it do it just make sure you've got a lot of stuff to clean up with i doubt you will get an infection from doing it think of what comes out of your butt for pete's sake but like i said it might be pretty messy plus who cares about what people on y answers think if this is a serious question it's something you have to decide you'd like to do or not you may like it or you may hate it Moe Szyslak The Ashlee Simpson Show Bat Lash Chappelle's Show Social rule Avenue Q Humphrey Bogart Aqua Teen Hunger Force EastEnders Joke Jackass: The Movie Little Britain Toilet humour Buttocks April Fool's Day Kyle Broflovski The Apprentice 2 Codename: Kids Next Door South Park Major League Baseball television contracts Pee Dee Fat Butt and Pancake Head Theory of conduct Empire Burlesque Eric Bischoff Jennifer Lopez Clown George Costanza Paul Reubens Strap-on dildo She Loves You Ron and Fez Teen Girl Squad Team America: World Police Stepford Cuckoos Buddy Guy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Friends The Daily Show Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Janet Jackson QI Noel Gallagher Nickelodeon (TV channel) Hey Arnold!
