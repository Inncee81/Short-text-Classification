alternative steroids i am not sure if steroids are illegal or not but i want pack some muscle on without painful threats to my health body and my balls i was wondering if there were any alternatives that have low risk and if so what exercises should i do at home i would recommend going for creatine supplements they're legal fairly easy to get but rather pricey they help rebuild torn muscles faster and can allegedly make you stronger however my friend used them for quite sometime he claimed they were helpful but stated it started becoming a mental crutch for him like he needed them to get to the next level in lifting so use them in moderation another one of my friends a prospective physical trainer suggested that one should just eat a lot during the night before training and then work very hard i know that will get you through the workout but i'm not sure if that will help you regenerate torn muscles once you certain then i guess its up to you what you want to work out i'd go to trainwithmeonline com and figure out a balanaced routine there are way to many idiots that only bench press and end up with unbalanced bodies try bench pressing along with dead lifts skull crushers shoulder shrugs squats and tricep kickbacks Bodybuilding Equine conformation Muscle Aerial (dance move) Creatine Babe Ruth Chronic fatigue syndrome Clinical depression Professional wrestling holds Ben Johnson (athlete) Aikido Fecal incontinence Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Dog Osteoporosis Tightlacing Cancer Multiple sclerosis Traumatic brain injury Tai Chi Chuan Exercise Electroshock gun Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Professional wrestling throws Powerlifting Menstrual cup Swimming Growth hormone treatment Osteoarthritis Childbirth Anabolic steroid Obesity Spanking Abortion Cannabis (drug) Breaststroke Myocardial infarction First aid Zero (Mega Man) Press up Bruce Lee Drug abuse Illegal drug trade Stopping power Baseball Prostate cancer LSD Folic acid Motorcycle Hulk (comics) Dieting Asthma Professional wrestling attacks Back pain Doom enemies One Piece minor characters Coronary heart disease Tocopherol Acne EastEnders WCW Power Plant Hypoglycemia Knife Iliotibial band syndrome Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Humerus Diabetes mellitus Arm Obstetrics Fast bowling Ferret Vegetarianism Meditation Tenshinhan Satchel Paige Vitamin C Anal sex Barry Bonds Massage Controlled Substances Act Unreal Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Transsexuality Bates Method Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Kasparov versus The World Electroconvulsive therapy Blood (computer game) Psoriasis Autism Squat (exercise) Piccolo Junior Saga Scar Hiking
