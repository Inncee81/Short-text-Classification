question about shaving after i shave every morning there seems to be a dark patch where i just shaved i took some pictures and it shows pretty bad how can i get rid of it how do you get stubbles of hair out do you shave against the grain or with it because if you shave up then you'll have ingrown hair you need to start shaving downwards not against the grain if that doesn't change anything and you have a dark patch of skin on just one part of your face then you should see a doctor because you might have skin cancer but i seriously doubt thats the case i think you just have ingrown hair Baldness Shaving Depilation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pseudofolliculitis barbae Beard Pubic hair Haircut Head shaving Waxing Human skin color Hair Global Gillette Skinhead Drug test Skin Plane (tool) Recess (TV series) Guinea pig Laser hair removal Ron and Fez Razor Mange Psoriasis Stomach cancer Woodworking G__del's incompleteness theorem Vulva Leg shaving Prostate cancer Metastasis The Ashlee Simpson Show Barber 613 mitzvot Eczema Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 February Black (people) Dandruff Alopecia areata Vitiligo Anarcho-skinheads Kodocha Moustache Wig (hair) Sideburns The Doctor Dances Joker (comics) Theory of conduct Hard water Callus Late Night with Conan O'Brien Professional wrestling match types Wolfrider H__ctor Garza Red hair Hair color Lucha libre Pilonidal cyst Tanning Vampire Dilbert Malignant melanoma Wood Melanin Hair (musical) Ganguro Androgen insensitivity syndrome Human papillomavirus Good Morning, Vietnam Radio Yerevan Social rule Nail disease Bart Simpson Yeti Three Stooges Aryan invasion theory 2000 Australian Grand Prix Radiation therapy Skin of Evil (TNG episode) Leather Kurt Angle Facial feminization surgery Meat Loaf Gothic fashion Dynamical system Calvin and Hobbes Hair metal Cantonese cuisine Five Ks Artemis Entreri Patch (computing) Dragon Booster Great Teacher Onizuka Goatee Clothing Jesus Star Trek: Nemesis Fancy rat Breath of Fire III
