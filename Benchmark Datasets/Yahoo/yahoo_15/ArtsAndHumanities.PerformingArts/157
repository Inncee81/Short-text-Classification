how do i get over my stage fright i'm not shy i love to act and dance and play piano and i don't mind being on stage but when i'm asked to sing in front of people i freak out i take voice lessons and i'm not that bad i just can't sing in front of people what do i do before you go out on stage to sing take a full minute to yourself do some deep breathing exercises to relax you clear your mind and let your body relax this also works for public speaking events also during your performance you can keep calm by not letting your eyes rest on any one person if your voice lesson instructor wants you to look around the room while you sing this lets your audience think you're singing to them not at them then never rest too long on any one person if your instructor wants you to pick a spot on the back wall and stare at it yes i've seen people want you to do this then just concentrate on that spot and don't let anything that's going on in the audience shake you also always smile this shows that you have a confidence that you really may not feel Social rule Shaggy dog story Whose Line Is It Anyway?
