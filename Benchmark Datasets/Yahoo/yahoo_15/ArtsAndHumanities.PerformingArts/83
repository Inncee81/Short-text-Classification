whats harder an three row accordian or a bajo sexto i'd say it depends on your personal perspective but imo a row accordion would be harder because i have a more difficult time dealing with different pitches with the bellows going in versus going out and i have a very hard time with guitar i think a bajo sexto would be easier because you can see the strings to pluck and know where your frets are Acoustic bass guitar Tejano music Bass guitar Norte__o (music) Sitar Violin Tablature Fret Music of Ireland Guitar Lute Twelve string guitar Pedal steel guitar Mandolin Musical notation Fingerboard Los Rieleros del Norte String instrument Music history of the United States Double bass Stanley Jordan Slide guitar Harp Lap steel guitar Organ (music) Harmonica Chapman Stick Fast bowling Dobro Intonation Banjo Complexity classes P and NP Uilleann pipes Classical guitar Hornbostel-Sachs Piano Guqin Concertina Synthesizer Cello Flutina Hurdy gurdy Viol Red Special Guitar/synthesizer Halting problem Drone (music) Floyd Rose Open tuning Fender Telecaster Electric guitar Ghost notes Grade (climbing) Ukulele Textile manufacturing Blood on the Tracks Black Sabbath Authentic performance IP (complexity) Musical instrument classification Blues ALGOL 68 Music of Madagascar Slapping Jaco Pastorius Harpsichord Tapping Plectrum Time Out of Mind Subtractive synthesis Double stop Tambura La Bottine Souriante Password Volleyball Tony Iommi MP3 Appalachian dulcimer Chemnitzer concertina Musical instrument Alexi Laiho Anton Webern Ani DiFranco Flute Cuatro Knuckleball Lyric Suite (Berg) MIDI controller Abortion Music of China Musical terminology Cricket ball Laws of cricket Batting (cricket) The Waterboys Eddie Van Halen Victor Wooten Pipe organ Popular music
