how come i can't sing and play guitar at the same time is there a reason why i can't do those things at once everytime i do i lose rhythm for both the song and the guitar is it because i am a beginner at guitar can this be solved or am i just not meant to do both at the same time the above answerers get close to it though the proper term isn't subconscious it's kinesthetic you really can't make something become subconscious but you can make it become a matter of kinesthetic awareness or in short muscle memory also it's not so much a problem of asking two areas of the brain to work together it's a matter of overtaxing several areas of th ebrain as a bass player singer i have some experience in this area here's the problem music is a global function it uses many areas of the brain in both hemispheres you're working with mathematical patterns rhythm aural sensations pitch emotions etc all at once singing involves language functions as well playing guitar involves many of the same musical processing functions as singing but also involves lots of gross and fine motor functions and different actions in one hand than in the other really it's a pretty complex activity brain wise so you take guitar playing which as you know from the necessary level of concentration just to get from chord to chord as you play and combine it with the additional brain workload of singing and you end up with a matter of difficulty which is pretty understandable so what you have to do is work stuff into muscle memory or in other words practice kinesthetic awareness the way i learned to do it was to go slowly and methodically first i made sure i was very solid on and aware of what i was playing then i figured out how the rhythms of the vocal line fit with what i was playing as i said i did this slowly and methodically working out how things fit together then i gradually brought stuff up to tempo the more you do this the easier it gets though you will probably never get to a point where it comes naturally it's just too complex an activity to feel natural the trick as with so many things in the performing arts is to make it look natural even though it isn't by the way it helps to start with something rhythmically simple just strumming on steady quarter or half notes while singing works well it's still pretty complex since you have to arrange the fingers of one hand into chords strum with the other hand and devote lots of brain power to singing keeping a simple steady rhythm in the guitar just reduces one of the many variables in the equation once you've got this you might then think about playing more complex stuff the answerer who mentioned not being able to play hands together on the piano had it right it's a matter of what pianists and drummers cal separation being able do different things with different parts of the body in a way that seems as though those parts of the body are largely unrelated it's really a matter of doing that with your brain have fun edm Stuttering Music Alexander Technique Dyslexia Time Out of Mind Bass guitar Jazz Violin Brain Music genre Human Blood on the Tracks Tablature Consciousness Musical notation Cognitive science Native American music Double bass Blues Cerebellum Trance music Music of Ireland Aphasia Neuro-linguistic programming Traumatic brain injury Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Science Mathematics Sonata (music) Big band Tonality Highway 61 Revisited Sampling (music) Human brain Marching band The Velvet Underground Neurofeedback Classical music era Clinical depression Sleep Guitar Rhythm guitar King Crimson Microeconomics Autism Synthesizer Slow Train Coming Artificial neural network Philosophy of perception Computer The Beatles Software engineering Tempo Authentic performance Proprioception The Who Hypnosis Urinary incontinence Jet engine Weight training Serialism Second language acquisition Asperger syndrome A Hard Day's Night (song) Unconscious mind Milton H.
