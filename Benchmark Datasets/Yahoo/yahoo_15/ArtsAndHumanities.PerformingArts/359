how do i properly play baritone okay so here's the scenario ever since the th grade i've been playing tenor saxophone since then i've been generally happy with that instrument i was never the best but it was fun fast forward years and here i am i'm in the marching band at my high school i've marched tenor sax for years now i've recently had a growing interest in drum corps therefore i switched to baritone i have aspirations of auditioning for a specific corps this fall but back to the question apparently the baritone and tenor sax have different embouchures that's the issue at hand i guess i'm trying to use the tenor sax embouchure on the baritone if that makes any sense the end result is a really tight stuffy sound i'm having trouble relaxing my throat to let more air flow through it's so hard to diagnose this problem myself because this is all i know does anyone have advise on how to loosen up and get a good tone get a teacher why would you think that a saxophone embouchure work for an instrument that doesn't even use a similar mouthpiece or sound generation style would work go get a teacher so you can learn to play it properly i've had many friends who went on to play in some of the best dci groups and i can guarantee you from talking to them that if you don't know how to play the instrument properly you aren't going to make it in any real drum corp because they want the best musicians they can find Big band Trumpet Marching band Baritone saxophone Embouchure Tenor saxophone Alto horn Clarinet Pet Sounds John Coltrane Marching percussion Vibrato Harmonic series (music) Flute Transposing instrument Oboe Bagpipes Sarrusophone Timpani The Beach Boys Bassoon Musical instrument classification Drum and bugle corps (modern) Mouthpiece Trombone Street-Legal Brass instrument Recorder Western concert flute Music genre Double bass Dave Douglas Phil Collins Brian Jones (musician) Martial art Shine On You Crazy Diamond Music lesson Wardell Gray Bebop Bass saxophone Morphine (band) Uilleann pipes Guitar Diving Brass band The Band Tenor Blues Horn (instrument) Jazz King Crimson Ornette Coleman Prostate cancer Hamiet Bluiett Blonde on Blonde Clef Music of Ireland Elton John Miles Davis Drum Corps International Cello Tin whistle Boyz II Men Shaggy dog story Violin The Beatles Social rule Sly & the Family Stone Adolphe Sax Baritone Turkish music (style) Philosophical skepticism Cornett Buck Fever Pitaten Non-native pronunciations of English Glenn Miller Charlie Parker Music of Brittany The Temptations Ben Webster Therion (band) Lester Young Charles Mingus Fife (musical instrument) Stan Getz Rahsaan Roland Kirk Humphrey Bogart Shot of Love Scientology beliefs and practices Tosca Louis Armstrong 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Theory of conduct Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band Streetlight Manifesto
