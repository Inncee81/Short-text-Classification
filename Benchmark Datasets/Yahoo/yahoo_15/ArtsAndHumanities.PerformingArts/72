i am and want to learn how to play the violin whats the best brand and size to start with the best thing to do is go to your closest music store and find any chinese model you will always get a good quality for their prices there are tons out there you'll just have to ask yourself how much money you'd like to spend you can even go on line and look at the colors etc if you are planning on actually playing and getting better i'd go with an instrument worth and up if that's too much money for you go cheaper but don't forget to upgrade after a while because a bad instrument will keep down your learning and performance level since you're i will assume that you're an average adult size person so you'll definitely want to go with a full size violin unlike other string instruments violins come in and full sizes not inches the chinese models usually come in complete sets with a case and a bow and sometimes even some extra strings beyond that you might also want to consider purchasing a shoulder rest without one you won't be able to play well unless you have some odd anatomy and the better the shoulder rest from the beginning the better your position and ability to focus on your left hand when you're getting better the best brand shoulder rest in my opinion is the kun there are many different versions and prices of them out there but just the simple black one will certainly last you a long time good luck Violin Double bass Viola Bass guitar Cello Mattress Harp Piano Binoculars Baseball Stars Timpani IBM PC compatible Marching band Microeconomics Inflation Electronic organ Supply and demand Keynesian economics Sergei Prokofiev Visual Basic Stage lighting Caulfield Grammar School Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Digital photography Nintendo Hornbostel-Sachs Mandolin Betting (poker) Contredanse CPU cache Stradivarius Hash table Saxophone Bow (music) PlayStation 2 Authentic performance Orchestra Shen Gong Wu Craps European classical music Philip J.
