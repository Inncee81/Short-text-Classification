i need a good beginners violin and music book any recommendations my first and best response is to ask your instructor the book that he or she teaches from is going to make both of you the most comfortable if tht is not an option the essential elements for strings has both a dvd with basic holding media and a cd to play along with it has most of the basics and will get you started i also like the all for strings method put out by alfred but it does not have the dvd if i can be of any further assistance just give me a shout as far as a beginners violin i really like the cremona vl or you can find other ones locally and again i would ask your instructor first and always but if that is not an option try folk of the wood dot com Violin Bass guitar Parachuting Berimbau BASIC programming language Viola B__la Bart__k Cello Cremona West Coast Swing Clarinet Contredanse String instrument Dmitri Shostakovich Harp Guitar Mandolin Old-time music Double bass Juilliard School Sonata (music) Bow (music) Anchor George Crumb Reversi Strap-on dildo Suzuki method Python programming language Antonio Stradivari Claudio Monteverdi Graduate school Dog training Aikido Drill instructor Visual Basic Coin magic Objective-C Tag Mario Davidovsky Zolt__n Kod__ly Charles Ives Hello world program King Crimson Dots and Boxes Gymnasium (Denmark) Igor Stravinsky Bash The Band Authentic performance Fife (musical instrument) Piano trio Magic (illusion) Antonio Vivaldi Oops!...
