i'm becoming the stage manager at my high school does anyone have any tips get organized the main job of the stage manager is to keep the performance running smoothly from start to finish you'll need to know a lot about what's going on in all the different areas is the house ready for the performance audience seated lights out are the actors in place for their entrances this extends throughout the performance lots of actors forget entrances and you'll have to chase them down props in place stage hands ready for the next set change lighting techs ready for the next cue sound effects you name it it's a big job but if you can manage it you'll be rewarded with a super successful show you should also know that it's one of the most thankless jobs in show business you have a huge amount of responsibility and practically no visibility to the audience the cast may hate you because you have to be bossy to them the only people whose respect you will earn for a job well done are the director and the rest of the stage crew but at the end of the show if you've helped make the show work the cast will probably be very thankful Stage management Whose Line Is It Anyway?
