if you've stopped shopping at walmart do you have a certain reason why i'd love to hear your stories i just recently stopped because of this story http www lamanaphotography com walmart htm i can't believe they refused to stop selling these after that happened just want to restate that this is not my story just one i found online on someone else's blog i stopped shopping at walmart years ago after they were fined for forcing their employees in many stores to work off the clock with the threat of being fired if they didn't do it since then there's been a gender discrimination lawsuit filed by million present and former walmart female employees since they openly paid women less than men that were doing the same exact job exact hours exact experience or more experience for many of the women and exact education it takes a tremendous amount of documentation to prove this type of case since who has access to payroll files walmart was fined in the last years for hiring illegal aliens in many of their stores including in my state nc many communities have fought against having walmart in their areas since they lower their prices initially drive out the competition then either hike their prices or close the store so the community is forced to drive to another community to another walmart also in many large cities walmart pays so poorly their employees are eligible for public assistance in housing food stamps and have poor or no medical insurance and need access to free medical care i believe california cities started noticing how much their public housing food stamp rolls increased after walmarts opened that's how walmart keeps their prices low they gouge their employees run out the competition and expect taxpayers to fill in the gaps in pay and medical coverage to their employees we're subsidizing walmart executives pay with our tax dollars that's the american way guess who is the largest employer in the us too walmart so when you hear about all those poor people who don't work that are on public rolls actually they work they just work for walmart who is using our taxes to make billions off of us United States Postal Service Taxation in the United States Tax FairTax Health insurance Microeconomics Economic inequality George W.
