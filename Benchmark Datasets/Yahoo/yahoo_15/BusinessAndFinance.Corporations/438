mandatory overtime part time employee my sister works part time for a company she had a verbal agreement years ago that she would have to leave by a certain time to pick up her son now they are saying each employee has a mandatory hour of overtime to be taken at the end of the day my sister cannot do this because she drives an hour each way and has to now pick up her son from kindergarten after occurances of not working the hour of overtime she will be fired i think mandatory overtime is legal but she works part time so anything under hours would not be considered time and would it i am furious with her company right now as she's been there years this sure as hell isn't ethical yes mandatory ot is legal and if she doesn't work hours she does not get time and a what they're doing is legally ok but it does seem unethical technically the workplace doesn't have to cater to your personal life unless you're disabled or something and time schedule they are there to run a business and employees are expected to comply as business changes and as management changes verbal agreements go out of the window at times other workers could claim that she's being showed favoritism if she isn't made to do the extra hour like everyone else so management has to make sure their butts are covered in that aspect after her long stay with the company you'd think they would show her more loyalty Insurance Business ethics Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Video game developer Salary Electronic Arts Wal-Mart Employment in Hong Kong Poker jargon Working time Strike action Overtime Termination of employment National Football League Contract Air traffic controller Social rule MAME Fair Labor Standards Act Extreme Programming Lloyd's of London Digital rights management Microsoft Game programming Life insurance Eight hour day Microsoft Windows 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines National Football League Lore Customer relationship management Harry Bridges Value system Ethics Workplace democracy Sexual harassment Mediation Daylight saving time Scientology beliefs and practices Outsourcing Capitalism Ice hockey Conspiracy Bruce Johnson Occupational Medicine National Hockey League Firefighter Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Offshoring Social Security (United States) Islamic banking Bully Murder Strategic management Charter of the French Language Education in the United States Sweatshop Nike, Inc.
