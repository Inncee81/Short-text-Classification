how old were you when you got your wisdom teeth removed i just got mine taken out and i'm only that's one of the younger ages i've heard my parents got theirs taken out in their mid twenties i think it would be pretty early to get them removed even late in high school i don't know how unusual is this if you got your wisdom teeth removed how old were you by the way the pain is really intense which i didn't really expect i was when i had all wisdom teeth surgically removed painful for a while don't be afraid to zone out for a little while on pain medication a few days is all you need but in a week or so you should feel almost like new just beware of infections i washed my gums with that little syringe a billion times and still got an infection in one of the cut areas and it had to be lanced open so i had a little longer healing time they usually take x rays to determine if you wisdom teeth are coming in right or will disturb your other teeth i can not imagine they would remove earlier than necessary at least i hope not sorry about the pain hope it goes away soon Wisdom teeth Tooth Milton H.
