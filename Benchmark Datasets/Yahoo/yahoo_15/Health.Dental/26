how to relieve the pain of sensitive teeth without having to go to see the dentist last time i went to see the dentist i had one injection and never went back after that i have a really painful sensitive tooth in the back of my mouth i always use sensodyne toothpaste which does help but sometimes it becomes very painful again samantha hot and cold does seem to make it worse and i needed to have the injection to numb the pain but when i was about to have the treatment done i panicked after looking at the drill and didn't go through with it in the end you will dislike my answer but reading your question made me clear that you must see the dentist you can not postpone it or you will feel worse believe me i have been in this situation but an injection is nothing compared to tooth extraction root canal i hope i have spelled it correctly tooth engraving and the pain what kills you you have a serious problem you must see the doctor i am sorry to say this but there is no heroism in your current behavior though i can understand you don't like dentists and their practice but now you are in the case of emergency and this overwrites your fears or no i can not e mail you through yahoo answers i wanted to suggest something in regard of your other question the lady who stalks you Dentistry Dental caries Tooth Mouth ulcer Scientology beliefs and practices Stomach cancer Milton H.
