will it hurt or what braces okay so i got the brackets and the spacers i got them yesterday so i m going back on the th and the th i think they're taking the spacers out on the th and well i m wondering will taking out the spacers hurt as much as putting them in or will it be like not be painfull at all also i dont have the wires yet or anything so will it hurt when they put the wires and the little metal thing around the teeth where the spacers are in oh and um the lady was saying i hope she doesnt have cavity's so they found out i had like which is really that bad at all will they fix it or somthing or no as far as i remember taking spacers out don't hurt when they put the bands around your teeth though it does feel weird kind of scrapey and tight while they're putting it on and sometimes it pinches your gums when they get it all the way down tell them if it hurts and they should be able to adjust it for you also those bands have a little thing that sticks out towards your cheeks which is where the wire attaches to at the ends those little things that stick out and scratch at your cheeks and hurt for the first few days be sure and ask for dental orthodontic wax to cover them up to reduce irritation they'll show you how to use it it's really easy and totally worth using it'll save you lots of ouchy cheeks as far as the wire itself goes it doesn't really hurt but it does feel weird it feels like pressure or pulling in the next few hours days it will be sore make sure your parents get you some tylenol or advil to take in case you'd like a pain reliever you may want to take one before your appointment to lessen any uncomfortable sensations you may experience after everything is installed depending on where the cavity is they'll want to fix it before the braces go fully on that way it's easier to reach and less cumbersome of a procedure once you've got all the parts of the braces on dental work gets that much more complicated good luck with everything it isn't so bad and you'll be happy when you're teeth come out nice Dental brace Breastfeeding Dentistry Tooth Dental caries Equine conformation Fecal incontinence Atomic Kitten Nine Inch Nails Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule Drill bit Pitaten Mattress Massage Knife First aid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Cocaine Textile manufacturing Shaggy dog story Trapping Time Out of Mind Mouth ulcer Microeconomics Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Blood on the Tracks Traumatic incident reduction Kim Possible Coeliac disease Hand grenade Barbed wire Poker jargon Bon Jovi Sampling (music) Chronic fatigue syndrome Professional wrestling holds Diving Chair Dentures Rich Mullins AFI 100 Years series Weight training Tooth enamel Futurama (TV series - season 5) Humphrey Bogart Chewing gum Prostate cancer Oral sex Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Oral hygiene The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Crown (dentistry) Piccolo Junior Saga Urinary incontinence Radio controlled airplane Hormone replacement therapy (trans) The Shining (film) Wire Late Night with Conan O'Brien Ramones Tobacco smoking Kodocha Bullet Body piercing Philosophical skepticism Sail-plan Gingivitis The Dentist Sailing Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Adventures of Pete & Pete Tetrapod Halitosis Avenue Q Karen Horney Strap-on dildo Brewery The Amber Spyglass Corset 2000 Australian Grand Prix Rose (Doctor Who) Sawfiler Plastic God Emperor of Dune Singlish Goodness and value theory
