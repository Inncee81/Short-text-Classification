i just had bicuspids removed for braces will the gaps close today i just got bicuspids teeth removed next week i will go get my braces on i was wondering the gap by where the bicuspids use to be will the teeth eventually fill in evenly its like really obvious and in my lower jaw it doesnt seem right that it would fill evenly because my teeth on the bottom are small and perfectly straight kaycee i had the same thing done before i got my braces there are very small gaps but they are not at all noticeable your braces will draw your teeth back to fill the empty spaces at least for the most part good luck Tooth Drill bit Dental brace Face Barbed wire Mandible Equine conformation Trapping Maxilla Canoe Brewery Leaf Mattress World Trade Center Textile manufacturing Trombone Carburetor Turner syndrome Jaws (James Bond) Canal lock Broadcast television system Carpal tunnel syndrome Barque Seismic retrofit Indent style Ammonite Tetrapod Dental caries Andes Timber framing Poker jargon Orthodontics Crocodilia Pterosaur Upholstery Embouchure Lathe Bracket Gray Wolf Table saw Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 IAR 80 Empty set Urinary incontinence Set Floppy disk Shark Economic inequality Netsuke Siegfried Line Doom engine Nautiloid Glossary of nautical terms Bong Casting Siphon Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Dentistry Bobby Charlton Tuatara Hamster 2000 Australian Grand Prix Tooth enamel Gag (BDSM) Naval mine Geology of the Grand Canyon area The Dentist Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina The Price Is Right Seabiscuit Seine (fishing) Piccolo Junior Saga Entropy Oral and maxillofacial surgery Heraldry Tlingit Physical characteristics of the Buddha Milton H.
