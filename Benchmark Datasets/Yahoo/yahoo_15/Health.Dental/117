not satisfied with porcelain crown what should i do now i recently a few months ago had a root canal and a porcelain crown porcelain fused to metal done at the dental cosmetic center of houston to the first 'molar' tooth behind my left canine upon arrival at home i looked in the mirror and was a little taken aback by it i could clearly easily distinguish it from the rest of my teeth for it had a very prominent dark grey line at my gum line i asked about this at another visit and the dentist sort of suppressed the inquiry and said that it was my natural tooth structure and that he could not see a line bs so after a normal brushing this is about two months later i noticed a dark spot on the inner side of it in the shape of a circle i tried brushing the hell out of it and flossing it it would not come off my mom believes it is the porcelain that has worn off these crowns are supposed to last a long time i want an all porcelain crown they never told me it would be a pfm what should i do now well the line that you are seeing by the gum line is the metal showing this part should be tucked up underneath the gums so it is not visible however old age or receding gum lines can cause it to show way in the future depending on your age also it sounds like they did not pick the correct shade there are a lot of shades to pick from they should have matched you up with a shade guide then let you look at the color they chose to see if you like it as well one thing they are correct about is that you dont want an all porcelain crown for a molar tooth they are good for anterior front teeth but not molars the reason why is because that is where all your biting force is and it will easily break he probably knows he messed up and does not want to admit it because then he will have to pay the lab about dollars to replace it he should of had to check it out though before he cemented it you have to choices either go back and demand he replaces it because you are very unhappy with it or live with it Tooth Dental caries Crown (dentistry) Tooth enamel Maxilla Dentistry Hangul Mandible Bruxism Oral hygiene The Dentist Gray Wolf Dentures 2000 Australian Grand Prix Drill bit Wallpaper group Nine Inch Nails Cosmetic dentistry Evolution of the Horse Halitosis Dental floss Microeconomics Snooker Chewing gum Evidence of evolution Fast bowling Pottery Sundial Equine conformation CPU cache German Shepherd Dog Plastic Heraldry Mojave people Money Social rule Macropod Textile manufacturing Dog training Color Cocaine Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sperm Whale Sphenoid bone Combine (Half-Life 2) Sawfiler The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Dental implant Occipital bone Bulk vending StarCraft Episode VI Explosive material EastEnders Umlaut Root canal Bass guitar Spanish verbs Opportunity rover Progressive rock Economics Dentition Gold Oral sex Tire Knife Fluoride therapy Characters in the Smurfs Toothbrush The Ashlee Simpson Show The Joker's Wild Los Angeles Kings Vernon Schillinger Slot machine Shawn Michaels StarCraft: Uprising The Amazing Race Temporal bone Piccolo Junior Saga The Contender (television series) Hollywood Squares Sydney Riot of 1879 Knots Landing Color blindness Dark Phoenix Saga Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Charles Goodyear Quarashi Netsuke The Invisibles Paul Is Dead
