wisdom teeth i went to the dentist yesterday and he told me that in the next years all of my wisdom teeth will have to come out and i'm really nervous about that and i plan on putting that off for a while until i get my root canal done but i heard that getting them pulled hurts and all kind of stuff is it really that painful plus he said i need to go to a special place to get them done why is that oh and they haven't grown in yet but he noticed them on the x ray and they looked very screwed up going in all different directions would i be asleep since all four have to go and would i go to an oral surgeon instead of a regular dentist office most general dentist dont do a lot of extractions especially wisdom teeth most people's wisdom teeth aren't fully errupted above the gum line as much as they should be when they need to come out usually need to come out because they are impacted or crowding the other teeth usually an oral surgeon is the best place to have them extracted they may need to be surgically extracted dont be nervous almost everyone has their wisdom teeth extracted most likely you will be put to sleep for the procedure anyways so you wont even remember what happened you'll just need someone to drive you there and dont make any plans for the next day or two Dentistry Tooth Wisdom teeth Surgery Orthodontics Dental caries Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Dental brace Dentures Carpal tunnel syndrome Oral hygiene Anesthesia Oral and maxillofacial surgery Root canal Urinary incontinence Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Tooth enamel Theory of conduct Bruxism Shaggy dog story The Dentist Ayyavazhi mythology Gingivitis Crown (dentistry) Humphrey Bogart Abortion The Shining (film) Psychosurgery Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Dental implant EastEnders Halitosis Mouth ulcer Hypnosis Oral sex John the Baptist Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Intact dilation and extraction Time Out of Mind Philosophical skepticism Methamphetamine Nine Inch Nails Fecal incontinence Space opera in Scientology doctrine Maxilla W.I.T.C.H.
