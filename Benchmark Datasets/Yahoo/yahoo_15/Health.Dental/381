should i get a gold tooth i have to have a crown on a tooth thats right next to one of my wisdom teeth enamel and gold cost about the same which should i get gold crowns have a better fit they are thinner so they can reduce the tooth less and have good occlusion they can also last longer because they have a better fit around the margins and stand up to mechanical wear in the mouth better gold is usually more expensive by about the gums typically tolerate gold crowns the best less inflammation and bleeding around them porcelain crowns are very natural looking and can also have a great fit they can typically last years sometimes even longer they are less expensive than gold you have to be a bit more meticulous with your flossing to maintain healthy gums around porcelain crowns i would never recommend a stainless steel crown they are not custom made and do not withstand the pressures and biological stresses in the mouth very well the gum tissue is almost always inflamed around stainless steel dental work it depends on whether people seeing it will bother you because even if it's on the second to last tooth if you laugh people will see it but gold will be your best dental investment in my opinion i would say about of the people i work with in the dental field would choose a gold crown hope this helps Dental caries Tooth enamel Crown (dentistry) Oral hygiene Drill bit Dental fillings Dental brace Dental floss Dentistry Gingivitis Halitosis Welding Breastfeeding Cookware and bakeware Plastic Knife Corrosion Motorcycle Gas metal arc welding Fluoride therapy Transformer Orthodontics Psoriasis Dentures Chronic fatigue syndrome Sawfiler Coeliac disease Terminal ballistics Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cosmetic dentistry Cocaine Bulk vending Radiation therapy Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Wisdom teeth Chewing gum Fusion power Insurance Tooth development Dental implant Jet engine Mouth ulcer Glass Diving cylinder Stomach cancer Tetrapod Spark plug De Lorean DMC-12 Bicycle Face Hypoglycemia Bicycle frame Toothpaste Gypsy moth Shark Metallurgy First aid Turbocharger Atherosclerosis Steel Mattress Prostate cancer Stroke Cat Glossitis Wind turbine Nutrition Place of articulation Stainless steel Carpal tunnel syndrome Screw Cartridge (firearms) Carburetor Porcelain Oral cancer Stem cell E85 Microeconomics Tocopherol Tire Hydraulic machinery Acne Ceramics Urinary incontinence Toothbrush Inflation Fountain pen Domestic rabbit Pronunciation of English th Gold as an investment The Dentist Order of Canada Non-native pronunciations of English
