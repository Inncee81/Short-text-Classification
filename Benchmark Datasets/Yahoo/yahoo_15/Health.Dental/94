is there any other way im and my teeth i've been noticing are slowly moving apart from eachother it never was like this before and i was wanting to get braces to fix them up is there any other way to get them to stick back together other than having to get braces thank youu does it hurt to get that it's not a quick solution but you'll be growing more molars in so your teeth might push forward then also after you're or so the dentist could do a procedure that caps your teeth making the caps a little bigger than your natural teeth are filling in the spaces they can't do this until your teeth have stopped growing though so you have a few years to wait just a note that might not make any difference to you but jewel the singer said in an interview once that she wanted to have her one crooked tooth fixed and her fans booed her and wrote her begging her not to do it they loved her look because she didn't look like everything other barbie doll pop star and when leanne rhymes got her teeth fixed so she didn't have a gap anymore she lost the one thing that made her uniquely beautiful now she just looks like everyone else and if nothing else it's easy for you to floss right now whatever you choose good luck Dental brace Tooth Dental caries Super Mario 64 Ed, Edd n Eddy Dentistry Tooth enamel The Fairly OddParents Shaggy dog story Richard Rahl Quarashi Characters in the Smurfs Billboard Hot 100 Nine Inch Nails Piccolo Junior Saga Skateboarding trick Jennifer Lopez Cliff Richard Kodocha Spice Girls Oral hygiene Poker jargon Aquarium (album) One Tree Hill (TV series) Aerial (dance move) Jon Secada A Day in the Life Kim Possible Journey (band) Carpal tunnel syndrome Milton H.
