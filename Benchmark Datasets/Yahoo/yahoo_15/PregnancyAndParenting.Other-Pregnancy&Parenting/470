how far should you let racism affect your life my husband i want a large family we want to have kids biologicly adopt i was raised to not see the color of someones skin my husband was raised to actually believe that black people are generaly alright but shouldn't be allowed to mix with white i'm glad to say he doesn't believe in this although thats how his parents are now when i look online at adoptable children the majority of them are black one girl in particular i just fell in love with right away considered adopting her then i realized how his parents would react how where we live theres maybe a black population how other's backwards attitudes might affect not only us but the child now i can handle rascist remarks would be ready to stand up for my child but i worry about the child if it would be a negative affect on her i would love her make a good mother for her but is that enough in todays society everyone says racism's a thing of the past but is it really tell me what your opinion is please read my question thoroughly before answering my husband is not rascist at all he'd make a great father his parents are rascist and live very close to us i don't want them saying anything that might affect the child but i really love her and feel we'd make a good mother daughter match despite color her and i are such a perfect match she is five and sooo pretty she has some emotional problems and i've studied psychology for several years and believe i can help her she's also very close to her brother who she's lived with all her life but recently was taken out of his home because although he did his best he wasn't able to fully provide for her and he gave her up which was hard on both of them and if i adopt her i plan to make sure they stay in touch she also has found a love in swimming which is my favorite hobby as well she loves visiting the beach and my family goes to the beach at least twice a year it just seems so right thank you all for your answers you have a great heart and i think what you want to do is awesome there are so many children out there in need of some affection racism is still out there i think it will never stop just go to other sections on yahoo answers and you will see i went once and never went back what people had to say what just so disturbing this is a hard subject i wish i could tell you how the child would feel she might grow up to let it affect her or she might flip all that around and it will make her stronger i guess it all depends on the people supporting her you sound like a very nice person that would do whatever it takes to make that child feel good about herself you rank high in my book you have a lot to give and want to share it you have a big heart and i think that's all that matters as long as you have your husbands support i don't think anything else should matter i wish you the best of luck with your decision which ever one it turns out to be i know you and your family will succeed at what ever you set your minds too god bless you all Theory of conduct Transactional analysis One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada Pitaten EastEnders Charmed Infantilism W.I.T.C.H.
