abortion why is abortion a woman only question why does the father not have the same legal rights to determine the existence of his child under uk law edit i understand that a woman has to carry and give birth to to the child but why should that be a a reason for a comitted father not to have a say wether the baby is born or not he was at least the reason why the child was conceived and to give a selfish reason if the child is born a father has to pay child support towrads the baby surely in todays society this should amongst other reasons entitle him to a say excellent question unfortunately you make too much sense for many people to comprehend the same ones yelling my body my choice are the same ones who'll go chasing the absent father with the ironic statement it takes two to tango st century society and statements like 'my body my choice' are producing men who are scared to become husbands and fathers instead of making equal rights for men and women the legal system is now at the point where it punishes a man who has children he can't afford but rewards a woman who does the same thing the truth is most men don't want to 'control' a woman's body or her decisions they only want some say when it's a decision that could affect their lives forever which a baby definitely does but if you want of the choice then you should be held accountable for of the responsibility Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Abortion in the United States Ethics Simone Weil Free will Mary, the mother of Jesus Slander and libel Capital punishment Rick Santorum Goodness and value theory Civil rights Theodicy Marriage Divorce Theory of conduct Roe v.
