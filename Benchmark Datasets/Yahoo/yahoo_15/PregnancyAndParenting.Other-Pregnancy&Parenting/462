advice on having babies months apart our daughter will be months old when our son will be born in early december does anyone have any good advice or has gone through the same thing i'm just wondering what everyone else has gone through with kids less than two years apart my kids were close to the same they were months apart making sure that my oldest got mommie time and felt like a part of everything to the fullest really helps then she he won't be acting out because the attention from mommie is now split also it really is much nicer for sleeping since the oldest still takes naps just make sure you and baby lay down also sleep is a huge part of being able to function with two where before you could just sit with baby as much as you wanted to now you have one to chase while holding also if you have a relative or someone who would be willing to help out the first bit it is great for the oldest to get to go on special dates with someone other than that there really isn't a rule book it is hard but totally can be done good luck and hope all goes well for you AFI 100 Years series The McGuire Sisters Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Contender (television series) Care Bears Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Avenue Q The Catcher in the Rye Kimi Finster Jon Secada EastEnders Social rule Poker jargon Radiohead Infantilism Charmed Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Mommie Beerest Breastfeeding Hereditary peer Something Positive Characters in the Smurfs Appeal Theory of conduct Girls Aloud Pitaten Garfield Cliff Richard Textile manufacturing Super Mario Bros. television series Urinary incontinence Boston Public The Pilgrim's Progress Aerial (dance move) Characters of Lost Parliament of the United Kingdom Ageplay Mattress 2000 Australian Grand Prix Characters from Arrested Development Privy Council of the United Kingdom Phoebe Halliwell Baby Blues Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Sharon Tate Volkert van der Graaf The Critic Penda of Mercia Honey and Clover Negima Days of our Lives Mina Mongoose Milton H.
