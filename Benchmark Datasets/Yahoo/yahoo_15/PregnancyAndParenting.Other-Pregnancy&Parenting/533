okay everyone i really want a baby okay so heres the deal i am married with children already i have a wonderful husband and two of the best kids in the world i am absolutely in all ways a lucky woman i want to have another child and i know that it makes my husband so excited to think about it the thing is we really don't have the money i feel as though that don't matter in ways though if we all waited until we were financially stable we wouldn't have babies right well my children are and and i don't want them to be spread apart much further than that i want them to grow up together and not have one be alot older than the other what do you think we should do try or not am i being greedy with wanting another child to love i absolutely love being a mommy advice please no that financial stability part may not be true to everyone and i don know what it is like to grow up with children that are not your age my brothers are and years older than me and my sisters are and years younger i understand this stuff that is why i want what i want i don't just decide okay thats how they should be raised everything i have said is because of everything i have been through and the who financial stuff great you know if you were born into a rich family lucky you some people work hard for what they have and what they try to provide for there children not all people are that lucky and i don't even consider it luck i for one would not want to be a paris hilton or whoever i am proud to say that i am a working mom and i come from a hardworking family thats my comments on yours i would like to add a thank you to all of you who have answered and put some thought into it i really appreciate it it really is so hard to decide knowing what we want but also trying to know what would be best for my family thank you for the advice on everything i have one boy and one girl see i am lucky i do not have baby clothes because my husband and i made a big move and i got rid of that stuff however i have plenty of neices and nephews and friends who have children and baby stuff it sounds to me like you're just looking for people to agree with a decision you've already made it sounds like what both you and your husband want is to have another child and there's nothing wrong with that i suggest you sit down together and figure out what this child will cost what you'll need and what you can live without to make it happen will you breastfeed it's cheaper than bottle feeding do you have people who will lend give you the essentials crib stroller etc etc do you get a mat leave at all how far will this put you in the hole if anything there's a saying that goes you only regret the things you don't do in life not the things you do if you truly want a third child and can provide it with the necessities of life shelter food clothing and a whole lot of love then do it you won't regret having a third child but you just might regret not having one and lastly remember that your life will change adding another child into the mix as long as you're prepared for that and willing to accept it then you're on the right track good luck Cliff Richard Time Out of Mind Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct EastEnders AFI 100 Years series Infantilism Kimi Finster Knots Landing Social rule Married... with Children Rich Mullins Empire Burlesque Blood on the Tracks Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Little Britain Avenue Q One Tree Hill (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga The Adventures of Pete & Pete Frankie Laine Breastfeeding Doug The McGuire Sisters Charmed The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Laura Schlessinger The Lovely Bones Characters in the Smurfs The Catcher in the Rye Rais massacre Scrooge McDuck Zhao Yun Luck About a Boy God Emperor of Dune Big Brother UK series 6 Pitaten Days of our Lives Microeconomics Great Teacher Onizuka The nature of God in Western theology Rugrats Fiddler on the Roof Year of the Spider The Emancipation of Mimi Satchel Paige The Chemical Brothers Neighbours W.
