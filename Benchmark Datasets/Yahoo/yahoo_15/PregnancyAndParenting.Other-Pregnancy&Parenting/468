do a heavy sleeper wake up when their baby cries i was just wondering if any mothers go through this and is it hard to wake up it scares me to the point where i don't think i would be able to be alone at night with my baby no i don't have any kids it just scares me thank you i used to be able to sleep through anything and i really mean anything when i was pregnant especially towards the end i was getting up every hours to go pee when the baby came i was only asleep anyway and able to jump up for the baby right away second of all i had the baby in the bassinet for the first few weeks months and was used to his schedule by the time it came to put him in his room as long as my door is open and his is closed i can hear him anytime of the day or night i swear that the main reason you have to sleep so poorly when you are pregnant is just to get you used to sleeping poorly when you have a new baby Humphrey Bogart Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pregnancy Urinary incontinence Sleep EastEnders Knots Landing The Amber Spyglass The Shining (film) Jon Secada Daylight saving time Tupac Shakur Narcolepsy Ron and Fez AFI 100 Years series Shaggy dog story Futurama (TV series - season 5) Slow Train Coming Breastfeeding Friends Lisa's First Word Treehouse of Horror XII History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Mattress Insomnia Time Out of Mind The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Sami Brady The Contender (television series) Journey (band) Jam (TV series) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Catcher in the Rye Sudden infant death syndrome The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Fertility awareness Hansel und Gretel The Marriage of Figaro Co-sleeping Premature birth Passenger car What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
