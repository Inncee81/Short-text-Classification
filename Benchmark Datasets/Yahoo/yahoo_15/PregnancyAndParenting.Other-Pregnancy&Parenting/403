i'm babysitting tonight for money and i dont know how much to charge i'm and the girl is my bestfriend theyre going out to dinner and are leaving a year old with me how much should i charge for about and a half hours the mom insists on paying me but didnt specify how much i just need an estimate on if she asks it all depends on how they are financially and how well you know about babysitting and if all you're doing is babysitting if you're good at babysitting and they are ok financially and all you are doing is babysitting and nothing else i would charge an hour if they are asking you to do something else besides babysitting and you can do it then go up a dollar if you think it's too much for them then stick with an hour or if you prefer to do it this way where you're not comfortable to tell them what you charge just say whatever you can give that's what i always do 'cause i never know how they are financially to tell them what i charge have fun good luck Tag Day care Calvin and Hobbes FoxTrot Cooperative Jennifer Lopez The Tracey Ullman Show shorts Lizzie McGuire Grandview, U.S.A.
