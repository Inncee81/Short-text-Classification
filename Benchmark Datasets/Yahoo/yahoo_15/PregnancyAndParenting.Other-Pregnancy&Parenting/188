is it possible to create a human child from two eggs i was wondering if science has yet found a way to manipulate them somehow so that a baby could be born sharing traits of both eggs no the males sperm must be present to create life baby making basics conception is based on an intricate series of events every month hormones from your pituitary gland stimulate your ovaries to release an egg or ovulate this often happens around day of the menstrual cycle although the exact timing may vary among women or even from month to month once the egg is released it travels to the fallopian tube if you want to conceive now's the time the egg has about hours to unite with a sperm since sperm cells can survive in your reproductive tract for two to three days it's best to have regular sex during the days leading up to ovulation if the egg is fertilized it'll travel to the uterus two to four days later there it'll attach to the uterine lining you're pregnant your periods will stop as your body begins to support the embryo if the egg isn't fertilized it'll break down and you'll have your next period as usual Ovulation Infertility Ovary Sexual reproduction Fertilisation Female reproductive system (human) Fertility awareness Endometriosis Emergency contraception Polycystic ovary syndrome Oral contraceptive Estrus cycle Intersexuality Ovum Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sexual intercourse Endometrium Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Androgen Twin Uterus Fetal development Miscarriage Ovarian cancer Ectopic pregnancy Flowering plant Testicle Obstetrics Swyer syndrome Sterilization (surgical procedure) Abortion debate Amenorrhoea Meiosis Childbirth Pregnancy (mammals) Man Human cloning Progesterone Gynaecology Sexual differentiation Embryo transfer Gonorrhoea Chakra Growth hormone Endocrinology Semen Parthenogenesis Spermatozoon Pelvic inflammatory disease Endometrial cancer Premature birth Urinary incontinence Vagina Carpel Shark Male reproductive system (human) Tsetse fly Digenea Sex Ovarian cyst Delayed puberty Luteinizing hormone Breastfeeding Pituitary gland Growth hormone deficiency Multiple birth Oxytocin Gonadotropin-releasing hormone Drosophila melanogaster Edward's syndrome Chimera (genetics) Abortion Stem cell Prostate cancer Anatomy Platypus Biology and sexual orientation Jurassic Park Spider Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Endocrine system Estradiol Human sexuality Cryptorchidism Gynecologic hemorrhage Human development Earthworm
