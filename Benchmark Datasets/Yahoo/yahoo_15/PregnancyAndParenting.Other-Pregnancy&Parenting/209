was your hubby scared to have kids too my hubby and i have been married for year he's and i'm when we got married my hubby told me that after we were in a house for year we would start trying for a baby it'll be a year at the end of august acouple weeks ago i asked him where he was at and he told me he was getting closer and closer to wanting a baby but that he was scared that he'd be a bad father because his parents were horrible and he had such a bad childhood since he didn't really give me an estimated date as to when we would be starting to try i asked him again acouple days ago he said stop asking me i'll let you know when i'm ready the way he said it was rude and now i'm getting pissed off i'm starting to think he doesn't want kids cause he's never been excited about it and keeps avoiding talking about it what do you think i held my end of the bargin i got us a house and we are doing pretty good financially where your husband bf's just as scared i feel like i can't just let it go it's driving me crazy i'm a planner and it's important to me to take my vitamins and continue to eat healthy and exercise before i get pregnant i want to give any possibly te best start and i can't do that unless he gives me a time frame what should i do how can i help him along i understand your frustration i have never met a man that was eager to start a family most men think of children in a different light than us women my husband kept insisting on waiting until we were settled too i now thank him for doing so we were together years before having our baby now months old i am as well and very happy to be a mother but boy is it tough you have to make sure both of you are sure before getting pregnant it is going to change everything about your life it is the most challenging thing my husband and i have done and i am glad that we waited until we were both excited about the idea it would be a much different experience if only one of us was happy about it it is very normal for your husband to be scared about such a big life decision my husband was petrified about the whole thing pregnancy me giving birth dirty diapers the baby crying my husband turned out to be an incredible father but i think that is because we waited until he was ready for the changes that came hang in there give hime another year or so and enjoy your alone time he will come around in his own time believe me this is not a decision that you want to pressure him into my husband and i are already in negotiations about having another baby that is just the way it goes women want babies and men don't necessarily see the rush good luck Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Kodocha Pregnancy Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends One Tree Hill (TV series) The Ashlee Simpson Show Infantilism Breastfeeding The Fairly OddParents Social rule Alois Hitler Jon Secada Kender About a Boy Sharon Tate Jennifer Lopez Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Boston Public Piccolo Junior Saga The Smoking Room Jam (TV series) The Contender (television series) Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Miss Saigon The Empty Child The Star Wars Holiday Special Milton H.
