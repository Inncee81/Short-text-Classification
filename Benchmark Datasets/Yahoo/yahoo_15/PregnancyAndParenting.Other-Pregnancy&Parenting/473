do you think employers would wanna employ a weeks pregnant i wouldn't tell anyone but family that i was pregnant until at least you pass the first trimester mark applying for a job i wouldn't tell them i was pregnant if you do tell them they aren't going to say well we aren't looking to hire pregnant people right now it's going to be we found a candidate that is better qualified or we have hired someone for the position when they call you back if they even call you at all you are only six weeks along unless you are having a football team you aren't going to start showing for a while now at least obviously showing it may seem a bit deceptive to not tell a potential employer but if you are telling them chances are you are not going to find a job and since kids are very expensive my bet is that you want a job i would not tell them take the job then you can tell them you are pregnant somewhere in the range of to weeks along in your pregnancy if you aren't showing you could wait even longer the only thing i can think of off the top of my head here is that if you are looking for insurance most places are going to count your pregnancy as a pre exsisting condition and your prenatal care and delivery will not be covered basically if you are going to announce to potential employers that you are pregnant you might as well not even bother looking for a job from the employers prospective you are only going to be around for about seven ish more months and then you will be gone for at least two months if you even return at all it's a loss on their end to go through the entire training process etc in most cases they are going to not hire you Pregnancy Obstetrics Miscarriage Abortion debate Unemployment Roe v.
