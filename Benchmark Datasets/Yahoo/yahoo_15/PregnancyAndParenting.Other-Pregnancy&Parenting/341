do you allow children disciplining children in your household when i was about maybe my older sister who was at the time and i got into a huge verbal argument i remember cursing her out calling her a f king c t and she got mad as hell she dragged me by the arm to the kitchen sink and pinned me against it with her body she grabbed the bottle of palmolive dish liquid squeezed open my mouth and poured some of that horrid stuff in my mouth when i was able to get away i ran to the bathroom and did my best to rinse out my mouth by adding water it made it foam up more when my parents came back i told my mother what happened she didn't look to happy but she said i deserved it would you allow your children punishing their siblings in your house no way would i allow that type of discipline from an adult or a child i wouldnt allow a child to discipline another child because of the simple fact the child whom is being disciplined is going to think that it is ok for anyone to push them around and tell them what to do which isnt good for their personality when the get older your mother should not of allowed your sister to be disciplining you in the first place now i can understand watching babysitting you at the age of but no discipline that is just simply the parents job so i guess my answer would be no no no no that just isnt right because the older child will take it to his or her advantage and preform unneeded ungodly acts just like the own you explained above EastEnders The Shining (film) Theory of conduct 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Kitchen Theodicy Pitaten Shaggy dog story Spanking Rais massacre The Fairly OddParents Piccolo Junior Saga Humphrey Bogart The Inside Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Blood Simple Professional wrestling throws Sola fide Second Battle of the Atlantic Professional wrestling holds Father's Day (Doctor Who) The Star Wars Holiday Special Syphon Filter Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City Sin Punishment Meat Loaf Infant baptism 2000 Australian Grand Prix Aerial (dance move) Tag Motion picture rating system Controversies in autism Family Incest Chuck Cunningham syndrome Kain (Legacy of Kain) Abortion debate Friends Knots Landing Kodocha Swimming Milton H.
