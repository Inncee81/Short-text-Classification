are you offended when your children aren't invited i am getting married in the spring we are considering not inviting children to the ceremony reception for the following reasons our recection hall has a max limit of guests but our friends family who we are pretty sure will attend have total children we are having the reception catered at approx per person that will be very expensive to feed all of those kids our reception will be in a yr old home that is being kept up as a museum we will be liable for any damage done to the home or gardens we are planning on an open bar when i have suggested that kids may not be invited for the above reasons some people are understanding but others have gotten upset said they won't come if they can't bring their kids although i like kids i really don't feel they are appropriate for every setting i just don't understand why some people feel they can't enjoy an adult event is it really a valid excuse if someone says they can't find a babysitter i mean they are aware of the wedding months in advance surely that is enough time to make arrangements afterall parents are able to find babysitters when they really need to we did not invite children to our wedding and we also did not have children as part of the wedding ceremony i'm not offended when the children are not invited it allows me time to actually enjoy the wedding ceremony and reception without keeping track of my children we are going to a wedding this weekend and my oldest children ages and were invited but not the youngest ages and and i felt slightly offended at first that the oldest were ok but not the youngest until i really thought about the reasoning behind it so we are going with the oldest and will have a great time i'm sure also my cousin got married a few years ago and didn't invite children but she also paid for a couple of babysitters to stay at her moms house for family members children just a thought good luck and congrats Marriage The Fairly OddParents Day care White wedding Friends Social rule Infantilism Wedding Crashers Kender God Emperor of Dune Avenue Q Yoko Ono About a Boy George Costanza Abigail Folger Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Malcolm in the Middle Marilyn Monroe Timmy Turner Same-sex marriage Humphrey Bogart Neighbours EastEnders Pitaten Adoption Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Britney Spears Insurance Wedding reception Haven (TNG episode) Baby Blues British Royal Family For Better or For Worse Miss Saigon Alois Hitler The Giver Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Vicky (The Fairly OddParents) Kodocha Divorce Everwood Polyamory A Milhouse Divided The Catcher in the Rye Buckingham Palace Education in England Surveillance Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ABBA Incarnations of Immortality Sydney Riot of 1879 Satchel Paige Leasehold estate Excommunication Kimono We Belong Together Futurama (TV series - season 2) Autism rights movement St. Elmo's Fire (film) 2000 Australian Grand Prix Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Billy Joel Good Times Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles Will & Grace Culture of the United States One Tree Hill (TV series) Kyle Broflovski Elvis and Me Shaggy dog story Edward S.
