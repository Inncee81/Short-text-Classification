women only the right time to conceive hi i always thought id be a person who got accidently pregnant or only had to try once i decided i would start trying months ago and had my implant taken out straight away but still nothing i get my period every twenty eight days like clock work each cycle i make sure we try on day and of my cycle and still nothing anyone whose conceived successfully what is your advice my colleages etc just tell me to stop thinking about it but i cant thanks for help yup you do just have to stop thinking about soo hard to do i know but if you can just let nature take its course it will happen soon enough if your periods have always been like clockwork it should be easier but not always how long have you been trying for there is truly only a chance of successful fertilization of the egg each time you try so don't despair we tend to get obsessed with the idea and goal its like we think something is wrong if it doesn't work right off the bat with your implant and with any contraception it sometimes takes a while for your body to regulate its own cycles although you maybe bang on date wise you may not even be ovulating i know it sounds weird but its possible does your partner smoke or eat badly that can sometimes affect motility of his little guys get him to stop those things and focus on being healthy if he's not are you underweight by chance sometimes that can also cause some difficulty they say after one year you should be pregnant but if you're really concerned i'd go see your doctor just to reassure you they will usually tell you to go away until then but if you are insistent they might check you both out in advance bottom line i believe babies pick their parents so your baby just isn't ready yet good luck and try focusing on a hobby or just spending time with your partner or husband instead of making it just about conception make sure you're on a prental or at least taking folic acid daily stay away from coffee and all that other stuff and you'll be on your way Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Friends Birth control Folic acid Oral contraceptive Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abortion debate Infertility EastEnders Alcoholics Anonymous Social rule Urinary incontinence Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ovulation Infantilism Breastfeeding Theory of conduct Emergency contraception Human cloning Prostate cancer Kodocha Humphrey Bogart Extreme Programming Charmed Spina bifida Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Fertilisation Sexual abstinence The Death Gate Cycle Series finale Stomach cancer Phoebe Halliwell Guinea pig Traumatic incident reduction Bipolar disorder Miscarriage Neighbours The Smoking Room Vampire Aerial (dance move) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hey Jude AFI 100 Years series Condom Stem cell Obesity Teenage pregnancy Abortion Shaggy dog story Sex and the City Hearing impairment Sharon Tate Blood (computer game) Maya calendar Time Out of Mind Singlish History of sex Divorce StarCraft: Uprising Jam (TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Kim Possible 2004 Republican National Convention Niddah David Hume Days of our Lives Stuttering The Catcher in the Rye "Weird Al" Yankovic Survivor (novel) One Tree Hill (TV series) Little Britain Prolactinoma Scientology beliefs and practices The Dalek Invasion of Earth 2000 Australian Grand Prix Jon Secada Multiple birth Marriage K' Transactional analysis Characters of The Sandman The Amazing Race Magical thinking Healthy eating Characters in the Smurfs Futurama (TV series - season 3) Malaria Milton H.
