my husband's nervous about having kids i'm ready what should i do he wants kids he just really nervous about it if he wants kids and it's just a case of him being nervous don't worry about it most men have a lot less experience with babies and small children than women do even in this day and age teenage girls not boys are sought after to babysit little girls not boys are the target audience for babydolls it's natural to be nervous of something you know little about especially something so fragile and so dependant on you as a baby is my husband was terrified of the idea of even holding my oldest son until he went to the nursery to bring him to our room i actually had to give him a peptalk to go down there and get him and i remember the conversation ended with if you don't think you can carry him just bring the crib down or ask a nurse to carry the baby then i had to literally ask him to give me the baby because he came in the room holding my son with the nurse tagging along behind crib in tow and sat down in the chair across the room just to marvel at the newborn and i think to marvel at the fact that he was indeed able to carry him without freaking out educate your husband some either with a book a parenting class for the two of you to take or by encouraging a man he respects to form a kind of mentor relationship with him i would suggest all three that way he can learn about the terms and the theories of child rearing he can have practical training in parenting duties like bathing and diaper changing and knowing what to expect of the baby and he has someone other than you he can go to for questions plus another man can tell him the things we women take for granted like that the newborn's head has a soft spot that will pulsate my husband actually informed my brothers in law of this it freaked him out because he didn't know it would happen or that even newborn boys get erections a phenomonon that can be fascinating and repulsive to a man at the same time if you think about it being nervous is a good thing the nervous dads to be are the ones who do everything they can to protect their wife or partner in pregnancy and childbirth and who put forth the most effort to be ready for the baby after he or she is born talk to him let him know it's okay to be nervous he'll have nine months to get ready make sure that it's just nervous not actual doubts about being ready to have a baby if he still feels like he's ready to have a baby but is just nervous about everything be encouraging and supportive in many ways he's even newer at this than you are Childbirth Breastfeeding Infantilism Abortion debate EastEnders Pregnancy Shaggy dog story Urinary incontinence Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milton H.
