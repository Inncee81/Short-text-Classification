do i have say with my child daughter i just got married to my husband after living together for almost a year he has a yr old she lives states away with her mother most the time but we see her at least every month for a week or more during the summers it is a lot more than that i am mths pregnant so she has been coming up to us for weeks at a time her dad feels guilty about not being able to spend as much time with her as he should and i know that but when she comes it completely disrupts our lives because of that she has no bedtime she eats anything that she wants to and pretty much does what she wants too i want her up with us more but i can t help but dreading her stays one of my biggest problems is that my husband falls asleep with her watching tv on the couch every night i complain about it and he just says that he is trying to spend time with his daughter i just want a normal family routine when she is here so that i don t feel like it completely disrupts everything but am i oversteping here first i think you need to have another talk with your husband i'd be concerned since you have a child on the way and it doesn't appear he understands that children need limits order and rules he may say he feels guilty because he doesn't see his daughter enough but that doesn't justify letting her do what she wants you're not going to want your own daughter to model his daughter's behavior so this needs to be addressed sooner rather than later i think you do have a say since it's your house and you should be able to set some rules but i understand the sensitivity as she has her own mother and you don't want to become the evil stepmother think you really need to have your husband do this but if he won't i don't see that you have a choice sorry you're in such a difficult situation good luck EastEnders Theory of conduct The Catcher in the Rye Social rule Fathers' rights Friends About a Boy Hollyoaks Maison Ikkoku Abortion debate Phoebe Halliwell Sharon Tate Garfield Alignment (role-playing games) Kurt Cobain Days of our Lives Fathers' rights movement in the UK Pitaten Knots Landing The Ashlee Simpson Show Poker jargon Marilyn Monroe Jam (TV series) One Life to Live Stuttering Ben Johnson (athlete) Narcissism 2005 trial of Michael Jackson The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Kodocha Incarnations of Immortality Madonna (entertainer) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theodicy Big Brother (USA TV series) My Life as a Teenage Robot Characters in the Smurfs Narcolepsy Abortion in the United States Laura Schlessinger Angelina Jolie Domestic violence Henry Fonda Traumatic incident reduction Transactional analysis The Fairly OddParents W.I.T.C.H.
