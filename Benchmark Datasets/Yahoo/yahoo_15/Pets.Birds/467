anyone here had some experice with african greys and could lend me some tips thanks for reading this first of all congratulations on adopting an adult african grey your new companion is one of life's most mysterious birds in fact your companion species has replaced the monkey as next in line to the human in cognitive thinking see the link below about mit dr pepperberg's alex foundation you will need special thinking as well to allow your companion to settle in to his new surroundings since you have just got him this is a good thing no bad habits we need to get back to the basics of support here and i'll start out with the why's he will act like this sitting in one place and not move around much and watch you as he checks out his new location all african greys are naturally apprehensive they do not adapt well to change their fight or flight instinct is very high relax this will take time to adjust next let's look at a few standard issues involved with greys in particular first and foremost is their caging remember their cage should be large enough to strech out their wings in both directions next if you have done this already take out of his cage all of his toys greys need time to adjust to everything and that includes new toys slowly introduce new toys into the same room first put it close by his cage and then move closer to his cage day by day then on top of his cage not attached and then if there is no problem then put in the cage remember slow is the key here do this one step at a time untill you have enough toys to keep your grey active he has a very highly active mind it is important to keep him involved and excersized both mind and body next let's talk about cage location he should be near a window with plenty of direct sunlight they get vitimin d from this and it's manditory for his health it also stimulates his mind to be able to look out and set his natural clock according to the seasons and weather there should be a small spot in the cage when positioned correctly that he can move to in order to get out of the direct sun cage position is very important do not place next to your tv set stereo electronics etc do not place near the front door to your house i don't have any suggestions one way or the other about wing clipping except make sure it is done right the next link is about proper wing clipping and tells you the difference i have some who are clipped and many who are not it all depends on the bird diet is important also your cage should have three bowls and a water bottle first bowl should be a good african grey pellet diet many available such as pretty bird species specific african grey second bowl should contain a little amount of seed large parrot mix you can get at walmart they like to occupy their time cracking seeds peanuts etc and it is a must but don't overdue the amount per day you give him of this cup change out daily the third bowl should be water and placed above this bowl the water bottle you don't know if he is a bottle trained bird so have both available untill he adjusts to the bottle when he does replace this water bowl with fresh food see second link below for diet especially the fresh food i do not reccomend to any cage bird that we use water bowls they are a sourse of disease and bacteria as soon as we get our birds off water bowls the better a water bottle is better because you can keep it clean longer and provides a contious supply of fresh water lastly i wish i could tell you about how much time your african grey will take to adjust but i can't they are highly social birds so it will happen but just not right away there is no replacement or a majic bullet to turn your grey around it just takes patience love all the things alan pointed out above but when your adjustment period is over there is nothing like the love and companionship of a grey the fourth link is from a book by a very good author who has raised many greys she talks at length about their unique
