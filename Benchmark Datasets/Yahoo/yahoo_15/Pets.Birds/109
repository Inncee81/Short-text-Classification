bird nest in my water softener i have a water softener outside i notice there is a bird nest with baby eggs inside i need to know is it safe to move where can i place it i did not see the mother bird this nest has to remove a s a p my water softener is not working thank you well by removing it you will be breaking the law all native birds are protected byt the migratory bird treaty act is the softner not working because of the nest can you wait it out until the baby birds leave the nest if you move it the mother will not be able to find it also you obviously need to make it so that a bird cannot get into it in the future so you do not continually have birds building nests there you will have to block it off somehow Platypus Seabird Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 Kakapo Bird migration Hamster Peregrine Falcon House Sparrow Egg (food) Bird Nile crocodile Intact dilation and extraction American Alligator Egg (biology) Canada Goose Chicken Surtsey Mono Lake Capercaillie Country parks and conservation in Hong Kong Great Salt Lake Gal__pagos Islands California Water Wars Peter Pan Hummingbird Australian Magpie Albatross American Robin Comanche Piccolo Junior Saga House Martin Leatherback Sea Turtle Dinosaur Eurasian Oystercatcher Life in the Freezer Ocean's Twelve Cliff Swallow Rhea (bird) Jamaica Bay Osprey CPU cache Storm-petrel Kosher foods Compiler optimization ROOK Paper wasp Fauna of Australia Water Rail Kiwi Hedgehog Mute Swan Hard water Places in Bionicle Nest box Wilson's Phalarope Digger wasp Winter Wren Hunting Kea Red Squirrel Cormorant Great Blue Heron European Kingfisher Spotted Flycatcher Bird bath Philippine Eagle Cock (chicken) Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Rock Dove The Curse of Fenric Daedalus Naval mine Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Pied Avocet Red Phalarope Turkey Vulture Northern Mockingbird Big Bird H5N1 California Gull Red-necked Phalarope Piping Plover Taikyoku shogi Bird ringing Green Heron Earwax Swiftlet Blue Tit Piratic Flycatcher Island restoration Minor characters in Tintin 613 mitzvot Farne Islands Phoenix Ovum Bird flight Warm-blooded Icarus (mythology) Bird strike Acorn
