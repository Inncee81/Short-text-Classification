about our yr old cockatiel charlie was a sweetheart until a few months ago when he started to attack us we have no idea what happened maybe he was frightened we have had work being done on the house so the noises have really stressed him we restricted him to his cage since he started chewing on the window screens and my husband won't let me clip his wings he says it's cruel and no argument will change his mind now he sets in the cage miserable and plucking feathers and is nearly naked any suggestions will be appreciated i really love him even though he has bonded with my husband instead will his feathers grow back he has pulled them out under his wings breast stomach and legs it's so pitiful as he is a beautiful bird a few months ago was cockatiel mating season at that time many cockatiels go hormonal and become very terriroial and aggressive they can and sometimes do attack the hormones are raging for to weeks after which the bird reverts back to its old habits so basically the bird went through a temporary breakdown and now finds himself in solitary confinement his tiny brain does not understand why he is lonely and unhappy so he has begun plucking his feathers just like stressed people will sometimes bite their nails even to the quick ther bird is feeling confused and betrayed you must regain his trust this can be done but it will take a lot of time and patience expect to be nipped a few times but do not punish the bird other than a stern no bite and leaving him alone begin by spending lots of time with him even if he is in his cage talk to him in a soothing voice praise him sing to him read to him anything to interact with the bird this needs to be for at least to hours per day when he shows signs of being calmer try giving him special treats through the bars sunflower seeds room temperature cooked pasta crackers fruits and veggies or whatever he likes best make sure that he only gets the treats if he takes them from your hand nicely don't drop treats into the cage or the food bowl he needs to know that treats come from you and your husband alone he must socialize to get his treats after he has shown that he will readily take treats from you try opening the cage and offerring the treat at the door of the cage let the bird come to you he will soon learn to come to you for his treat next after giving him a treat try gently stroking his chest and tummy if he withdraws or gets aggressive just close up the cage and leave him alone for a few hours eventually he will become more tolerant to your touch as the last step when he is comfortable with your touch then try offerring your finger for him to step up on while you say step up he should get the idea fairly quickly at this stage he has demonstrated that he trusts you fully next year watch for the mating season usually in the spring if the bird shows signs of aggression then put him in his cage but be sure to spend time with him talking to him each day even if he is acting aggressive you should eventually become adept at recognising the bad times and dealing with them Breastfeeding Hamster RuneScape quests Milton H.
