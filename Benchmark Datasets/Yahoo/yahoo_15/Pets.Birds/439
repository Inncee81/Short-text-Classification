what causes a cardinal to loose all his head feathers i have one that comes to the bird feeder and he does not look well i thought he might be molting but it is only his head feathers missing well you have pretty much heard all the most plausible answers i have a male cockatiel that gets his head plucked by his mate sometimes birds do this when they are unhappy with their mate sure glad my wife is not a bird it could have mites this is not a deadly disease but causes a bird a lot of discomfort i don't know of anything you can do for a wild bird with mites since it usually requires a trip to the vet molting would not cause a bird to lose the feathers on his head because he could not pull them out with his beak molting may make a bird look sort of patchy an ratty but it does not make a bird lose all the feathers from any area pin feathers the quills that have been mentioned will itch very badly but they do not just fall out if the bird can reach them he will usually pull them out other birds will sometimes groom their friends to remove these but the pin feathers never comprise all the feathers on any given area this problem with the cardinal does not sound serious most likely a dissatisfied mate but regardless you are unable to do anything about it it is illegal to catch wild birds even to help them or save their life if you are seriously worried then call your state department of natural resources fish and game and report the problem they have wild bird rehabilitaters who are trained to help wild birds Bird Moult Tick Peafowl Seabird Canary Domesticated turkey RuneScape quests Feather New York Giants Ferret Chicken Spider Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Guinea pig Poker jargon Kakapo Dog Shaggy dog story Krill Diseases of the honeybee Falconry Trapping Piccolo Junior Saga Cockatiel Fox hunting Northern Cardinal Bird flight Albatross Dinosaur Archaeopteryx Nerpa Elephant Sexual dimorphism Penguin Babe Ruth Chess terminology Tyrannosaurus rex Light pollution Emu Hamster Ostrich Tarantula American lobster Biological pest control Fancy rat St. Louis Cardinals Ruy Lopez Sin City Depilation Mercury 4 Professional wrestling holds Garfield Condor Heartworm Antarctic krill Gypsy moth Mosquito The Muppets Ivory-billed Woodpecker Big Bird Chess (musical) Theory of conduct Kitzmiller v.
