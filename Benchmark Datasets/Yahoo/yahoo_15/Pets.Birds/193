do parrots which speak really mean what they say or they're just conditioned and repeat things for instance if a parrot says''you look sad today'' does he really mean it not sure about everything they say but african grey's are known to have what is called appropriate language for example i walk into my birds room and she's shred newspaper all around the cage she looks at me and says what a mess or i'll be typing away on my computer and she'll say whatch doin i'll answer oh just typing and she'll say whatcha typin is it coincidence i don't know for sure but i don't think so she also will ask for a specific toy none other will do if you try to offer her something else she'll shake her head no over and over until you give her the one she wants African Grey Parrot Parrot Mealy Parrot John Cage Shawn Michaels Shaggy dog story The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Dead Parrot Perl Meaning of life Color Irene Pepperberg Philosophy of language Python programming language Euphemism Little Britain Written Cantonese Fallout (computer game) Live 8 Senegal Parrot Aphasia Inheritance (computer science) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Autism Invader Zim Objective-C Ontology (computer science) Customs and etiquette of Japan BASIC programming language Common Lisp Stuttering Muslim ibn Aqeel Perl 6 Dexter's Laboratory XML The Sims Cantonese (linguistics) Cryptic crossword Variable Hearing impairment Polymorphism (computer science) Asperger syndrome Shit Crossword Bluetooth Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Computer Conure RuneScape Random Events Quebec French Magic (illusion) Abstraction (computer science) Calvin and Hobbes German grammar Scientology beliefs and practices Dog training Alex (parrot) Taxi Driver African American Vernacular English Friends Function (mathematics) Mixed martial arts Budgerigar English grammar Logo programming language Hey Jude Object (computer science) Chinglish Public domain Species RuneScape quests Compiler optimization Consciousness Religious Society of Friends Database Scheme programming language The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Newspaper Douglas Adams Pointer John Searle Sudoku Kaliyan Vivian Stanshall The Emancipation of Mimi Datatype Contract American and British English differences Pasadena, California Mel Blanc Benchmark (computing) Polish language Gender-neutral language Virtual machine Exact solutions in general relativity Aqua Teen Hunger Force Whose Line Is It Anyway?
