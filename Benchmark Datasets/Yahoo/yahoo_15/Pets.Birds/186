i have budgies i was wondering if cockateil can be in the same cage or will they fight are they gonna fight or not it depends many people are able to keep budgies and teils together as they tend to get along well but you'll need a large cage to comfortably accommodate their varying activity levels follow the typical procedures of introducing a new bird to a cage inhabited by a senior occupant by letting them stay in separate cages besides one another for a few nights if they seem content with each other try housing them together if it works out great if not separate them if the pair goes sour at worst they might nip at each other but they should seriously harm one another so see how it goes they will probably be somewhat aggressive in the beginning when establishing dominance personally keeping them separate seems easier to me and that's what i would do unless you had a very large cage and outgoing birds Domestic rabbit Hamster Mixed martial arts Canary Electrophysiology John Cage Badminton Breastfeeding Aikido Magic (illusion) Guinea pig Trapping Champagne (beverage) Stereoscopy Infantilism Starfleet ranks and insignia Ferret House Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Acid Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an School bus Kart racing Poker jargon Seabird Roller skating Social rule Bicycle frame Illegal drug trade Cat Prisoner's dilemma Quizbowl Combine (Half-Life 2) Sleep Fancy rat Alignment (role-playing games) Welding Chicken Tweety Bird Airport Computer Yacht Parliamentary system Coconut crab Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Big Brother (USA TV series) Nip/Tuck Divorce Schizophrenia Policy Debate Microphone Consensual crime Dairy Bird Bicycle The Sims Equine conformation Bird migration Porsche 911 RISC The Birds (film) Milton H.
