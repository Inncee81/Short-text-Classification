how do i cut my budgies nails ive had him for weeks and his nails are long how do i cut them i would suggest buying a budgie book that will show you illustrations on how to cut your birds nails basically you just want to trim off a bit of the hook on the nail making sure you don't cut the quick or the blood vessel in the nail i use regular nail clippers because i find i have alot more control with them i also have someone else hold the bird they squirm alot and you don't want to cut their toes you can use styptic powder or corn starch to stop bleeding in case you do cut too far it would be a great idea to have a vet or an experienced bird owner show you how it is done from the books that i have read you do not want to use those sandpaper perches these can cause their feet to become raw and they don't work anyhow before i knew any better i had tried them good luck Nail (anatomy) Callus Woodworking Budgerigar Horseshoe Los Angeles Clippers Equine conformation Shaving Pottery Milton H.
