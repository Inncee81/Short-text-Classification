is it normal for cockatiels to i just got a cockatiel from a nearby petstore and brought it home two days ago it's six months old and i don't think it's every really been in a cage i think it's scared of me because it always shakes as if it's frightened i've gotten it to eat food but it wont drink any water also it wont move from the spot i put it in i put it on it's food perch and it doesnt move unless i move it is this normal for a new bird how can i make it feel more comfortable and also what temperature should the bird be in you should never do anything with a bird other than feed it and water it for at least the first hours after the bird comes to your house playing with them before then causes them so much stress that they go hypoglycemic and can actually die if the bird is not drinking you need to take it to the vet asap because birds can't go very long without water a way to tell if the bird is drinking is to put some red food coloring in the water check her the next day and if the feathers under her beak are red she's drinking but if they're not then there's a problem usually scared birds wont let you touch them so if this one is scared and letting you near it there is most likely a problem probably due to stress if the bird is drinking wait a few days without touching it or doing anything other than feeding and watering it if the bird isn't any better get some anti stress medication homeo pet d stress anxiety is the best in my opinion and see if there's a change the best temperature for a bird is degrees but some are okay at or so just see what temp your bird likes you can get a heating pad and if the bird is over with it all the time then she's cold if you have any other questions feel free to let me know Chicken Hypoglycemia Fancy rat Dog Capercaillie Cockatiel Bird Thermoregulation Mealy Parrot Kakapo Hamster Guinea pig Sorghum Anxiety Falconry Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hyperthermia RuneScape quests Urinary incontinence Stuttering Discus (fish) Seabird Housebreaking Temperature Cat Vitamin C Upholstery Alcoholism Carbon dioxide Chocolate Combat stress reaction Fecal incontinence Friends Domestic rabbit Hyperglycemia Canary Parrot Breastfeeding Atomic Kitten Poker jargon Hansel und Gretel Salad Fingers Stomach cancer Milton H.
