can a baby parakeet share a cage w finches hi can a mo baby parakeet share a cage with finches cordon bleus and star finches the finches live in a large cage x x i just bought a white parakeet the store only had one and i fell in love w it now i feel a bit bad that its by itself in its own cage i know a bird needs to be in its own cage for a couple weeeks before putting it in w other birds i will probably go out and buy another solid parakeet once i find one but in the mean time until i do i am curious to know if finches and parakeets can share a cage no not at all not even for a minute for starters your parakeet will probably attack your finches second they eat different foods and need different size perches third your parakeet doesn't 'need' a friend of any sort birds are perfectly content living alone if you actually spend time with them like you should either way don't mix the birds if you insist on getting another parakeet so be it but keep the species together Hamster Darwin's finches Parrot Monk Parakeet Conure John Cage Plum-headed Parakeet Bird Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Mealy Parrot Rose-ringed Parakeet Breath of Fire III Newton's Parakeet Finch Carolina Parakeet Canary Emberizidae The Birds (film) Trapping Monkey Alexandrine Parakeet Budgerigar Passerine The Beatles discography Cuttlefish Inception of Darwin's theory Chaffinch Pok__mon Live!
